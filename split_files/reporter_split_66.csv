Project Summary/Abstract
Nanomedicine based on ultra-small nanoparticles (usNPs), such as dendrimers, gold NPs, quantum dots, and
protein-based carriers (e.g., albumin), are at the forefront of clinical translation for targeting cancer and inflammatory
disorders. Myeloid cells such as inflammatory monocytes (ФIMs) can traffic to the inflamed tissue and mediate the
targeting of NPs to inflammation. However, the lack of mechanistic understanding of NP interaction with ФIMs
and ФIM-mediated NP targeting to inflammation has significantly limited the rational design of tissue- or cell-
specific delivery systems. A critical obstacle is that when NPs are injected into the blood, multiple serum proteins
adsorb to the NP surface, forming a ‘NP proteome’. The NP proteome masks NP interaction with the cell surface
and alters the NP cellular tropism. It is now recognized that it is the NP proteome rather than the NP physiochemical
properties that dictate the NP cell tropism and more broadly their in vivo targeting behaviors. Toward this end, the
overarching goal of my research program is to understand usNP–myeloid cell interactions and myeloid cell-
mediated NP targeting to inflammation from the perspective of ‘NP proteome’ and to leverage myeloid cell
recruitment to design inflammation-targeting nanotherapeutics. My research team has made significant strides in
using animal models to characterize the trafficking of ФIMs to inflamed tissue and how ФIMs trafficking dynamics
affect the deposition of usNPs. We also showed NP proteome is a critical mediator of usNP–ФIM interactions. Over
the next five years, my research team will address key knowledge gaps that limit the rational design of inflammation-
targeting nanotherapeutics. Specifically, for usNPs that carry drug payload on their surfaces, we will i) determine the
fundamental mechanisms that govern usNP–ФIM interactions: we will establish a structure-property relation
between the molecular properties of surface payload and NP proteome, and understand how NP proteomes are
‘read’ by ФIMs; ii) determine how myeloid cell recruitment mediates the targeting to inflammation for NPs carrying
different payloads. The anticipated results will transform the current understanding of NP-myeloid cell interactions
and have broad implications for nanotherapeutic targeting behaviors in vivo (e.g., tropism towards myeloid cells,
biodistribution, targeting to inflammation), clearance, and toxicity (e.g., complement activation). iii) guided by this
knowledge, we will develop a translatable nanotherapeutic that selectively delivers an immune modulator to target
ФIMs and remove immunosuppression. As ever more nanotherapeutics are being tested in the clinics for various
diseases and through diverse delivery routes (e.g., inhalation, intratumoral delivery), we envision this research
program will set up the foundation for future studies to understand how NP proteome formed in the serum samples
of various disease conditions and biological fluids (e.g., pleural fluid, tumor interstitial fluid) can determine the in vivo
targeting behaviors of nanotherapeutics."
10940217,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating malignancy with dismal outcomes for patients, particularly in the
elderly where most cases occur. The recent approval of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven) in combination with
a hypomethylating agent (HMA; such as azacytidine/Aza) for the treatment of AML in elderly/unfit adults has
substantially improved outcomes for these patients. Still, about a third of patients treated with Ven/HMA exhibit
poor responses to therapy, and most patients who do respond will eventually relapse with Ven/HMA resistant
disease. Moreover, patients whose AML contains mutations in the TP53 gene are refractory to Ven/HMA and all
other forms of chemotherapy. The central premise of this project is that intra-patient heterogeneity of the
leukemia initiating cell (LIC) population is a key driver of therapy resistance/failure. At least two distinct forms of
LSCs can be found in AML patients, one with a more primitive phenotype (p-LIC) and one with a monocytic
phenotype (m-LIC). While Ven-based therapies are an effective means to eradicate the p-LSCs in newly
diagnosed AML patients, m-LIC are resistant to Ven/Aza and can mediate relapse. The goal of this work is to
identify and characterize distinct LIC subtypes and their vulnerabilities to design more effective and more durable
therapies. We have further shown that m-LIC exhibit upregulation of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAP) and
that IAP inhibition using drugs called SMAC mimetics (SMACm) potently sensitizes AML cells to Ven/Aza-
induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, particularly for the monocytic subpopulation highly resistant to Ven/Aza
alone. Intriguingly, SMACm therapy is also highly effective at eradicating TP53 mutant/deleted AML cells, which
are generally refractory to currently available therapies. Thus, varying subtypes of AML LIC are vulnerable to
targeting by distinct strategies. Mechanistically, we show that SMACm in combination with Ven/Aza induces
noncanonical NF-B signaling and high levels of TNF, which causes cell death by apoptosis. Here, we propose
to characterize the molecular phenotypes and therapeutic vulnerabilities of different LIC subpopulations in order
to design more effective therapies. In the first aim, we will characterize the pathways and molecular mechanisms
that mediate differential vulnerabilities of resistant LIC subtypes, with a focus on monocytic and TP53 mutant
subtypes. The second aim will leverage in vitro and in vivo models to gain a thorough understanding of the clonal
heterogeneity of different primary AML specimens, the phenotypes of the various subclones, and how distinct
LIC subclones differentially respond to Ven/Aza and SMACm therapy. Finally, in Aim 3, a clinical trial will assess
the safety and efficacy of combining a SMACm drug, tolinapant, with Ven/Aza in the relapsed/refractory AML
setting. Samples from this trial will be used to determine whether and how tolinapant sensitizes LICs to Ven/Aza
therapy, thereby inducing deeper remissions. In all, these studies should lead to the development of therapeutic
strategies that limit or control the development of drug resistance."

Almost every cell in a human being has the same DNA sequence yet different cells vary widely in which genes
are expressed. In addition to the genetic code, human cells contain chemical modifications on DNA called
epigenetics that can dictate cell type identity and cell fate. The most abundant epigenetic modification in the
human genome is DNA methylation, which is critical for silencing transposable elements, genomic imprinting,
and X chromosome inactivation. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns is a hallmark of aging and cancer cells,
however the genetic pathways that contribute to DNA methylation remains unclear.
My research laboratory aims to unlock how DNA methylation is established in the human genome and to
understand how defects in DNA methylation pathways leads to disease. Using genome-wide genetic screens,
my lab has recently discovered genes that previously have not been implicated in DNA methylation, including
an RNA binding protein and the proteasomal complex that degrades proteins. In the next five years, we will
dissect the roles of our newly discovered genetic factors of DNA methylation and how they regulate gene
expression programs in cancer and embryonic stem cells using multidisciplinary approaches including
biochemistry, genetics, and advances in DNA sequencing technologies.
In addition to our goals to understand DNA methylation pathways, my laboratory is a leader in pioneering new
CRISPR methods to write and erase DNA methylation at any site in the genome. We use lessons learned from
our basic biology findings to engineer tools that allow us to turn off/on human genes solely by changing the
epigenetics of a gene instead of inducing harmful DNA breaks. In the next five years, we will innovate next
generation CRISPR epigenetic editing technologies that enables fine tuning of transcription at defined levels. To
overcome the current challenge of delivering CRISPR technologies into primary human cells, we will establish
the first protein-based delivery of CRISPR epigenetic editing technologies into primary immune cells for use in
cancer immunotherapy applications. Our CRISPR epigenetic editing technologies and delivery platforms will
have broad use in the biomedical sciences and as safe and robust tools for cell and gene therapy clinical
applications purely by modifying epigenetics instead of genome editing."

 A fundamental gap exists in our ability to screen for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that
has resulted in widespread delayed diagnosis and underdiagnosis. COPD is now the third leading cause of
death in the world, but how best to identify individuals remains a significant challenge, as symptoms alone are
not sensitive enough to identify those at greatest risk. Hence, there is a critical need to find a better way to
identify high risk individuals who require targeted pulmonary function testing. Providing a potential solution,
lung cancer screening has now been widely adopted and is recommended by the US Preventive Task Force
and paid for by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for individuals aged 50 to 80 years who have a
20 pack-year smoking history. Given the wealth of information that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for
lung cancer screening provides, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to leverage what is now
routinely collected data to improve the overall health of this patient population. Estimates suggest that roughly
35% of those undergoing lung cancer screening CT scans have undiagnosed COPD. Our group has already
reported on a subset of individuals from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) that quantitative
analysis of emphysema from LDCT can be used to help detect individuals with COPD. However, despite
recognition of the problem, this solution has yet to be widely implemented. Radiologists remain unclear on
what to tell primary care physicians; primary care physicians are also unclear on what to do with information
they are provided, even when radiologists do mention the presence of emphysema in an LDCT report. Our
overall objective with this proposal is to develop a tool based on data collected as part of lung cancer
screening to enable clinicians to identify risk for COPD. Our central hypothesis is that a quantitative, imaging-
based COPD risk tool can help identify undiagnosed patients with COPD. We will test our hypothesis through
the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will a) use quantitative imaging analysis to characterize the range of
COPD-related pathology from LDCT scans from NLST and b) formulate an advanced multivariable model
integrating diverse quantitative imaging attributes to determine the probability of COPD. In Aim 2, we will build
a user-informed communication tool designed for clinicians but understandable by patients to facilitate
screening for COPD by determining a) primary care provider beliefs, attitudes and approaches to the
interpretation of LDCT findings; and b) patient understanding regarding risk for COPD and interpretation of
lung cancer screening scans. Upon completion, the risk tool developed is expected to have an important
positive impact by paving the way for future interventional studies with the tool that could be implemented at a
health system level to reduce the burden of undiagnosed COPD."

Formation and plasticity of synapses are essential for normal functioning of the brain and
key events for learning and adaptive plasticity. Diseases such as addiction, epilepsy,
and Alzheimer’s that involve maladaptive plasticity appear to highjack these same
mechanisms controlling these events leading to disease states. The area of addition is
particular pressing given the devastating impact the disease has on society and the clear
like between addictive behaviors and the formation of new synapses and/or maladaptive
plastic changes in the brain. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate
normal develop and plasticity in the brain are likely to be critical for any advances in
treatment of these diseases.
The majority of synaptic contacts that form are made on dendritic spines, which are also
a key site of synaptic plasticity. Dendritic spines contain specialized structures called
postsynaptic densities (PSDs) that are directly apposed to pre-synaptic neurotransmitter
release sites and which scale in size with changes in synaptic strength. Despite having
understood this relationship for many years, the molecular dynamics of the translocation
and accumulation of PSD proteins and presynaptic proteins following structural plasticity
remain poorly understood. Our preliminary data indicate that pre- and postsynaptic
proteins for scale in a modular fashion with dendritic spine size. We will determine the
synaptic molecular architecture and address how the molecular architecture of the spine
synapse responds to structural plasticity in three aims: 1) Determine the
nanoarchitecture of glutamate receptors at spine synapses. 2) Determine the
nanoscale organization of synchronous and asynchronous synaptic release sites.
3) Determine how PSD-95 nanomodule number and plasticity are regulated.
Collectively these studies will advance our understand of basic mechanisms that impact
the ability of the nervous system to grow and change, events that are likely central to
disease of maladaptive plasticity such as addiction and Alzheimer’s."

Many cross-national studies based on the HRS family of studies have yielded new insights about aging
behaviors and health disparities around the world. This project will continue to support the development of new
international studies with harmonized HRS around the world (ATW) data. The project will also maintain
harmonization and data development among existing comparable HRS studies and foster a cross-country
research agenda. There are a number of aims consistent with that objective. First, we will organize in-person
and virtual harmonization meetings that will bring together the principal investigators and study teams of all
HRS-family surveys and relevant content experts in the field. The purpose of these meetings will be to improve
harmonization among the existing HRS surveys; to support the development of new HRS-like surveys; and to
develop a strategy for further innovations to the HRS family of surveys. Second, we will support small-scale
pilots and organize research conferences that will bring new innovations in survey contents or methodology
into the HRS network of studies, and be open to researchers outside of the network. Third, we will foster the
development of the new studies in the HRS network so that they can launch their studies successfully and with
good comparability to the more mature existing HRS ATW studies. Finally, we will support a within group sub-
network involving Brazil, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) to conduct joint studies and seek financing
from their countries to conduct joint research and enhance study content. We intend to share reports
summarizing key discussions at the harmonization meetings, the results of small-scale pilots, and journal
articles and other research products deriving from the Network’s activities through the HRS ATW website. We
will promote these contents through our Network members, population-center networks, and professional
associations, using multiple platforms."
10928262,"The goal of this research program is to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA-binding protein
(RBP) regulation of the decisive stage of gene expression, translation. To maintain homeostasis, signaling
pathways direct the cell’s translational output by relaying information about its environment through RBPs;
RBPs ultimately repress or stimulate the translation of associated mRNAs depending on whether the cell
needs the protein product it encodes. At the molecular level, signals are transduced by RBP conformational
changes, ranging from subtle to large-scale. Such changes alter RBP surface chemistry and shape, in turn
strengthening or weakening their interactions with RNA and other proteins. These shifting molecular
interactions shunt RNAs down the appropriate pathway: translation, storage, or decay. Some RBPs can guide
target RNAs to opposing endpoints, thereby acting as molecular switches. Surprisingly, the principles guiding
such fundamental decisions by the cell are surprisingly understudied.
The specific and nonspecific interactions that RBPs have with their target RNAs are tunable on several levels.
First, most RBPs have multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs), the relative orientations of which are maintained
by linker regions and can change based on RNA and protein binding partners. Second, most RBPs receive
input from signaling pathways that describe the cellular environment and, in response, actuate gene
expression changes; different pathways culminate in different post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can
lead to divergent translational outcomes via the same RBP. Third, RNAs receive co- and post-transcriptional
modifications that signal various messages to their RBP partners; these marks can thereby induce RBP
conformational change, altering interactors and translational outcome. The interplay among these signaling
inputs and translational output is not well understood. We propose to use the RBP La-related protein 1
(LARP1) as a model system for understanding how cells integrate information from multi-RBD RBPs, PTMs,
and post-transcriptional mRNA modifications to direct the translation of specific transcripts.
We will use biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology to address these fundamental questions of
translation regulation. We will examine how the three LARP1 RBDs—two separated by 400 amino acids in
primary structure—communicate their binding statuses through space to regulate the translation of associated
transcripts. We will also investigate how post-translational modifications affect the RNA- and protein-binding
activities of LARP1 to manage the translation of distinct classes of mRNAs. Since LARP1 recognizes co- and
post-transcriptional RNA modifications, we will also utilize this system to understand how RBPs respond to
information from RNA targets to adjust structure-function relationships. Our work will propel LARP1 biology
forward and also yield conceptual advances that are applicable to many, if not all, translation regulator RBPs."
10928266,"Project Summary
A critical question in the field of Epigenetics/Mammalian Gene Regulation is how a cellular identity is inherited
by progeny cells during cell division. This fundamental aspect of epigenetic regulation was recently clarified in
our lab: repressed, but not active, chromatin domains are inherited. Repressed chromatin domains in facultative
heterochromatin are maintained by the multi-subunit complex, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), that
catalyzes the histone post-translational modification, H3K27me3. PRC2 exhibits a notable “read and write”
feature whereby its recognition of H3K27me3 results in its allosteric activation. Thus, PRC2 can fully restore
repressive chromatin domains upon inheritance of H3K27me3-nucleosomes. Remarkably, our findings point to
a previously reported histone chaperone, NPM1, as facilitating this inheritance of repressed chromatin: NPM1 is
exclusively localized to chromatin in late S-phase when repressed chromatin is replicated, and interacts directly
with PRC2. Our latest findings demonstrated specific de-repression of PRC2-regulated genes upon auxin-
mediated depletion of NPM1 during S-phase of the cell cycle. We will expand our mechanistic studies of
epigenetic inheritance by investigating the role of NPM1 as an S-phase-specific histone chaperone and its
interplay with PRC2 in a series of histone chaperone assays performed in vitro with distinct candidate
oligonucleosomal templates. We will investigate the role of NPM1 in epigenetic inheritance by adapting our in
vivo assay for chromatin domain inheritance as a function of the presence of NPM1 and pertinent NPM1 mutants.
The interactive dynamics of NPM1 and PRC2 in the context of a replication fork is critical information towards
understanding the transfer of parental nucleosomes to daughter DNA strands. Thus, single-molecule localization
microscopy as well as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) are expected to bear directly on
the role of NPM1 and the significance of its interaction with the epigenetic regulator, PRC2. Importantly, mutant
NPM1c associated with ~35% of all Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is mis-localized to the cytoplasm. We
propose that NPM1c hampers normal PRC2 function. Indeed, similar to our findings above upon NPM1
depletion, known HOX gene targets of PRC2 are aberrantly expressed in NPM1c AML, participating in the
establishment of the leukemic state. Deposition of H3K27me3 by PRC2 and DNA methylation by DNMT3A result
in repressed chromatin, but are usually mutually exclusive. Yet, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations synergize in
leukemogenesis. Thus, we further propose that DNMT3A partially compensates for our proposed NPM1c-
mediated thwarting of PRC2⏤which is lost upon DNMT3A mutation. Through temporal expression of NPM1c as
a function of the presence of mutant DNMT3A, we will track the repercussions to gene expression, features of
repressed chromatin domains, PRC2 chromatin occupancy and DNA methylation in both tissue culture and a
mouse model of AML to fully grasp the sequence of aberrant epigenetic events as they occur in leukemogenesis."
10937095,"Inhibiting beta-adrenergic and COX-2 signaling during the perioperative period to reduce
 ovarian cancer progression
Abstract:
The short perioperative period, days before and after surgery, is commonly not exploited for anti-metastatic
interventions. During this short but critical period, stress and inflammatory responses are prevalent among
cancer patients. In vitro studies indicate that β-adrenergic and prostanoid signaling can accelerate ovarian tumor
cells’ growth and pro-metastatic characteristics. In several animal models, including in ovarian cancer (OC), in
vivo perioperative pharmacological blockade of β-adrenergic stress responses and/or activity of prostaglandin-
synthesis COX-2 enzyme, was shown to reduce cancer metastasis and improve long-term survival rates.
Epidemiological studies suggest survival benefits of incidental perioperative use of such pharmacological
blockade in many solid cancers, including OC. Recent perioperative small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in
breast and colorectal cancer patients (n=38 & 34) indicated beneficial effects of the β-blocker, propranolol, with
or without the COX-2 synthesis inhibitor, etodolac, on molecular biomarkers of cancer progression in excised
tumors. The drugs were well tolerated, exhibited high safety profile, and in colorectal cancer patients, preliminary
findings also suggested improved 5-year disease free survival. Herein we propose to conduct a small exploratory
two-arm placebo-controlled RCT in 60 women undergoing OC debulking surgery. Patients will be treated with
both propranolol and etodolac (or placebo), starting 5 days before surgery and up to 3 weeks following it.
Propranolol (extended release) will be initiated at a low dose (20mg, BID), increased on surgery day (80mg,
BID), and gradually decreased during the following 3 weeks back to the low dose, while etodolac will be given in
parallel at a steady moderate dose (400mg BID). Thereafter, to address the unmet need of alleviating increased
anxiety across treatment spectrum, and to attenuate stress-related β-adrenergic stimulation, propranolol (which
is also anxiolytic), or placebo, will be continued for additional 2 months at the low dose. Primary outcomes of the
study will include (i) recruitment rate, (ii) perioperative drug safety, tolerability, and adherence, and (iii) molecular
characteristics of excised tumors with respect to tumor infiltrating leukocytes and transcriptional activity related
to pro-metastatic (e.g., EMT), pro-growth (STAT and GATA families), and stress and inflammatory signaling (NF-
κB/cRel, AP-1, CREB and GR). Secondary outcomes will include 3-year recurrence rates, based on signed
agreements with the medical centers and without additional costs. If promising outcomes will be evident in this
RCT, a larger multicenter RCTs can be justified to identify additional mediating mechanisms of the intervention,
devise novel biomarkers for treatment efficacy and for OC progression, and to test whether this intervention can
improve long-term cancer outcomes and overall survival of OC patients. As the intervention is based on
repurposing of inexpensive off-patent safe and easily administered medications, it can easily be implemented
clinically in most medical centers worldwide."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts that
disrupt the renal architecture and function, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), dialysis, and renal
transplantation. Although ADPKD has a genetic origin, its progression and clinical outcome is highly variable
and dependent on agents circulating in blood. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that one of these
agents is ouabain. In primary renal epithelial cells obtained from kidneys of patients with ADPKD, ouabain
promotes the cystic phenotype by increasing cell proliferation, augmenting cAMP-dependent fluid secretion,
and inducing cell dedifferentiation; ouabain also stimulates cyst progression in embryonic renal explants and
adult kidneys of ADPKD mouse models. Ouabain exerts these effects via its cell plasma membrane receptor,
Na,K-ATPase (NKA), through the activation of signal transduction pathways in the cell. Ouabain also inhibits
the exchange of Na+ for K+ across the cell plasma membrane characteristic of NKA ion transport function,
which contributes to reduce fluid reabsorption in the renal epithelium and enhance ADPKD cyst progression.
While all NKA appears to function as an ion transporter, it is believed that the NKA residing in caveolae is
involved in ouabain-induced signal transduction. In caveolae, NKA forms a complex with other proteins in what
is known as the “NKA signalosome”; key to this receptor complex is the association of NKA with the kinase
Src, which allows NKA to function as a tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor. At present, the mechanisms by which
the NKA signalosome functions in ADPKD are unknown. Moreover, it is unclear if ouabain affects both the
signaling and ion transport functions of NKA to drive ADPKD cystogenesis. I hypothesize that elimination of
NKA signaling capacity, through caveolar depletion or disruption of NKA/Src interaction, will reduce ouabain-
induced ADPKD cyst progression. Aim 1 will determine the role of caveolae in ouabain-induced NKA
signaling and ADPKD cyst progression. The role of caveolae in ADPKD is currently unknown; I will use a
novel mouse model to determine necessity of caveolae for ouabain's effects in ADPKD cyst progression and
NKA signaling. Aim 2 will establish NKA/Src interaction as the mechanism driving ouabain effects in
ADPKD. The mechanisms involved in the activation of the NKA signalosome are currently unknown. I will
create a novel mouse model which interrupts the NKA/Src binding site and determine how the absence of this
interaction affects ADPKD cyst progression and NKA signal transduction. Completion of these aims will give a
better understanding of how ouabain accelerates ADPKD cyst growth and characterize a novel mechanism of
cyst progression which can be targeted to develop future therapeutics for the treatment of ADPKD. The training
plan outlined in this fellowship will not only develop my technical research skills, but also provide both clinical
and research mentorship, opportunities for teaching, and a carefully planned transition back to medical school."

As our population ages, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related pathologies will continue to increase in
prevalence, making the investigation of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors related to AD critical. Non-
modifiable risk factors, such as genetic risk that individuals are born with, and modifiable risk factors, such as
physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels, significantly influence brain development and
disease pathology. Utilizing a lifespan perspective to investigate the ways in which these risk factors effect
brain development during childhood, a critical period of neurodevelopment, may lead to novel insights on
mechanisms and prevention of AD in the brain. This proposal aims to study the relationships between
cognition, physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), genetics, and the development AD-vulnerable
brain networks in a cohort of periadolescents (aged 8-13 years old). Evidence suggests that PA and CRF can
enhance the brain’s functional connections in networks most vulnerable to AD pathology, including the Default
Mode Network (DMN), and the Frontoparietal Network (FPN). Investigating these networks in relation to PA
and CRF during this critical neurodevelopmental period will aid in the understanding of how modifiable risk
factors influence AD-vulnerable brain networks. While it is well known that APOE-ε4 status influences AD risk,
more recent evidence suggests PA and CRF may help mitigate risk associated with genetic profile, however
this relationship has not been investigated in developing cohorts. In order to fill the gap in this research area,
cognitive, brain imaging, and genetic data will be collected as part of larger (N = 270) cohort of periadolescents
enrolled in the parent study (R01 AG064247), in addition to PA monitoring and CRF testing completed as part
of an additional sub-study designed by the applicant. We hypothesize that greater PA and CRF will be
associated with enhanced memory and executive function ability, as well as greater within-network functional
connectivity profiles that support cognition. Interactions of these findings will also be investigated in relation to
APOE allele status, as we also hypothesize that PA and CRF levels may moderate the relationship between
cognitive development and genetic risk. The applicant, an MD/PhD student at the University of Nebraska
Medical Center, will be able to develop skills related to hypothesis generation and testing, human-subjects
research methods, data analysis, and development of scholarly products. Throughout the proposed research
and clinical training, advanced courses, clinical preceptorships, workshops, and hands-on experiences will be
completed in order to develop the scientific skills necessary to fulfill the aims and become a rigorous and well-
rounded physician scientist."
10903097,"Myocardial infarction (MI) wound healing is accomplished through scar formation initiated by an acute
inflammatory response. The post-MI inflammatory phase is marked by a dramatic recruitment of neutrophils to
the heart where they become activated. Studies within the clinic have demonstrated that increased quantities
of circulating neutrophils serve as a predictor of death and adverse prognoses. Studies have demonstrated
that elimination of this neutrophil response prior to MI delays scar formation and contributes to worsening heart
failure. These two narratives indicate that although increased quantities of neutrophils may contribute to
pathogenesis of heart failure, a certain number are required for appropriate scar formation. Either side of this
balance could contribute to worsened cardiac function. Due to their short lifespan, the body must maintain the
number of circulating neutrophils through steady-state granulopoiesis. However, in circumstances of immune
challenge (such as in MI), the enhanced demand for neutrophil production is met through a reactive process
known as emergency granulopoiesis. Whether or not neutrophils produced through emergency granulopoiesis
exhibit different character or function has not been investigated previously and presents a gap in current
understanding. Additionally, how any altered neutrophil function may contribute to the pathogenesis of heart
failure post-MI is unknown. We hypothesize that neutrophils produced via emergency granulopoiesis exhibit
altered functions which contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure. This project seeks to determine if
emergency granulopoiesis produces neutrophils with aberrant secretory function and if emergency
granulopoiesis contributes to post-MI heart failure. The objectives of the proposed research are 1) to determine
if MI-induced emergency granulopoiesis gives rise to neutrophils with differential functionality and 2) to
determine if emergency granulopoiesis delays scar formation and contributes to heart failure post-MI.
Successful completion of the proposed research will contribute to the knowledge of neutrophil function in
situations of inflammatory stress such as after MI and the role of neutrophils in post-MI scar formation.
Additionally, identification of differential functions and their role in the pathogenesis of heart failure could
present avenues of study for future identification of therapeutic targets facilitating post-MI recovery."
10903164,"Background. This proposal entitled “The impact of poly-substance use on the crosstalk between microglia,
astrocytes, and neurons that regulates HIV latency"" is submitted in response to RFA-DA-24-001: Ex Vivo
Models for Studies at the Intersection of HIV and Poly-Substance Use”. Although combination antiretroviral
therapy (ART) dramatically lowers the levels of HIV RNA in the brain, it does not reduce the prevalence of HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which still develops in up to 50% of people with HIV (PWH). Poly-
substance use in PWH increases the risk of developing HAND, creating a significant unmet medical challenge.
Our goal. Our proposed ex vivo studies of poly-substance exposure are based on newly developed methods to
derive authentic microglia, astrocytes, and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We will study the
responses of these cells to HIV and poly-substance exposure in mono-, di-, tri-cultures, and organoids. Our
previous work has shown that HIV latency is established due to signals from healthy neurons and astrocytes that
drive infected microglia into a homeostatic state. The latent virus becomes reactivated in response to
inflammatory cytokines and neuronal damage. For example, adding methamphetamine (METH) at a
physiologically relevant concentration (100 nM) to co-cultures of microglia and neurons induces HIV reactivation
and neuronal damage. Also, it sensitizes HIV-infected microglia to reactivation by inflammatory stimuli such as
TNF-α. We will test the hypothesis that poly-substance use (combinations of methamphetamine and opioids)
deregulates the cortical/dopaminergic system and disrupts the homeostatic regulation of microglia, leading to
HIV reactivation and increased neuronal damage. In addition to measuring the impact of poly-substance
exposure on HIV reactivation, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing to study the changes in cellular signaling
and activation induced by substance exposure.
How will we advance the field? To define how intracellular signaling between neurons, astrocytes, and
microglia is dysregulated by poly-substance exposure, we will first investigate how METH and opioids affect the
expression of crucial signal/receptor pairs (CD200/CD200R, CX3XL1/CX3CR1, glucocorticoid/GR, DA/DRD1-5)
in the presence or absence of HIV. In addition, since we discovered unexpectedly that adenosine is a potent
silencer of HIV in iMG cells, we will investigate how extracellular ATP produced by neurotoxicity and astrocyte
activation is metabolized to adenosine by surface receptors on microglial cells and promotes HIV silencing.
Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level will set the stage for devising effective anti-inflammatory
strategies to ameliorate HAND in the context of poly-substance use.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive muscular disease that affects
both muscle and bone. To date, effective therapies for DMD are limited. Studies have shown
that reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability resulted from secondary loss of neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS) in the absence of dystrophin is a key contributor to disease progression.
Restoring NO homeostasis via dietary nitrite and nitrate representing a novel therapeutic
approach due to its ability to be converted to NO in low oxygen and ischemic states that can
bypass nNOS. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of inorganic nitrite and explore its
mechanism of action on both skeletal muscle and bone. Our preliminary data, based on a
severe dystrophic mouse model (dKO-dystrophin/utrophin double knock out), demonstrated
disrupted NO homeostasis in dystrophic muscle and more excitingly, oral administration of
nitrite significantly improved the life span and a series of pathological changes in dystrophic
mice, both in skeletal muscle and bone tissues. The mechanisms underlying these
improvements deserve further investigation to provide important preclinical and mechanistic
information for identifying novel therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that inorganic nitrite
administration improves both muscle and bone pathologies in DMD by enhancing NO signaling
pathways in dystrophic muscle and by modulating the expression and secretion of bone-
regulating myokines. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1: To test the
hypothesis that inorganic nitrite restores nitrate/nitrite pool in dystrophic mice and improves
muscle/bone pathologies and preserves muscle function. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that
nitrite affects skeletal muscle via myoglobin-mediated NO-cGMP signaling pathway. Aim 3: To
test the hypothesis that in addition to increased mechanical loading, nitrite affects bone
homeostasis via modulating the expression and secretion of bone-regulating myokines from
dystrophic muscle. We anticipate that these findings will provide a novel, safe and low-cost
therapeutic approach benefiting both muscle and bone for the currently untreatable DMD.
Completion of these aims will advance our knowledge of novel mechanisms for the
pathogenesis of bone abnormalities in DMD through bone-regulating myokines as well; which
may uncover new potential therapeutic targets. Importantly, our findings may have profound
translational implications not only to DMD but also to other neuromuscular diseases that lack
normal NO signaling pathway function."

Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a nuclear RNA binding protein that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).
When mislocalized and/or dysregulated, aberrant phase separation of FUS leads to the formation of pathogenic
solid-like aggregates that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We have recently discovered that reduction of DDX6, an RNA
helicase known to interact with FUS, significantly diminishes cytoplasmic FUS granule formation during stress
in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Our preliminary results show that (i) DDX6 modulates FUS condensate
number and size in a concentration dependent manner in vitro i.e., DDX6 promotes FUS condensate formation
at low concentrations but limits growth above a finite level and (ii) DDX6 forms a discontinuous ring around FUS
condensates. Building on these exciting results, I aim to test the hypothesis that DDX6 regulates FUS
granules through dual roles as a granule nucleator and Pickering agent. Pickering agents are particles with
distinct properties which adsorb to the surface of condensates, promoting their liquidity and maintaining small
condensate size. Based on our results, we propose that DDX6 promotes FUS granule nucleation while its role
as a Pickering agent maintains small droplet size and liquidity, thus preventing pathogenic aggregation.
Additionally, we predict that ATP binding and RNA structure will affect the activity of DDX6 on FUS granules. We
will test these predictions in three aims. Aim 1 will utilize in vitro condensation assays to evaluate the interaction
between DDX6, FUS, RNA and ATP and to establish whether DDX6 acts as a Pickering agent. Aim 2 will utilize
biochemical and single molecule assays to characterize the molecular-level dynamics of the interaction between
FUS, DDX6, and RNA, and its dependence on ATP. Finally, aim 3 will use cell-based methods to investigate
how tuning intracellular DDX6 concentrations and disrupting ATP binding affects FUS granule formation in
wildtype and ALS-associated mutants. Together, this work will lead to a deeper understanding of RNA-protein
granule regulation which is of utmost importance to treating neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD."

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a leading cause of infection worldwide and a major driver of antibiotic
resistance. Although there have been close to thirty vaccine trials targeting the pathogen, all successful
pre-clinical vaccines taken to human trials have failed for unclear reasons. Recently, we provided
evidence that SA vaccine failures occurred because of routine and frequent human exposure to SA
compared to laboratory mice. We showed that prior exposure of mice to SA leads to the development
of anti-SA antibodies with increased Fc sialylation, incapable of supporting opsonophagocytic killing of
the pathogen. Staphylococcal vaccination of these pathogen-exposed mice recalls the non-protective
antibody response and leads to vaccine failure. Using this model, we have successfully explained the
failure of all clinical SA vaccines we have tested to date. To understand the mechanistic basis for the
vaccine failures, we now show that SA induces abundant IL10 that enhances Fc sialylation of non-
protective antibodies. IL10 also blocks anti-SA cellular immunity by antagonizing TH17 generation.
Taken together, we hypothesize that non-protective immune imprints develop as a result of IL10
induced by the pathogen, and IL10 underlies the development of non-protective responses by
subsequently administered T and B vaccines targeting SA. To test our hypothesis, 1) we propose to
investigate the molecular link between IL10 and Fc glycosylation, and the mechanism whereby Fc
glycosylation leads to aborted opsonic killing of SA. 2) We will seek to identify the bacterial source of
IL10 induction and address the mechanism of IL10+T cell expansion and IL10-mediated suppression of
TH17 development. 3) Finally, we will address the practical strategic implications of these findings on
vaccine development. Overall, our proposal aims to understand the interaction between SA, the host,
and the vaccine to provide new insights on anti-SA vaccine approaches. Our findings has the potential
to shed light on why vaccines targeting other pathogens also failed."

Community outreach and engagement (COE) has become the gold standard in addressing health disparities
and closing the health gaps in minoritized and marginalized communities. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)
encourages all NCI-designated Cancer Centers to foster and share “COE knowledge-base, best practices,
and tools” for adoption, adaptation and implementation by other NCI-designated cancer centers, the scientific
community and the public at large to advance progress against the burden of cancer and cancer risk factors.
Unfortunately, there have been limited nation-wide opportunities to facilitate mutual learning of COE
knowledge, best practices and tools by COE administrators, COE researchers, COE professionals, cancer
survivors, cancer advocates and community stakeholders. The Science of Community Outreach and
Engagement (SoCOE) conference is proposed by the Alliance of Black COE Scientific Directors who lead
COE Offices and Programs in several NCI designated Cancer Centers serving minority, rural and
marginalized communities across the United States. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a
platform for COE academic-community stakeholders to share best practices and recommendations that will
address inequities in cancer prevention, early detection, care and survivorship in Black communities. A five-
year conference funding is requested to support the SoCOE conference, with the 1st conference proposed
to be hosted by the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Virginia Commonwealth University
Massey Cancer Center from May 8 to 10, 2024, in Florida, United States. Subsequent conferences will focus
on: Addressing Racism and Discrimination in Cancer Care and Research (2025); Innovative Approaches to
Social Determinants of Health (2026); Precision Oncology/Genetics in Cancer Care (2027); and Community
Outreach and Engagement: Strategies for Global Oncology (2028). Led by outstanding health equity
researchers and COE scientific directors, the SoCOE conference will foster the development of sustainable
and culturally-responsive resources to facilitate COE in Black communities, including: (1) human capital; (2)
finances/funding mechanisms; (3) effective recruitment, enrollment and retention approaches; (4) information
systems; (5) regulatory pathways; and (6) institutional collaborations. Additional tangible outcomes are
published meeting proceedings, collaborations among conference participants, and increased expertise
among participants. We expect a minimum of 250 delegates to participate in the conference."

10909112,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The high mortality of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is largely a consequence of diagnosis at an advanced stage when
the tumor is no longer treatable for cure. Currently, asymptomatic screening for PDAC is not recommended for
the general population, with screening pursued only for a small subset of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions
or strong genetic risk for PDAC. Even when cancer is identified early, patients can have rapid recurrence after
surgical resection, most often with liver metastases. To improve outcomes for patients with PDAC, a number of
important advancements are urgently needed, including improved risk assessment to identify those at elevated
risk for PDAC, new non-invasive biomarkers to select individuals for intensive imaging surveillance, and better
strategies to identify those with localized tumors who are at risk for rapid recurrence after surgical resection. In
the current proposal, we directly address these critical areas of need, focusing on: (a) machine learning models
for risk assessment from electronic medical record data (Aim 1), (b) development of non-invasive biomarkers
from stool and computed tomography (CT) imaging that measure metabolic alterations caused by early PDAC
(Aim 2), and (c) characterization of CT imaging and circulating cell-free DNA methylation patterns to predict
presence of occult metastases at the time of surgical resection (Aim 3). Furthermore, we will collect and make
available clinical data, blood samples, stool samples, imaging studies, and tumor tissue from multiple patient
populations critical to PDAC early detection research, including those with early-stage PDAC, chronic
pancreatitis, genetic PDAC risk, pancreatic cystic lesions, and non-cancer controls (Aim 4). To accomplish the
proposed work, we have assembled a highly experienced and collaborative team that is fully committed to
working together and with other Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium units. Thus, we will leverage cutting-
edge machine learning approaches, develop multiple innovative, non-invasive biomarker technologies, and
collect a large array of data and clinical samples for collaborative activities within and outside the Pancreatic
Cancer Detection Consortium. With a highly dedicated expert team and clear scientific plan, we expect to
achieve our near-term goal of reducing pancreatic cancer mortality by finding PDAC earlier and treating it more
effectively for cure."

10909864,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Developmental Core
HIV/AIDS remains an important public health issue, especially in the Southern United States, where the rise in
opioid use disorder is associated with an increased number of HIV-1 infections. To accomplish the CFAR
research missions that include preventing new infections, increase access to care, reduce health disparities
and inequities, and improve health outcomes for people with HIV, skilled researchers are needed. The goals
of the Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Developmental Core are to stimulate new HIV/AIDS research
programs targeting the most relevant issues facing people with HIV, and to train and support the next
generation of HIV/AIDS researchers to ensure local, regional, and national HIV/AIDS research priorities are
addressed. To accomplish these goals, the Core proposes three areas of activities including financial support
for pilot research projects, development of professional networks through recruitment of HIV/AIDS researchers,
and a structured mentoring program. In the next funding cycle, the Developmental Core will provide financial
support to develop new research programs that address NIH priority HIV/AIDS research, particularly the
Southern HIV Epidemic and the impact of opioid use disorder on HIV/AIDS and co-morbidity. The
Developmental Core also works with other Departments, Centers, and Institutes to recruit promising new
HIV/AIDS researchers to the Duke faculty. The Developmental Core provides mentoring and career
development support to assist the growth of the next generation HIV/AIDS researchers, such as support for
junior investigators to enhance their ability to receive independent funding and engagement of established
investigators from outside the field. The activities of the Developmental Core also support Duke CFAR overall
aims of support the overall aims of the Duke CFAR including, “Continue development of a pipeline of next
generation HIV/AIDS investigators through strong support of Early Stage Investigators and engagement of
established investigators from outside the field”, “Foster critical synergies through Core-Core interactions and
engagement of new and existing strategic partnerships” and “Further enhance and support inter-CFAR
collaborative activities”."
10909865,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Immunology Core (Basic Science Core)
The overall goal of the Immunology Core is to provide Duke HIV/AIDS scientists, clinicians, collaborators, and
trainees access to an innovative, state-of-the-art, and standardized repertoire of immunologic assays that can
comprehensively and deeply interrogate the immunologic space in response to HIV-1 infection, vaccination,
co-infections, and cure strategies. The Immunology Core will continue to address gaps in the field. Three key
examples of accomplishments to date are the following: 1) Provided implementation and training of
standardized neutralization, binding, and cellular assays to national and international laboratories, such that
diverse studies across multiple laboratories can now be directly and rigorously compared for advancing the
science to the next phase. 2) Fostered innovation of new assay development and analysis for multiple
simultaneous measurements, significantly advancing the depth and breadth of immunological information (i.e.
global virus panels for neutralization breadth, immune monitoring assays for TB, flu, malaria, and typhoid, PK
and functional ADA assays for broadly neutralizing antibodies, comprehensive array of Fc effector function
assays, Env characterization on infected cells, novel analytical algorithms, and training for flow cytometric
analyses (such as FLowPET) to integrate complex immunological data and multiplex binding breadth assays.
3) Provided scientific training and mentoring to Duke young investigators, resulting in R01 and P01 awards,
high-impact publications, and career development opportunities. 4) Implemented a recharge system to
provide services to the CFAR community. Thus, the Immunology Core investigators have a strong history
together and are uniquely poised to tackle newly emerging gaps in the field of HIV-1 immunology. The Duke
CFAR’s priority areas for innovative research at Duke are supported by the science and technology offered by
the Immunology Core: 1) the ‘Southern HIV Epidemic’, 2) HIV Co-Morbidities and Co-Infections, 3) Latency
and Eradication, 4) Health Disparities, 5) Vaccine Design and Evaluation, 6) Mental Health and Substance
Abuse, 7) the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act, and 8) Emerging Infections. The Immunology Core’s
assay platform and commitment to innovation is ideally suited for support of the Duke CFAR priority areas
and Specific Aims, as well as broadly covering the current and emerging needs of the Duke CFAR community
of scientists and clinicians. As part of the overall Duke CFAR Aims, the Core will provide advanced assays
and technologies to CFAR investigators, provide support and training for early stage investigators, and
support NIH initiatives (PAVEG, HVTN, IMPAACT, HPTN, CHAVI-ID/CHAVD, MIG, CURE, EQAPOL) and
collaborative partnerships with other CFARs."

The Quantitative Sciences (QS) Core enhances HIV/AIDS research at Duke by linking early stage and
established HIV/AIDs investigators with the analytic expertise needed to thoughtfully design experiments,
conduct research using statistically rigorous approaches, and where appropriate, use state-of-the-art statistical,
bioinformatics, or computational biology methods to dissect complex data sets. Formerly known as the
Biostatistics and Computational Core, the new name reflects the expanded range of services proposed for the
next funding cycle, now encompassing biostatistics, computational biology, genomics and microbial
bioinformatics, and population health analysis. The QS Core has four Specific Aims: 1) Provide consultation,
analysis, and grant support services; 2) Provide education and mentoring in quantitative methods; 3) Develop
innovative methods in HIV/AIDS research; and 4) Foster internal, intra-CFAR, inter-CFAR, and external
collaborations. The QS Core's top priority is to provide useful statistical and analytical resources and services
to the CFAR community. To accomplish this, the QS Core will continue to offer ad hoc consultations and walk-
in clinics, conduct statistical analyses for manuscripts, and collaborate in the preparation of grant proposals. In
particular, the Core ensures that early stage investigators receive adequate mentoring, training, and analytic
support. In this funding cycle, we will provide free data analysis support for all CFAR Pilot Grant awardees,
which will contribute directly to their successful outcomes. Through affiliated quantitative cores from the Duke
Cancer Institute, Global Health Research Institute, Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, and Child
Health and Development Initiative, CFAR investigators will now have access to expertise in a much wider
range of quantitative fields, including Pharmacogenomics and Electronic Health Records. The QS Core will
provide education and mentoring through annual workshops in data analysis, and collaborative projects that
pair biostatistics graduate students with CFAR investigators. Additionally, the QS Core will offer a
comprehensive research education program in quantitative methods for HIV/AIDS research that includes
summer internships as well as workshops in data science, statistics, and the analysis of complex assays. The
QS Core seeks innovation by (1) developing new training and education opportunities, such as walk-in clinics
and a variety of workshops; and (2) methods development in collaboration with CFAR Cores and/or
investigators to improve data provenance and statistical rigor. Lastly, the QS Core collaborates extensively
with other Cores and Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) in the Duke CFAR; there are multiple joint projects
with the Clinical, Development, and Immunology Cores, as well as with the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill CFAR Biostatistics Core, and with HIV/AIDS researchers at the University of South Carolina who
do not have an in-state CFAR."
10909867,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Clinical Core
The Clinical Core supports patient-centered HIV/AIDS research through activities and services: (1) facilitating
access to key populations of people with HIV (PWH), patient-derived biologic specimens, and relevant
databases, in both domestic and international settings; (2) providing consultation to address clinical challenges
consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, including study design and implementation, and sophisticated
domestic and international regulatory support; and (3) serving as the liaison for community engagement in
CFAR research. The Core is involved in recruitment and enrollment of PWH and biologic specimens through
Duke University and partnering institution clinics, coordinating access to the Duke CFAR Biorepository and
support to access Network repositories. Importantly, the Clinical Core is intimately involved in prevention and
treatment efforts for the Southern HIV Epidemic, and HIV-related co-morbidities, through research on pre-
exposure prophylaxis, acutely infected persons, substance abuse including persons who inject drugs, and
retention in care for marginalized populations, as well as through outreach to historically black colleges and
universities. The Core has identified high-value, well-phenotyped populations through the Duke CFAR
Biorepository, especially useful for investigators researching co-morbidities, recently infected persons, and
long-term non-progressors. The Clinical Core leadership and staff are highly experienced and active, and
since 2015 the Core has provided 226 consultations on study design and implementation, regulatory support
on 601 applications, and assistance with subject recruitment in 14 studies. The Clinical Core is highly
networked within the CFAR, and with other entities both internal and external to Duke. Notably, the Core has
supported the opening of an HIV Vaccine Trials Network site at Duke, creating exciting new opportunities for
vaccine-related science. The Core serves as the gateway to access our international partners in Tanzania,
Kenya and South Africa, and populations of PWH. These networks have attracted investigators new to
HIV/AIDS, which has further enhanced the impact of Clinical Core researchers. The Clinical Core welcomed
seven new Duke faculty as Core investigators, and in conjunction with other CFAR Cores, plays an important
role in their co-mentorship, promoting highly rigorous, impactful, and ethically sound investigations. In the next
funding cycle, the Clinical Core expects continued expansion of research activities focused on the Southern
HIV Epidemic, with partnerships in other academic institutions, public health professionals, and the community,
building upon our work in HIV testing, prevention, early treatment, and retention in care. The Core anticipates
increased activities in HIV-related co-morbidities, especially with our international partners. Growing expertise
and research in HIV-related cardiovascular disease and disparities in the care of HIV-related CVD within the
Clinical Core will lead to exploration of a new Scientific Working Group focused on Health Services Research."
10909869,"Learning difficulties (LDiff) are a pervasive, impairing, and costly problem that disproportionately affect children
living in economically disadvantaged communities. Youth from disadvantaged communities also experience
disproportionate exposure to air pollution and to psychosocial stressors, and we have shown that prenatal
exposure to air pollution compounds effects of early life stress (ELS) on cognitive and psychological outcomes
in youth. This study will investigate biological and cognitive pathways from prenatal air pollution and stress
(ELS) exposure to LDiff.
We hypothesize that the neurobiological basis of LDiff among children from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds derives from brain system dysfunction related to chemical and social exposures, resulting in
unique neural signatures of LDiff in these children. In animal models, prenatal exposure to air pollution and
chronic stress alter levels of dopamine and its metabolites across the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal and
ventral striatum. These dopaminergic circuits mediate core cognitive processes, such as inhibitory control and
reinforcement learning which may be domain general areas of deficit leading to LDiff. Relevant to the proposed
work, we have recently shown that lower inhibitory control mediates pollution-related effects on reading and
math problems in children from economically disadvantaged families. Such findings suggest that prenatal
exposure to air pollution in humans may be linked with LDiff via dopamine-mediated disturbances in inhibitory
control and reinforcement learning. The cognitive and neural pathways linking exposure to low achievement,
particularly in children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds at high risk of experiencing prenatal
exposure to air pollution and early life stress, however, remain understudied. Documenting these pathways will
establish this environmentally-associated phenotype of LDiff. Impact: This LD Hub will integrate innovative
magnetic resonance of neuromelanin, a metabolite of dopamine, with computational modeling of
inhibitory control and reinforcement learning, cognitive processes served by dopamine and that
contribute to learning, and granular measures of early life stress. By studying these pathways from
exposure to LDiff, we will greatly enhance our ability to comprehensively characterize the complex
LDiff faced by children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. These signatures will serve as
targets for the design of intervention programs for adolescents with entrenched LDiff and early
intervention programs for young children with emerging problems to be conducted in a future CU
Center for Environmental LD Research submission."
10909870,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Social and Behavioral Sciences Core
The Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) Core is the primary resource for university-wide scientific consultation
on the design and conduct of interdisciplinary social and behavioral studies related to HIV. The mission of the
Core supports NIH Priority areas for HIV/AIDS research, including reducing the incidence of HIV infection,
developing new therapies to optimize engagement and retention, and addressing HIV-associated comorbidities,
coinfections, and complications. In the most recent funding cycle, the Core served 71 NIH-funded research
projects from 36 Duke investigators, with steady growth on both of these metrics during each year of the funding
cycle. In the last 3 years, 72% (n=21) of grants that were peer reviewed by the SBS Core were funded. The Core
provided services related to preparing for grant submissions, research implementation, networking, community
collaboration, and mentorship of new investigators. The SBS Core proposes to capitalize on its successes in the
last five years by continuing to support investigators to develop their diverse independent research portfolios,
and improving the quality and breadth of SBS research at Duke to address the global and regional HIV
epidemics. This will include a specific focus on supporting early-stage investigators, those new to HIV research,
and investigators from historically underrepresented groups. The SBS Core will continue to collaborate with other
CFAR Cores, the CFAR scientific working groups (SWGs), and the broader community to expand focus on the
three NIH Priority areas. The SBS Core has four Specific Aims: 1) Provide expertise in the social and behavioral
sciences in order to advance research across the HIV/AIDS care cascade and prevention continuum. 2) Enhance
the scientific rigor and potential impact of social and behavioral HIV/AIDS research by providing consultations
on research methods and intervention approaches. 3) Build the individual and collective capacity of SBS Core
users at Duke University by attracting and supporting early stage investigators and investigators new to HIV,
providing mentorship and training, and facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations both within Duke and with other
CFARs. 4) Expand the reach and impact of SBS studies by linking SBS Core users to appropriate community
partners and assisting in the implementation and dissemination of findings to stakeholder and scientific
communities. Through these aims, the Core will continue to provide scientifically sound, individualized services
to a large number of investigators, sharing expertise in research, and maintaining high success rates of NIH
funding for Core users. The Core's efforts will add value and provide economy of scale to existing NIH-funded
HIV research at Duke, and will support research efforts to advance science and practice across the continuum
of HIV prevention and care."

training, and delivering a translational science training program—all aimed to prepare early investigators with
skills needed to bridge the gap between learning difficulties (LDiff) research and best practices in the
educational system. Our framework uses a bidirectional hub and spoke model, linking the embedded research
project (the hub) with a network of community sites in which trainees work with practitioners/learning
specialists in the educational system and provide feedback to the research study with respect to community
needs and communication challenges. The hub will train early career scientists to conduct cutting-edge
neuroscience to explore the biological and cognitive pathways linking environmental chemical and social
exposures to LDiff. The spokes of the model comprise the translational component, in which early investigators
receive training in how to engage with and listen to community members, and translate community needs and
relevant research to practitioners, educators, and policy-makers who are responsible for making change in
educational settings. The Leadership Core will thus prepare the next generation of LD research scientists with
a full set of research, communication, and leadership skills, spanning neuroscience, epidemiology, systems
thinking, and dissemination & implementation science. The core will develop an administrative and training
infrastructure for the overall LD Innovation Hub, deliver a state-of-the-art biological/neuroscience research
methods training program, and implement a translational science training program with didactic and
experiential components.
IMPACT: Our Leadership Core expands the LD research paradigm by training future leaders in
neuroscience and analytic techniques (the hub), linked to a translational community-based practicum
experience in disadvantaged educational communities (the spokes). We go beyond community
participatory research to prepare future LD leaders with practice-based communication, listening, and
engagement skills, enabling them to become independent investigators, faculty members, and
spokespersons for children from economically disadvantaged families who suffer disproportionately
with learning difficulties, thereby helping to close the gap between research and practice."
10909961,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE

10909964,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 1
 Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), an inherited disorder arising in heterozygous carriers of germline mutations
in TP53, is associated with early-onset cancers in many different tissues of origin. Because TP53 has been
studied so extensively, a unique opportunity exists to intervene early – prior to tumor formation – in LFS
individuals.
 Whether germline or somatic, most cancer-associated TP53 mutations are missense mutations that
disrupt p53’s ability to bind DNA. While some of these mutations map to residues in direct contact with DNA,
many do not. Rather, these mutations reduce p53’s thermodynamic stability, so that an insufficient amount of
(mutant) p53 is correctly folded: this leads to loss of function (LOF). Many of these mutations also confer
oncogenic gain of function (GOF) activities. Among Li-Fraumeni individuals, evidence suggests that the earliest
stages in the emergence of precancerous lesions, and progression of these lesions to cancer, derive from mutant
p53’s GOF activities.
 Ongoing work in the Karanicolas lab focuses on developing drugs that bind and stabilize the folded
conformation of mutant p53, to directly correct the missense defects that underlie the LOF and GOF activities.
These “refolder drugs” are designed to bind a region on the protein surface that is separate from all of p53’s
most common mutations, so that the same drug can be applied irrespective of the specific mutation. We have
tested these drugs in diverse cancer cell lines harboring many different mutations in TP53. Through these
studies, we have confirmed that these refolder drugs both: 1) restore LOF from mutant p53, and 2) revert mutant
p53’s GOF activities.
 The objectives of our proposed project are three-fold. First, we will define the set of mutations
characteristic of LFS individuals that can be addressed by this new class of agents. Second, we will optimize our
current “best” agent to enhance its expected safety and efficacy in animal studies. Third, we will test the safety
of the resulting agents’ in mice heterozygous for a TP53 mutation seen frequently in LFS individuals, and efficacy
in a mouse model of p53-mediated squamous carcinoma that provides clear milestones of the progression from
precancer to cancer. Successful completion of these studies will serve as important proof-of-concept that these
p53 refolding agents hold the potential to become new drugs for prevention and early interception of cancer in
LFS individuals."
10909965,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 2
Most patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) do not survive one year and less than 10% survive five years. This is
unfortunate, given the slow rate of growth of PC over many years, and the large window of opportunity for
potential intervention prior to diagnosis. Patients with hereditary familial PC (~10% of PC cases), as well as those
exposed to mutagens and presenting with predisposing clinical conditions like pancreatitis and new onset of
diabetes, are at high risk for PC and would benefit greatly from improved early detection, cancer prevention,
and/or interception strategies. The proposed project addresses this unmet need by joining the FCCC Cancer
Prevention-Interception Targeted Agent Discovery Program (CAP-IT) at the “Agent Identification and Screening”
stage. The proposal is the first, to our knowledge, to employ a stroma-targeting strategy to intercept progression
of precancerous tissue to overt PC. This proposal exploits our work in studying desmoplasia – a unique
microenvironment enriched in stromal fibroblasts and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that characterizes PC.
We have defined distinct subsets of tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing fibroblasts (TPFs and TSFs), which
can reversibly interconvert in phenotype. We have shown that TPFs arise in early precancerous tissue, and are
characterized by expression of Netrin G1 (NetG1). NetG1-dependent signaling is essential for premalignant cells
to thrive as tumors. Mechanistically, we have shown that NetG1+ TPFs provide nutritional support to
premalignant initiated epithelial cells (IECs) and tumors, allowing them to survive in the nutrient-poor
desmoplastic environment and escape immunosurveillance by inducing an immunosuppressive
microenvironment. While some support is delivered via TPF secretion of nutrients and chemokines; additional
support is provided by the TPF-generated ECM. Critically, we have shown that a commercial monoclonal
antibody (mAb) that inhibits NetG1 reverts all of these tumor-promoting properties and intercepts the formation
of PC. Although the commercial mAb is sufficient for proof-of-concept experiments, it is not sufficiently potent as
a clinical candidate. A large panel of mAbs targeting diverse NetG1 epitopes, with higher binding affinities than
the one above-mentioned, has been generated. In Aim 1, we will determine which of the new mAbs functionally
reverts TPFs to TSFs, based on the expression of molecular markers that distinguish between the two classes.
In Aim 2, co-culture experiments will be used to identify mAbs that reduce the ability of TPFs to provide nutritional
support to IECs, and assess whether the same mAbs decrease the ability of the ECM, produced by TPFs, to
enhance IEC growth. New IEC models will be engineered that parallel the loss of function genetic variants seen
in populations at high risk for PC. In Aim 3, the lead candidate mAbs that can intercept the transition from
precancer to cancer in vitro will be evaluated for their toxicity profiles and ability to inhibit formation of PanINs,
the precursor of PC, in KC mice, a model of PC. These studies are expected to yield novel agents that target the
stroma for PC prevention and/or interception."
10910011,"In the event of a nuclear accident or a radiological attack, the exposure to ionizing radiation can
cause acute damage to radiosensitive tissues that have rapid turnover rates, including the
hematopoietic (H) system and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. After irradiation, an insufficient
regeneration of either the hematopoietic system and/or the GI tract can lead to death within a
few weeks, which is termed the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Although significant progress
has been made to understand mechanisms underlying the ARS, no FDA approved therapy is
available to treat both the H-ARS and the GI-ARS when given at least 24 hours after irradiation.
At this time point, the majority of tissue stem/progenitor cells will already be dead. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to develop novel medical countermeasures (MCMs) that target master
regulators of tissue regeneration in response to radiation injury. The long-term goal of this
project is to develop a novel class of MCMs that mitigate both the H-ARS and GI-ARS by
targeting calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2). We have shown
that inhibition of CaMKK2 by genetic deletion or by the small molecule inhibitor STO-609 is
sufficient to stimulate hematopoietic regeneration and mitigate the H-ARS. Remarkably, our
preliminary data indicate that deletion of Camkk2 specifically in myeloid cells is sufficient to
facilitate blood cell formation following total body irradiation. More recently, we found that
deletion of Camkk2 also protected mice from the GI-ARS. Of note, outside the brain, the
expression of CaMKK2 is restricted to a small number of cell types, including macrophages and
epithelial tuft cells, which share the ability of tuning the regeneration rate of hematopoietic and
intestinal stem cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CaMKK2 is an important
druggable target to regulate the behavior of hematopoietic and intestinal stem cell niches, and
blocking this enzyme 24 hours after irradiation will be sufficient to facilitate tissue regeneration
in response to radiation injury. We will test this hypothesis using sophisticated mouse models,
CaMKK2 inhibitor, along with primary bone marrow cells and intestinal organoids from human
donors. Using these combined approaches, we will define mechanism(s) by which CaMKK2
expressed in myeloid cells mitigate H-ARS, and will determine the impact of acute Camkk2 loss
in tuft cells after irradiation on the development of GI-ARS. By completing this grant, we expect
to gain new insight into the role of CaMKK2 in regulating both the H-ARS and GI-ARS. More
importantly, by more comprehensively understanding mechanism(s) underlying the effects of
CaMKK2 inhibition on mitigating the ARS, we will lay the foundation for approval of STO-609 as
a medical countermeasure against radiation under the FDA’s Animal Rule."
10910244,"SUMMARY
It is essential that technological advances in imaging developed in the laboratory find direct translational paths
to rapidly demonstrate their clinical utility in patients, and establish the potential for improving detection,
diagnosis, and monitoring of disease. While label-based optical imaging modalities have demonstrated potential
in intraoperative cancer detection, mapping the microvasculature, and site-specifically targeting of altered
metabolism and pathology, to name a few, these approaches often come at a significant time and financial cost
due to the associated safety risks and lengthy review processes required for FDA approval of any new contrast
agent or probe. Importantly, any new targeted contrast agent or probe inevitably will have some degree of non-
specific binding or off-target labeling, as well as a variable degree of uptake or labeling of the targeted cell or
site. In the end, the measured or imaged signal levels are always questioned. Is the signal low because the
targeted pathology is minimal, or because the targeted efficiency of labeling is low? The importance of label-free
imaging is therefore high, and the need for label-free imaging across size scales is great. By identifying robust
label-free signals or biomarkers that indicate changes in structure, molecular composition, metabolism, and
function, quantitative clinical and in vivo imaging not only becomes a feasible alternative to label-based methods,
but also provides a direct and rapid translational path to clinical human studies, since regulatory approval is not
additionally needed for a contrast agent or probe. This enables rapid in vivo first-to-human and limited-scale
human subjects research studies (and subsequently larger clinical trials) to be performed with the new optical
imaging technologies, and make early determination of the clinical utility of the technologies and the new optical
biomarkers that they generate. This TRD focuses on the technological development through four specific aims
that progress from 1) the sub-cellular and cellular scale, identifying optical biomarkers and signatures that would
indicate more systemic disease processes, to 2) tissue sections in an advanced digital pathology platform with
artificial intelligence, to 3) computational optical imaging algorithms that extend the depth and performance of
optical imaging in thick tissues, and finally to 4) engineered beam delivery systems to widely expand tissue
access and application for these label-free optical imaging modalities. Collectively, this project will demonstrate
novel technological advances that will find a myriad of applications to advance the biological and medicine
sciences, and improve diagnostic and monitoring capabilities in clinical medicine."
10939106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly half of U.S. adults have or are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle intervention is efficacious
and the first line of prevention among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, outcomes in real-
world settings do not approach the initial efficacy trial findings, in part due to low rates of retention in the
intervention. Real-world programs have particularly struggled to retain participants who identify as members of
racial/ethnic groups that are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes, potentially exacerbating health
disparities. Given the strong influence romantic partners have on one another and the shared environment in
which couples typically live, lifestyle interventions that systematically include romantic partners have the
potential to address the research-practice gap. The purpose of this project is to examine the efficacy of
PreventT2 Together, a couple-based lifestyle intervention our team developed. The specific aims of the
research are: (1) to determine the efficacy of PreventT2 Together in a single-center, randomized clinical trial,
(2) to examine baseline relationship satisfaction as a moderator and perceived partner support as a
mechanism of lifestyle change, and (3) to quantify intervention retention and describe reach across recruitment
methods. We will recruit 162 couples (i.e., adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes and their romantic partners)
from community and healthcare settings, oversampling members of racial/ethnic minority groups. We will
randomize participating couples to individual (PreventT2; delivered only to partners at high risk) or couple-
based (PreventT2 Together; delivered to couples) lifestyle intervention conditions. HbA1c and objectively
measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) will be collected from all participants at baseline (Pre)
and at the end of the 1-year intervention (Post). Participants will also report on lifestyle factors, health
outcomes, and relationship functioning at each of 13 time points (Pre, monthly during the intervention, and
Post). We focus on the patient-centered minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in outcomes, including
objectively-measured MVPA (primary outcome), as well as other aspects of lifestyle (nutrition, sleep), health
outcomes (HbA1c, weight loss, stress), and relationship functioning (perceived partner support) (secondary
outcomes). Situating lifestyle intervention within the romantic relationship context in which lifestyle change
occurs is likely to increase reach and improve retention and lifestyle change outcomes in real-world settings.
Our community-engaged approach to the development of the intervention and design of the proposed project
will ensure broad applicability and dissemination of results across communities, including racial/ethnic minority
groups that have not been effectively reached and retained. CDC review and approval of PreventT2 Together
for use as an alternate curriculum in the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) delivered
across the U.S. underscores the scalability of the intervention. If efficacious, PreventT2 Together has the
potential to impact individuals and their romantic partners’ quality of life and ultimately improve real-world
outcomes of lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes."
10940368,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) affect up to 25% of U.S. children. Patients often suffer from disabling,
multisystem comorbidities that suggest a common root (sleep disturbances, fatigue, anxiety, etc). Yet, DGBI are
defined and treated based on GI symptom origin (cyclic vomiting, dyspepsia, irritable bowel) rather than
underlying pathophysiology. Many patients manifest comorbidities suggesting an underlying autonomic nervous
system (ANS) dysregulation (palpitations, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction). Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is
a prototype DGBI with known ANS imbalance and episodic vomiting attacks. Many chronic nausea and vomiting
conditions, often termed ‘functional dyspepsia’, present with postprandial symptoms suggesting gastric
dysmotility. However, currently available tests do not capture the range of possible gastric motor disturbances.
These patients often have symptoms of ANS dysregulation. Unfortunately, due to common features of anxiety
and visceral hyperreactivity, children with CVS and functional dyspepsia are frequently diagnosed with
psychosomatic or ‘benign, functional disorders’ and treated with empiric antidepressants despite lack of scientific
support and risks of serious side effects. Little is known about the underlying brain-gut mechanisms linking these
comorbidities. A lack of targeted treatment options naturally follows the paucity of mechanistic data.
A dysregulated ANS response circuit via brainstem nuclei is linked to visceral hypersensitivity. ANS regulation
can be non-invasively measured via several validated indices of cardiac vagal tone. Using the novel vagal
efficiency (VE) metric, a dynamic measure of brainstem vagal afferent signaling, we have demonstrated
inefficient vagal regulation in CVS and pain-related DGBI and that low VE predicts response to auricular
percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) therapy. PENFS targets brainstem vagal afferent
pathways and, along with brain-gut interventions such as hypnotherapy, are the only therapies proven effective
for pediatric DGBI. Individualizing neurostimulation based on sensory thresholds while assessing dynamic ANS
reactivity offers a path towards personalized medicine using the most effective therapies to date.
This proposal will test the feasibility of ANS-Sensing System (ANS-SS) software in assessing real-time,
autonomic regulation in children with nausea/vomiting and ANS imbalance. ANS-SS will measure VE output
(Aim 1) in response to PENFS using both standard and personalized neurostimulation parameters. Aim 2 will
investigate clinical efficacy and ANS changes of 6 weeks of personalized PENFS vs. personalized PENFS + gut-
directed hypnotherapy vs. standard of care pharmacotherapy. A subset will undergo multimodal assessment of
gastric physiology using real-time gastric MRI. Simultaneous pre- and post-meal ANS function measures will
attempt to correlate gastric and autonomic parameters and may further delineate brain-gut axis alterations."
10941028,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 In the modern era of genomics and proteomics, the vast amounts of biological data generated present both a
challenge and an opportunity. Central to this proposal is the innovative use of kmers, short nucleic or peptide
sequences, as a tool to navigate and interpret this data. Kmers are used in a variety of genomics and proteomics
applications, including genome assembly and alignment, genomic variant detection and metagenomics. With the
continued advancement of sequencing technology, kmers are poised to play an important role in research.
 Quasi-primes are kmers found in only one single species. We have recently developed algorithms to efficiently
identify quasi-primes across every available genome and proteome. In humans, quasi-prime loci are primarily
found in brain-expressed genes associated with cognition and are enriched for quantitative trait loci, indicating
their significance in the development of species-specific traits. Over the next five years, we will examine quasi-
primes in populations of diverse ancestries, in archaic hominins and in primate and mammalian evolution to
improve our understanding of their functional and evolutionary significance. Additionally, we will leverage our
expertise in performing large scale analyses to expand upon our findings and characterize the functions of these
kmers across every sequenced organism and taxonomic group. This will allow us to investigate the underlying
mechanisms that enable species to develop new traits and adapt to their environment.
 The composition of organismal genomes depends on a variety of factors, including genome size, genomic
instability, and biological processes, such as transcription and translation. We aim to investigate how these
factors shape the composition of genomes in every species and across all taxonomic groups. We will integrate
different types of genomic and proteomic data, including kmer frequency profiles, codon usage tables, and
transcription and translation annotations. Our goal is to deconvolute the relative contributions of different factors
shaping the composition and evolution of organismal genomes. Building on this, we plan to incorporate these
findings into generative artificial intelligence models to create improved simulated genomes that will have
significant applications as synthetic controls for bioinformatics analyses.
 Finally, we will provide well-documented, open-source software tools and integrate the data from our projects
into accessible databases, aligned to the FAIR principles. In doing so, we aim to not only advance research in
our specific areas of focus but also equip other researchers with tools and datasets they can utilize in their distinct
domains of expertise.
 In summary, our multifaceted approach seeks to harness the power of kmers in genomics and proteomics,
delve into the intricacies of evolutionary processes, and provide the scientific community with computational
resources, fostering collaboration and innovation in basic and biomedical research areas."
10941029,"Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by cardio- and skeletal myopathy, neutropenia,
and mitochondrial dysfunction, which limit the quality of life for BTHS patients. Despite improvements in
diagnosis, premature death is still commonplace due to the lack of effective therapies. Recently, clinical trials for
two potential BTHS drug treatments, bezafibrate and elamipretide, were conducted in BTHS patients. Neither of
these drugs showed a beneficial effect in their respective double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. These results
underscore the central problem - the leading pathogenic mechanism of BTHS is unknown. The gene mutated in
BTHS is TAFAZZIN, which codes for the transacylase tafazzin (Taz), which remodels the signature mitochondrial
lipid, cardiolipin (CL), a unique lipid containing four acyl chains and localized almost exclusively in the matrix-
facing leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Taz deficiency leads to decreased CL and accumulation of
the remodeling intermediate, monolyso-cardiolipin (MLCL), However, the mechanism linking defective CL
remodeling to the pathology in BTHS is not known. We established that both CL and MLCL can form a complex
with the hemoprotein, cytochrome c (cyt c), localized in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria, and
this complex acts as a peroxidase towards polyunsaturated (PUFA)-CL
. Normally, low steady-state levels of
MLCL and compartmentalization of CL and cyt c preclude the formation of this peroxidase complex. In Taz
deficiency, robust accumulation of MLCL in the IMS-facing leaflet of the IMM, the site of the
Taz-catalyzed
reaction, makes it available to interact with cyt c. We further discovered that polyunsaturated MLCL, CL and
other major phospholipids undergo robust peroxidation by the peroxidase complex.
Given the well-documented
membrane toxicity of lipid peroxidation products, we hypothesize that MLCL/cyt c complexes represent the
primary pathogenic mechanism underlying BTHS, and suppression of this peroxidase activity and lipid
peroxidation will protect mitochondria from BTHS-associated injury. We propose three mechanistic approaches
and small molecule inhibitors to quench the peroxidase activity of MLCL/cyt c complexes as a new therapeutic
strategy that will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1: Inhibiting MLCL/cyt c peroxidase catalytic activity. 2: Blocking
complex formation by competitively inhibiting MLCL-cyt c binding. 3: Eliminating sources of H2O2 required for
peroxidase activity. Our multi-PI team of experts in molecular genetics (M. Greenberg), redox biology (V. Kagan)
and LC-MS based redox lipidomics and MS-imaging (H. Bayir) will provide the interdisciplinary scientific
expertise required to implement the proposed experiments. Discovery of the MLCL/cyt c peroxidase complex as
the primary mitochondrial mechanism of BTHS pathogenesis will lead to new medicines - clinically relevant
inhibitors of pro-oxidant peroxidase activity."
10919772,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are highly prevalent conditions in the United
States and a major cause of disability, particularly among our nation’s Veterans. Emerging evidence suggests
that mild or moderate TBI is a critical risk factor for later developing PD. Yet, little is known about the impact
of mild or moderate TBI on symptoms in PD. Specifically, there is a vital need to better understand the
relationship between mild-moderate TBI and neuropsychological functioning, quality of life, and
neuropathology in PD. Preliminary work from our group has indicated that a history of remote mild-moderate
TBI is associated with greater cognitive deficits (d’ = .77) and decline (d’ = 1.54), elevated neuropsychiatric
symptoms (d’ = .55), decreased motor function (d’ = .71), poor quality of life (d’ = .62), as well as reduced
brain volumes (d’s = .61-1.1) in PD. However, due to the preliminary nature of these findings, further research
is needed to 1) confirm these results in a larger, descriptive sample; 2) examine symptoms with a
comprehensive, standardized battery, including those symptoms that may be impacted by PD and/or TBI; 3)
determine the longitudinal impact of mild-moderate TBI on long-term outcomes in PD; 4) assess the
neuropathological substrates that may underlie this comorbid condition; and 5) determine the relationship
between critical biomarkers and neuropsychological symptoms as well as long-term clinical outcomes. Such
knowledge will advance our understanding of mild-moderate TBI impact in PD and will ultimately aid in the
treatment and management of these vulnerable individuals.
 The overall aim of this longitudinal study is to determine the impact of chronic (> 1 year since injury)
mild or moderate TBI on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and neuropathology (i.e., brain
morphometry) in PD. We hypothesize that cognition (particularly executive function), neuropsychiatric
symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), motor function and quality of life will be significantly worse in PD
patients with a history of mild or moderate TBI (PD+TBI) compared to PD patients without a history of TBI
(PD-TBI). We also hypothesize that the PD+TBI group will demonstrate a greater decline in motor and non-
motor symptoms, as well as decrements in quality of life, over time (i.e., two years). Moreover, we predict
that brain volumes, specifically pathognomonic brain regions implicated in PD and/or TBI (i.e., fronto-striatal
regions) will be significantly reduced in the PD+TBI group compared to PD-TBI. We will examine the
relationship among these symptoms, quality of life, and relevant biomarkers in exploratory analyses.
 Ninety non-demented individuals with PD and a history of mild or moderate TBI (PD+TBI; n = 45) or
without a history of TBI (PD-TBI; n = 45) will be enrolled in the proposed study. Over-recruitment by 15% will
be instituted to account for subject attrition or unusable data, and to ensure an adequately-powered sample
size. All participants will be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to measure cognition (e.g.,
executive function, attention, memory), neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, PTSD),
motor function, and quality of life. Tests will be administered at baseline and 24-month follow-up. At baseline,
participants will also undergo a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Data will be primarily
analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses and linear and multivariable random effects modeling.
 Findings from this study will advance our understanding of the impact of mild or moderate TBI history
on PD-related symptoms, quality of life, and brain morphometry. Furthermore, results will provide essential
data regarding the interaction of TBI and PD on the progression of neuropsychological symptoms and other
relevant clinical outcomes. Ultimately, this study will provide important information to guide clinicians in the
identification, management, and treatment of at-risk patients, which in turn, could significantly impact clinical
practice within and outside the VA Healthcare System, as well as the greater scientific community."
10919779,"Undiagnosed and untreated hypertension (HTN) is a main driver of cardiovascular disease, contributing to
a third of deaths globally, disproportionately affecting low and middle-income countries. Across sSA, country-
level application of evidence-based guidelines to screen and manage HTN is low and variable due to lack of
service readiness, uneven health worker motivation, weak health worker accountability systems, and poor
integration of HTN screening and management with chronic care services. In Mozambique, where HIV
prevalence is >13%, the HIV treatment platform is the only scaled chronic care service. With over 900,000
patients on anti-retroviral therapy, it presents an opportunity to standardize and scale HTN care cascade
services. Low-cost, systems-level strategies are effective in improving linked cascade services and may be
effective for routinizing HTN diagnosis and management within existing HIV services; improving flow through
the HTN cascade; and improving patient-level outcomes.
 Our proposal builds on the ongoing SAIA-HTN trial. The overall objective of our UG3/UH3 (SCALE SAIA-
HTN) is to establish a robust evidence base on the effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy
(SAIA) on the HTN/HIV cascade using a ‘scaling-out’ framework, whereby strength can be ‘borrowed’ from
prior effectiveness trials. SCALE SAIA-HTN will be ‘scaled out’ through a novel modality delivered by district
health supervisors (rather than study nurses). We will also ‘scale up’ SAIA-HTN by expanding to all districts in
two additional provinces (15 districts), serving as a foundation for national scale-up. We propose three aims for
the UG3 (Planning) and two for UH3 (Implementation) phases. UG3-Aim 1: To develop a multi-sectoral
partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical working groups at the national level and with
participating provinces. UG3-Aim 2: To identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect the adoption,
integration, scale-up and sustainment of the SAIA-HTN implementation strategy. UG3-Aim 3: To conduct a
pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district supervisor-led SAIA-HTN intervention over six
months in one primary care facility and redesign tools and standard operating procedures as necessary for the
UH3 phase. UH3-Aim 1: Develop a district-based dissemination and implementation strategy for SCALE SAIA-
HTN using the RE-AIM model to evaluate the programs’ Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and
Maintenance. UH3-Aim 2: Determine the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization. We will
estimate total incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care."

have challenged this definition of functionality and argued up to 80% of the human genome to be
functional. Several studies have pursued the possibility that biological function evolves as an adaptive
response to rapid changes under environmental pressures whereby sequence conservation does not
directly predict function. By integrating -omics datasets and multilayer network approaches, we will
specifically test the following four hypotheses: (1) Among the millions of tandem repeats, a small portion,
still corresponding to thousands of loci, are functionally relevant. We further hypothesize that majority of
these functional tandem repeats will be evolving under negative selection and primarily cluster together in
multilayer networks of tandem repeat units. (2) Exonic tandem repeats have evolved as molecular tools to
regulate the dosage of a particular functional motif. Thus, we expect that these functional tandem repeats
will retain sequence conservation among paralogs as well as among species. (3) There are hundreds of
tandem repeats in the mammalian genome that evolve under lineage-specific positive selection. We
expect that such positively selected tandem re peats show unusual species-specific copy number
expansions or contractions, and may affect gene expression and phenotypic traits more often than
neutrally evolving tandem repeats. (4) Tandem-repeat copy number variation, if functional, primarily
effects phenotypic variation related to immunity and metabolism in humans. We expect that these repeat
loci evolve under positive selection. To test these hypotheses, we will develop
mathematical/computational methods to find groups of core nodes in multilayer genetic networks, and
then apply them to multilayer networks that we will build, in which each network layer is based on a
specific type of relationships between tandem repeat units."

Scientists are motivated by the notion that their work could improve or save lives; however, moving medical
innovations from bench to bedside is challenging. Biomedical entrepreneurship can be a career choice but is
also key to translating these investments in medical research by the commercialization of innovative ideas.
To succeed at this translation, a whole new set of skills are required, such as; understanding the barriers to
adoption in the complex healthcare market, business plan development, regulatory requirements, securing
the financial resources, and protection of intellectual property. Training in biomedical entrepreneurship is
limited in the Institutional Development Award program (IDeA)-eligible states. We posit that innovative
training opportunities that close this foundational knowledge and skills gap will speed the commercialization
of biomedical inventions and career progression. To address this need and education gap we established the
IDeA-Entrepreneurship (I-Trep) training program. The overall goal of I-Trep is to promote
entrepreneurship in biomedical research and to jump start and facilitate the transition of innovative
ideas and discoveries from the laboratory or bedside into the marketplace. To date, we have engaged
seven target states (VT, NH, ME, RI, DE, AK and Puerto Rico) and moved careers forward. We have trained
or assisted a highly diverse group of scientists, who have raised to date $8 million in SBIR/STTR grant dollars
and two I-Trep -assisted companies have now raised $20 million from private investors. I-Trep is being
revamped with a next phase of development, innovation, and expansion to create an IDeA entrepreneurial
ecosystem. We will now move forward to engage the entire IDeA program of 23 states plus Puerto Rico with
the aims and goals for the next phase that are: 1) Promote early career training in biomedical
entrepreneurship through innovative training opportunities. This will be achieved using innovative
principles of active learning, we will deploy virtual and asynchronous learning opportunities, an I-Trep Studio
program, and an I-Trep Fellows program. 2) Build a virtual community of practice. Mentoring of early-
stage entrepreneurs will be achieved through the establishment of an online community of practice
(ecosystem)- allowing members to a) connect with peer mentors, b) received one-on-one mentoring from
vetted consultants, c) find internship opportunities to gain practical experience. and 3) Marketing. We will
disseminate our training program by using a multifaceted approach that is grounded in best practices and
innovations in communications and build the community of practice in collaboration with several NIGMS
Regional Technology Transfer Hubs. I-Trep fills a unique niche through the education and training of
academic scientists so that they can interact more effectively with business professionals and thus realize the
successful translation of scientific discoveries to market."

Knowledge about the human microbiome has increased exponentially in the last twenty years, leading to its
association with a wide variety of conditions and diseases. However, many of the mechanisms underlying the
relationships between microbes and their human hosts have not been elucidated, particularly at the tissue level.
The human extracellular matrix (ECM) provides important structural and biochemical cues for the development
and homeostasis of all human tissues. Extensive ECM remodeling is a prominent feature of several diseases
linked to human microbiome dysfunction including pulmonary cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and
cervical cancer. Yet, regardless of tissue or body part, host cells (e.g. fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils)
are considered the primary drivers of ECM degradation, even though human-associated microorganisms are
known to secrete active proteases. Thus, crucial ECM-microbiome interactions should be included in existing
paradigms of host ECM remodeling. To address this important knowledge gap, our lab develops in vitro and ex
vivo models using biomaterials and tissue engineering strategies to explore the fundamental mechanisms behind
ECM-microbe interactions. We hypothesize that commensal microbiota can degrade human ECM and that
ECM remodeling, in turn, alters host cell behavior. The proposed research program will initially answer three
key questions: 1) What environmental conditions enable bacterial degradation of host ECM? Our
preliminary data demonstrates that commensal bacteria grown in complete growth medium can degrade
individual ECM components in vitro. Because environmental factors influence bacterial metabolism, we will
explore how factors such as pH, and nutrient source impact ECM degradation by gut and vaginal bacterial
species. 2) How do human-associated bacteria remodel host ECM? In parallel to question 1, we will use
metaproteomics and inhibition studies to identify the specific proteases and carbohydrate degrading enzymes
involved in ECM degradation. Additionally, we will develop an ex vivo tissue culture model to characterize the
extent of bacterial ECM remodeling. 3) What are the consequences of microbiota-driven ECM remodeling
for host immune cells? Because the ECM regulates cell behavior, we will test the hypothesis that ECM modified
by the microbiome impacts host cell function. We will generate in vitro biomaterial platforms that capture the
properties of native ECM and incubate them with microbiota culture supernatant. We will then expose innate
immune cells to the remodeled matrices and evaluate their phenotype. This ESI-MIRA award will enable my
group to discover interactions between bacterial microbiota and host ECM, shedding light on the microbiome’s
underexplored contributions to tissue maintenance and dysfunction. Ultimately, the vision for my research
program is to determine the impact of the human microbiome on ECM remodeling and leverage this new
knowledge to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutic strategies."
10940820,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is not only the most common adrenal disorder but also the most common cause of
endocrine hypertension. PA is characterized by renin-independent adrenal aldosterone production that results
in excessive mineralocorticoid receptor activation which eventually leads to hypertension. PA is also associated
with higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to blood pressure-matched essential
hypertension. Despite its high prevalence, PA is vastly under-recognized in the hypertensive population
preventing proper medical therapy for these patients. Over the past decades, it has become clear that PA results,
in part, from the disruption of adrenal cell calcium homeostasis leading to increased aldosterone synthase
(CYP11B2) expression and aldosterone production. The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has
provided important clues to the pathogenesis of PA and has defined a series of somatic mutations in genes that
encode proteins impacting intracellular calcium levels, including KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D,
CACNA1H, CLCN2 and SLC30A1 (aldosterone-driver gene mutations). Research focused on defining the
genetic causes of PA in Black Americans, however, is limited despite the high prevalence of salt-sensitive
hypertension, and their higher susceptibility to hyperaldosteronism and cardiovascular mortality.
 The overall objectives of this proposal are: 1) to define the spectrum of aldosterone-driver PA somatic
mutations in Black American patients, and 2) to identify targeted therapeutics that block mutation-driven
aldosterone production in endocrine hypertension. Two specific aims have been designed to address critical
gaps in the care of Black American PA patients. • In Aim 1, we will probe the hypothesis that Black American PA
adrenals harbor novel somatic mutations that cause aldosterone excess via increased intracellular calcium and
CYP11B2 activity. We will implement CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry-guided NGS to identify aldosterone-
driver somatic mutations Black American PA adrenals. We will then define the disease-causing mechanisms for
novel aldosterone-driver somatic mutations using genetically engineered adrenal cell lines. • In Aim 2, we will
probe the hypothesis that in Black Americans, PA is caused by aldosterone-driver mutations that can be targeted
by the currently available calcium channel inhibitors (CCIs). We will develop genetically engineered adrenal cell
lines expressing the major aldosterone-driver mutations found in Black Americans with PA. This will be followed
by testing these mutation-expressing cell lines to determine the efficacy of CCIs to inhibit mutation-driven
aldosterone production in Black Americans with PA. The proposed research would significantly improve our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing PA in Black Americans and provide foundational
information needed for the future development of available targeted therapeutics to treat PA in Black Americans."

The development of the human body involves cell specification and cell fate transition starting from
the embryos. Precise coordination of gene expression networks is required: lineage-specific genes
are transcriptional activated during early development, while genes for ectopic lineages are repressed
in the process. The precise control of gene expression is governed by epigenetic chromatin
modifications. Recent advances showed that genes encoding epigenetic “writer” and “eraser”
enzymes are frequently mutated in human diseases. However, treatment or early prevention methods
are hampered by the lack of knowledge on how the epigenetic landscape is precisely regulated. We
are investigating how a critical histone methylation (trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, or
H3K27me3) is precisely regulated. H3K27me3 is the hallmark for facultative heterochromatin, which
dynamically regulate gene repression during body development. During early differentiation,
H3K27me3 is deposited on pluripotency genes, erased on cardiac genes, and maintained on other
developmental genes for ectopic lineages. The dynamic level of H3K27me3 across the genome is
essential for the ON/OFF switch of gene expression, but it remained unclear how H3K27me3 is
regulated in a coordinated temporal and spatial manner. We hypothesize that key macromolecular
interactions including protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions regulates the specificity of
the H3K27me3 “writer” enzyme – Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 or PRC2. Recent progress and
our preliminary data show that the dynamic interactions between PRC2 and its accessory proteins
play key roles in the spatiotemporal regulation of epigenetic silencing specificity. To test the
hypothesis, we propose to fully interrogate the mechanism by employing a series of separation-of-
function mutants. Understanding the mechanism will open to door to further identification of novel
therapeutical targets to manipulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms."

10907709,"This new R01 proposal is designed to elucidate the essential role the phosphorylation of a single amino acid in
the most abundant enamel matrix protein, amelogenin, plays in the regulation of enamel formation. Proposed
studies build on our extensive new findings that show that phosphorylation of a single serine site (S-16) in native
amelogenin is critical for the formation of the highly-ordered enamel structure. Using a novel knock-in (KI) mouse
model developed in our laboratory with a S16 to alanine substitution that prevents amelogenin phosphorylation,
we have now for the first time demonstrated in vivo that amelogenin phosphorylation plays an essential role in
both the secretory and maturation stages of amelogenesis. Extensive analyses of developing enamel tissues from
KI, heterozygous (HET) and wild-type (WT) littermates reveal that KI mice exhibit distinct enamel phenotypes,
including, the loss of enamel rod structure, the hallmark feature of mammalian enamel, numerous surface defects,
shorter enamel crystals, hypoplasia and hypocalcification. Of particular note, HET enamel was found to be mosaic
in nature with regions that also contain normal prismatic structures as seen in WT enamel. We have also found
that KI ameloblasts lack Tomes' processes and exhibit a loss of organization of the ameloblast layer and severe
cell pathology that builds gradually through the secretory stage. These findings, along with other recent
evidence from our laboratories, have lead us to develop new working hypotheses regarding the role of
amelogenin phosphorylation in the regulation of enamel mineralization and in maintaining ameloblast integrity
and function during amelogenesis. Proposed functional activities with respect to mineralization reflect the
enhanced capacity of both native phosphorylated full-length amelogenin and its predominant phosphorylated
cleavage products to stabilize mineral phase precursors, as a means to control mineralization throughout
amelogenesis. We further hypothesize that lack of amelogenin phosphorylation leads to disruption of cell-
matrix interactions and trafficking of enamel matrix proteins. Four (4) specific aims have been proposed: to
determine how amelogenin guides the linear appositional growth and organization of enamel crystals; to
determine the basis for stage-specific abnormal enamel development in the KI mutants; to determine if S-16
amelogenin phosphorylation is required for amelogenin interactions with other essential enamel matrix proteins
during enamel formation; and to elucidate the importance of amelogenin phosphorylation in maintaining
ameloblast integrity and function throughout amelogenesis. The proposed studies are designed to provide
fundamental insight into the mechanism by which phosphorylated amelogenin serves to regulate the formation
of the highly-ordered dental enamel tissue. Long-term, our findings should aid in our understanding of inherited
enamel diseases and factors that influence dental caries susceptibility. The successful completion of this work
will also provide new insights for the development of improved methods for the regeneration of tooth enamel.
Given the high prevalence of dental caries, there is need for improved understanding in these noted areas."

Janine M. Dutcher, PhD aims to understand the brain mechanisms for behavioral interventions for stress reduction and
health. The research and training plan described in this proposal will strengthen her experience in neuroimaging with
additional training in structural neuroimaging, and launch her independent career as a multi-modal health neuroscientist.
To enable this training, Dr. Dutcher will analyze data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness training in
stressed employees. This study features functional and structural neuroimaging, and stress assessments—and experience
with these data will help the PI build a career that explores the brain mechanisms for stress reduction interventions.
Candidate: Dr. Dutcher is a Special Faculty Researcher in the Psychology department at Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU). She received her doctorate at UCLA in social and health psychology. Her work focused on understanding the
neural mechanisms of stress reduction, the neuroscience of inflammation and social experience, and the relationship
between reward and stress. She has worked primarily on cross-sectional and experimental studies, using functional
neuroimaging methods for testing neural mechanisms. She plans to receive training in structural neuroimaging and RCTs
to advance her studies on the longitudinal brain mechanisms for behavioral interventions.
Training Goals: Dr. Dutcher aims to learn more about RCT study design, intervention integrity, and mindfulness
meditation programs—goals that her mentor Dr. Creswell can aid in. Analytically, Dr. Dutcher will receive training in
diffusion spectrum imaging from Dr. Verstynen, learning statistical techniques for linking longitudinal structural and
functional brain changes, and assessing those relationships as a mechanism for the benefits that interventions have on
stress and health. Finally, Dr. Dutcher will hone the professional skills that will support her pathway to independence,
including grant writing, networking, and more mentoring opportunities through managing research teams.
Mentors/Environment: Dr. Dutcher has overseen the day-to-day execution of an RCT exploring the effects of a
mindfulness training program on stress and burnout in a stressed employee population with Dr. Creswell. She and Dr.
Verstynen coordinated to add diffusion spectrum and functional neuroimaging pre- and post-intervention. Thus, she will
be leveraging an existing dataset and existing collaborations to achieve her training and research goals. She has the
resources and support of CMU, proximity to other collaborators, and the ideal mentoring team for executing this proposal.
Research: Although the literature has established mindfulness as an effective stress reduction intervention, the brain
mechanisms are as yet unclear. The purpose of this project is to analyze data from a rigorous RCT of a 30-day smartphone
mindfulness program compared to an active control program (problem solving) to evaluate how mindfulness changes the
brain in a sample of stressed employees (N=100). Analyses will examine changes in white matter integrity over the 30-
day intervention, compared to control, and link these changes in white matter to changes in stress. This project has the
potential for mapping the brain mechanisms for stress reduction, providing greater understanding of how to effectively
intervene and reduce the risk of stress-related health conditions in the population."
10908475,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many of them
use closed architectures and proprietary software.
 To address this challenge, we propose to develop the PCBA and firmware for the implantable pulse generator
(IPG) platform and external charger, which will be based on a flexible, open-architecture, open-source, and
modular approach. Such flexibility will allow a significant degree of customization for different clinical indications,
including open-loop and closed-loop IPG operation. The PCBA and firmware modules will be designed for
interfacing with a large selection of sensing and stimulation leads. Once the IPG and charger modules are
developed, they will be subjected to the benchtop testing."

The goal of this application is to train Dr. Brian Shy, a physician scientist at the University of California San
Francisco, with the skills necessary to become an independently-funded investigator studying, developing, and
manufacturing engineered cellular therapies. This research proposal will evaluate CRISPR-based non-viral
methods for targeted genome, epigenome, and transcriptome engineering in primary human T cells. This will be
applied to understand DNA repair pathway choice and DNA toxicity responses in order to improve site-specific
“knock-in” strategies with large therapeutic constructs such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), develop safe

An aging human population has revealed the burden of chronic illness and age-related disease, and by
understanding the genetic and environmental factors that drive aging, we will be better suited to develop and
test therapeutics that slow age-related disease. As biological aging is influenced by both genetics and the
environment, our laboratory studies the cellular and molecular drivers of aging, with a particular focus on inter-
organelle communication in disease. Here, we newly describe a dramatic reorganization of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) subdomains in aging C. elegans. The ER mediates inter- and intracellular signaling through these
sheet and tubule domains, and sheet:tubule balance is critical for cell function. ER tubules store calcium and
lipids, and at specialized membrane contact sites, they regulate mitochondrial dynamics. We find that the aging
ER undergoes a loss of rough ER sheets and expansion of smooth ER tubules, and our data suggest that
modifying ER structure is sufficient to preserve mitochondrial morphology in age, making the ER a potential
target in preventing age-related mitochondrial fragmentation. Though autophagy is seen as cytoprotective in
aging, we show that autophagy is necessary for age-related ER remodeling. This may be explained by ER-
phagy, a form of ER-selective autophagy that has not been studied in the context of aging, as ER-phagy shares
common recycling processes. Finally, we demonstrate that caloric restriction, which extends lifespan, prevents
this age-related loss of ER morphology. Therefore, we hypothesize that dysregulated ER-phagy drives age-
related ER remodeling and that dietary restriction promotes longevity by mitigating this loss of ER form and
function. To discern whether these changes are attributable to selective ER-phagy, rather than general
autophagy, I will use a combination of in vivo imaging, fluorescent reporters, and RNAi to investigate the
molecular mechanisms leading to a change in ER subdomains with age (Aim 1). In Aim 2, I will use dietary
restriction, a robust longevity paradigm, to investigate the cause(s) and consequence(s) of ER remodeling in
healthspan and lifespan regulation. This work will be conducted at Vanderbilt University under the supervision
of Dr. Kristopher Burkewitz, Assistant Professor of Cell & Developmental Biology, who discovered roles for ER
function in lifespan regulation through ER-mitochondrial crosstalk. I will additionally be supported by Dr. David
Miller, Professor of Cell & Developmental Biology, whose lab is experienced in electron microscopy and
pioneered many genetic engineering techniques I will perform in C. elegans. In these studies, I will receive
feedback from a strong advisory committee with expertise including interorganelle signaling, membrane
dynamics, and aging physiology. Successful completion of this project will not only advance our understanding
of cell biology and the role of the ER in aging but also establish ER structure and function as therapeutic targets
in the treatment of age-related disease."

In the United States, people of recent African ancestry are four times more likely to develop chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) than non-Hispanic whites. While some of this risk can be
attributed to differential access to care and social determinants of health, much of this excess risk can be
attributed to two “high-risk” variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene. Patients with APOL1-associated
kidney disease are diagnosed with CKD at younger ages, have more rapid CKD progression, and are less
likely to respond to existing therapies. Although the link between the high-risk APOL1 genotype and the
increased risk of kidney disease is well-established, basic questions about the structure of the APOL1 protein
and the differences in activity between the high- and low-risk variants remain unanswered. Purified bacterially-
expressed APOL1 proteins have been observed to have nonselective cation channel activity. However, the
oligomerization state of the active APOL1 channel and the structural determinants of its selectivity are
unknown. Furthermore, the functional effects of the high-risk variants on APOL1 channel activity are unknown.
In preliminary work, I have purified eukaryotically-expressed, recombinant APOL1 proteins and shown that
they can form active ion channels in vitro. I hypothesize that APOL1 forms oligomeric nonselective cation
channels, and that channels composed of high-risk variant APOL1 proteins permit greater cation currents than
channels composed of the low-risk variant protein. To test this hypothesis, I propose two specific aims. In Aim
1, I will solve the structure of the APOL1 protein using electron microscopy. In Aim 2, I will reconstitute purified
APOL1 proteins into liposomes and characterize their activity using fluorometric liposome efflux assays. In
pursuing this work, I will gain critical skills and expertise necessary to study the structural and biophysical
properties of membrane proteins involved in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. I will develop as a physician-
scientist through formal coursework, scientific programming, and direct mentorship from experts in kidney
disease, structural biology, and ion channel physiology. The proposed research aims and career development
plan will help me establish a career as an independent investigator who studies the fundamental biochemical
and biophysical processes that cause kidney disease, while continuing to treat patients with kidney disease as
a nephrologist."

The Massachusetts Partnership for Community-Engaged Cancer Control Equity (Mass PCECCE) builds
on a robust partnership between the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Massachusetts League of
Community Health Centers, and Mass General Brigham. The proposed Center is well-poised to further
accelerate community-academic collaborations to advance transformative solutions for cancer equity.
Our Center's theme is advancing cancer control equity by strengthening community health center's
(CHC) capacity to deliver evidence-based cancer screening and tobacco treatment and by promoting
social and digital connection among patients and their communities. Advancing cancer control equity will
result from CHC systems that deliver evidence-based care together with community organizations that support
community needs. The Partnership has selected four local priorities as SDOH targets: (1) social capital,
which reflect the resources embedded within social connections; (2) civic engagement, or the actions that a
community takes to improve its circumstances; (3) access to digital skills and technology (here forward
referred to as “digital access”), which impacts on equity in access to health care and social resources that
support health; and (4) access to evidence-based cancer control care for breast, cervical, and colorectal
cancer screening and tobacco treatment, reflecting Healthy People 2030 objectives. We will conduct a
multi-level intervention at 2 levels— the community level to build community social capital and civic
participation, enabling engagement that will improve resident access to health and economic resources, and
the systems level to improve cancer control care (e.g. cancer screening and tobacco treatment) and digital
access, by digital needs screening and navigation to needed resources.
To support the Center's goals and planned research, we will: (1) create a community-partnered approach to
conducting research and building both community and CHC capacity to address key SDOH through a strong
Admin Core; (2) create a process for developing and sustaining research that is responsive to community
interests through our Community Responsive Project (CRP) Program; and (3) create an innovative, centralized
approach for efficient collection, management, and sharing of research data across the Center through a data
ecosystem, and supporting the methodologic needs of the Center through a Research Methods, Measurement,
and Data Management Core. This is a highly integrated Center with a strong emphasis on capacity building for
all partners. We aim to link CHCs and communities in ways that maximize civic engagement and participation
in cancer control research and care to address health inequities, using approaches that are scalable and
sustainable across MA and nationally."
10929695,"SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core of the Massachusetts Partnership for Community-Engaged Cancer Control
Equity (Mass PCECCE is designed to provide scientific and administrative leadership and governance to
ensure an integrated and sustained focus on our aims. Co-led by an academic (Emmons) and a community-
based (Clark) MPI, the Core is designed to provide strong and inclusive governance, articulate our scientific
vision and theme, coordinate collaborative activities across the Center and relevant partnership resources, and
advance the Center's theme through administrative support and continuous evaluation of our activities. The
Administrative Core will play a critical role in ensuring that the proposed Center achieves its goals and that it is
connected to the broader research and community health fields to maximize impact. The Core will also ensure
that our work is well-connected with the U19 consortium and that we work well with the Coordinating Center.
We have strategically designed the Administrative Core to oversee our capacity-building activities, with a
Capacity-Building Team to support aims related to building effective teams to address SDOH. This effort is
designed to harness the abilities held by members of the communities most affected by structural harms. Our
capacity-building efforts focus on: (1) catalyzing academic-community partnerships focused on SDOH; (2)
building the capacity of research teams to build coalitions and use community organizing and agenda-setting
strategies as part of transformative interventions; and (3) engaging graduate students from backgrounds that
are under-represented in science to co-lead capacity-building efforts.
To achieve our goal of creating a community-partnered approach to research and capacity building to address
key SDOH facing partner communities, we will: (1) develop a strong operational structure that integrates
activities across the Center as well as community and academic partner assets; (2) monitor and evaluate our
efforts to build an effective coalition that is committed to addressing SDOH; and (3) actively participate in
cross-Consortium activities to enhance learning locally and nationally.
We have integrated community partner engagement into every aspect of Mass PCECCE, drawing on core
principles of community-engaged research. Every Core or project is co-led by an academic and a community
partner. We have ensured that there is balanced representation on all governance structures and review
processes, and our budget reflects a commitment to shared resources. Most importantly, Mass PCECCE is
built on the foundation of a 5-year collaboration that has borne deep respect and commitment to the shared
work, which will bring significant benefit to the proposed collaboration."
10929696,"SUMMARY – RESEARCH METHODS, MEASURES, AND DATA MANAGEMENT CORE
The Research Methods, Measures, and Data Management (RMMDM) Core of the proposed Massachusetts
Partnership for Community-Engaged Cancer Control Equity (Mass PCECCE) will acquire and integrate
data from multiple sources and on multiple levels of influence, anchored in the Center's guiding conceptual
frameworks. Specifically, we will implement a robust Data Ecosystem for the Center that will include all
research, clinical, organizational, and community-level data collected as part of the Center. The Data
Ecosystem will be designed to create efficiencies for the Community Gateway to Health Equity Study, our
social determinants of health (SDOH) research project, the Community Responsive Projects Program, the
Administrative Core, and our partner community health centers (CHCs) by centralizing the acquisition,
processing, and management of outcomes data across projects; sharing de-identified data with investigators;
and overseeing data reporting to federal agencies and community partners. This approach also enables data
collected by one project (e.g. community-level structural stigma) to easily be used by other projects. All data
resources are available to all research teams in the Center to maximize efficiency, but most importantly to
maximize learning that will benefit participating communities. We will also achieve efficiencies as well as
standardization by centralizing as much data collection as possible. For example, the Research Engagement
Survey Tool will be administered centrally to all community partners who are collaborating with the Center to
assess the quality of our community engagement processes. Although each research team could collect this
data independently, centralizing this function is efficient and allows us to more easily look at our performance
overall as well as for individual projects.
The RMMDM Core will be co-led by Dr. Daniel Gundersen (survey methodologist) and MPI Dr. Cheryl Clark
(community located health equity/SDOH researcher), who have outstanding and complementary skill sets.
The overall goal of the RMMDM Core is to facilitate Center productivity by eliminating redundancies in data
collection, analyses, and evaluation across projects, and to maximize the impact of our work. The Core has
also been designed to catalyze the formation of a research methods infrastructure at our community partner,
the Institute for Health Equity Research, Evaluation, and Policy (IHE), which Dr. Clark leads.
The work of the RMMDM Core will directly support both the SDOH research project and the initial Community
Responsive Projects Program (CRP) Project, which will use centrally collected data and the Core's
methodological and statistical resources, and will oversee the CRP Program overall. Building on our Data
Ecosystem, the Core is well-positioned to support data sharing across the U19 Consortium, as well as
consortium-wide pilots that utilize our data and strong partnership infrastructure."

opportunity for civic engagement, improve resident access to resources, and ensure that CHCs have the
support needed to provide evidence-based care. The community-level intervention is an innovative approach
to build social capital and civic engagement, led by Union Capital, a non-profit designed to amplify resident
voice and power through resource exchange and collaboration. This will enable residents to access resources
that they need by building social ties and engaging in community opportunities. It will also support residents to
come together to engage with institutional structures, such as local government, that could change laws or
policies to reduce the impact of SDOH (e.g., living wage laws, tobacco product sales to minors). The health
care system-level intervention includes: (1) point-of-care population management tools for breast, cervical, and
colorectal cancer screening and tobacco use, and implementation support to increase their use; and (2)
screening and navigation to get needed resources for digital skills and technology.
We will use a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge study design in 12 CHC sites to determine the impact of the
community- and systems-level interventions. Cancer control will target breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer
screening rates and tobacco use. Outcomes will be measured at community, systems, and patient levels.
The proposed study, a partnership between academic and community-based researchers, aims to link CHCs
and communities in ways that can impact structural factors that produce cancer control inequities. The
interventions are designed to maximize sustainability and scalability. Our community-level intervention is
conducted in partnership with an existing organization focused on social capital and community engagement,
and the systems-level intervention increases use of existing population management strategies and tools that
can be integrated into CHC infrastructure, but are significantly underutilized."
10929698,"SUMMARY – COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE PROJECTS PROGRAM
Although academics are well-meaning in designing studies they believe will improve health equity, they often
do not have relevant lived experience to select study questions or study designs; as a result, the research does
not always address priorities for those facing health inequities. We will tackle this challenge by creating a
Center that is embedded in the communities in which the research is conducted and by partnering with
community-engaged researchers from underrepresented backgrounds as key Center leaders.
The goal of the Community Responsive Project (CRP) Program is to create a mechanism to identify
community priorities in cancer control research, and to enable academic and community teams to pursue those
ideas. Our Cancer Center's Community Outreach and Engagement Program has allocated $250K in support
for the CRP Program, which will increase our ability to advance strong CRP ideas. We will also support
academic-community teams to apply for other funding. This approach will help to sustain the concept of
community-responsive research beyond the U19 funding cycle. We have created multiple and interacting
mechanisms for generating ideas for the CRP Program, and an academic-community partnered review
process that ensures strong representation of community perspectives.
Our initial CRP, Using Community Advisory Boards (CAB) to Build and Sustain CHC-Community
Connections (CHC CAB study) will build on community input, our prior collaborative work, the Center's
theme, and the Community Gateway to Health Equity Study, our social determinants of health SDOH project.
The project will test the impact of a community health center- (CHC) based community advisory board (CHC
CAB) Toolkit and implementation support to increase clinic-community linkages. The goals are to: (1) support
the ability of CHCs to gather community and patient input, (2) center the community voice in both the
implementation of the Gateway Study and the CRP project; and (3) increase engagement with local community
partners and residents on cancer prevention and control. The ultimate goal is to build community voice into the
fabric of CHC preventive care decision-making, creating a mechanism for gathering community input about
cancer control priorities and programs and to build supporting community connections. Creating CABs focused
on SDOH and equity in cancer control will bring to light new opportunities and needs that can be channeled
into the CRP Program and integrated into the long-term planning at each CHC.
The CRP Program has been designed to maximize synergy across the Center's components, leverage the
benefits of academic-community partnership, and build capacity of community members to engage in cancer
control equity research participation and review."

The overall goal of this project is to deliver an automated diffusion image analysis tool to be
used in a clinical setting that quickly evaluates the diffusion images in conjunction with MR
volumetric images and reports diffusion-based microstructural parameters derived from
segmented anatomical locations to determine Alzheimer’s disease status of patients.
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized with β-amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles
preceding neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Hence quantitative volumetry and measures of
neuronal function have been studied extensively as potential bioimaging markers. There has
been increasing evidence of microstructural alterations in Alzheimer’s patients’ brains in addition
to the volume and functional changes in neuronal bodies. While diffusion imaging has been
used effectively in diseases involving specific white matter pathways, the recent advances in the
diffusion imaging techniques particularly multi-compartmental models for successfully
quantifying microstructural changes now enables the effective use of diffusion imaging in
Alzheimer’s disease. Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) is an advanced diffusion imaging
method and currently can be used in MR scanners from major manufactures which have the
capability to acquire multi-shell diffusion imaging. Recent studies of Alzheimer’s disease
patients with diffusion techniques reported decreased diffusion anisotropy in multiple white
matter tracts as well as increased diffusion in gray matter structures. Microstructural changes
due to axonal and dendritic pathology, would reflect in diffusional measures. Advanced
diffusion methods that are sensitive to neurite density and orientation are best qualified for
elucidating the neuropathological changes preceding the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s
patients. Indeed, strong correlations between tau deposits measured by PET studies and
neurite density index measured by advanced diffusion techniques were reported. There was
also evidence of higher neurite dispersion in Alzheimer affected brain regions in addition to
diffusion tensor imaging findings. Correlations with cognitive measures and diffusion
parameters were also reported in a group of Alzheimer patients. Recent studies showed
abnormal CSF measures of β-amyloid and tau levels associated with widespread alterations in
white matter microstructures throughout the Alzheimer’s patients’ brains. Since CSF measures
are well established biomarkers for AD pathology, in vivo and non-invasive determined diffusion
parameters may convey AD related brain changes and predict future cognitive decline."
10939911,"Project Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by pathological processes that
occur many years before clinical symptoms manifest. One of the hallmark features of AD is the accumulation of
beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain. Detecting and quantifying Aβ burden is crucial for identifying individuals
at high risk of AD progression and evaluating the effectiveness of potential treatments. Currently, the primary
method for assessing Aβ burden is using radioactive positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. However, PET
imaging has several limitations, including high costs, limited spatial resolution, and constraints on frequent
measurements, which are essential for tracking changes over time and evaluating treatment outcomes. In
response to these limitations, this project sets out to develop and optimize an innovative magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) technique that is sensitive to pathological aggregates such as Aβ, with the goal of supplementing
the traditional amyloid PET. Under aim 1, the novel 3D MRI sequence will be implemented and optimized for
Aβ detection in the brain; Under aim 2, the signal generated from the saturation transfer MRI will be compared
to the uptake values of the amyloid PET for the whole brain and in key brain regions. Ultimately, our goal is to
deliver a clinically useful MRI method for Aβ detection. This method has the potential to reduce the need for
expensive PET scans, offering better motion tolerance, improved image quality, and increased sensitivity to
changes in Aβ aggregation size. Additionally, its non-invasive nature allows for repeat scans, enabling us to study
variability, reliability, and long-term changes in AD mechanisms."
10940682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondria play essential roles in eukaryotic cells. However, they are often subject to stress originated from
various sources, both intrinsic and extrinsic. In response to such stress, cells activate a diverse array of stress
response mechanisms collectively known as the mitochondrial stress response, aimed at restoring mitochondrial
homeostasis and preserving overall cellular fitness. Our recent work has uncovered a key mitochondrial stress
response pathway involving the integrated stress response (ISR), a cellular strategy for coping with diverse
stress conditions. Despite distinct triggering mechanisms, all the ISR pathways converge on the phosphorylation
of eIF2a by four stress-specific kinases (PKR, GCN2, HRI and PERK). This phosphorylation event leads to an
attenuation of global protein synthesis while upregulating the expression of stress response transcription factor
like ATF4. Our research has revealed an OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling cascade as a distinct link between
mitochondrial stress and the ISR, offering a unique therapeutic target for manipulating the ISR in disorders
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of how
cells integrate mitochondrial stress programs to maintain a homeostatic mitochondrial network. The long-term
goal of our lab is to comprehensively elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of the mitochondrial stress
response spanning from the molecular mechanisms of stress sensing and transmitting to the ultimate outcomes.
Recent findings by us and others highlighted critical roles of protein trafficking in sensing and relaying
mitochondrial stress. By leveraging reporter-based assays, CRISPR screens, reconstituted cell-free assays and
proteomics approaches, a primary objective of our lab is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing
protein dynamics during mitochondrial stress. While emerging as a primary mitochondrial stress response under
various stress conditions in a wide range of cell types, there remains a significant gap in understanding how the
OMA1-DELE1-HRI-mediated ISR integrates with other mitochondrial stress response programs to maintain
mitochondrial homeostasis. Another key objective of our lab is to systematically elucidate the intricate
mechanisms involved in maintaining a homeostatic mitochondrial network. Considering that mitochondrial
dysfunction is a major hallmark of numerous diseases such as primary mitochondrial diseases and
neurodegenerative diseases, our mechanistic investigations into the mitochondrial stress response are
anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of these pathological conditions and will potentially identify
novel therapeutic targets to mitigate their impacts."

Gene editing offers significant advantages for treating rare diseases since it edits the patient’s
own DNA. Thus, the normal regulatory environment of the gene is maintained, it can be used to
correct any gene regardless of gene size, and it generates edits that are expected to be more
durable than gene replacement approaches where loss of the episomal transgene may occur.
As next generation in vivo gene editing therapies advance towards clinical development,
preclinical studies are needed to assess long-term durability.
The gene editing therapy described in this application is designed to remove DMD exons 45-55
to restore the reading frame for 50% of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients while retaining
87% of the protein coding sequence. This is ~3x more of the coding sequence than gene
replacement therapies which deliver a “micro-dystrophin” and introduces fewer non-native
junctions. It also replicates a patient genotype associated with no symptoms or just a very mild
disease course.
Thorough preclinical efficacy of this gene editing therapy has been demonstrated in an
established humanized mouse mode of Duchenne at 2 months post-treatment. In this proposal,
efficacy will be compared in long-term 6-month studies versus short-term 2-month studies.
Molecular and functional efficacy outcomes will assess DMD editing, vector copy number per
cell, restoration of both the DMD gene product (dystrophin) and the dystrophin-associated
glycoprotein complex, muscle histology, and muscle function testing using two different non-
invasive assessments. Multiple dosing strategies will be compared, including a two-fold higher
single dose and a repeat dose at Days 0 and 56. This work will clarify the long-term durability of
gene editing efficacy and how it is influenced by dosing regimens. Learnings from this proposal
will have wide applicability to other gene editing therapies which target post-mitotic tissues like
muscle. These data will be included in future IND filings and will help advance development of
an innovative gene editing therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

Hazardous alcohol use is prevalent among men living with HIV (MLWH) in Uganda and associated with non-
adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and detectable viral load (VL). This is especially problematic in
serodiscordant partnerships with pregnant partners as HIV acquisition risk may increase by more than two-fold
during pregnancy and postpartum and incident HIV during this period also increases risk of vertical transmission
due to high maternal viral load during the acute phase of infection. Therefore, intervening on alcohol use and
ART adherence among MLWH with serodiscordant pregnant partners has the potential for tremendous public
health impact. To address the lack of evidence-based interventions (EBI) addressing alcohol use and HIV among
MLWH in Uganda, we developed, Kisoboka, a behavioral and structural intervention grounded in motivational
interviewing techniques and behavioral economics. The objective of this proposal is to adapt Kisoboka among
MLWH who engage in hazardous alcohol use with serodiscordant pregnant partners with the aim of extending
intervention reach to reduce risk of HIV acquisition in pregnancy. Candidate: I am a public health researcher
with 13 years of experience conducting HIV and alcohol use research in sub-Saharan Africa. I am applying for
a five-year K01 award to obtain the training, mentorship, and applied research experience needed to apply for
an R01 and become an independently funded public health researcher. Training: Under mentorship of Drs.
Susan Kiene (co-primary mentor, SDSU), Gregory Aarons (co-primary mentor, UCSD), Dvora Joseph Davey
(co-mentor, UCLA) and Judith Hahn (co-mentor, UCSF), this award will allow me to expand my capacity as a
researcher by supporting advanced training in (1) implementation science (IS), (2) conduct of intervention
research, (3) use of alcohol biomarkers and biofeedback counseling, and (4) collaboratively working in global
health settings. These training areas represent critical gaps in my skillset that will support my ability to ultimately
lead the implementation, evaluation and scale-up of culturally and contextually relevant EBIs to address the
syndemic of alcohol use and HIV. Research: specific aims: (1) Engage key stakeholders to co-adapt Kisoboka
for use with MLWH and their serodiscordant pregnant partners, (2) Use theater testing and iterative feedback
from multilevel stakeholders to refine the adapted intervention (3) Conduct a pilot randomized control trial (RCT)
in MLWH who use alcohol and have serodiscordant pregnant partners. With this award, I will strengthen my
capacity to rigorously conduct IS and intervention research, expedite the research pipeline and close the “know-
do” research gap on addressing this syndemic."
10928741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Locally advanced rectal cancer, defined by spread to lymph nodes or extension through the full rectal wall
thickness, is diagnosed in over 15,000 US patients yearly. Standard treatment for locally advanced rectal
cancer in the US involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiation, CRT) prior to surgical removal
of the entire rectum. Patients may experience undesirable post-surgical consequences such as permanent
colostomy or altered anorectal function. In light of this, much ongoing research focuses on strategies to avoid
surgical intervention in the subset of patients who might be cured with CRT alone. At the time of surgery, 10-
30% of tumors are eradicated by CRT (i.e., they demonstrate a pathologic complete response) while other
tumors show little to no response. This variability in response is incompletely understood, but likely relates to
the fact that one tumor may contain numerous different tumor cell subpopulations, all with different genotypes
and epigenetic (or non-genetic) features. These diverse subpopulations and variable genetic/epigenetic
features can interact, resulting in a dynamic and evolving tumor cell network that is poorly understood. In an
increasing number of cancers, there is evidence supporting the emergence of treatment-induced evolutionary
“traps,” or “collateral sensitivities”, where resistance to one therapy results in sensitivity to another therapy.
Whether this occurs in rectal cancer, and how to leverage it into treatment strategies, is unclear. To address
these questions, it is crucial to select a representative experimental model. Thus, the current proposal
leverages an already-established co-clinical pipeline from which patient derived tumor samples are used to
generate paired, patient-specific organoid and xenograft models. Two broad analytic approaches will be
undertaken to identify trends in CRT-induced tumor evolution and elucidate potential synergistic approaches to
improve CRT response. Specific Aim 1 will dissect CRT-induced changes using genomic, epigenomic, and
single cell profiling techniques, including an advanced method combining single cell RNA-seq with lineage
tracing. Specific Aim 2 employs an innovative iterative paired CRISPR/high throughput drug screen approach
to identify evolving collateral sensitivities in CRT-treated rectal cancer. To validate the findings in both Aims,
advanced patient-derived rectal cancer organoid and xenograft models will be utilized. Research, scientific
instruction, and career development will be supported by an expert panel of mentors and collaborators and a
structured training plan. Successful completion of both Aims will be promoted by the expertise and existing
screening and genomic infrastructure in the co-mentors’ laboratories and leverages a unique co-clinical
platform already established by close institutional collaborators. This research will establish a patient-derived
platform for interrogating CRT-induced tumor evolution, establishing a scientific niche to facilitate success
during the transition to scientific independence."

In this Fast Track SBIR application, NeuroDex, Inc. proposes to use its expertise in extracellular vesicle (EV)
immunoaffinity isolation to develop a blood test that detects synucleinopathies with high sensitivity, with the long-
term goal of helping clinicians identify patients for whom antipsychotic drugs are harmful and contraindicated.
Development and commercialization of a sensitive blood test for synucleinopathies would address a
major unmet need for selecting appropriate antipsychotic treatments that avoid severe adverse effect.
The proposed work leverages a proprietary procedure NeuroDex developed for isolating EVs from plasma using
immunoaffinity for cell-specific surface markers. Using this approach, the company demonstrated a > 20-fold
increase in signal to noise ratio of NDEs, a degree of specificity that is essential for analyzing aSYN because >
90% of aSYN in plasma does not originate in the brain and is not disease related. Previous efforts to measure
aSYN in unprocessed plasma have not yielded any diagnostic value, but measurement after NDE isolation
provides powerful classification. Leveraging this approach, NeuroDex has developed assays to test aSYN within
and on the surface of neuron-, microglia-, and oligodendrocyte-derived EVs. These assays successfully
distinguished 35 healthy controls, 51 PD patients, and 30 MSA patients with high accuracy. NeuroDex now
proposes to complete the discovery phase (Phase I) and conduct analytical and clinical validation (Phase II).
PHASE I—Aim 1. Identify final biomarkers to be included in the synucleinopathy detection panel. Using
195 samples from healthy individuals and patients with an array of autopsy-confirmed synucleinopathies, we will
assess the performance of different panels of the possible biomarkers to select the combination with the best
performance. Success Metric: ≥ 80% PPV for identifying patients with synucleinopathies and ≥ 90% NPV. Aim
2. Qualify the selected assays. Success Metrics: precision CoV ≤ 20%, linearity across 8-fold dilution range,
and LLQ compatible with clinical samples. Go/No Go Criterion for Progression to Phase II: Completion of the
discovery phase to include a defined set of biomarkers in a panel that a) provides ≥ 90% NPV and b) can be
measured in a robust manner (variability in precision and reproducibility <20%). PHASE II—Aim 1. Analytical
validation of the diagnostic assay. Milestones & Success Metrics: 1) Successful audits for CLIA lab SOP, 2)
analytical data package for FDA breakthrough designation submission. Aim 2. Preliminary clinical validation
of the diagnostic assay in a CLIA-certified lab. We will validate the assays with 700 samples from patients
with dementia with or without synucleinopathies and age-matched controls. Milestones & Success Metrics:
primary: NPV ≥ 90%; secondary: PPV ≥ 80%. Impact—Development and rigorous validation of a novel blood
test for differential diagnosis of dementia with synuclein pathology would produce a commercially-viable
diagnostic to inform appropriate treatment plans and clinical trial stratification for improved drug development."

 The overarching goal of the CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in the Science of Minority Health
and Health Disparities Program at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) is to provide
minority junior faculty with training and mentoring in health disparities and community-based participatory
research, empowering them to achieve the highest levels of scholarship on their respective pathways to
successful, independent careers as clinical research scientists. The ultimate goal is to improve the health of
racial/ethnic minority groups and reduce disparities. Achievement of this goal will be measured by the number
of trainees who successfully pursue long-term careers in clinical-translational, racial and ethnic disparities
research, including community-engaged research, and by the quality and quantity of their work.
 Component I is comprised of two years of an innovative structured mentoring and support for earning a Master
of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with added foci on the Science of Minority Health, Community-
Based Participatory Research, and Recruitment and Retention of Minority Underserved Populations for Clinical
and Epidemiological Research.
 Component II is comprised of pilot research projects that will enable participants to continue working toward
establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for
individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards.
 The CDU-CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training
infrastructure at CDU and UCLA, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education
and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies
from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD
agenda. The CDU-CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development
opportunities within the broader CDU science-generating “critical mass” by (1) focusing exclusively on urban
health disparities and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda
and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes
CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive
mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring
configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at
CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring
social determinants of health to the forefront of epidemiological and clinical research."

For many YBMSM, heavy drinking or problems related to alcohol use adversely impacts their HIV care and
treatment. Thus, interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes and reduce heavy drinking in HIV-infected
YBMSM in HIV treatment are urgently needed. Career Development Plan. Dr. Knox's training will include
developing critical skills in intervention research and implementation science, and substantive training in HIV
care and treatment. This will be achieved through a plan that includes seminars, workshops, coursework,
conferences, and tailored mentoring. These activities will help Dr. Knox become an independent investigator
with a research program focused on understanding and addressing HIV and alcohol use in vulnerable
populations. Research Plan. In Aim 1, Dr. Knox's proposed research involves conducting formative work to
inform the development of an intervention that addresses HIV treatment and alcohol use in heavy-drinking, HIV-
infected, YBMSM. The intervention will borrow components from two distinct and potentially complementary,
evidence-based clinic-based interventions that are brief and theory-driven. The first improves HIV treatment
outcomes in HIV-infected YBMSM by involving a member of their social network to support them in HIV care.
The second intervention addresses alcohol use by using smartphone technology to engage participants daily in
self-monitoring relative to drinking reduction goals formed during a brief, motivational component of the baseline
intervention session. In Aim 2, the information from this formative work will be synthesized with the help of
consultant workgroups made up of YBMSM and implementation partners. The product of Aims 1 and 2 will be
an innovative intervention that leverages both social network support and technology to improve HIV treatment
outcomes and reduce alcohol use in heavy-drinking, HIV-infected YBMSM. It will be administered as a single-
session baseline intervention with brief follow-up check-ins. In Aim 3, the new intervention will be pilot tested to
assess its potential efficacy, acceptability, feasibility and implementation against a randomly assigned control
condition among 60 heavy-drinking, HIV-infected YBMSM in an HIV clinic in New York City (NYC). As an
epicenter of the HIV epidemic, interventions for young, black MSM in HIV treatment are urgently needed in NYC.
The results of this pilot test will inform the development of an R01 proposal for a fully powered randomized
controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and implementation of the developed intervention. Mentorship. A team of
expert investigators in alcohol and drug use, HIV, racial and sexual minorities, intervention development,
implementation science and mixed methods will support this research. Public Health Impact. The project aims
to reduce disparities in HIV treatment outcomes and, in turn, incidence of new HIV infections, a high research
priority of the NIH Office of AIDS Research. Developing HIV interventions targeted for critical, underserved
populations also works towards achieving important End the HIV Epidemic milestones."

This proposed research addresses unresolved and fundamental questions in human evolutionary history and
the formation of genetic diversity. It contains three related research themes: (1) uncovering key features of
human population history and structure, both in the recent and ancient past, (2) determining factors influencing
selection across the genome and the limits to cross-population phenotypic prediction due to population history
and natural selection, and (3) modeling and predicting the genetic basis of complex traits under realistic
models of human evolutionary history, population structure and admixture. This work combines ambitious but
feasible methodological developments with new data from diverse worldwide populations.
Human evolutionary history is imprinted in the DNA of people living today. Learning this history involves the
combined efforts of theoretical, statistical, and empirical analyses. As the volume of genome sequencing data
grows, we have the opportunity to infer new details from key periods in our species’ evolution and clarify how
population biology and natural selection shape phenotypic and genetic variation. This requires developing
population genetic theory and computational methods that can handle data from many populations and large
sample sizes, and that simultaneously incorporate these many different factors that impact genetic diversity.
Over the next five years, my group will develop theoretical and methodological innovations that enable new
discoveries from human population genomic data, and we will uncover details of human history that resolve
important questions about our species’ evolution. This work builds on my lab’s expertise in population genetic
theory and simulation methods. Recent work shows that our newly developed approaches for modeling
diversity and linkage disequilibrium statistics are powerful to learn complex multi-population history. Combined
with newly sequenced high-quality genomic data, we will unravel early human evolution and reconstruct recent
admixture and demographic histories of Latin American populations. These models build genomic resources
for understudied populations and are essential to downstream studies to understand genetic components of
health and disease susceptibility. Our theoretical advances will enable new analyses of the combined effects of
selection and recombination in multiple populations, which we will use to understand fundamental limits to the
portability of phenotypic prediction across populations and in recently admixed groups. Finally, we will develop
approaches to predict the architecture of polygenic traits in structured and admixed populations, settings that
are most relevant for human genomic studies, but current methods fail to address. The mathematical and
statistical advances from this work will be developed into open source, maintained computational resources
that will facilitate genomic discoveries in our own research and that of others in the years to come."

Black Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than White Americans. The
biopsychosocial determinants of cognitive function, an early-stage component of the AD continuum, are less
understood in the Black population. Allostatic load (AL), an indicator of multisystem (e.g., nervous,
cardiovascular) physiological dysregulation driven by chronic psychosocial stress, may be one determinant of
poor cognitive function. The neighborhood is an emerging social determinant of cognitive function that may be
especially relevant for Black Americans given historical systems of socioeconomic and residential
disadvantage. Neighborhood disadvantage together with perceived neighborhood stressors may exacerbate
AL, to the detriment of cognitive function for midlife and older Black adults. The overall research objective is to
examine the relationship between AL and cognitive function and whether this association is impacted by both
neighborhood disadvantage [i.e., neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and Black-White segregation] and
perceived neighborhood stressors (i.e., high disorder and low social cohesion) within Black midlife and older
adults. Secondary, longitudinal data will come from the 2006-2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study,
a nationally representative study of health among the midlife and older (>50 years of age) US adult population.
Specific aims for this project include: (Aim 1) testing the relationship between AL and cognitive function using
baseline linear regression and growth curve models; (Aim 2) examining the moderating roles of neighborhood
SES and Black-White segregation on the relationship between AL and cognitive function to predict baseline
cognitive function and change over time using cross-sectional linear regression models and growth curve
models; and (Aim 3) analyzing the association between AL, perceived neighborhood stressors, and cognitive
function in baseline linear models and growth curve models stratified by levels of (1) neighborhood SES and
(2) Black-White segregation. The positive impact of the proposed research will be an increased understanding
of complex, multifactorial social-environmental and biological determinants of cognitive function among Black
Americans. Furthermore, by mentoring underrepresented students at Xavier University of Louisiana I will
contribute to increasing diversity in the aging research pipeline and expanding my university’s population
health and aging research capacity."

Rates of internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety) among youth have increased significantly over the past
decade. During this same time period, the use of social media (e.g., TikTok, Snapchat) has become nearly
ubiquitous, with 97% of adolescents using at least one platform. Despite growing public concern that social
media has contributed to the youth mental health crisis, little is known about how and for whom social media
use contributes risk for internalizing problems among adolescents. This study aims to identify specific
mechanisms of risk in the context of social media engagement, including youths’ uses of, beliefs about, and
emotional responses to social media. We will recruit a diverse sample of 200 youth (ages 13-16) with a full
range of internalizing symptoms for a four-wave, longitudinal study with assessments at baseline, 6-, 12-, and
18-month follow-up. Participants will engage in an innovative, online experimental eye-tracking task that
simulates peer interactions in a social media environment. At each time point, a real-time, collaborative social
media data collection procedure will be used and dimensional measures of internalizing symptoms collected.
We will also convene a youth advisory board to provide ongoing feedback and insight. The primary aims of this
study are to: (1) Identify social media experiences that increase adolescents’ risk for subsequent internalizing
symptoms, using an experimental, eye-tracking paradigm; (2) Test a longitudinal mediation model whereby
adolescents’ beliefs about social media predict high-risk social media engagement and subsequent
internalizing symptoms; and (3) Examine moderation effects by gender and age in the associations among
beliefs about social media, social media use, and internalizing symptoms (exploratory aim). This research will
offer new insights into the mechanisms of social media’s influence on adolescent internalizing symptoms. It will
identify novel, potentially-modifiable targets for future clinical, education, and public health interventions, and
will have immediate relevance for supporting youth in using social media in healthier ways."

Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder with a chronic course, affecting over three million people in the
country and several tens of millions worldwide. The available treatments for schizophrenia are only modestly
effective in improving the quality of life of these patients, partly due to the unclear neural mechanism of the
disorder. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in visual perception, in addition to its core clinical symptoms.
The visual system is among the most extensively studied systems in the brain. Therefore, it provides the
opportunity to borrow and combine different techniques from basic neuroscience, to investigate the relationship
between neural dysfunction and the perceptual deficits in schizophrenia, which is the aim of this proposal for a
K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. This proposal details a comprehensive
four-year training program for the applicant, who is a computational neuroscientist and a psychiatrist, to acquire
additional formal training and mentorship in human visual neuroscience and functional neuroimaging. To test his
hypotheses, the applicant will first carry out a series of visual psychophysical studies on schizophrenia patients
and normal control subjects, to track and localize the visual deficits in three consecutive stages of visual
processing in schizophrenia, namely contrast detection, orientation detection, and depth perception. The
hypothesis to be tested is that the deficits are pervasive at all three stages. Second, he will develop computer
simulations of biophysical models for the underlying neural structures of the above visual processing stages,
including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the primary, and the secondary visual cortices (V1 and V2,
respectively). He will then tune the parameters of the models to replicate the performance of each subject in the
above-mentioned stages, such that a personalized computational model will be developed for each subject.
Subsequently, he will compare the excitatory and inhibitory components of the biophysical models across
schizophrenia and control subjects, to test the hypothesis that a simultaneous reduction in both excitation and
inhibition accounts for the visual deficits in schizophrenia. Third, to further test the hypothesis that the perceptual
deficits are due to the hypoactivity and dysconnectivity within the underlying neural substrates, he will obtain
high resolution (7 Tesla) fMRI scans of LGN, V1, and V2 in schizophrenia and normal control subjects. He will
correlate the perceptual performance of the subjects in the three stages of visual processing with the activity
level and intrinsic functional connectivity of the underlying brain areas. The results of this research will yield a
mechanistic understanding of how dysfunctions at the circuit level can lead to distinct behavioral deficits in
schizophrenia. Such a mechanistic understanding will pave the way for identification of new therapeutic targets
for schizophrenia, and development of novel therapeutic agents. It could also potentially lead to identification of
objective biomarkers to assess response to treatment, and to facilitate early detection of this disease."

the genome from a single histological slide. There are three major methodologies of experimentally
implementing ST: the sequential in situ hybridization method, in situ sequencing method and spatial barcoding
method. Among these, the spatial barcoding method is the most straightforward, comprehensive and so far the
only method scalable for large amount of samples. The spatial barcoding method reveals both the RNA
sequence and their spatial locations by capturing tissue RNA using a spatially-barcoded oligonucleotide array.
The current spatial barcoding method, however, are intrinsically limited by their low resolution and low RNA
capture efficiencies; correspondingly, all currently available technologies failed to reveal the microscopic
details of the spatial transcriptome. We recently developed a technology named Seq-Scope, which overcomes
all these limitations. Seq-Scope has an effective resolution of 0.5-1 μm, and reveals over 20 transcripts per
μm2 area (~50 transcripts/μm2 estimated at library saturation). Both resolution and transcriptome capture
output of Seq-Scope are the best among all available technologies described in the literature so far. With this
unprecedented performance, Seq-Scope visualized spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at multiple histological
scales, including tissue zonation according to the portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and inflammation-
fibrosis (injured liver) axes, cellular components including single cell types and subtypes, and subcellular
architectures of nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria. Seq-Scope also has a potential to improve and
complement current scRNA-seq approaches. In response to the SenNet announcement, we propose to adapt
and utilize Seq-Scope to provide atlases of cellular senescence in multiple tissues during normal human aging,
focusing on the following three aims: (1) Identify and Characterize Hepatic Senescent Cell Population during
Liver Disease. (2) Characterize Age-Associated Changes of Hepatic Spatial Transcriptome. (3) Combine Seq-
Scope with Detection of Senescence Protein and Cell-type Marker Proteins.
For all aims, we will begin with analyzing mouse tissue to establish the feasibility of monitoring cell and tissue
senescence (UG3), and then expand the work in human tissues using the tissue obtained from diverse
resources including the SenNet tissue mapping center (TMC) (UH3). Seq-Scope is a versatile technology,
which is quick, straightforward, scalable and adaptable. Once optimized, a single researcher can process 5-10
frozen tissue blocks every week to generate a high-quality spatial single cell transcriptome data. Therefore, our
team is confident that we will be able to adapt our technology to any of the tissue systems that are provided by
the SenNet TMC in the UH3 phase."
10915720,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cellular senescence is a biological program whereby cells exit the cell cycle, typically as a consequence of DNA
damage accumulation. After exerting their beneficial effects in young individuals by playing a role in tissue
homeostasis, wound healing and tumor suppression, senescent cells are recognized and cleared by the immune
system in response to their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). With age, immunosurveillance
becomes increasingly dysregulated, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and their SASP leads to chronic
inflammation which has been linked to many age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration, diabetes,
osteoarthritis, fibrosis, heart disease and cancer. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy cause the
accumulation of senescent cells in both normal and cancer tissues and create a microenvironment which can
promote tumor relapse. Hence, methods to characterize the diversity of senescent cells in tissues are critical to
improve our understanding of their roles in both normal physiology and disease and to develop more precise
and effective senolytic and senostatic interventions. We propose to develop new technologies and integrative
solutions to map the spatial epigenomic, transcriptome and proteomic states of senescent cells and their
microenvironment in complex tissues. In the UG3 phase, we will develop spatial genomics, transcriptomics and
proteomics methodologies to delineate senescent cells in a diverse set of murine tissues, including brain, liver
and adipose tissue. We will also perform feasibility studies in a limited number of human samples available
through tissue banks and collaborators, and in human cell culture. Our goal is to provide a proof of principle and
evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of our proposed tools, technologies and methods (TTM) to identify and
characterize the heterogeneity of senescent cells in multiple tissues. In the HG3 phase, we will optimize and
expand our methodology to a variety of human tissues obtained from normal samples available from tissue
banks, and via collaborations with other SenNet Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs)."
10928329,"VIRGINIA ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH EQUITY AND ACTION DASHBOARD: COMMUNITY FRAMING OF
 EQUITY DATA TO SUPPORT CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
PROJECT SUMMARY
Disease burden, healthcare delivery, health outcomes, and life expectancy differ strikingly across US
populations and communities. Inequity is deeply rooted in the US healthcare system, and translational science
should study and address the structural biases that lead to disparities. To set priorities and focus research
where needed, translational science teams and communities need to co-create data systems that allow them
to identify health inequities and potential underlying causes; track trends, including the impact of their work;
and collaborate to develop priorities and solutions. The Wright Regional CCTS is a national leader at
developing census tract measures to inform research, training, care, and policy. Our CTSA hub has developed
the HealthLandscape Virginia geospatial and analytic data warehouse with novel community-level metrics that
span workforce, clinical care, community characteristics, social and economic factors, and health outcomes.
We have used HealthLandscape and a novel bright spot and community asset mapping analysis, a blend of
advanced analytics and community engagement, to identify communities that do better or worse than predicted
for opioid overdose deaths and potential causal factors. This approach needs to be expanded to a wider range
of equity issues. Building on existing data, analytics, strengths in community engagement, and HLVA platform,
we propose to develop the Virginia Accountable Health Equity and Action Dashboard (Va-AHEAD). Our work
will occur in four phases: (1) prioritize and co-create with the community new equity goals and measures, (2)
identify bright spot communities that do better than expected and factors that may contribute to their success,
(3) develop shared meaning, products, and action from the data, and (4) disseminate and support use of equity
content. To develop content, we will use unique person-level data (All-Payer Claims Database, state mortality
data), community-level data sources, and authentic community engagement grounded in community-based
participatory research and guided by our bright spot and community asset mapping approach. Content will be
configured in Va-AHEAD. For each equity topic, one of seven existing community advisory boards will support
content development and usability design of content. We will form a new Equity Research Opportunity lab, a
learning community to support use of the dashboard and products for equity research. Milestones to
demonstrate success include: (1) engage community partners to prioritize and coproduce content, (2) calculate
new equity measures, (3) identify bright and cold spot communities and their equity solutions and needs, (4)
engage researchers, learners, care team members, and policymakers to use the dashboard, and (5)
longitudinally track Va-AHEAD use and impact on translational science and equity outcomes. These efforts will
address a longstanding translational science need—new data and analytics for health equity research
determined by the communities that are experiencing inequities. The lessons and infrastructure emanating
from this project will produce a sustainable model that is scalable across the CTSA consortium."
10905521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen responsible for a wide variety of systemic and mucosal
infections. Immunocompromised individuals, including organ transplant recipients, AIDS patients and cancer
patients on chemotherapy are highly susceptible to infection. A morphological transition from yeast to
filamentous cells and the ability to respond to a wide variety of host environmental stresses are critical for
pathogenesis. While transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that mediate C. albicans filamentation
and stress responses have been well-characterized, considerably less is known about the role of translational
mechanisms. However, UME6, a key regulator of C. albicans morphogenesis, is controlled by a 5’ UTR-
mediated translational efficiency mechanism. The eIF4F translation initiation complex is important for binding
to the 5’ cap of mRNAs and contains helicase activity that unwinds complex secondary structures in 5’ UTRs to
promote ribosome accessibility. Fungal-specific C. albicans orthologs of the yeast eIF4E-binding proteins
(eIF4E-BPs) Eap1 and Caf20, which function as negative regulators of the eIF4F complex, were shown to
control morphogenesis and a variety of stress responses. Both C. albicans eIF4E-BPs are down-regulated in
response to membrane stress and orf19.7034 (the Eap1 ortholog) functions as a negative regulator of P-
bodies (translationally inactive cellular compartments) under multiple stress conditions. Orf19.7034 and the
eIF4E cap-binding protein, also control Ume6 protein levels in a 5’ UTR-dependent manner. Asc1, a key
virulence factor and phosphosignaling protein important for morphogenesis whose yeast ortholog forms a
complex with Eap1 to translationally control target genes, also regulates a variety of C. albicans stress
responses. We show genetic interactions between Asc1 and eIF4E-BPs with respect to control of morphology,
biofilm formation and/or stress responses. Using ribosome profiling, C. albicans morphogenesis and response
to the drug stress fluconazole were also shown to be under widespread global translational regulation that
does not simply parallel transcriptional control. Based on this evidence, and additional studies, our hypothesis
is that Asc1 and eIF4E-BPs function together to translationally regulate C. albicans morphology, stress
responses and virulence by modulating activity of the eIF4F complex in response to host environmental cues.
To address this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) determine how Asc1 and eIF4E-BPs control the ability to respond to
host filament-inducing and environmental stress conditions, 2) determine the mechanism by which Asc1 and
eIF4E-BPs control C. albicans morphogenesis and Ume6 expression, 3) determine the functional relationship
between Asc1 and eIF4E-BPs with respect to regulation of C. albicans target gene expression, pathogenesis
and virulence. These studies will provide a better understanding of translational mechanisms that control the
response of C. albicans to a variety of filament-inducing and host environmental stress conditions, and could
ultimately provide information leading to the development of new and more effective antifungals strategies."

10908415,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RP1
Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) but
is available to only <20% of patients. For the 20%-30% of patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced
(BR/LA; involving major abdominal vasculature) PDAC, neoadjuvant therapy with induction chemotherapy, with
or without radiotherapy, is the emerging standard. This sequence with chemotherapy up-front provides the
opportunity to downstage tumors to allow curative resection. Importantly, early treatment of micrometastatic
disease helps select patients who are likely to benefit from surgery and spares unnecessary surgery in those
who would not benefit.
Evidence to date supports neoadjuvant therapy, but a more-structured, comprehensive approach is needed,
which requires rigorous prospective evaluation. Moreover, there are currently no biomarkers that reliably predict
treatment response or resistance. This knowledge is essential to appropriately select patients who will benefit
from specific treatment regimens and to modulate treatment for individual patients.
We will evaluate the efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) combining novel triplet chemotherapy with
ablative-dose radiotherapy (AD-XRT), given before surgery, in a phase II trial (Aim 1). This trial will assess the
promising 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin + liposomal-irinotecan + oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX) regimen, administered
entirely up-front for 4 months, followed by AD-XRT (biological equivalent dose of 100 Gy, delivered in 15-25
fractions, with capecitabine as radiosensitizer). The primary endpoint is event-free survival, with events defined
as progression, recurrence after surgery, or death.
Toward the development of biomarkers of treatment response after TNT, we will assess the potential of (Aim
2A) radiomics analysis of CT images and (Aim 2B) functional FDG-PET and novel immunoPET using 89Zr-
HuMab-5B1 that recognizes cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) to monitor treatment response, assess surgical
resectability, and predict survival. Using blood samples collected on the trial, we will also evaluate circulating
tumor DNA (measured by MSK-ACCESS targeted sequencing) and serum CA19-9 for the same purpose (Aim
3).
This clinical trial aims to define TNT as a new treatment standard for BR/LA PDAC. The planned correlative
studies promise to identify noninvasive biomarkers of response after TNT that may be rapidly translated to the
clinic to allow adaptive disease management. As patients with BR/LA PDAC stand to benefit greatly from
improvements in treatment and monitoring, because of the opportunity to enable curative resection, this project
will likely have a major impact on outcomes in PDAC overall."
10909114,"Summary/Abstract
Mammalian sperm acquire fertilization capacity as they transit through the
reproductive tract in a process known as capacitation. During capacitation, sperm
change their motility pattern and become competent to undergo an acrosome
reaction and fertilize an oocyte. These capacitation-associated processes require
energy, and sperm are dependent on nutrients in their environment to complete
them. Sperm are exposed to different nutrients in their surroundings as they pass
from being stored in the cauda epididymis to the fallopian tube where they will meet
and fertilize the oocyte. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated that
sperm supplied with exogenous glucose generate ATP via glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation, and glucose utilization via both pathways increases in
capacitating sperm. In addition, we found that capacitating sperm alter activity
through the pentose phosphate pathway and sperm deprived of exogenous
nutrients can metabolize endogenous energy sources. We now propose to apply
modern metabolite profiling combined with metabolic flux analyses to identify how
sperm coordinately regulate their metabolic pathways and leverage different
exogenous nutrients as they mature through distinct activation states. Soluble
adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is essential for the molecular changes observed during
capacitation, and we will use our unique tools for modulating its activity to test the
hypothesis that sAC regulates the metabolic changes induced by capacitation."

Premature infants have low nephron number (endowment) and are at high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and end stage renal disease as adults. Most nephrons are added late in gestation through a poorly understood
process called lateral branch nephrogenesis (LBN). As direct study of late gestation human kidney development
is difficult, the non-human primate model (rhesus macaque) was recently identified as a suitable model to bridge
this knowledge gap. The long-term goal is to apply the molecular findings of LBN in the non-human primate
model towards development of therapeutic methods aimed at extending nephrogenesis in preterm infants. The
central hypothesis is that a shift in the signaling milieu involving components of the developing kidney (nephron
progenitor cells (NPC), ureteric bud (UB), and stroma) results in sustaining LBN over multiple weeks in late
gestation. The rationale for this proposed research is that the genetically tractable non-human primate model
system can be used to test hypotheses and apply therapeutic interventions aimed at improving human nephron
endowment. The central hypothesis will be tested by using the latest molecular technologies to understand the
molecular mechanism sustaining LBN in the non-human primate, including single-cell RNA sequencing, laser
capture microdissection with RNA sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus ATAC
sequencing. Preliminary morphologic study on the postnatal day two marmoset kidney identified a single ureteric
stalk with lateral branches consistent with LBN, suggesting the common marmoset could be used as a genetically
tractable primate model. Expected outcomes include assembly of the largest primate late gestation developing
kidney molecular dataset and identification of genes and pathways enriched and regulatory networks active
during LBN, as well as identification of a genetically tractable model to study LBN to understand why prematurity
leads to early cessation of nephrogenesis in humans, and how to extend it. These results are expected to have
a positive impact on the current understanding of late gestation human nephrogenesis by identifying molecular
pathways and potential therapeutic interventions for those born prematurely. In addition to the aims outlined in
this proposal, career development plans include didactic training in molecular biology and bioinformatics through
the Certificate program in Bioinformatics, wet-lab experience with the latest molecular technologies and multi-
omic platforms, and career advancement through a selected advisory committee for transition to independence

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and arises predominantly from
developing B-cell precursors. B-cell ALL (B-ALL) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children,
and B-ALL survivors face long-term therapy-related morbidities. Moreover, B-ALL disproportionately impacts
children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, who have the highest risk of disease and inferior patient outcomes
compared to non-Hispanic white children. Prevention of B-ALL remains an essential goal, to mitigate childhood
mortality and suffering and to reduce disparities, and this necessitates an understanding of the disease’s root
causes. Paramount to this will be elucidating the mechanisms of genetic predisposition to B-ALL. Previous
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 15 risk loci associated with childhood B-ALL,
but in most cases the causal variants have not been identified. Our proposal aims to integrate results from a
large multi-ancestry GWAS of childhood ALL with single-cell epigenomic data followed by targeted base editing
in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), to pinpoint causal variants and discern their impact on
normal human B cell development. Through this innovative and collaborative approach, we hypothesize that we
will uncover mechanistic insights into the root causes of B-ALL development that could inform future preventive
strategies. In our first aim, we will conduct a multi-ancestry GWAS followed by statistical fine-mapping analysis
of known B-ALL risk loci using existing genotype data. These results will be integrated with single-cell accessible
chromatin data spanning human hematopoiesis and B cell development using the SCAVENGE method we have
developed previously, to identify specific B cell developmental stages that underlie B-ALL predisposition and to
identify causal variants at each B-ALL risk locus. In our second aim, we will generate new single-cell multi-omic
data, including from joint scRNA- and scATAC-seq in single cells, from human HSPCs undergoing B cell
differentiation in vitro. These data will enable regulatory mapping in cells across B cell development, including
rare intermediate cells, and will be used to map relevant cell states and target genes for the fine-mapped B-ALL
risk variants. Finally, in our third aim, we will investigate the functional impact of B-ALL risk variants using genome
editing. We will prioritize six causal variants from our other mapping approaches, including variants in ARID5B
and GATA3 that have previously been identified as causal and that contribute to the increased B-ALL risk in
Hispanic/Latino children. We will recreate these six variants individually and in specific combinations via base
editing in human HSPCs from multiple donors that will then be subject to B cell differentiation and investigate
their effects on B cell development and on illegitimate V(D)J recombination, a known driver of B-cell
leukemogenesis. Our innovative variant-to-function mapping approach will reveal the precise mechanisms
through which B-ALL association loci may increase a child’s risk of developing leukemia and may highlight novel
therapeutic targets and inform future approaches for childhood leukemia prevention."

Rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of clinical isolates are crucial to ensure early
appropriate treatment and prevent misuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Both phenotypic (i.e., growth,
inhibition, or killing event-based) and molecular (i.e., resistant gene or molecule-based) ASTs are routinely used in
the hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. The limitations of molecular methods (e.g., qPCR, MALDI-TOF MS)
include their narrow scope (i.e., select resistance genes/molecules), or in some cases the inability to predict
antimicrobial susceptibility, while phenotypic methods involve time-consuming, multi-step expansion culture resulting
in prolonged time to result, which can delay appropriate treatment decisions. This proposal leverages an exclusive
liquid repellency (ELR) based under-oil open microfluidic system for a transformative approach to next-generation
phenotypic ASTs. With a multidisciplinary team including clinicians, microbiologists/pharmacologists, surface
scientists, and bioengineers, we outline three aims for the development of this next-generation, phenotypic AST
system. The ELR-based AST system aims to meet the following criteria: i) direct AST using the original clinical
isolates (e.g., from blood, sputum, urine, abscess) to eliminate time-consuming expansion culture and passage-
associated selection bias ex vivo, ii) comprehensive test coverage including anaerobes, multispecies communities,
heteroresistance (i.e., resistant mutants within the wild-type population), and iii) rapid AST with the goal of sample
to report in less than 4 hours. In Aim 1 we propose to develop ELR-centrifugation and small-volume (
μ
l scale)
lossless sample processing for isolation, enrichment, and preparation of sparse (i.e., 1-100 cfu/ml) bacteria from
whole blood. The goal is to directly isolate and enrich bacteria from whole blood without expansion culture. We will
combine the lossless sample processing enabled by ELR with lysis-centrifugation to maximize the recovery yield of
bacteria (> 90%) from whole blood. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate compatibility of ELR AST with intrinsic fluorescence
label free imaging modalities and deep learning-based identification. The goal is to develop and apply proof-of-
concept advanced label-free, single-cell resolution, live-cell imaging, and deep learning algorithms to integrate
bacterial detection, species identification, and antimicrobial screening thereby eliminating isolate passage
expansion. In Aim 3 we propose to develop label-free, direct detection of heteroresistance in priority human
pathogens in clinical isolates. The goal is to detect heteroresistance [i.e., a small/rare subpopulation (e.g., <1%) of
resistant mutants in clinical isolates], which cannot be identified by standard clinical methods. We will utilize sweep
distribution to array small numbers of bacteria directly from clinical isolates, thus enabling the detection of
these heteroresistant mutants. The outcomes of this project will address many gaps in the current AST landscape
and develop a next-generation AST platform with the potential for rapid adoption in many clinical settings."
10939707,"The development of modern medicines relies on the ability to access compounds that are potent, selective,
and ideally curative. To achieve these goals, chemists have sought to prepare evermore complex structures in
search of nuanced activity and selectivity profiles, advances dependent on the availability of tools and strategies
to synthesize such compounds in an economical and scalable fashion. Complex natural products have
traditionally inspired the development of such tools, often acting as key milestones in the advancement of organic
synthesis and as vital medicines in their own right. However, at the apex of complexity, their structures continue
to test the limits of current capabilities: highly intricate targets are prepared only through enormous effort in terms
of man-years and number of synthetic operations, often only in a target-specific manner.
 Here, we propose to utilize such compounds as vehicles for the discovery of complexity-generating tools and
tactics. We outline approaches to several families of natural products built upon two distinct complexity-building
strategies: dearomative transformations of readily available aromatic compounds and desymmetrization of
simple symmetrical precursors. In the former case, aromatic feedstocks – available as petroleum byproducts or
from renewable biomass – represent a versatile synthesis platform given well-established, predictable modes
for their functionalization. We seek to deploy these materials in complexity-building dearomative reactions,
disrupting their otherwise stable aromatic systems and transforming their flat sp2-scaffolds into sp3-rich
compounds containing multiple stereogenic centers. Specifically, we propose to utilize the regiodivergent
oxidative coupling of simple bisphenolic compounds to access the structural complexity inherent to the
quassinoids, a family of potent anticancer terpenoids. Our synthesis platform will leverage the built-in oxidation
of the aromatic systems to encode for much of the sp3-skeletal oxidation in these highly oxidized terpenoids,
providing a unique means to access these targets and analogues, and illuminate their biological mode of action.
 In a symmetry-breaking transformation, we will develop new photochemistry of pyridinium ions to provide
convenient access to highly functionalized cyclopentane building blocks, in particular via enantioselective
desymmetrization of symmetrical allylic cation intermediates. We will apply these intermediates to the
asymmetric synthesis of pactamycin-type aminocyclopentitols, highly potent antiparasitic agents. We will also
develop a related approach to two subclasses of the Lycopodium alkaloids, which include central nervous
system-active compounds, built upon two sequential photochemical dearomatizations of a simple quinoline.
 Overall, such discoveries will open up new areas of complex chemical space from simple aromatic or
symmetrical precursors, providing natural products and designed analogues for interrogation of biological
function. These studies will lead to innovations in dearomatization and desymmetrization chemistry, afford novel
chemotypes for disease treatment, and provide tool compounds that may lead to new discoveries in biology."

and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."

My lab develops statistical methods to characterize genetic architecture and to translate genetic data into
biological insights. We are broadly interested in rare variant genetic architecture and its relationship with that of
common variants. A particular area of focus is on rare protein coding variation and its functional consequences.
 Among all known rare-variant associated genes, the majority are driven by protein truncating variants
(PTVs). PTVs are consistently deleterious, which is a benefit for association testing, but they make up <10% of
coding variants; other types of coding variants – missense, splice site, UTR variants – are functionally
heterogenous, with a spectrum of effects including loss, gain and change of function. Their functional
heterogeneity poses a challenge when integrating them into existing statistical methods, but it also presents an
opportunity biologically. This application focuses on the question: what is the relationship between the
functional effect of a mutation and its phenotypic effect on individuals?
 Proteins and protein coding variants are richly annotated. Variant effect prediction (VEP) has emerged
as one of the most successful applications of artificial intelligence in biology; for missense variants alone, at
least five sophisticated models (EVE, gMVP, ESM-1b, primateAI-3D, and alphaMissense) have been published
in 2021-2023, with clear implications for association testing. Other functional annotations as well – including
protein structure predictions, predicted effects on protein binding, and experimental measurements of variant
effects – complement VEP methods by capturing the functional heterogeneity of equally pathogenic alleles.
 We aim to understand the relationship between the functional and phenotypic effects of protein coding
variation by integrating genetic association data with a wide range of protein coding functional annotations. We
will identify and characterize functionally informed allelic series: multiple independently associated alleles in
a gene, whose heterogenous phenotypic effects align with their functional properties. To do so, we will use two
complementary approaches, focusing on individual genes and on the exome as a whole. By analyzing
individual genes with long, statistically unambiguous allelic series, we will identify functional annotations that
are relevant, and we will learn how genes differ from each other in the functional effects of trait-associated
variants within them. Then, we will analyze the functional architecture of protein-coding variation using the
functionally informed allelic series model, which integrates any number of structural or functional annotations
with genetic association data for one or more traits.
 In GWAS, the combination of genetic association data with regulatory annotations – using integrative
statistical methods – has been among the most productive sources of biological insight, both in genome-wide
scans and in the dissection of individual loci. We envision that in rare variant association studies, their
integration with functional annotations, using sophisticated statistical methods, will be similarly vital."
10940931,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has financial incentive programs where families in
SNAP can purchase fruits and vegetables (F&V), for half the price or less, at select sites. These programs
increase F&V consumption and can save billions of dollars in healthcare costs; yet, limited awareness and uptake
presents a major barrier to widespread utilization and limits potential impact. This study will leverage pediatric
clinics to increase awareness and uptake of a SNAP F&V incentive program in South Carolina to improve parent-
child diet quality, reduce food and nutrition insecurity, and lower disease risk. Social drivers of health screenings
in pediatric clinics will be leveraged to identify of parents, with a child 2-10 years of age, who are food insecure
and enrolled in SNAP. All eligible families will receive brief education on a SNAP F&V incentive program from
their pediatrician during their clinic visit. After the visit, dyads (N=296) will be randomized to: 1) Veggie Vouchers
(Intervention) or 2) Education-only, wait-list control group (Control). Randomization will occur on a rolling basis
at the individual level. The intervention group will then receive an electronic voucher for 3 free F&V boxes at a
community organization that participates in a state-wide SNAP F&V incentive program as a “free trial” of this
program. Each voucher can be redeemed for a F&V box that contains a variety of produce and recipe cards.
Families can redeem 1 voucher every 2 weeks, for 6 weeks of free F&Vs. After voucher redemption, parents can
continue purchasing these F&V boxes for steeply discounted prices using their SNAP card. Home delivery of
F&V boxes will be offered for the intervention group during the full study duration; thus, boxes provided during
the 6-week “free trial” and subsequent boxes purchased using their SNAP card will be eligible for home delivery.
This service is being offered to overcome prominent access barriers to participating in this SNAP program.
Voucher redemption rates and subsequent F&V box purchasing will be objectively tracked via an online portal.
Assessments will occur at baseline, post-voucher redemption (6 weeks), and two follow-up time periods (18 and
30 weeks). The primary outcome will be changes in child diet quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI] scores) from
baseline to 30-weeks. Secondary outcomes include changes in parent HEI, household food insecurity, nutrition
insecurity, and SNAP F&V incentive program use, across timepoints. Mixed methods will systematically assess
data from a detailed process evaluation, key informant interviews, and community advisory board feedback to
determine barriers/facilitators to intervention implementation and sustainability and inform future dissemination.
If effective, this study will yield crucial knowledge on leveraging pediatric clinics to increase knowledge of existing
SNAP F&V incentive programs, while incentivizing use and minimizing access barriers. Data will inform future
efforts to maximize the impact of these programs and policies to fund these strategies more broadly. This study
has strong potential for substantial public health impact and directly aligns with the priorities set by the White
House and the National Institutes of Health to promote nutrition security and reduce chronic disease risk."
10906828,"Opportunity/Gap:
A core tenet of the “Biodesign innovation process,” as well as other human-centered design methodologies, is
the importance of innovators seeing first-hand the challenges they aim to solve. This exposure not only
provides a more complete appreciation of the problem at hand, but also allows innovators to use their
perspective as an “outsider” to glean unique insights that may be missed by those who experience a problem
daily. It is these first-hand observations of latent needs that often seed disruptive and meaningful innovations
that are vital in improving the quality and affordability of healthcare.
Today, the existing undergraduate courses in Bioengineering (and otherwise) at Stanford do not include a
robust needs finding curriculum or opportunities for students to directly participate in observing needs in clinical
practice.
Proposal:
Stanford Biodesign, in partnership with the Bioengineering Department and its capstone course team, as well
as with clinical collaborators across the School of Medicine, would like to guide and mentor undergraduate
students in an approach to needs identification that includes direct clinical observations along with need
research, need characterization, and clinical validation interviews. We believe these skills will be invaluable in
preparing student innovators to pursue careers in health technology whether in academia, medicine,
engineering, or business.
We propose to structure this as a part-time summer program (~6-10 hours/week), targeted at rising
Bioengineering seniors who are on campus for funded summer research experiences and can bring this
experience to their capstone course/team in the Fall.
Accordingly, we propose the following aims: (1) Develop a course curriculum for undergraduate students to
learn to identify and characterize clinical needs. (2) Develop assessment tools for evaluation of student
learning of the needs-identification and needs-characterization process. (3) Implement and document summer
training program through iterative development and assessment."
10906829,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Following on a very successful launch of this training program at the University of California
Berkeley, the purpose of this renewal project is to continue providing high level training
workshops for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty interested in
acquiring formal demography skills. Formal demography consists of a set of analytic tools that
allow for a kind of analysis not possible with standard statistical models and are therefore critical
in addressing the kinds of complex population processes occurring in the 21st century. We build
on the success of the first 5-year cycle, and introduce new workshop content by having a yearly
special emphasis topic chosen to connect formal demography to important and newly emerging
areas of demographic research. Pedagogically, we will modernize the workshop format by
adding pre-workshop remote learning, on-site team projects, and a new generation of
instructors. The proposed program consists of three weeks of guided independent study prior to
the workshop, a weeklong workshop in Berkeley – three days of training followed by a two-day
research conference; and an annual networking event at Population Association of America
meetings. The three days of core training will include instruction on population dynamics and
hands-on training in modern demographic computing (in the R statistical modeling language). A
third day will include training and methods specific to that year's special emphasis topic. These
workshops not only serve as training grounds, but also provide ample opportunities for
networking and building relationships and community. During the week, trainees will also work
on group projects to give them ample hands-on experience with the data and methodology, and
results of these projects are presented on the final day of the workshop. The topics covered in
the workshops include the continuation of core topics in the mathematical modeling of fertility
and mortality, with the addition of new themes in population models of contagious diseases,
impact of climate change on demography, and digital demography. These elements – training,
research presentations, group projects, networking – work to create a long-lasting community of
scholars that can engage in interdisciplinary research for years to come. In this way we expect
that the topics of these studies will serve to inform demographic and social science research
and have positive impacts in particular on population health policies."
10906830,"Project Summary: Significance: South Africa has the highest number of adolescents living with HIV in the
world with KwaZulu-Natal the epicenter, yet adolescents are poorly prepared for transition from pediatric to adult
services as evidenced by poor retention in care and viral suppression after transition. In-person and mHealth
adolescent-friendly interventions have potential to remedy the disparities for adolescents living with HIV in low
to middle income countries but larger, powered randomized trials are needed. Differentiated care: Transition
readiness assessments can be used to identify the more vulnerable adolescents and focus resources on
adolescents who would benefit most from additional interventions. Innovation: This study is the first study to
evaluate interventions to support transition from pediatric to adult care for adolescents living with HIV in sub-
Saharan Africa. mHealth has not previously been used to address the critical transition period for adolescents
living with HIV. We hypothesize that in-person or mHealth adolescent-friendly interventions will improve viral
suppression for adolescents living with HIV with low to intermediate transition readiness as they transition to
adult care. We also hypothesize that mHealth interventions can provide equal benefits to in-person interventions
with lower costs, broader reach, and easier adoption. Approach: Using a Type I hybrid effectiveness-
implementation design, we will evaluate the effectiveness of in-person or mHealth delivered adolescent-friendly
transition interventions for adolescents living with HIV with low to intermediate transition readiness. Using a
stepped-wedge, delayed implementation randomized clinical trial design we will measure the effectiveness of
the interventions compared to standard of care on viral suppression and retention in care (Aim 1).
Simultaneously, we will use the RE-AIM framework to measure the implementation factors associated with the
implementation strategies of peer educators as clinic champions and audit and feedback (Aim 2). We will also
determine if the interventions lead to changes in transition readiness scores and their underlying domains for
future targeted interventions further differentiating care based on transition readiness (Aim 3). Investigators:
Multiple Principal Investigators: Brian Zanoni has been working in adolescent HIV in South Africa since 2006,
has received NIH funding through an R21 to develop the transition readiness assessment and K23 to develop
and pilot the mHealth intervention used in this proposal. Monerndran Archary is an expert in pediatric and
adolescent HIV in South Africa. He and Dr. Zanoni have been working together since 2011 in developing
transition readiness assessments and interventions to improve adolescent transition care. Co-investigators:
Maryam Shahmanesh is an expert in clinical trials among youth in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Jessica
Haberer is an expert in the development and implementation of mHealth interventions for people living with HIV.

10906834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Venous thromboembolism disorders represent the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular
disease. Despite the addition of catheter directed thrombolysis to standard anticoagulation therapy, recurrent
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent post-thrombotic-syndrome (PTS), where the signs and symptoms
of DVT persist or worsen with thrombus resolution, still cause long term disability. Thus, a better understanding
of the basic mechanisms of DVT formation and resolution is needed.
In order for a DVT to form, endothelial cell (EC) injury must occur. Recently, the EC glycocalyx (eGCX), a
membrane bound mesh of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and associated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), has come
into focus as a multifunctional surface layer capable of regulating vasodilation, inflammation, proliferation, and
coagulation pathways. The 3 most prominent eGCX GAGs, heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and
hyaluronan (HA), have been associated with binding sites for anti-thrombin, heparin cofactor II, and non-
circulating factor XI (FXI). GAG binding of these critical coagulation components suggests an ambiguous
and currently unclarified role for GAGs in thrombus formation and resolution, warranting further
mechanistic investigation.
The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanistic role by which the eGCX regulates DVT formation and
resolution. My hypothesis maintains that an injured eGCX will bolster DVT formation by increasing platelet-EC
interactions and activating the intrinsic clotting pathway, via release of non-circulating FXI. Furthermore, the
injured eGCX will impair DVT resolution by increasing inflammatory (M1) monocyte infiltration into the thrombus
and the vein wall. In Aim 1, I will determine the role of eGCX GAGs in platelet activation and thrombus formation
using a caval constriction DVT model in wildtype CD1 mice. In Aim 2, I will determine the role of eGCX GAGs
in causing post-thrombotic vein wall changes. This study will potentially identify relevant therapeutic targets that
directly affect DVT formation and resolution, paving the way for interventional studies and supporting the
rationale for the development of selective, safe, and effective antithrombotic agents. These studies will be
performed at Oregon's primary academic medical center, the Oregon Health and Science University in the
Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Vascular Surgery under the co-mentorship of Dr. Monica Hinds,
PhD and Dr. Khanh Nguyen, MD. The PI is supported by a mentorship team of senior scientists and physicians
with expertise in vascular pathophysiology, thrombosis, and vascular surgery. Career development activities
include training in mouse surgery, in vitro and in vivo analysis techniques, and coagulation and vascular
pathophysiology, as well as training in communication and leadership skills. This training is designed to support
the PI's career goals of becoming a physician-scientist with a long-term career goal of leading a productive and
translational vascular pathophysiology laboratory with a tightly integrated vascular surgery practice."
10906835,"Based upon epidemiological data and interventional studies in invertebrates and rodents, metformin is a
leading candidate to modulate aging. Yet, these animal studies have limited applicability to human subjects
because they usually are of short duration and apply metformin doses that are much higher than the doses used
in humans. Thus, the impact that metformin has on aging-focused outcomes and the mechanism by
which metformin may promote healthy life extension in older human subjects is unknown.
 This grant application targets RFA-AG-20-044 “The Biological Mechanisms of Metformin Effects on Aging
and Longevity” to test the hypothesis that metformin modulates critical pillars of aging in older adults to improve
healthspan. We will leverage our ongoing NIA-funded randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin to
prevent frailty in older adults (R01AG052697). The parent trial (n=120) is testing whether metformin
administration for 24 months can prevent or delay the onset of frailty in older (≥ 65 years) adults. Deep aging-
focused phenotyping includes changes in frailty (Fried phenotype score and Rockwood deficit accumulation
index), physical function (short physical performance battery and 6-minute walk), muscle strength/mass, glucose
metabolism (insulin clamping and glucose tolerance) and cognition (Mini-Mental State Exam). The parent trial
also collects several biospecimens including blood, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue before and during
metformin/placebo administration for measures of metabolic (AMPK and insulin signaling) and inflammation
(NFκB and MAPKs) pathways.
 By applying innovative metabolomic, proteomic, molecular and biostatistical methodologies we will take
advantage of these rich phenotypic data and biospecimens to evaluate the effect of metformin on 1)
mitochondrial function; 2) cellular senescence; 3) epigenetics (DNA methylation), which will be in addition to the
pillars of aging studied in the parent grant (metabolism and inflammation). Our objectives are:
Aim 1) To determine the effect of metformin on pillars of aging in older adults.
Aim 2) To determine the link between metformin-induced modifications in pillars of aging and changes
in aging-focused phenotypic outcomes.
 We have assembled an interdisciplinary group across three institutions (UTHSCSA, Mayo, UCLA) that is well
poised to help clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which metformin promotes healthy life extension."
10906841,"Project Summary/Abstract
 While both ticks and tick-borne disease agents have rapidly become a serious and growing threat to human and
veterinary public health, mounting evidence indicates that many tick-borne diseases due to rickettsial infection may be
under-reported in Northern America because of their uncharacteristic symptoms in humans and domestic animals. Ixodes
pacificus is a principal vector for pathogenic and endosymbiotic bacteria on the Pacific West Coast of the United States.
Compared to pathogenic rickettsiae identified in other tick species in California, the ecology and biology of pathogenic
rickettsiae in I. pacificus remains largely unexplored. Our lab detected a novel Rickettsia species, Rickettsia species
phylotype G022, in questing adult ticks of I. pacificus in three counties of Northern California in 2011, 2013, and 2020.
Due to phylotype G022’s low prevalence (2-4.5%) in adult I. pacificus and published phylogenetic trees placing the
bacterium within other pathogenic spotted fever group rickettsiae, our hypothesis is that phylotype G022 is a pathogenic
Rickettsia. The proposed study ultimately serves as a continuation of our previous findings regarding the ecology and
pathogenesis of Rickettsia species in I. pacificus. Our research pursues the following specific aims: 1) We will conduct a
survey to estimate the prevalence of Rickettsia species phylotype G022 in nymphal ticks of I. pacificus by collecting the
nymphs from the field and detecting the bacterium by real-time PCR; 2) We will study transmission routes of Rickettsia
species phylotype G022 in I. pacificus by collecting all life stages of the ticks via feeding on New Zealand white rabbits
and detecting the bacterium by real-time PCR; 3) We will perform the propagation and isolation of the Rickettsia
phylotype G022 isolate from I. pacificus using tick embryonic cell lines and limiting dilution assay; 4) We will perform
the molecular typing of the Rickettsia species phylotype G022 isolate by Multilocus Sequence Typing; 5) We will
investigate the presence of Rickettsia species phylotype G022 infection in domestic dogs from Northern California. This
study will not only result in the official naming of phylotype G022 by typing the pure bacterial isolate, but also enable us
to start gathering data on transmission dynamics of the bacterium as well as its potential pathogenicity, the long-term
research goal of our lab, to humans and animal hosts in Northern California."
10906842,"Reproductive aging is a major health, personal and societal issue, but ovarian aging has received limited
scientific attention, even in large genomic survey projects. Ovarian aging influences diverse health outcomes in
women including lifespan, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders and
various types of cancer. Yet the molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian aging, timing of menopause and
inter-organ feedback loops remain elusive. As one of the most dynamic organs in the human body, the ovary
undergoes significant remodeling across the entire reproductive period. The dynamic transcriptional regulation
of and interactions between oocytes and their surrounding cells during aging remain unknown. The objective of
this proposal is to understand the regulatory landscapes underlying the complex interplay among the different
cell types in the ovary and to investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the remarkably complex
processes of reproductive aging. We will apply powerful single-cell (sc) RNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis to
define specific transcriptional programs and regulated enhancer networks that are altered in distinct ovarian cell
types or subtypes during aging. By defining the roles of specific enhancers in specific cell types, and how these
change with aging, we aim to understand the identities of the regulatory factors and environmental signals that
impact aging in each ovarian cell type. Genetic variation affecting enhancer selection and function is a major
determinant of differences in cell-specific gene expression between individuals. To investigate the mechanisms
by which altered regulatory enhancer landscapes contribute to ovarian aging by licensing changes in
transcriptional programs, we will investigate the roles of genetic variants associated with age at menopause,
detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in modulating transcription programs during ovarian
aging. In particular, we hope to provide mechanistic insights into genetic modulation of transcriptional regulation
of critical homeostatic and inflammatory pathological functions in the granulosa cells (GC), the supporting cell
type immediately surrounding the oocyte, by modeling the causal regulatory variants in human GC models that
are differentiated from human ESCs engineered to carry causal variants by CRISPR gene editing."

As social creatures, social interaction is vital for mammalian health. Prolonged separation from social
environments can result in social isolation stress, which is linked to poor mental health outcomes, including
anxiety, depression, and violence. Despite this, relatively little is known about the neurobiology underlying these
changes induced by social isolation, representing a critical gap in the field. In this proposal, I will investigate the
role of Tachykinin 2-expressing (Tac2+) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in regulating
isolation-induced aggression, through a combination of genetic characterization, cell-type specific functional
manipulations, and in vivo imaging approaches. My preliminary work establishes mPFC Tac2+ neurons as
interneurons and finds isolation-induced aggression in both male and female mice. In Aim 1 I will use an in situ
hybridization assay to investigate the extent to which neuropeptide-encoding genes are expressed in mPFC
Tac2+ interneurons to understand whether these neurons are a homogenous population or can be subdivided
into subpopulations. Then, in Aim 2 I will examine whether the activity of mPFC Tac2+ interneurons or
Tac2/Neurokinin B signaling is necessary for isolation-aggression and will investigate the role of neurokinin B in
this process. Lastly in Aim 3, I will use dual-color in vivo microendoscopic imaging of different colored calcium
indicators expressed in mPFC Tac2+ interneurons and mPFC pyramidal neurons, respectively, to understand
the activity of these neuronal populations during isolation-induced aggression. This project builds off my strong
background in rodent behavior and allows me to gain computational skills for the analysis of behavior and calcium
imaging data. Under the training provided by this fellowship, I will gain the necessary technical skills, knowledge
of my field, and data analysis skills to assist in my transition to a postdoctoral position in systems neuroscience
and achieve my career goal of becoming a professor at a research-intensive institution. Through understanding
the contribution of mPFC Tac2+ interneurons to isolation-induced aggression, this project will further our
understanding of the circuit-level mechanisms that contribute to mental health issues resulting from prolonged
social isolation."
10907483,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The US territory of Guam has a staggeringly high burden of liver cancer with incidence and mortality more than
twice that of overall rates in the United States (US) where rates have nearly tripled over the past three decades.
Excess risk is most prominent among CHamorus who are the native people of Guam, comprising 42% of the
population. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary form of liver cancer, develops entirely within the context
of progressive chronic liver disease (CLD) characterized by advancing levels of fibrosis. Thus, there is an urgent
need to understand the etiology of progressive CLD in CHamorus and to identify novel strategies and targets for
prevention and early intervention. Our proposed research will address whether oral dysbiosis and sleep/circadian
rhythm disturbance contribute to liver fibrosis through glucose and lipid dysmetabolism and the potential
modifying effect of other exposures. We propose a case-control study of 300 liver fibrosis cases and 300 matched
controls among CHamorus in Guam. Liver fibrosis, a well-established precursor of liver cancer, as well as liver
steatosis as a secondary outcome, will be measured by transient elastrography (Fibroscan).
The Specific Aims of Full Project II are to:
1) Evaluate the association of oral dysbiosis with liver fibrosis and steatosis. Oral dysbiosis will be defined as
deleterious patterns of the oral microbiome and/or the presence of periodontal disease. We will perform bacterial
16S rRNA sequencing to measure oral bacterial diversity and composition. We will determine periodontal
disease by clinical examination and self-report. The association between oral dysbiosis and liver fibrosis, with or
without stratification by steatosis grades, will be evaluated; the potential modifying effects of other exposures
(e.g., betel nut chewing, viral hepatitis, alcohol) and the mediating effects of glucose and lipid dysmetabolism
will be assessed. We hypothesize that having moderate to severe liver fibrosis is associated with: 1a) reduced
oral microbial diversity, enriched pathogenic and depleted commensal bacteria, and aberrations in insulin-
signaling bacterial genes; 1b) the presence and severity of periodontal disease; and 1c) oral dysbiosis through
and independently of glucose/lipid dysmetabolism.
2) Evaluate the associations of sleep (quantity and quality) and circulating Mrna expression levels of circadian
clock genes with liver fibrosis and steatosis. We will determine sleep duration and quality using validated
questionnaires and analyze the expression of the period (Per1, Per2, Per3) and cryptochrome (Cry2) genes in
blood as a biomarker of circadian rhythm. We hypothesize that liver fibrosis is associated with: 2a) short sleep
duration and sleep apnea; 2b) reduced expression of the clock genes; and 2c) sleep/circadian rhythm
disturbances through and independently of glucose/lipid dysmetabolism."
10908032,"Abstract
Corneal scarring is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Through their interactions with the extracellular
matrix (ECM), stromal keratocytes play a central role in fundamental biological processes such as developmental
morphogenesis and wound healing. Recent studies suggest that feedback from the ECM can have a significant
impact stromal cell behavior. Specifically, ECM stiffness, topography and protein composition have all been
shown to modulate keratocyte differentiation, contractility and patterning. However, there are still significant gaps
in our knowledge of how multiple stimuli are integrated to produce specific cell phenotypes. The parent R01
project focuses on the development and testing of novel 2D and 3D experimental platforms which allow us to
systematically incorporate combinations of both soluble and non-soluble cues. In particular, in Aim 1 we are
determining how substrate elasticity modulates the keratocyte response to soluble biochemical cues; in Aim 2
we are determining how substrate topography and composition modulates the keratocyte response to
biochemical and biomechanical cues; and in Aim 3 we are determining how substrate dimensionality (2-D versus
3-D) modulates the keratocyte response to biochemical, biomechanical and topographic cues.
In this proposal we propose the acquisition of a Zeiss microscope stage CO2 incubator system that will be
installed on a motorized Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope. This upgrade will allow us to perform live-
cell analysis, time lapse imaging, and provide us with multi-modal information. Based on experimental data
collected over the first 4 years of the project, our needs for live-cell and time lapse imaging have expanded
dramatically. This instrumentation will allow us quantitatively (i) determine and measure dynamic cell morphology
and transient cell activation information with improved temporal resolution; (ii) characterize the impact of collagen
fibril alignment and topography on keratocyte migration in response to novel wound injury models we have
developed; (iii) allow us to identify the relative roles of proliferation and migration in response to secreted and/or
immobilized growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins; and (iv) allow us to determine the effects of 3D
confinement on keratocyte migration. The acquisition of this live-cell imaging system is expected to provide
unprecedented insights into the role of key biophysical signaling pathways on the differentiation of keratocytes
(e.g. quiescent, migratory, regenerative and repair phenotypes). Knowledge obtained using these novel
constructs should also aid in the development of targeted anti-fibrosis therapies, as well as guide tissue
engineering approaches to developing stromal tissue replacements."
10905850,"Cancer patients receiving most types of chemotherapy experience dysgeusia, i.e., distorted taste, which is
associated with depression, malnutrition, morbid weight loss, and interruption of life-prolonging treatment. Cells
within taste buds are continually and rapidly renewed, and this constant turnover makes taste prone to
disruption by cancer therapies. However, the underlying and likely multiple mechanisms perturbed by cancer
drugs that cause dysgeusia are not known. Here we focus on a small subset of six tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) used routinely to manage metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). These drugs target tumors by
inhibiting VEGFR1-3 and PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Paradoxically, these receptors are not
expressed in taste epithelium, leaving open the question of how these drugs distort taste. It is well known that
mRCC TKIs inhibit many off-target RTKs, including the Kit receptor. Via investigation of TKI target data and
comparison with RTKs expressed in taste epithelium, we find that Kit is one of the few “taste” RTKs inhibited
by all 6 drugs. We now have extensive pilot data that suggest inhibition of Kit may in fact underlie dysgeusia
caused by these TKIs and specifically sweet taste is impacted. Preliminarily we show: (1) in mice, Kit is
expressed primarily in sweet taste receptor cells (TRCs); (2) TKI treatment of lingual organoids derived from
adult mouse taste stem cells leads to reduced expression of Tas1r2, a marker of sweet cells; (3) mice given
the TKI cabozantinib have fewer Tas1r2+ sweet TRCs after 2 weeks; and (4) mice have blunted sweet taste
function after 4 weeks of cabozantinib. In sum, our preliminary finding suggest the multifaceted hypothesis that:
TKIs used to treat kidney cancer impede production of sweet taste cells, and disrupt sweet taste function by
inhibiting Kit signaling.
Aim 1. To investigate if TKIs used to treat mRCC inhibit sweet TRC differentiation and/or survival. We combine
molecular genetic lineage tracing of sweet TRCs with drug treatment in mice (Aim 1A) and organoids (Aim 1B)
to assess if sweet TRCs fail to survive TKI treatment or if treatment blocks production of new sweet TRCS.
Aim 2. To test if cabozantinib, which cause dysgeusia in patients, alters sweet taste function in mice. Our pilot
data suggest sweet taste is specifically impacted, but we cannot rule out effects on other taste modalities. We
will use both behavioral assays (Aim 2A) and taste nerve recordings (Aim 2B) to determine if sweet taste is
altered in cabozantinib-treated mice and/or if taste function is more broadly impacted.
Aim 3. To determine if paracrine Kit signaling within taste buds is required for sweet TRC production. In Aim
3A, we will use western blotting of lingual organoids to assess if Kit signaling is inhibited by mRCC TKIs.
Our pilot data reveal SCF, the ligand for the Kit receptor is expressed by glial-like cells and sour TRCs within
taste buds. In Aim 3B, we will use conditional molecular genetics in mice to test if glial and sour TRCs signaling

10905852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Calcium signaling and homeostasis in spermatozoa is essential for successful fertilization. The overall goal of
this research program is to elucidate how sperm CatSper channel assembles to form Ca2+ signaling
nanodomains and integrates proteolytic and metabolic pathways to control mammalian sperm motility and fertility.
The research program aims to understand how calcium signaling and homeostasis in sperm is crucial for suc-
cessful fertilization, specifically focusing on the CatSper channel and its crosstalk with other signaling pathways.
During the first funding cycle, significant progress has been made in comprehending CatSper's role in sperm
motility and fertility. Molecular and structural organization, along with new CatSper components, were identified
through proteomic screens. In-depth studies using mouse models shed light on the channel's activity, assembly,
and trafficking. Additionally, 3D in situ molecular imaging revealed CATSPER1 as a molecular signature of suc-
cessful sperm reaching the fertilization site. Cryo-electron tomography further allowed the resolution of the first
in-cell CatSper structure in human and mouse sperm flagella, contributing to a clearer understanding of the
channel's composition and spatial arrangement.
This R01 renewal builds on new CatSper components identified, new animal models generated with novel strat-
egies, and new cutting-edge imaging techniques acquired during this period. Our studies reveal many unex-
pected features and broader implications of CatSper regulation of mammalian sperm physiology and fertilization,
laying the groundwork. We pursue the same long-term goals of deepening our understanding of sperm physiol-
ogy and uncovering new pathways that could be exploited to assess and control sperm motility and fertility with
new Specific Aims investigating 1] the role of ancillary transmembrane subunits in regulating channel assembly
and nanodomain organization; 2] the proteolytic regulation of the channel, and 3] its physiological significance
on the sperm energy metabolism, sperm motility and fertility.
Collectively, these new aims, leveraging work from the first R01, will elucidate the entirely novel molecular
mechanisms by which CatSper maintain and terminate sperm motility. This new knowledge will inspire im-
provements sperm selection in assisted reproduction and provide new targets for contraceptive development."
10907916,"The objective of the proposed R01 project is to build on our recent findings that attractive odors from sources of
nectar activate conserved olfactory channels in mosquitoes, and the odorant ratios within the scent, along with
the inhibition in the antennal lobe (AL), are critical for Aedes aegypti behavior. Feeding on fruits and flowers is
a vital behavior for mosquitoes, and mosquito attraction to these sources of nectar is mediated by the ratio of
key odorants in the bouquet. Bait-and-kill traps that use fruit syrups have effectively controlled local mosquito
populations, but variation in the fruit odor can strongly impact its attractiveness. We still have not identified the
odor constituents and ratios that are attractive in the nectar odors – enabling the development of synthetic lures
–, nor how this information is detected and processed by the mosquito's olfactory system.
 Nectar-feeding by female mosquitoes increases their life-span and decreases the gonotrophic cycle, thereby
increasing their vectorial capacity, and for adult males, it is the only source of nutrients. Our recent work allowed
us to identify the odor constituents that mediate nectar-feeding behaviors in Ae. aegypti and understand how the
odor is processed in the brain. Now in this application, we propose to use a combination of behavioral assays,
chemical methods combined with calcium imaging in tethered flying mosquitoes, and genetic approaches to
study the olfactory basis of nectar-seeking behaviors. Aim 1 will allow us to identify attractive odorants in the
scents of diverse plant nectar sources and use heterologous expression systems to de-orphan the cognate
odorant receptors (Ors). We also take advantage of the Q-system for genetically characterizing three Ors (Or15,
Or49, and Or2) that are essential for representing the proper ratios in nectar odors. In Aim 2, we leverage our
existing and new GCaMP expression lines to examine how the ratios of these key odorants are processed in the
AL, and how GABAergic inhibition shapes these responses. In Aim 3, we will use our identified odor lures, and
artificial lures that vary in their natural ratios of key odorants, to determine their efficacy in bait-and-kill systems.
Together, these experiments will test the working hypothesis that nectar odors and their specific odorant ratios
activate conserved olfactory channels to be processed similarly by AL circuits to mediate feeding behaviors.
 While there has been an extensive study of mosquito attraction to blood hosts, we know comparatively less
about nectar feeding. Our experiments will identify new odors that can be immediately deployed as attractant
lures. Additionally, GABAergic systems are involved in diverse physiological processes in insect vectors,
including olfaction, immune response, and arbovirus replication, as well as being potent targets for insecticides.
Generating mutants that target the mosquito's olfactory responses or GABAergic pathways could provide
additional insight into these diverse processes. Sugar feeding plays an essential role in the vectorial capacity of
mosquitoes and the spread of diseases that afflict over a billion people annually. Therefore, unraveling the
neural bases of nectar-feeding will enable new gene-targets and tools for their control."
10908476,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many of them
use closed architectures.
 To address this challenge, we propose to develop the implantable leads for the implantable pulse generator
(IPG) platform, which will be based on a flexible, open-architecture, and modular approach. A large selection of
stimulation and sensing leads will be developed for interfacing with the IPG header. Specifically, we will develop
a polydimethylsiloxane-based cuff for stimulation of autonomic nerves with the diameter of 1 mm and larger. We
will also develop a lead for sacral nerve stimulation. For enabling closed-loop neuromodulation, we will develop
the leads for electrocardiographic, electromyographic, electroneurographic, and accelerometer-based motility
sensing. Such flexibility and modularity will allow a significant degree of customization for different clinical
indications, including open-loop and closed-loop IPG operation. Once the implantable leads are developed, they
will be subjected to the benchtop testing."
10909176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 54 children in the US, however the modifiable risk factors for this
disorder remain unknown, creating a pressing public health need. As ASD likely arises early in prenatal
development, efforts in identifying such modifiable factors have focused on maternal exposures in pregnancy,
including medications. While some medications have been shown to be associated with ASD, major critical
knowledge gaps remain, including: (1) the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated, and (2) the effects
of most maternal medications on ASD risk are still unknown — despite pervasive use of prescription and over-
the-counter (OTC) medications in pregnancy, most of which cross the placenta, with unknown effects on the
fetus. In response, the key objectives of the proposed study are to identify medications taken by pregnant women
that influence offspring ASD risk, elucidate confounding factors in these associations, and benchmark their
generalizability and specificity. To achieve these objectives, we propose independent, but synergistic aims: Aim
1: Systematically investigate the effects of the full range of maternal prescription and OTC medications used in
pregnancy on ASD offspring risk, using well-powered sample of 1.2M live births from Israel with full demographic,
prescription, medical and pedigree information. We will test if the observed effects on ASD differ depending on
the timing or duration of the exposure, concurrent use of other medications, indication or offspring sex. Aim 2:
Test the mechanisms underlying the associations between maternal medication use and ASD, 2A: examining
familial confounding, using sibling comparisons and negative control of paternal exposure; and 2B: identifying
clinical confounding by (i) examining risk of ASD associated with clusters of medications defined by their
pharmacological features (target(s), chemical structure) vs indication, (ii) adjustment for maternal health proxies;
(iii) discontinuation analysis. Aim 3: Establish the specificity and generalizability of maternal medication effects
on ASD, by 3A: examining the range of other (neuro)developmental outcomes affected by the same maternal
medications as ASD, and 3B: performing a replication study in Sweden, Finland and the US. The innovation of
this project is four-fold: (1) it can identify novel, potentially modifiable risk factors for ASD; (2) it triangulates
orthogonal approaches to discern causal vs confounded effects of medications on ASD risk; (3) it leverages
pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data on medications to unambiguously define exposure; and (4) it
provides new insights into shared and distinct risk factors in different adverse developmental outcomes. Upon
completion, our multi-dimensional approach, rigorous methods and unprecedented study power in the hands of
our expert team will deliver a systematic list of the maternal prescription and OTC medications in pregnancy
associated with ASD, and robust evidence regarding the role of the confounding factors in these effects. This
will help identify potential modifiable risk factors for the disorder, contribute high-quality evidence about the risks
associated with maternal use of certain medications during pregnancy, and delineate the etiology of ASD."
10909177,"Adapting a point of use test card, the chemoPAD, for protecting
 chemotherapy drug quality in sub-Saharan Africa
Project Summary/Abstract
Goal: validate a new technology for detecting bad quality chemotherapy products at the point of use.
Motivation: Chemotherapy medicines form the backbone of affordable cancer treatment in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), yet LMICs often lack technical and regulatory capacity to evaluate the quality of
chemotherapy products. There is currently no commercial technology to screen for bad quality chemotherapy
products at the point of use in LMIC settings, and the drug regulators in Ethiopia, Malawi, Kenya, and
Cameroon do not conduct post-market surveillance testing on chemotherapy products.
Activities: The technology that will be validated, called SpotCheck, consists of an inexpensive paper test
card (the chemoPAD) and a cell phone app. We will first adapt the chemoPAD to screen eight types of
injectable chemotherapy drugs. The phone app’s neural network will be trained to identify products that are
falsified or contain less than 65% of the stated API content. Clinical, academic, and supply chain partners in
Ethiopia, Malawi, Cameroon, and Kenya will conduct annual situation awareness and quality surveys of 320
chemotherapy products per year; the results will enable a team of researchers at U. North Carolina to model
the markets for chemotherapy products and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the SpotCheck system. After a
technical performance milestone is passed, we will tailor the clinical validation of SpotCheck to suit the local
needs, clinical workflows, and regulatory capacity in each site. The validation of the SpotCheck system will
proceed through a planning and ethical approval milestone (Y3 in Ethiopia and Malawi and Y4 in Kenya and
Cameroon) and three clinical phases: proficiency study, clinical validation, and implementation pilot.
Proficiency testing will demonstrate that oncology pharmacists and nurses can use SpotCheck with accuracy
>85% to detect SF products. Clinical validation will establish whether SpotCheck works correctly in a clinical
setting on authentic products, rather than proficiency samples. The implementation pilot study will probe
SpotCheck’s ability to test the drops left over in product vials after patient treatments are prepared in the
hospital; this method of use would allow sustainable implementation of SpotCheck in many hospitals and
clinics in low-resource settings. Technology transfer efforts will empower LMIC partners to produce the
chemoPAD locally and integrate the cell phone app into regulatory reporting systems.
Impact: This project will help to fill the huge evidence gap about the quality of chemo drugs in LMICs, make it
harder for manufacturers and distributors to sell bad quality products, and improve the quality of products that
are used to treat patients in LMICs.

Stem and progenitor cells at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) have been identified as crucial to the
development of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, and proximal stomach.
Combined, these cancers have over 20,000 new cases per year in the U.S., are associated high mortality, and
represent a major public health burden. Our group has identified both gastric cardia as well as GEJ transitional
basal stem cells as likely cells of origin for precancerous states in this region. However, defining the mechanisms
and effectors that drive GE junction stem cell fate and promote cancer development remains a critical gap in
knowledge. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) represent the prototype for
neoplasia arising from GE junction stem cells. We have extensive preliminary data demonstrating that circulating
secondary bile acids derived from gut bacteria directly promote the development of BE and EAC, treating our
L2-IL1B mouse model of BE/EAC with deoxycholic acid (DCA) accelerates neoplasia, and treatment with
obeticholic acid, an agonist of nuclear bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor), decreases proliferation,
GEJ stem cell numbers, and dysplasia. However, the exact mechanisms by which secondary bile acids impact
GEJ stem cells and the associated microenvironment have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that circulating
secondary bile acids produced by gut bacteria promote early cancer development via direct effects on GE
junction stem cells through FXR antagonism and by inducing pro-inflammatory microenvironment alterations.
Using highly novel techniques and approaches (including scRNA-Seq and CyTOF), we will perform a series of
experiments using mouse models, mouse and human organoids, and with validation of findings in a prospective
study of patients, to address the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the role of circulating secondary
bile acids in GEJ epithelial stem cell fate and early cancer promotion; Aim 2. To assess the effects of circulating
secondary bile acids on the GEJ epithelial stem cell microenvironment; Aim 3. To determine whether targeted
microbiome modification that regulates the circulating bile acid pool modifies GEJ cancer development. To
achieve these aims we will use our unique L2-IL1B mouse model with FXR knockout in stem cells (L2-
IL1B/Fxrfl/fl), allowing us to assess the effects of secondary bile acids on GEJ stem cells as well the L2-IL1B/Nlrpfl/fl
model to explore inflammasome activation in stem cells and assess for cross-talk with the microenvironment.
Ultimately, we will perform experiments treating with distinct consortia of highly characterized bacterial strains
to modulate the secondary bile acid producing capacity of the gut microbiome and determine the effects on
cancers arising from GE junction stem cells. Elucidation of the specific mechanisms by which secondary bile
acids interact with GEJ stem cells and modify the microenvironment to promote cancer development may lead
to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, including the potential for rationally designed probiotic therapy,
which would have a major public health impact."

Caribbean Fishers reflects an integrated, multi-disciplinary collaboration focused on evidence informed
education bridging the gap between research and practice to improve fishing industry sector worker safety and
health. In 2018 the Southeastern Coastal Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (SCCAHS) launched the
annual State of the Science (SOS) Meeting to better understand and enhance the uptake of evidence-based
practices that improve the health and safety of agricultural, forestry, and fisher populations and spotlight
emerging issues. The SCCAHS has convened a total of six meetings 2018 – 2023, with the annual theme
driven by community feedback reflecting their priorities, values, and experiences. The focus of this proposal is
to use the sound SCCAHS framework to create a forum that addresses cross-sector topics (musculoskeletal
health, injury prevention, surveillance, climate adaptation and mental health) and the effectiveness of practices
and policies on U.S. Gulf and Caribbean fisher communities. The meeting outcomes will contribute to stronger
collaboration between regional researchers and serve as a vehicle to disseminate research findings more
broadly to community stakeholders related to NIOSH strategic and intermediate goals on musculoskeletal
disorders, workplace safety, and healthy work design and well-being. The leadership team seeks to convene
two SOS meetings in partnership with the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute (GCFI) in November 2024
and 2025. The SOS meetings will be convened pre-GCFI Annual Conference specialty workshops in
collaboration with the NIOSH Office of Agricultural Safety and Health and an Organizing Committee. These
groups understand the burden and needs of commercial and artisanal fishing workers – climate change
impacts, governance, and adherence to safety interventions. These meetings will be driven by the long-term
goal to cultivate partnerships and interdisciplinary collaboration, share national and regional research findings,
engage the community as leaders in the research process and mobilize responsive programming to serve real-
time conditions and challenges. The conference plan will be directed by NIOSH strategic goals and
corresponding specific aims: 1) to provide oversight in aligning speakers/discussion leaders in addressing
knowledge gaps and emerging issues impacting Gulf Coast and U.S. Caribbean fisher populations, 2) to
embed hallmark community led meeting track – Community Voices: The impact of climate variability on
fisheries productivity and fisher livelihoods, 3) to implement networking opportunities to advance collaborations
among Gulf Coast and U.S. Caribbean stakeholders, and 4) to evaluate, translate, and disseminate research
to practice findings into public information products. The proposed work is important because Gulf South,
Puerto Rico, Saint Croix, Saint John and Saint Thomas coastal areas and island territories must join the
discussion to support capacity building and promoting fisheries research, assessment, and management."
10907170,"Pain continues to be a significant health care problem because of its prevalence, its impact on
those who suffer, and the absence of consistently effective therapeutic options devoid of
deleterious consequences. These issues will only be compounded with the aging of the US
population and the increased incidence of pain in those over 60 years old. Any progress in
addressing this growing problem will take a concerted effort from the basic scientists diligently
working to understand pain mechanisms to the health care providers struggling to manage pain
in their patients with limited tools and resources. It not only takes a sustained effort from those
already working to address this problem, but from subsequent generations of pain scientists as
well. The US Association for the Study of Pain (USASP) was formed to address these issues
and continues to develop ways of doing so. One of our solutions to advance pain science is an
annual scientific meeting organized to facilitate the dissemination of the latest advances in pain
science and the interdisciplinary discussion of these advances, as well as the career
development and mentoring of pain scientists and health care providers with a focus on early
career scholars. To maximize our ability to achieve these goals, the USASP and the scientific
meeting are organized around principles of diversity, equity and inclusion, where all interested in
addressing the complex problem of pain are welcomed to participate. This application is for
funds to support early career investigators to attend the USASP annual scientific meetings in
2024 thru 2028. Consistent with the broader goals of the USASP for the scientific meeting, the
Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Provide Early Career Pain Scholars with a national
forum in which to learn about and discuss pain research findings that shape the direction of the
field; 2) Facilitate networking and career development for Early Career Pain Scholars with
different pain science stakeholders (researchers, policymakers, clinicians, and patients); and 3)
Foster dialogue and collaboration between multiple pain science disciplines to develop
innovative translational strategies to address current challenges in pain research and
management. As the connections made early in a career pay dividends over the long term, we
seek support for 60 Early Career Pain Scholars to participate in the yearly (2024-2028)
conference, building a workforce that will contribute to pain science and ultimately safe and

Kidney cancer is expected to affect 76,080 new patients with 13,780 deaths in the U.S. in the year 2021. Renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer which imposes significant economic burden
on healthcare system. A recent study based on SEER Medicare database reported that the total healthcare
cost per RCC patient was $23,489 with a weighted total economic burden of $2.1 billion. RCC often presents
as an incidentally detected, incompletely characterized renal mass. Many of these patients with incidental renal
mass either undergo direct surgery or biopsy without further imaging evaluation as accurate histologic
diagnosis with current imaging techniques is not always possible. However, upfront surgery or biopsy is not
ideal as nearly 25% incidental renal masses are either benign (angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma) or low-grade
(chromophobe RCC, low-grade clear cell RCC) and overtreatment of such masses adds to unnecessary
morbidity and health care cost. Prior studies have shown low-grade RCC can be managed conservatively with
active surveillance in select patients (elderly patients and patients who are poor surgical candidates), but at
present there is a no non-invasive way to separate low-grade RCC from aggressive RCC (high-grade clear cell
RCC, papillary RCC). Accordingly, there is an emergent need to develop novel non-invasive quantitative
biomarkers for accurate characterization of renal masses so that more patients eligible for active surveillance
could be identified. Recent studies have shown that MR tissue relaxometry mapping including T1, T2 and T2*
mapping and fat fraction quantification can provide improved characterization of kidney diseases and correlate
with tumor grade and biologic aggressiveness in RCC. However, the current kidney relaxometry mapping
techniques still suffer from long breath-holds, limited spatial resolutions/coverage, and ability to mostly capture
one tissue property at a time. Further, the quantitative measures are often susceptible to motion artifacts with
poor repeatability and reproducibility. In this study, we propose to utilize the novel MR Fingerprinting (MRF)
technique together with machine learning methods to mitigate aforementioned limitations in kidney imaging. In
particular, we will develop a new 3D free-breathing kidney MRF method for simultaneous T1, T2, T2* and fat
fraction quantification (Aim 1). We will combine this kidney MRF acquisition with novel deep learning
approaches to accelerate data acquisition and improve tissue mapping efficiency (Aim 2). Finally, we will apply
the MRF technique in patients with RCC to explore its diagnostic strength in characterizing kidney cancer (Aim
3). Upon successful development, the multi-parametric quantitative measures acquired with MRF could make
MRI a more powerful tool for the diagnosis and predicting of tumor grade in RCC, with the ultimate goal to
eliminate unnecessary biopsy/surgery in eligible patients with benign/low-grade RCCs and provide guidance
towards the most appropriate treatment strategy."
10911840,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With the exponential increase in protein sequences, the statistical power of multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) has been recognized as an important source of information for analysis and design of proteins. For
example, consensus design, where the most frequent residue is selected from each position of an MSA,
has been recognized as generating folded, functional, stabilized proteins. At the same time, covariance
among pairs of residues at different positions has been recognized as having powerful value in predicting
protein structures, and is a major component of the recent successes of deep-learning methods such as
AlphaFold. Despite the power of pairwise residue covariance, these statistics have seen limited use in
design of proteins. Moreover, it is not presently known which properties of proteins—for example, folding,
stability, binding, and catalysis--are affected by the forces that contribute to covariance.
The proposed research will combine consensus design with covariance. Using well-behaved consensus
proteins we designed in the previous funding cycle, we will use two complementary methods to design
proteins with varying amounts of covariance and consensus information. The first uses a statistical
thermodynamic ""Potts"" formalism to determine coupling biases between residue pairs and separate them
from single-site biases. This separation allows us to adjust the amount of covariance information in our
designs. The second method uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to transform an MSA to a set of
coordinates that separate consensus from covariance. Within this space, sequences fall into well-defined
clusters that have shared conservation and covariance patterns. We will use the coordinate values of these
clusters to design sequences with specific patterns of covariance. Designed proteins will be produced in
the lab, and their stabilities, binding affinities, and enzyme activities will be determined. By projecting Potts
designs into SVD space, we will refine the Potts designs and gain insights into the specific pair correlations
that position each SVD cluster. We will also project extant sequences with known specificities into SVD
space to predict functional features of clusters, which will be tested experimentally.
To identify specific consensus and covariance sequence elements that contribute to stability and activity
patterns, we will make single-and multisite point substitutions that are found in our consensus, Potts, and
SVD designs. These will focus the non-additivity of consensus stabilization, which has been suggested
from the previous funding cycle, which is likely to be related to covariance. These mutagenesis studies will
also better define the striking stability and activity differences we have seen in preliminary Potts designs.
Overall, the proposed research will better define the roles of covariance in the various properties of proteins,
and will lead to new tools for more precise protein design. Furthermore, we expect better connect the SVD
method to taxonomy, and help establish it as a mainstream tool for molecular biology research."
10929536,"This proposal aims to enable a new generation of high-speed, low-cost, wavelength-flexible swept source
optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging device technology targeting applications in dental imaging and
based on microelectromechanical systems vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (MEMS-VCSELs) and planar
lightwave circuits (PLCs). MEMS-VCSELs provide an unmatched combination of high and variable axial scan
rate, dynamic single mode operation enabling long imaging range, and the potential for low-cost volume
manufacturing through wafer scale fabrication and testing. The proposed effort involves a collaboration between
Praevium Research, which pioneered MEMS-VCSELs for SS-OCT, and the University of Washington (UW), a
world leader in SS-OCT structural and angiographic imaging in dentistry. This work seeks both to advance dental
imaging science through new imaging tools and promote commercialization in cost-sensitive dental markets.
 Praevium Research will develop new high axial scan rate MEMS-VCSEL swept sources near water
absorption minima at 1700nm and 2200nm, to enable longer imaging range due to reduced scattering at longer
wavelengths. Imaging at these wavelengths may be particularly important in improving the ability of OCT to
noninvasively determine periodontal pocket depth. In addition, Praevium will combine emerging electrically
pumped MEMS-eVCSELs at 1310nm with advanced PLC technology, replacing bulky and environmentally
sensitive fiber networks commonly employed in SS-OCT by lithographically defined waveguide devices. This
will allow a radically miniaturized low-cost and stable SS-OCT subsystem with MEMS-VCSEL, optical amplifier,
wavelength monitoring, and MZI interferometers on a single chip in a compact butterfly package, overcoming
long-standing cost barriers to SS-OCT in dentistry.
 UW collaborators will use various generations of high axial scan rate MEMS-VCSELs, starting at 1310nm
and migrating to 1700nm and 2200nm as these latter sources are developed, to develop real-time wide field of
view (FOV) whole mouth structural (OCT) and label-free angiographic (OCTA) periodontal imaging. Current
methods for assessing periodontal disease rely on invasive probing, induce unnecessary pain and bleeding, and
are error-prone due to inconsistent frequency and force of probing and due to the complexity of gingival thickness
and appearance. The proposed SS-OCT technology, by contrast, has the potential to create qualitative and
quantitative imaging of microstructure and vasculature in gingival tissue. This will enable a comprehensive
periodontal imaging diagnostic suite which can assess periodontal attachment, alveolar bone quality and level,
gingival inflammation, sub gingival calculus plaque and tissue biotype. Such a system can also provide an
objective means to determine and evaluate the prognosis of periodontal, regenerative and restorative therapies,
improve computer-aided design and machining (CAD/CAM) for dental restorative procedures and planning, and
become a reliable tool for long term monitoring and maintenance in clinical practice for oral health."

Our goal is to generate a predictive model of the spinal cord nociceptive circuits that underlie the initiation of
pain perception and behavior. Nociceptive signals are conveyed from the periphery to the spinal cord dorsal
horn via highly specialized primary sensory neuron subtypes. These sensory neurons, as well as descending
modulatory neurons, form synapses upon an array of morphologically and physiologically distinct classes of
dorsal horn interneuron and projection neurons. The ascending output signals from the superficial dorsal horn
to the brain are conveyed by neurons of the anterolateral tract (ALT), which project to the thalamus,
periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and ventral brainstem. The goal of this
project is to define how critical sensory transformations and computations are achieved by these dorsal horn
nociceptive circuits and how ALT circuit outputs are conveyed with spatial and contextual precision to recipient
brain regions to drive pain and changes in behavior, as well as gain an understanding of the mechanisms
responsible for the transition of acute to chronic pain. The premise behind this work is that predictive models of
spinal cord nociceptive circuits that underlie the initiation of pain perception and behavior require: 1) defining
circuit output neurons and their specific tuning properties; 2) understanding the logic of primary sensory neuron
input onto these ALT output neurons; 3) determining the contributions of ALT output neuron classes to
reactions to noxious and innocuous stimuli and determining how this changes in disease conditions, and; 4)
defining the brain targets of dorsal horn nociceptive circuit output populations. This project will use novel ALT
pathway genetic tools in mice to identify, record from, silence and activate specific ALT subpopulations, and
physiological, anatomical, and novel, quantitative behavioral approaches to define the pivotal output channels
of distinct dorsal horn nociceptive circuits that underlie the perception of pain and its associated affective and
behavioral responses. Findings of the proposed work will establish the core logic of dorsal horn nociceptive
circuitry to lay a foundation for defining novel therapeutic opportunities for disrupting this circuitry to treat and
prevent chronic pain."
10940119,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Where one lives is an important contributor to disparities in health behaviors and outcomes, but it has been
difficult to draw firm conclusions on the relations between regional/neighborhood context and alcohol use and
misuse. This may be because (a) the influence of alcohol use and misuse (and genetic risk for alcohol use and
misuse) on where one lives is rarely considered, and (b) the effects of regional/neighborhood contexts may
only be relevant for certain genetically vulnerable individuals. Incorporating genetic information into a
prospective longitudinal study of the relation between regional/neighborhood context and alcohol use and
misuse might resolve inconsistencies in the literature. The proposed research will involve secondary analyses
of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AH), which included 20,745
adolescents in 1994-95 and has since conducted four follow-up waves. All five waves of data collection
gathered extensive health and behavior information, including alcohol use and misuse; administrative data
from the census and other sources were linked to the participants’ home addresses to provide information
about the region/neighborhoods in which they lived. Importantly, 9,974 participants provided DNA samples for
genotyping, allowing for the quantification of alcohol-related genetic risk by aggregating the effect of individual
measured polymorphisms into polygenic risk scores. The inclusion of 1,962 (289 monozygotic twin, 452
dizygotic twin, and 1,251 full sibling pairs) in the sample allows for the control of genetic factors when
examining associations between alcohol involvement and regional/neighborhood context and can provide
evidence consistent with a potentially causal relation. The three main goals of this proposal are to: (1) examine
prospectively the relation between regional/neighborhood contexts and later alcohol use and misuse, and (in
adulthood) the prospective relation between alcohol use and misuse and later regional/neighborhood contexts,
(2) examine prospectively, within exposure-discordant adult twin and sibling pairs, the relation between
regional/neighborhood contexts and later alcohol use and misuse, and the prospective relation between
alcohol use and misuse and later regional/neighborhood contexts, (3) examine whether alcohol-related
polygenic risk is associated with moving to or remaining in a high-risk neighborhood context and whether
alcohol-related polygenic risk amplifies the associations between neighborhood context and alcohol use and
misuse. The proposed research has the potential to provide critical insights into how alcohol-related genetic
propensities may exacerbate health disparities by influencing whether individuals reside in a high-risk
neighborhood context. It will also inform prevention and intervention efforts by clarifying whether the relation
between neighborhood context and alcohol misuse involves a direct causal relation. Evidence consistent with
such a causal relation would point to neighborhood-level interventions; evidence of a non-causal relation would
suggest that interventions delivered directly to individuals or families might prove more effective."
10933563,"Overview. It is crucial to uncover the biological features underlying disease mechanisms to develop
effective treatments and therapies. Typically, this is done via a two-step process: in stage 1, statistical
analyses are used to recommend candidate variants/genes for follow-up investigation. In stage 2,
researchers conduct costly experiments, clinical trials, or external studies via independent cohorts to
validate or establish causality between candidate features and disease traits. To minimize costs,
recommendations should lead to high-yield experiments and be replicable. These recommendations are
often generated through GWAS methods, based on linear mixed models. Despite the successes of
GWAS, there still exists a substantial heritability gap limiting the applicability of these associations in
clinical practice. A number of key issues can contribute to missing heritability including: the need for more
informative, multi-modal features; unidentified non-linear and epistatic effects; linkage disequilibrium
among variants; and heterogeneous sources of variability. To confront these challenges, we propose a
reality-checked stability-driven feature recommendation system based on decision trees that aims at
efficient discoveries for high yields in experimentation. We build upon iterative random forests (iRF) and
the veridical data science framework based on the principles of Predictability, Computability and Stability
(PCS) developed by the PI to propose a number of novel advances for stage 1. We propose: (1)
generalized MDI (gMDI) a stability-driven non-linear feature important measure for improving iRF
recommendations; (2) dependence-aware feature and interaction discovery; (3) supervised local feature
importance for heterogeneous mechanistic discoveries; and (4) validation through gene-silencing
experiments. Importantly, we generate multi-modal features to extract information across the genome.
Intellectual Merit. Our proposals: improve MDI-based methods by addressing drawbacks of MDI and
tailoring to problem settings; incorporate gMDI and dependence structure in iRF; and detect
heterogeneous sources of noise. Each aim will be vetted and follow the veridical data science framework.
In the case study, we will recommend genes and interactions for gene-silencing experiments. These will
supply valuable insights into genetic mechanisms underlying traits related to cardiac hypertrophy. Results
of this work will impact mechanistic discovery for complex diseases and advance statistical methodology."
10934374,"It is now well accepted that structured governed dynamics modulate function, yet we still don’t know how a 
few changes (e.g., mutations) in sequence modify dynamics to alter function. Understanding this interplay is 
a key step to engineering proteins with desired function to address disease, and viral evolution to fight with 
endemics or future pandemics, as well as many other bioengineering applications. Despite the work of many 
researchers, the connection between sequence, structure and dynamics remains elusive. This is partly 
because there is no powerful methods that can accurately quantify each amino-acid position’s contribution 
to structure and dynamics. We propose to fill this gap by using an innovative, interdisciplinary method based 
on mathematical topology and physics based protein dynamics modeling. The guiding hypothesis is that the 
topological landscape of proteins governs conformational dynamics and that it can be modified with sitespecific mutations. To test this hypothesis, we will create the mathematical framework upon which the local 
and global topology of proteins and conformational dynamics can be rigorously associated and the evolution 
of the topological landscape can be quantified. This work is particularly timely for two reasons: (1) 
conformational dynamics have established a connection between structure and function and evolution at the 
proteotome scale and (2) methods from mathematical topology have shown evidence of being able to 
characterize protein structure.
This research advances knowledge in mathematics and biology and breaks existing barriers in: (1) topology 
and geometry, (2) quantitative characterizations of protein structure, (3) connecting microscopic effects to 
the macroscopic properties of proteins and (4) providing a novel framework that enables not only to uncover 
the molecular mechanism of protein function and evolution based on fundamental mathematical and physical 
concepts, but also enables to design novel proteins with desired function. This is achieved by (1) creating
novel measures of topological complexity and a mathematical topological framework for characterizing multiscale protein structure, by (2) coarse-grained modeling and dynamical analysis of proteins and (3) by 
combining the two to establish the connection between conformational dynamics and the topological 
landscape of proteins. This integrated novel framework will be tested on different protein systems with 
available deep scanning mutational experimental data. The successful completion of this work could lead to 
a breakthrough that would enable to predict and modulate protein function based on structural dynamics."
10940441,"The role of late life depression in cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease risk
Abstract
The risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease increases by three-fold for people who experience symptoms of
depression in older age. Therefore, depression is thought to be a modifiable risk factor or early indicator of
Alzheimer’s Disease. Yet, the link between depression and Alzheimer’s Disease is poorly understood. The aim
of this administrative supplement to parent R01 MH128286 is to elucidate the link between depression and
Alzheimer’s Disease. In Aim 1, we will identify brain mechanisms that are shared between depression and
cognitive decline in older age. In Aim 2, we will determine the pathway through which depression impacts the
development of Alzheimer’s Disease pathophysiology by comparing models to assess whether depression is
an independent risk factor, an accelerator, an early indicator, or a response to Alzheimer’s Disease. All aspects
in this administrative supplemental proposal fit within the scope of the parent R01, as we will leverage the
same cohort (UK Biobank) and data variables (neuroimaging, depression scores, cognitive tests, and genetic
risk factors). If funded, this supplement will offer a bridge to the PI to establish a track record and set up
collaborations for expanded research into Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. The follow-up R01
proposal leveraging the results from this seed funding is expected to focus on the relationship between
neuropsychiatric symptoms and preclinical markers (i.e., tau and amyloid beta) of Alzheimer’s Disease."
10940705,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 27 million Americans remain uninsured in 2022, and millions more have lost Medicaid coverage with the
end of the Public Health Emergency in 2023. Over 40% of uninsured persons were eligible for large subsidies
to obtain coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. Health in-
surance is critical to providing access to care and improving health outcomes. While the American Rescue Plan
Act greatly reduced affordability barriers to Marketplace coverage, other key barriers to coverage remain un-
addressed. Administrative burdens—the compliance, learning, and psychological costs people face when inter-
acting with government services—have a large effect on health insurance coverage take-up. Despite the Market-
places’ critical role in providing health insurance coverage to Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, lim-
ited research exists on the effects of administrative burdens on Marketplace enrollment. This proposal’s objec-
tive is to assess how different types of administrative burdens impact Marketplace enrollment. The applicants
will use state-of-the-art research methods from economics, public administration, and anthropology to address
three specific aims: (1) determine if eliminating premium payment-related compliance costs affects reenroll-
ment in Marketplace coverage; (2) determine whether reducing the burden of information costs through adver-
tising affects Marketplace coverage take-up; and (3) create a person-centered understanding of how compli-
ance, information, and psychological costs erect barriers to Marketplace coverage. Aims 1 and 2 will use Mar-
ketplace enrollment data and causal inference approaches; Aim 3 will use semi-structured interviews in three
diverse states, Arizona, Connecticut, and North Carolina, to study administrative burdens. This mixed methods
research addresses a critical need for evidence on cost-effective policies that can reduce the number of unin-
sured, who disproportionately consist of AHRQ priority populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and
rural and low-income populations. In so doing, this proposal is directly responsive to AHRQ’s interest in re-
search on health insurance coverage, access and affordability, and its special emphasis notice on health services
research to advance health equity. It also is responsive to the President’s executive order on reducing adminis-
trative burdens. Results will provide state and federal policymakers with easily implementable approaches to
reducing the uninsured rate by making the process of Marketplace enrollment less burdensome. This proposal
is particularly timely with the end of the Public Health Emergency, which will require millions of former Medi-
caid enrollees to successfully navigate Marketplace administrative burdens to remain insured. The applicants
will directly disseminate findings to Marketplace policymakers and administrators to facilitate translation of
the proposed research into policies that reduce the number of uninsured."
10940543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."

10938489,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emergency department (ED) visits for suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents are rising, underscoring a
need for effective interventions preventing post-ED recurrence in youth suicidal crises. Parents are tasked with
implementing post-discharge suicide prevention recommendations (e.g., lethal means restriction, attending to
suicide warning signs, providing support), highlighting opportunities for parent-facing interventions to improve
post-ED youth outcomes.
Leveraging accessible text messaging, together with a Just
-In-Time Adaptive
Intervention (JITAI) framework designed to tailor support based on individuals’ unique and changing needs, our
goal is to examine the effectiveness of an adaptive text-based intervention for parents of suicidal youth
transitioning from ED care. We build on results from our NIMH-funded pilot of a text-based intervention with
two components, provided to parents for 6 weeks after ED discharge: (1) adolescent-centered (A-C) texts,
encouraging parental engagement in suicide prevention activities to promote youth safety; and (2) parent-
centered (P-C) texts, intended to enhance parents’ own well-being. In addition to feasibility and acceptability,
promising pilot results showed that the intervention improved key mechanisms of action and was associated
with lower post-ED youth suicide attempts. We expand on this pilot work to determine the effectiveness of the
text-based intervention in a full-scale multi-site trial and to investigate its implementation potential. In this
hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial, 420 parents of adolescents presenting with suicide risk across
two EDs will be randomized to standard ED services alone or paired with the 6-week text-based intervention
integrating A-C and P-C components. An embedded full-scale MRT in the intervention arm, with twice-daily
micro-randomizations to deliver (vs. not deliver) P-C messages, will inform a JITAI providing tailored parent-
directed support. The specific aims are to: (1) Compare standard ED services with and without the text-based
intervention on the primary outcome of youth suicidal behavior (actual, interrupted, aborted attempts) 12 weeks
after ED discharge and on two secondary outcomes of time-to-suicidal behavior and time-to-return ED visits
within 24 weeks; (2) Using the embedded MRT, determine if delivering vs. not delivering P-C messages
impacts proximal (within hours) outcomes of parental stress (primary) as well as parental positive and negative
affect (secondary); and (3) To support uptake in EDs, engage stakeholders to assess implementation barriers
and facilitators and produce an implementation package. Secondary aims are to examine if mechanisms of
action (parents’ engagement in suicide prevention activities, self-efficacy) mediate the intervention’s impact on
youth suicidal behavior, and to investigate time-varying parent and adolescent moderators (e.g., affect,
functioning) of micro-randomizations to identify when parent-directed support is most beneficial. Addressing a
critical need for post-ED continuity of care strategies to prevent youth suicidal behavior, and by proposing a
novel and scalable parent-facing approach, this study has potential for high impact.

The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans continues to be the cause of 15% of AIDS-related mortality,
primarily in under-resourced areas of the globe. The work outlined in the proposal is a continuation of work
investigating post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms of stress adaptation in this important fungal
pathogen and investigate their conservation across clinical isolates from AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in
Africa. We have implicated translatome reprogramming as a requirement for the adaptation to host-
temperature stress as well as oxidative stress. This reprogramming is regulated at two points: the entry of
mRNAs into the translating pool through regulation of translation initiation, and the removal of mRNAs from the
pool by deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. These two pathways cooperate in a stress-specific and
intensity-dependent manner to achieve a stress-adaptive translatome. In this proposal, we propose three
specific aims that outline a mechanistic investigation of these processes. First, we will investigate the
translational regulation of Gcn4, the transcription factor that controls expression of the integrated stress
response (ISR) regulon. We will define the C. neoformans ISR, and define the direct targets of Gcn4 in C.
neoformans. Second, we will build on preliminary data demonstrating that translation initiation regulation by the
kinase Gcn2 is activated by perturbations in other post-transcriptional and translation regulatory pathways
suggesting a role for Gcn2 as a failsafe responder to stress. We will investigate the contributions to
translatome reprogramming of these additional pathways, Hog1/p38, Nonsense Mediate Decay (NMD) and
Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) and investigate the role of Gcn2 activation in either suppressing or
exacerbating defects in translatome reprogramming or virulence phenotype. Finally, we will investigate the
mechanisms of translatome reprogramming in a panel of environmental C. neoformans isolates, as well as a
large collection of clinical isolates of C. neoformans from people with AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in Africa
that have accompanying outcome data and are fully genome sequenced. We will investigate the thresholds for
activation of these pathways and the intensity and duration of responses across the isolates, assessing
temperature dependent changes in translational output and both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intracellular
reactive oxygen species as ISR activators. We will also determine if the ISR regulon differs across the panel of
clinical isolates. This work will define pathways responsible for the agility of this important pathogen that differ
from non-pathogen environmental relatives and from the model yeast and identify additional targets for future
therapeutic interventions."

Every time we breathe, we inhale toxins and pathogens. The mucus produced in our airway traps these
pathogens. Thousands of multiciliated cells (multiple cilia per cell, MCCs) line the epithelium of our airway work
in a synchronized fashion to propel the mucus upwards and out of our body. This coordinated process is
known as mucociliary clearance, which prevents pathogens from moving to our lungs and causing irreparable
damage. Despite the central role MCCs play in mucociliary clearance, our understanding of the morphogenesis
of MCCs in the context of mucociliary epithelium remains incomplete. For example, the assembly of too many
or too few cilia is associated with impaired MCC function and can lead to pathological outcomes. However, the
mechanisms that define the cilia number remain unaddressed. Using an in vivo model of Xenopus embryonic
epidermal MCCs, we recently discovered that the centriole number depends on the apical area of the cell.
Moreover, we demonstrated that mechanical tension that affects the apical area of MCCs also calibrates
centriole number via mechanosensitive (MS) ion channel Piezo1. Our results have raised many important
questions about the mechanisms of Piezo1 function in MCCs. Also, they strongly suggested that
mechanotransduction plays a central role in the morphogenesis of mucociliary epithelia, specifically MCCs.
This proposal will focus on elucidating the role of mechanical forces and mechanotransduction pathways in
determining the centriole number and apical area of MCCs and non-MCCs using three complementary
approaches. First, we will take a gene-specific approach to examine the role of Piezo1 in centriole number
control. Second, we will take a cellular biomechanics approach to understand the interaction between tissue-
scale and cell-intrinsic forces in determining the apical area of MCCs and non-MCCs. Third, we will use a
systems approach to identify other MS genes involved in MCC morphogenesis. Our long-term goal is to
elucidate the mechanisms that define the properties of individual organelles (e.g., size and number of cilia) and
how they relate to the architecture of cells (e.g., apical size, cilia organization) and the mucociliary tissue
(arrangement of MCCs and non-MCCs) to generate efficient fluid flow."

This is a competing continuation application entitled “Molecular Epidemiology of Cancer Training Program”
(T32 CA09142). The specific aims of this research training program are to continue implementing innovative,
multidisciplinary, and collaborative research training in cancer epidemiology and to train five pre- and two post-
doctoral trainees in an interdisciplinary program of molecular and genetic cancer epidemiology. In the last 5
years, this program has emphasized a multidisciplinary approach by providing instruction and mentorship in
epidemiological methodology and the molecular aspects of cancer. In this continuation application, we will
continue to focus our training program on molecular epidemiology of cancer with new directions on human
microbiota, epigenome, post genome-wide gene-environment interactions, and integration of behavior and
molecular epidemiology, in response to a remarkable progress in the development of new sophisticated high-
throughput technologies which has enabled extensive applications of biologic markers in cancer epidemiology,
etiology, and prognostic prediction. With continuous leadership, collaborative faculty, a well-defined curriculum,
and interdisciplinary research environments, we will continue to provide trainees with opportunities to gain
experience in both cancer-specific epidemiologic methods and molecular laboratory skills. This will allow
trainees to utilize the knowledge of epidemiologic methods and molecular biology to elucidate genetic and
epigenetic predisposition and susceptibility to cancer, to study the effects of environmental exposures on
cancer risk, to describe the natural history of cancer among high-risk individuals with inherited genetic
mutations, and to evaluate post-genome-wide gene-environment/gene-gene interactions on the risk of cancer.
Special effort has been made, and will continue to be made, to recruit qualified predoc and postdoc candidates
from URM backgrounds and with M.D. training to postdoc positions. In the last five years, we have filled most
of predoc and postdoc positions. Since 2014, we have successfully recruited 5 highly qualified under-
represented minority (URM) trainees into our program (23.8%), including three pre-doctoral and two post-
doctoral trainees. In the last 10 years, our former and current pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees have
published a total of 100 unique papers. Eleven pre-doctoral trainees have graduated and eight post-doctoral
trainees have finished their training from our training program in 10 years. Graduates of the Molecular
Epidemiology of Cancer Training Program currently hold academic and research positions at leading
universities and research institutions. The Cancer Epidemiology Training Program has provided outstanding,
rigorous interdisciplinary training in epidemiology, statistics, and biology since 1975, and we hope to continue
this record of excellence in the future."
10929046,"SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH RESEARCH PROJECT – ABSTRACT
Cancer is a leading cause of death in Chicago, and Black, Latinx and low-income Chinese communities in
Chicago face significant cancer health inequities. Many observed racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes
are avoidable and research continues to identify structural racism and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) as
the major causes of cancer health inequities. Cancer patient navigation (PN) interventions have demonstrated
efficacy in resolving patients’ SDOH barriers to care and improving completion and consistency of cancer care
events, such as screening, follow-up, and treatment initiation among minoritized populations. The evidence has
contributed to the designation of PN as an evidence-based intervention. However, traditional cancer PN involves
navigators working with patients on a case-by-case basis, serving as a “Band-Aid” – temporarily mitigating some
effects of multilevel barriers to care – but rarely producing provider- and structural-level change in cancer care
delivery. Thus, we apply our experience from over a decade of PN research, in partnership with community-
based organizations with deep roots in Chicago’s Black, Latinx, and low-income Chinese communities, to
develop and test novel multilevel PN approaches within Learning Health Systems that propel a potentially
transformative new cancer PN paradigm where navigators have the tools to contribute to sustained provider-
and systems level care improvements that address SDOH and close cancer care delivery gaps at scale. Our PN
innovations address key priorities identified by our ACCERT Center community partners and in accordance with
the Center’s theme, will address structural racism, language accessibility, health literacy, and other SDOH with
the goal of mitigating cancer health inequities in Chicago’s Black, Latinx, and low-income Chinese communities.
In Aim 1, we will employ community-engaged participatory design methods to refine two multilevel PN
approaches: (1) remote PN augmented by interactive artificial intelligence (AI) agents that will automate certain
PN tasks and support patient education and coaching; and (2) remote PN augmented with 4R Oncology
(4R=Right Information and Right Treatment to the Right Patient at the Right Time) – a model which uses systems
engineering principles and Care Sequences with checklists to facilitate systematic patient-facing care planning
and team-based care delivery involving patients, providers of cancer care, social care and supportive care. In
Aim 2, we will conduct a Hybrid Type 2 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial with N=735 Black, Latinx,
and low-income Chinese adults in Chicago to compare the effectiveness of the novel PN approaches relative to
Standard PN in resolving SDOH-related barriers and improving patient receipt of cancer-related health services
(patient-level outcome), and improving patient-provider communications, and reducing medical mistrust and
experiences of racism/discrimination in medical settings (patient/provider/health-systems level outcomes). In Aim
3, we use mixed methods to evaluate implementation outcomes and multilevel implementation determinants."

racism, language accessibility, and health literacy – that have been identified as priorities by our community
partners and are SDOH focus areas for the ACCERT PN Center and its cancer patient navigation-centered
SDOH Research Project. CRP1 will use knowledge generated from Black female cancer survivors’ experiences
of an unmet need in cancer survivorship care, often dismissed or neglected by healthcare providers—information
and resources on sexual health after cancer treatment—to develop resources and training materials for patient
navigators and providers. CRP2 leverages innovations in Human-Computer/Artificial Intelligence (AI) Interaction
and Social Robotics to explore the use of AI social robots in community settings to enhance digital literacy and
cancer control health literacy among Chinese-speaking Chicago Chinatown residents who face language and
digital literacy barriers to cancer care access. Both projects will disseminate findings, lessons learned, and
resources to the ACCERT PN Center ecosystem to inform its multilevel patient navigation approaches. The two-
pronged process for soliciting applications for the CRP Pilot Grant Program will balance continuity and
relationship-strengthening through internal outreach within the ACCERT Center’s community partners to build
on existing Center projects, and broader outreach to our ACCERT PN Community Advisory Board and other
community partner networks, as well as within Northwestern University and local minority-serving institutions. A
streamlined application for proposals will reduce the burden on community partners and a community-engaged
peer review process will adapt NIH criteria to select proposals that align with community priorities related to
cancer control equity and facilitate and enhance the research related to the Center theme and the SDOH
Research Project’s intervention. CRPs will be supported by the Center’s Administrative Core and Research
Methods, Measures, and Data Management Core which will facilitate connections and integration with the

10929050,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Maternal mental illness following childbirth is associated with substantial societal costs.
Postpartum psychopathology is a leading contributor of maternal morbidity and mortality and can endanger the
child’s wellbeing onward from birth. Deprivation of maternal care during the early neonatal period can induce
long-term epigenetic alterations in a model animal, suggesting that postpartum mental illness can confer
intergenerational risks. While efforts exist to reduce postpartum depression, childbirth-related posttraumatic
stress disorder (CB-PTSD), a condition that is estimated to affect 240,000 American women each year, is
underdiagnosed and undertreated. Risk factors for CB-PTSD remain elusive, and knowledge about the
disorder’s course and impact on the child is almost entirely lacking. By generating important and substantive
data, the central objective of this proposal is to serve as a first step towards addressing the clinical gap for a
condition that should be amenable to early intervention.
In this first of its kind longitudinal prospective study, we will study pregnant women during third trimester (Wk.
32), again in the hours following delivery and will follow them at repeated time points across the postpartum (PP)
year, i.e., Day 1, Day 45, and Mos. 3, 6, and 12. Their infants will be studied at Mo. 6 and Mo. 12 PP. This
schedule will allow us to examine risk for, and development of, CB-PTSD, as well as its influence on mother-
infant bonding and early child development. Maternal CB-PTSD will be quantified using psychodiagnostic,
psychometric, and psychophysiologic measures. Psychophysiological responsivity during mental imagery of the
traumatic childbirth provides a potentially reliable biological marker of PTSD and can provide objective validation
of the CB-PTSD diagnosis. Bonding will be quantified using psychometric assessments of maternal perceptions
and an observational assessment of mother-child interaction at 6 mos. PP. Child outcomes will be quantified
using a standardized child developmental observational procedure and standardized psychometrics at 12 mos.
This study will offer new insights into the previously understudied posttraumatic dimension of postpartum
psychopathology. Our work could suggest modifications of postpartum mental health care, which currently
focuses on depression. Our findings may inform tools that can be used for early screening that may be the first
step in implementing programs that can enhance the welfare of mother and child, thereby reducing the odds of
developing a potentially preventable, costly posttraumatic disorder. In addition, the proposed study will further
the NICHD missions that “women avoid harmful effects from reproductive processes and children achieve
healthy and productive lives”."
10898888,"A core question in mental health is what underlying processes give rise to symptoms (e.g., NIMH strategic
plan goal #1). Answers may lie less in individual diagnostic categories, but instead in global,
transdiagnostic patterns of symptoms, notably their prominent and clinically useful division into
internalizing (e.g., anxiety) vs. externalizing (e.g., aggression) forms. This project aims to characterize
these two symptom clusters and their development (per NIMH strategic plan goal #2), by relating them to
computational mechanisms for decision making that have been studied in the healthy brain.
Previous computational psychiatry research grounds some internalizing symptoms such as worry in
dysregulated mental simulation, or ""internal information seeking."" Here, we propose and test a hypothesis
to extend this framework to comprise externalizing symptoms, which we suggest are grounded in parallel
dysregulation of external information seeking (exploration of the environment), building on a recent theory.
Because these computational capacities, as well as many mental health symptoms, emerge in childhood
and adolescence, there is a unique opportunity to understand their relationship via development.
We will use computational modelling to derive signatures of both sorts of information seeking from
participants' choice behavior in two reinforcement learning tasks. We hypothesize that internalizing vs.
externalizing symptoms are associated, respectively, with enhanced internal vs. external information
seeking, and further reflect aberrant developmental trajectories. We test this in Aim 1 by comparing task
behavior to psychiatric symptoms in two large general population samples collected online in adults. Next,
in Aim 2, we examine how these processes develop using the same tasks in children and adolescents,
and how this development differs in children with a diagnosed internalizing or externalizing disorder.
The present research leverages and tests a unifying computational theory that situates both types of
information seeking as parallel options in a tradeoff between acting for immediate reward vs delaying to
gather information and improve later choices. This account can overcome a crucial gap in current
computational psychiatry research, which only accounts for a relatively narrow range of symptoms. By
connecting computational neuroscience, psychiatry, and development, this project will clarify the
neurocomputational foundations of a wide range of externalizing and internalizing symptoms."

Current strategies to engineer human cells for cell-based therapeutics and biotechnologies rely upon the
genomic integration of transgenic payloads. Although these approaches have catalyzed transformative
medical advances, the integration of transgenic DNA permanently disrupts natural genomic sequences
and can lead to unexpected and even hazardous consequences. In addition, integrated transgenic DNA
is often unpredictably expressed and is prone to epigenetic silencing over time, especially within
primary/therapeutically useful cells. Further, the installation and validation of integrated cargoes is
inefficient and costly. These critical barriers limit the extent to which human cells can be repurposed and
engineered as cell-based therapeutics and these challenges are preventing biotechnological and clinical
innovations. Non-integrating, double-stranded DNA viruses have evolved sophisticated solutions to these
important obstacles, and they can stably persist within human cells as circularized self-contained
episomes or linear extrachromosomal elements across cellular divisions and for the lifetime of infected
hosts. These viruses accomplish this remarkable persistence by tailoring their own gene expression
patterns, synchronizing their genomic replication, and by reshaping endogenous transcriptional networks
in host cells. In this proposal, we will harness and redirect these natural abilities towards biomedically
useful outputs using clinical-grade non-integrating gene therapy vectors and cell types. Our project will
establish new ways to program and apply extrachromosomal DNA within human cells.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will optimize our recently developed genetically encoded extrachromosomal
modules to further refine and enable i) site-specific and tunable localization of extrachromosomal
payloads, ii) programmable episomal/extrachromosomal replication, and iii) multi-layered safety
switches; across a battery of human cell types to ensure robust utility. In Aim 2, we will deploy our
established extrachromosomal modules in four clinically proximal primary cell types using widely adopted
viral vectors for gene and cell therapies: integrase-deficient lentiviral (IDLV), high-capacity adenoviral
(HCAdV), and herpes simplex viral (HSV) vectors. In Aim 3, we will build proof-of-concept sense and
respond genetic circuits within IDLV, HCAdV, and HSV viral vectors to modulate the expression of
transgenic extrachromosomal and endogenous therapeutic payloads by combining these platforms with
synthetic CRISPR/Cas9-based transcription factors in clinically useful primary cells. Collectively, our
project will broadly empower cell engineers, synthetic biologists, and biomedical researchers with new
capabilities to tunably control the expression of therapeutic payloads from a wide array of
extrachromosomal vector systems and across a spectrum of clinical grade cell types without the hazards
and obstacles associated with genomic integration or double strand breaks."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, is a chronic condition
characterized by gastrointestinal inflammation. Among the IBD subtypes, Crohn’s disease is the most common,
affecting 1.6 million individuals in the United States today. The prevalence of IBD is increasing worldwide,
underscoring its significance as a major health issue. Despite being a significant healthcare and economic
burden there is no cure for the disease currently. The complex etiology of IBD involves a combination of genetic,
environmental, and immunological/microbial factors. Currently, the precise triggers of gastrointestinal
inflammation in IBD remains unclear. Recent studies highlight that patients with Crohn’s disease have increased
pathogenic bacteria levels and individuals with Crohn’s disease are more susceptible to bacterial infections.
Other studies have shown that microvilli and the proteins responsible for linking microvilli together, the
intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), are disorganized in Crohn’s disease patients. Under normal
physiological conditions, the IMAC are found at the tips of microvilli where they provide physical interactions
between neighboring protrusions. The IMAC increase the functional capacity of intestinal absorptive cells by
promoting dense packing of microvilli and by regulating microvilli length. To reach the microvilli tips, IMAC
components must be trafficked to the apical membrane and be correctly targeted to the tips of microvilli. It is well
documented that the molecular motor Myosin 7b traffics and anchors IMAC proteins from the apical membrane
to the tips of microvilli. Recent findings from our group have demonstrated that Myosin 5b is the molecular motor
responsible for trafficking IMAC proteins to the apical membrane of enterocytes. Interestingly, preliminary data
also suggests that Myosin 5b may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, there has yet to be a single
study that has investigated Myosin 5b, IMAC, and Crohn’s disease. This research proposal aims to investigate
how Myosin 5b regulates microvilli assembly in the intestine and investigate the degree of susceptibility of
microvilli exhibiting aberrant packing and size to pathogenic bacteria that are elevated in Crohn's disease
patients. We hypothesize that Crohn's disease patients have reduced Myosin 5b protein levels, leading to
mislocalization of IMAC components. We further hypothesize that the lack of IMAC delivery results in disordered
microvilli thereby increasing the susceptibility of the intestinal epithelium to bacterial insults. We will use both in
vivo and in vitro models to explore the alterations in Myosin 5b and IMAC components that occur in Crohn’s
disease (Aim 1), and how loss of Myosin 5b affects microvilli regulation, organization, and susceptibility to
bacterial insults (Aim 2). By employing Myosin 5b deficient mouse models and leveraging human Crohn’s
disease tissue, we aim to gain better understanding of the function of Myosin 5b in microvilli assembly and gain
novel insights into the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease."

Chronic pain is widespread in the adult population and inadequate pain control has a major negative impact on
the quality of life of chronic pain sufferers. Many currently available analgesics display modest efficacy and in
the case of opioids, addiction liability that has resulted in a dramatic increase in opioid abuse and addiction.
Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets for the development of non-opioid analgesics to
treat chronic pain. Our group has previously identified fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) as an intracellular
carrier for endocannabinoids and structurally related N-acylethanolamines, whose inhibition augments tissue
levels of both lipid classes and produces analgesia. In the periphery, FABP5 inhibition additionally blunts the
release of pro-inflammatory and proalgesic mediators, positioning FABP5 as a promising target for the
development of analgesics. Accordingly, recently developed FABP5 inhibitors display efficacy in a range of pain
models and are rapidly advancing across the preclinical pipeline, with clinical testing scheduled to begin within
several years. Despite the therapeutic potential of FABP5 inhibition in treating pain, our understanding of its
mechanisms of action remains limited. While the majority of FABP5's effects originate from the modulation of
intracellular lipid transport and receptor activation, emerging evidence indicates that subsets of FABPs can be
released from distinct cell populations under specific conditions to exert unique biological functions. In this
application we test the novel hypothesis that inflammation triggers FABP5 secretion, which is instrumental in
delivering proalgesic lipids to nociceptive sensory neurons to maintain hyperalgesia. Conversely, sequestration
of extracellular FABP5 produces antinociceptive effects. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that FABP5 binds to
and delivers a lipid of the leukotriene family to its receptor, in turn sensitizing the nociceptive channels transient
receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) to sustain pain. Specific
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that extracellular FABP5 modulates inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and will
interrogate the mechanisms underlying its cellular secretion. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that inhibition
of extracellular FABP5 or leukotriene signaling blunts inflammatory TRPA1 and TRPV1 sensitization. Specific
Aim 3 seeks to characterize the mechanisms underlying leukotriene-mediated TRPA1 sensitization. Successful
completion of the outlined aims will establish a novel paradigm linking extracellular FABP5 to pain modulation
and will provide a foundation for the development of analgesics targeting FABP5."
10904566,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 As the leading preventable cause of death, tobacco smoking causes nearly 8 million deaths globally each
year. Nearly 70% of U.S. adults who smoke want to quit, but only 7.5% manage to quit for 6 months or more.
Cigarette craving, induced or exacerbated by exposure to smoking-related cues, is a major factor in lapses in
abstinence. The goal of this project is to evaluate whether a cognitive technique for reducing negative affect,
called Affect Labeling, can be adapted into a new strategy for reducing craving in people who smoke.
 Affect Labeling refers to the act of naming an emotional experience or an emotion-inducing stimulus. Affect
Labeling reduces self-reported distress and activity in the amygdala, a key brain region linked to emotional
experience and response. Given that negative affect and craving may share neural and psychological
underpinnings, interventions that downregulate negative affect (e.g., Affect Labeling) may be effective in
downregulating craving. To examine this possibility, the Cue Labeling task was developed as a tool to regulate
craving and tested on 47 adults (Pittsburgh study) and 19 emerging adults (LA study) who smoked daily. The
objective of this proposal is to analyze these two datasets, in order to: 1) Examine the overlap in the neural
substrates of cue-elicited negative affect and craving; 2) Examine the effect of Cue Labeling on self-report
and neural markers of craving; 3) Identify the neural mechanism of Cue Labeling; and 4) Compare the neural
pathways of Cue Labeling and Cue Reappraisal, another cognitive technique for regulating craving.
 Participants completed the Cue Labeling and Cue Reappraisal tasks during fMRI after overnight abstinence
from smoking. In the Cue Labeling task, participants viewed either neutral picture cues (e.g., a man holding a
cup) or cigarette picture cues (e.g., a man holding a cigarette), and they selected one of two words (labeling
condition) or one of two pictures (matching condition) that fit the cue. In the Reappraisal task, participants
reinterpreted a cigarette cue in a way that made it less enticing, or they passively viewed neutral, negative, or
cigarette cues. During Cue Labeling, participants in the Pittsburgh study provided ratings of their craving
following each cue. During Reappraisal, all participants provided craving ratings following each cue. Primary
analyses of activation will focus on data extracted from pre-defined ROIs in the salience network and other
regions associated with craving, such as the striatum.
 Positive findings would provide the first evidence that Affect Labeling can be adapted for regulating craving.
If confirmed in trials, the potential clinical impact of this finding could parallel that of Affect Labeling. In the
same way that Affect Labeling has been identified as a method for enhancing exposure therapy for phobia,
this project may identify Cue Labeling as a method for enhancing standard therapies for addiction. Part of the
appeal of the Labeling technique is its simplicity and low cognitive demand, important advantages in
substance use disorder and particularly during withdrawal, when cognitive function may be compromised."

Collective studies from my laboratory have focused on the molecular characterization of the function(s) and
biochemical properties of the epigenetic modifiers and the mutations that are associated with human cancer.
Our goal has been to determine how the mutations in these factors molecularly change the pattern of gene
expression resulting in cellular hyperproliferation and use these molecular pathways to identify targeted
therapeutics for cancer. Our detailed structural studies supported during the past seven years by this grant
R35CA197569 have allowed us to identify the atomic structure of Set1/COMPASS, and based on this
information, we have generated inhibitors towards its activity that are now being developed in our laboratory as
a tool compound to regulate COMPASS's function in cells for the ultimate use in clinic. On other fronts, our
analyses of the role of MLL3/COMPASS identified its interactions with the histone deubiquitinating enzyme
BAP1, providing a central epigenetic balance at enhancers and the regulation of gene expression in cancer
caused as the result of MLL3 mutations. Based on this information, we have a clinical trial at Northwestern
Medicine investigating the epigenetic role of this balance in cancer therapy. We have also generated BAP1
inhibitors that can regulate hyperactivated BAP1 function in cancers caused as the result of ASXL1 mutations
and such BAP1 inhibitors are being further investigated in our laboratory as biochemical and clinical tools. Our
detailed analysis of the role of histone H3K27M mutations in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) resulted in
the identification of a role for BET-domain containing factors such as Brd2 and Brd4 in DIPG pathogenesis. We
are collaborating with colleagues at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago to test these findings in clinic. These
studies also resulted in the identification of CATACOMB as an endogenous factor mimicking H3K27M and
regulating PRC2 function. As will be described in the application, other studies in the laboratory have probed
the mechanistic properties of diverse epigenetic factors in developmental regulation and in cancer. Additionally,
recent cataloging of somatic mutations in cancer and during natural aging has identified a large number of
mutations in the components of the MLL1-4, UTX, Set1A/B, and other epigenetic factors. Given that we have
developed a fantastic set of reagents and tools over the past twenty years in our laboratory towards these factors,
their associated proteins, chromatin, and other chromatin modifiers in multiple model systems, my laboratory is
in a very unique and strong position to define the molecular bases of these factors’ involvement in cancer
pathogenesis, and thus, for the purpose of targeted therapeutics. The goals of this R35 renewal application
are the continuation of our full molecular and biochemical characterization of the trithorax COMPASS
family and BAP1 complexes in the regulation of developmental gene expression, and how their
mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancer."
10906806,"SUMMARY
 A growing number of serious disorders ranging from syndromic autism and intellectual disability to cancers
of the brain and gut have been linked to intracellular members of a family of electroneutral Na+/H+ exchangers,
including endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9 (eNHE), that regulate pH and Na+ within the compartments of
the endo-lysosomal pathway. Plasma membrane NHE isoforms have been thoroughly characterized and
pharmaceutically targeted. In contrast, intracellular NHE remain poorly studied due to limitations and challenges
in sensing organelle-specific lumenal ions. Furthermore, overlapping distributions of eNHE isoforms and
contradictory reports on the direction of sodium and proton transport within organelles has hindered a
mechanistic understanding of transporter function and physiology. Case reports linking disease to eNHE genetic
variants are sporadic and genotype-phenotype correlations are incomplete. This proposal brings together three
research groups with unique and complementary expertise, together with powerful tools and resources to tackle
these problems. To overcome the technical challenges in measuring the activity of these transporters, we have
developed a multi-functional fluorescent reporter for both Na+ and H+ to precisely assay intracellular Na+/H+
exchange. This reporter can be targeted to specific organelles to simultaneously read out Na+ and H+ levels
therein using an imaging method called two-ion measurement. In Aim 1, we will deploy this reporter to specific
compartments along the endo-lysosomal pathway to quantify [Na+] and [H+] in both healthy and disease states.
We will determine the functional contribution and mode of transport of individual eNHE isoforms in key
organelles. This aim will lay the groundwork for functional analysis of clinically impactful gene variants in eNHE.
To capture the disease landscape for eNHE, in Aim 2 we will evaluate the clinical significance of rare and
common gene variants in SLC9A6 and SLC9A9. For these analyses, we will leverage large-scale exome
sequencing of a clinical cohort, paired with their de-identified electronic health records. Combining genetic
associations, gene expression and functional analysis will provide mechanistic insight on the biological basis of
disease associated with eNHE. In summary, our comprehensive biochemical mapping of the endo-lysosomal
pathway and disease-agnostic approach to link gene variants and expression to phenotypes will capture a broad
range of cellular and clinical correlates that will pave the way to successful therapeutic targeting of these
transporters in disease."
10906807,"There is an immense national investment in Precision Medicine, however fulfillment of its promises depends on
broad utilization of genetic testing among nephrologists and patients, many of whom are from marginalized
racial/ethnic minorities. Research demonstrates that genetic forms of kidney disease are relatively prevalent,
and their identification can personalize care, yet genetic testing is not part of standard clinical care in nephrology.
This K01 proposes to identify the barriers to genetic testing in nephrology at the patient, clinician, and healthcare
system levels, and to develop and test possible facilitators. I will use a mixed methods design to collect nuanced,
currently unavailable, data on these issues with the goal of informing future implementation guidelines. Aim 1
will assess the rate of adoption of genetic testing in nephrology, and the barriers, facilitators, and acceptability
of potential implementation strategies to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing in nephrology. To address
the low confidence of nephrologists in genetics—a key barrier in effort to translate knowledge from labs to the
clinics—in Aim 2, I will use participatory design to develop a toolbox with the input of both patients and
nephrologists. The toolbox will include (i) a self-paced course in clinical renal genetics and external resources, (ii)
patient-facing materials with infographics, and (iii) a genetic literacy screen for patients. In Aim 3, I will assess the
toolbox’s potential by pilot testing it with nephrologists. This K01 will inform future efficacy trials and lay the
foundations for future research on interventions to ensure equitable access to genetic testing. Candidate: I hold
a Master in Genetic Counseling, a PhD in genetics and genomics and have a post-doctoral training in renal
genomics. To advance the implementation of genomic medicine in nephrology, there is a need for researchers
with combined expertise in genetics, nephrology, implementation science, health communication, health equity
research, and ethical, legal, and social Implications (ELSI) of genomics. My goal is to develop an independent
research program focusing on the novel field of “equitable implementation of genomic medicine in
nephrology”. During the K01’s training period, I will: (1) Develop expertise in the theoretical frameworks in
implementation science, (2) Become proficient in ELSI and health equity research, (3) Develop expertise in
qualitative research methods, (4) Refine my expertise in survey design, (5) Learn health communication research
tools and (6) Transition to independence. Environment: To guide and support my research and training goals,
I have assembled a strong mentorship team of experts in nephrology and renal genetics (Dr Gharavi, primary
mentor), translation of genomics research into clinical practice (Dr Rahm, co-mentor), implementation science
(Dr Moise, co-mentor), Equity and ELSI research (Dr Sabatello, co-mentor), health communication and
infographics (Dr Bakken, Advisor), and statistics (Dr Ionita-Laza, Advisor). The research will be conducted at
Columbia University, which will give me access to extensive research resources and training to help me
successfully transition to independence."

The goal of this study is to elicit preference-driven strategies to tailor contextually appropriate antiretroviral
therapy (ART) packages, including long-acting injectables (LAI), for youth living with HIV (YLWH) in South
Africa. Adolescents and young adults comprise 42% of all new infections in southern and eastern Africa, and
among this population in South Africa, estimated ranges of viral suppression are from 10-50%. LAIs offer a
potential solution for ART adherence and retention challenges faced by YLWH but may not work for all youth.
We hypothesize that if guided by preferences and paired with appropriate implementation strategies, LAI can
improve treatment outcomes among YLWH. Specific Aim 1: Guided by the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR), we will conduct 32 interviews with YLWH aged 12-29 years, parents, and
pediatric and adult HIV providers (counselors, nurses, doctors) to identify context-informed bottlenecks to
future implementation and opportunities for LAI delivery. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate acceptability,
appropriateness and revealed preferences for LAI among YLWH 18-29 years in a partial patient preference
trial pilot. YLWH will choose between treatment packages that include 8-weekly (2-monthly) LAI vs 2-monthly
standard oral ART pills; those with no preference will be randomized (1:1) to receive LAI vs. pills. Active follow-
up will continue for 6-months; in each arm, YLWH will be allowed to cross-over arms with clinical supervision
between 8-16 weeks. The primary endpoints will be revealed ART preference (pills vs. LAI vs. no preference)
at 0-months; and pill vs. LAI at 6-mos. Secondary clinical endpoints will include viral suppression (<50 copies
per ml) and retention on ART; other secondary endpoints will include assessments of acceptability, feasibility
and appropriateness of LAIs and adjacent strategies to retain YLWH in care. Specific Aim 3: Use preference
and clinical outcomes data from Aim 2 along with other clinical trial and emerging observational data to model
outcomes scenarios amongst YLWH. These aims will inform a fully powered R01 implementation trial,
comparing viral load-informed, tailored LAI delivery and support strategies for YLWH using a sequential
multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design."

Long-range (>10 μm) transport of electrons along networks of G. sulfurreducens protein filaments, known as
microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide range of globally important redox phenomena. The
remarkable electronic conduction capability of those nanowires has sparked a great deal of interest in the medical
application space, such as for building biocompatible materials and biosensor. For more than a decade, G.
sulfurreducens nanowires were thought to be bacterial type IV pili, supported by many indirect genetic and
biochemical observations. Recently we showed that these conductive nanowires are not made of type IV pilins.
Instead, these structures are a polymerized multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, which have never been
characterized before. The OmcS filament model is consistent with the known roles of OmcS in Geobacter
respiration, but our knowledge of cytochrome appendages is still very limited. This study aims at addressing
fundamental scientific questions about cytochrome filaments in respiring prokaryotes as well as applying our
discoveries into the general medical field. Specifically, I will: A) identify and characterize novel cytochrome
filaments in bacterial and archaeal strains, through bioinformatics algorithms followed by microscopic validation.
B) Then I will study the conduction mechanism of these filaments by high resolution cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and conductivity measurement. C) Finally, based on these new insights into cytochrome
filaments, I will create a novel design for a self-assembled conductive nanowire. These nanowires may be
derived directly from a novel cytochrome filament or may contain a peptide/protein based self-assembled scaffold

cytochrome nanowires, as well as generating self-assembling nanowire scaffolds that may be used in many

Emerging evidence suggests that age and depression, even the modest levels common in aging, may interact to
produce a “double jeopardy” for episodic memory impairment and may predict cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). The underlying cause/s of this double jeopardy is unknown. Even less is known about depression-
related memory impairments in Black/African American and Mexican Americans, despite evidence of more
disabling depression, and AD prevalence than in non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Multiple race-related proxy
factors (e.g., discrimination, vascular burden, religiosity) that may exacerbate or reduce depression-related
memory impairments but they have seldom been explored. Executive dysfunction may be an important
contributor to depression-related episodic memory impairments but studies of depression-related memory and
executive functioning impairments have been conducted in parallel. We propose a new conceptual framework in
which depression-related executive and associated PFC dysfunction underlie depression-related memory
impairments, double jeopardy effects, and ethnoracial disparities in these impairments. We will enroll 330 adults
from Black, Mexican, and NHW groups across the adult lifespan. Consistent with an RDoC framework, we will
assess depression along a continuum and examine depressive symptom dimensions (i.e., somatic, depressed
mood, etc.), and consider age of onset and chronicity that may differ by age and race/ethnicity. We will use a
combination of cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology approaches, innovative memory tasks
manipulating executive functions, univariate, multivariate, and multimodal neuroimaging, and longitudinal
clinical and cognitive assessments to identify the neural mechanisms underlying depression-related memory
impairments. With 2 fMRI experiments that use different approaches to manipulate demands on executive
functioning (Aim 1: inhibition of mnemonic interference and Aim 2: spontaneous and instructed emotion
regulation), we bridge across diverse literatures with our unifying executive dysfunction framework. In Aim 3,
we test racial/ethnic group differences in depression-related memory alterations, neural mechanisms underlying
them, and psychosocial factors that may influence group differences. In exploratory Aim 4, we use cutting-edge
analyses to explore multi-modal neuroimaging markers of depression-related memory impairment and decline in
older adults. Should the neural mechanisms by which depression negatively impacts memory depend upon age,
race/ethnicity and related psychosocial factors, it would suggest a need to update and advance current theories of
depression-related cognitive impairment to incorporate the influence of these factors. These results may reveal
who may be most sensitive to the negative cognitive effects of depression and identifying reasons why, informing
future, personalized brain stimulation or lifestyle interventions, tailored to one’s age, race/ethnicity and related
factors to reduce depression-related cognitive impairment."

 Antiviral therapy (AVT) has been a pharmaceutical success story for the treatment of both acute and
chronic viral infections in pregnant people, their developing fetuses, and newborns. Despite this, serious
adverse effects can occur due to antiviral drug-hormone interactions (DHIs). These adverse effects can result
in a substantial risk to both the patient, her fetus, and the newborn. Disruption of steroid hormone homeostasis
is critical in this phenomenon, with reports associating AVT with dysregulation of estradiol levels in pregnancy,
low birth weight and transient adrenal insufficiency in neonates, and neurodevelopmental impairments in
children later in life. These serious adverse effects require our attention in order to understand the toxicological
processes involved and inherent risks for some of the most vulnerable population groups, which is a primary
goal of this NIH funding announcement, (PAR-23-130). In order to reduce the risk for adverse health outcomes
with these drugs, we must first understand the underlying cause(s) for the toxicities associated with them. The
hepatic drug and steroid metabolizing enzymes, e.g. the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and UDP
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, are equally important in drug disposition and steroid homeostasis,
thus they sit at the interface of the DHIs attributable to AVT. Our central hypothesis is that antiviral therapy
interferes with the endogenous processes important for steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism via
enzyme inhibition, induction, and/or activation and that hepatic enzymes, in particular CYP and UGT enzymes,
are central in this interplay. Our approach consists of: 1) determining the effects of antiviral medications on
estradiol homeostasis during pregnancy in order to generate physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
models for DHI prediction of risk for estradiol metabolic imbalance, 2) quantifying the extent of antiviral drug-
hormone interaction for the human steroidogenic CYP3A7-dependent fetoplacental endocrine signaling
pathway, and 3) assessing the effect of lopinavir-ritonavir on hepatic bile acid homeostasis driven by CYP3A
ontogeny in early infancy to understand the potential risk for long-term bile acid dysregulation. We expect that
the successful completion of these specific aims will provide us with advanced mechanistic models to explain
antiviral DHIs and will allow us to predict and prevent future antiviral-based adverse DHIs in some of the most
vulnerable and understudied patient groups. This, in turn, will limit life-threatening complications and improve
health outcomes for women and children treated with life-saving antiviral medications, an important goal of the
NIH and this funding announcement (PAR-23-130)."

 Project Summary
 Following myocardial infarction (MI, or heart attack), the prolonged inflammation due to delayed transition of
proinflammatory phase to anti-inflammatory phase, and uncontrolled cardiac fibrosis following myofibroblast
differentiation, deteriorate cardiac function. As such, timely transitioning the proinflammatory phase to the anti-
inflammatory phase, and inhibiting myofibroblast formation will improve cardiac function. However, the effective
therapies to simultaneously achieve both goals remain to be established. Currently, systemic delivery of anti-
inflammatory agents did not show consistent outcomes in clinical trials, mainly because the drugs either inhibit cardiac
repair or are not delivered in a spatiotemporal manner to effectively target specific inflammatory signals. To attenuate
cardiac fibrosis, systemic delivery of TGFβ inhibitors and antibodies represents a major strategy. Yet, the efficacy is
not satisfactory because these therapies cannot essentially inhibit TGFβ pathway, and also cannot simultaneously
prevent other major pathways-induced myofibroblast formation, e.g., IL-1 pathway.
 In this project, we propose a new approach to address the above limitations. We will directly deliver, at acute MI
stage, secretome of M2 macrophages (M2Mφs), a dominated cell type in the anti-inflammatory phase, to timely
decrease inflammation in the infarcted hearts. Besides anti-inflammation function, we found that M2Mφ-secretome
increases cardiac cell survival and promotes angiogenesis in the infarcted hearts. Thus, it is multifunctional. Yet,
M2Mφ-secretome has not been explored for cardiac therapy before.
 To prevent cardiac fibrosis, we propose to deliver a newly synthesized, peptide-based inhibitor RPE that
simultaneously inhibits TGFβ and IL-1 pathways-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Our preliminary studies
demonstrate that RPE significantly reduced myofibroblast density in the infarcted hearts. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no known inhibitors that simultaneously inhibit these 2 pathways.
 To deliver the M2Mφ-secretome and RPE into infarcted hearts at the critical time window to attenuate inflammation
and myofibroblast formation - acute MI stage, while considering that direct myocardial injection has safety concerns
at this stage, we will deliver them by IV injection, after encapsulating them into infarcted heart-targeting nanoparticles.
These nanoparticles will specifically accumulate in infarcted hearts following IV injection. They will then
spatiotemporally release M2Mφ-secretome and RPE.
 We hypothesize that IV delivery of infarcted heart-targeting nanoparticles capable of releasing M2Mφ-secretome,
and RPE at the acute MI stage will efficiently decrease tissue inflammation, increase cardiac cell survival, promote
angiogenesis, and attenuate cardiac fibrosis, leading to a significant increase of cardiac function.
 AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that optimal M2Mφ-secretome composition will efficiently decrease cell
proinflammatory cytokine secretion, improve cardiac cell survival under ischemia, and promote endothelial cell
morphogenesis. AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that optimal RPE release profiles will simultaneously prevent TGFβ and
IL-1 pathways-induced cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblast. AIM 3 will test efficacy of the M2Mφ-
secretome and RPE releasing nanoparticles delivered at different times in the acute MI stage.

Pathology will hold a special session on Powerful Questions for Connecting, Collaborating, and Building
Confidence. The ASIP regards promotion of the career development of trainee and young investigators as an
extremely important aspect of the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the meeting provides not only special events
designed for their needs, but also sessions that highlight/showcase their work. Similarly, the Program Committee
works hard to ensure diversity among the participants with respect to gender, ethnic/racial group, stage of career,
and institutional affiliation. For 2024, among invited speakers: 42% are women, 55% are Assistant/Associate
Professors (or equivalent), and 90% of major sessions include speakers that are women or underrepresented.
The sole specific aim of this application is to promote the participation of trainees and young investigators in the
2024 Annual Meeting through provision of a Scholar Award program targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, clinical residents/fellows, and junior faculty members."

While experience-dependent cortical plasticity is most prominent during early postnatal development, the adult
brain retains some level of plasticity. In particular, synapses in the superficial layers of primary sensory
cortices, including the primary visual cortex (V1), remain plastic throughout adulthood. We previously reported
that a short duration of visual deprivation or auditory deprivation in adult mice produces a rather robust
plasticity in V1, which results in distinct plasticity of feedforward and intracortical synapses onto principal
neurons. V1 layer 2/3 (L2/3) not only receives feedforward information transmitted from the visual thalamus
(dLGN) through L4, but it also receives intracortical feedback projections from other cortical areas that provide
context to bottom-up visual information. We found that visual deprivation preferentially potentiates intracortical
synapses, while auditory deprivation leads to potentiation of the feedforward circuit in adult V1. Such
adaptation might underlie activation of V1 by Braille reading or speech in blind individuals or enhancement of
visual processing reported in deaf subjects. Here we will examine how such circuit-level plasticity is
established by changes in recruitment of inhibitory circuits, and how it could alter activation of adult V1 through
feedforward and intracortical inputs. Recent studies demonstrate that transient changes in the recruitment of
inhibitory circuits play a role in enabling cortical plasticity in juveniles. There are largely two distinct inhibitory
circuits in V1, one that involves parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and another that involves somatostatin (SOM)
interneurons. The former has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating visual experience-dependent
plasticity, while the latter is targeted by top-down circuits. Here we will test the hypothesis that differential
recruitment of PV and SOM circuits underlie adult V1 plasticity induced by visual and auditory deprivation. In
addition, we hypothesize the circuit level plasticity induced by visual or auditory deprivation will lead to
differential activation of adult V1 by feedforward and intracortical inputs. To test these hypotheses, we will
determine how recruitment of PV and SOM circuits in adult V1 L2/3 undergo plasticity by visual versus auditory
deprivation (Aim 1), and how V1 activation patterns from feedforward inputs (Aim 2) or long-range intracortical
inputs (Aim 3) are altered following visual or auditory deprivation. Our results will provide much needed
mechanistic information on adult V1 plasticity, and suggest how transient visual or auditory deprivation could
be leveraged to enhance the distinct functionality of the adult V1."
10908416,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RP2
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by low tumor mutational burden, impaired antigen-
presentation, low levels of infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and a non-immunogenic tumor microenvironment –
collective features which contribute to immunotherapy-resistance. There is a need to identify sensitive patient
subgroups and effective immunotherapy combinations for PDAC. Recent studies suggest that poly-ADP ribose
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) can enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade with programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade, potentially by enhancing tumor antigenicity and/or modulating the tumor
immune microenvironment. The PARPi olaparib is FDA-approved as a maintenance therapy in platinum-
sensitive germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCA-m) metastatic PDAC. Our group also reported a very high response
rate for gBRCA-m and gPALB2-m PDAC patients—which represents only 5-7% of PDAC—treated with platinum
in a phase 2 trial. Through a recent retrospective analysis (Park et al., CCR 2020), we identified that PDAC with
mutations in core homologous recombination (HR) genes (BRCA and PALB2) or non-core HR genes have
greater genomic instability and respond well to DNA damage response (DDR)-targeted agents (e.g., platinum or
PARPi), with a survival benefit, particularly when the HR gene had biallelic loss. Surprisingly, certain patients
without known HR gene mutations had exceptional responses to DDR-targeted agents, indicating there may be
additional, unidentified biological indicators beyond canonical HR gene mutations, perhaps linked to tumor
genetics and/or immune features of the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that PARPi can render PDAC
immunogenic and sensitive to PD-1 blockade in a subgroup of patients with homologous recombination
deficiency (HRD) beyond traditionally defined gBRCA-m. To test this hypothesis, we designed a phase 2 trial to
evaluate antitumor activity of pembrolizumab and olaparib (POLAR) in metastatic PDAC patients with HRD
(canonical BRCA or other HR genes) and in patients with exceptional platinum response but no HR gene
mutations. In this SPORE Research Project, we will use serial biospecimens acquired from POLAR trial patients
to understand the tumor genetics and features of the host and tumor immune ecosystem associated with
radiographic POLAR responses and resistance. We will use a combination of sophisticated genomic, single-cell
transcriptomic, and computational methods to: (1) determine mutational signatures that distinguish POLAR
response and functional consequences, (2) characterize cellular biomarkers, including tumor sub-populations,
immune infiltrates, and tumor microenvironment features associated with POLAR response, and (3) investigate
if POLAR boosts tumor neoantigenicity. We expect to identify underlying factors that differentiate responders
and non-responders and provide insights into the biologic mechanisms of response and resistance to a PARPi-
immunotherapy combinations that can guide future precision immunogenomic strategies to treat advanced
PDAC and inform opportunities for patient selection beyond those with HR gene mutations for relevant therapies."
10908417,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RP3
Immunotherapies can induce durable responses in advanced cancer patients and are the most exciting new
cancer treatments. However, as current immunotherapies directly reinvigorate preexisting anti-tumor T cells,
they are ineffective in T cell-poor (“cold”) cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). New
immunotherapies that stimulate de novo immunity are therefore needed for PDAC. To identify such strategies,
we discovered that compared to the majority of PDACs that are T-cell poor and “cold,” T-cell rich “hot” tumors
from rare long-term PDAC survivors are infiltrated by higher densities of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s),
a recently discovered lymphocyte with tissue-specific anti-tumor function. Higher densities of tumor ILC2s and
higher expression of the ILC2-activating cytokine interleukin-33 (IL33) correlated with higher CD8+ T cell density,
greater T cell cytolytic activity, and 2-fold longer survival in human PDAC. Using PDAC mouse models, we found
that systemic delivery of recombinant IL33 (rIL33) activated tumor ILC2s to produce the chemokine Ccl5, recruit
intratumoral dendritic cells, amplify intratumoral CD8+ T cells 10-fold, and restrict tumor growth. In addition, like
activated T cells, rIL33-activated ILC2s upregulated the inhibitory immune checkpoint PD-1, and combining rIL33
with PD-1 antibody blockade maximally restricted tumor growth and prolonged survival in PDAC mouse models.
Thus, our laboratory studies identify rIL33 as a novel therapeutic cytokine that stimulates de novo anti-tumor
immunity in PDAC both as a mono- and as a combination therapy with PD-1 blockade. However, as there are
currently no drugs that target the IL33-ILC2 axis, and as human PDAC tumors are immunologically
heterogeneous, the appropriate drug delivery strategy and target patient cohorts to rationally translate these
findings to PDAC patients are unknown. We will address these key knowledge gaps through three specific aims
to determine if rIL33 has anti-tumor efficacy (1) in immunologically heterogeneous PDAC molecular subtypes,
(2) in immunologically heterogeneous PDAC primary tumors and metastases, and (3) as half-life extended clinic-
compatible drugs. We will complete these aims and thereby establish the principles to translate rIL33 to patients
using mechanistic studies in orthotopic PDAC mice deficient in components of the IL33-ILC2 axis, patient-derived
organoid models of the tumor immune microenvironment, cellular and transcriptional analyses of matched multi-
site human PDAC primary tumors and metastases, and IND-enabling toxicology studies. Through these studies,
we will identify the target patient cohorts, the mechanisms of action, and the optimal drug to inform the design of
a first-in-human rIL33 clinical trial in PDAC patients by the end of the study period. This work will therefore
critically expand our knowledge of preclinical and translational biology of the novel IL33-ILC2 therapeutic axis,
accelerate its translation to patients, and address the unmet need for effective PDAC immunotherapy."

The Biospecimen Core is designed to provide expert support to the translational research efforts of the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Pancreas SPORE. The Core will leverage and extend the very
active tissue banking program and molecular diagnostics capabilities of the MSK Precision Pathology
Biobanking Core (PPBC), which anchors 4 other MSK SPOREs and the MSK Center for Pancreatic Cancer
Research. The SPORE Biospecimen Core will play an essential role in collection, annotation, storage,
distribution, and tracking of pancreatic cancer biospecimens (tissue and blood) from patients enrolled in
institutional biospecimen banking protocols and therapeutic research protocols. Detailed biospecimen
annotation, including documentation of preanalytic processing variables, pathology findings, and patient clinical
history information will be recorded in robust relational databases. We will conduct rigorous data quality
assurance and quality control measures, and standardized longitudinal follow-up of all consented patients with
materials in the pancreatic cancer biospecimen repository. The Core will also provide SPORE investigators
with expert histopathological evaluation of tumor samples, as well as assistance in performing and interpreting
immunohistochemical assays, selecting tissue for microdissection for downstream analysis, constructing tissue
microarrays, and facilitating patient-derived organoid creation. The specific aims of the core are to (1) maintain
and expand the collection, annotation, and storage of biospecimens for pancreatic cancer research, (2) perform
systematic pathologic evaluation of all relevant ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples and to prepare
appropriate biospecimens for use by SPORE investigators, and (3) provide systematic microscopic
assessment of response to therapy. Given the significant heterogeneity of pancreatic cancers, each of these
aims requires expertise beyond what existing resources can provide, underscoring the need for this Core. All
of the research projects will rely extensively on the Biospecimen Core to achieve their translational research
objectives."

The role of the Biostatistics Core is to support the investigators of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
Pancreas SPORE in the computational and statistical aspects of their research efforts, including the design and
analysis of laboratory experiments, clinical trials, molecular profiling studies, and imaging studies. Prior to the
initiation of all studies, Core staff will consult with SPORE investigators to discuss the underlying scientific
premise and translational goals of the project, to help the investigators select the most efficient and robust
analytical methods, and to estimate sample sizes to ensure adequate power to address study objectives. In
laboratory experiments, Core members will assist in the formulation of the experimental design and in the
analysis and interpretation of the data at the conclusion of the study. For clinical studies, Core members will work
with SPORE investigators to outline the major scientific objectives; the population to be studied; primary,
secondary, and exploratory endpoints; experimental design; analysis plans; and a targeted sample size justified
in probabilistic terms. At the conclusion of the trial, data analyses will be performed to assess the outcomes of
the study. For molecular studies using human tissues, Core members will closely interface with the team
members performing bioinformatics analysis and will have primary responsibility for merging molecular and
clinical data, and for performing appropriate statistical and bioinformatics analyses. The members of the
Biostatistics Core will also work with SPORE investigators to format data for publication. For imaging studies,
Core members will assess the ability of different imaging modalities to localize pancreatic cancer. Imaging
studies and radiomics analysis will also be employed to identify potential biomarkers of response to treatment.
As the research studies proceed, Core staff will suggest modifications to the design and analysis plans as
appropriate. They will also assist investigators with the preparation of any necessary graphs and tables, the
interpretation of results, the preparation of presentations and manuscripts, and will consult on the design of
subsequent research. If current statistical methodology does not adequately address a research question,
alternative methodologies will be developed. The experienced and collaborative Biostatistics Core is well
configured to provide the SPORE with a high level of statistical leadership and support that will enhance the
efficiency, quality, and quantitative rigor of its science."

 3 Neurological and mental health disorders cost the United States more than 800 billion each year. Acquiring both
 4 PET and MRI images is critical in characterizing conditions such as brain tumors, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease,
 5 and depression. Today, most patients must undergo two separate studies on PET/CT and MRI systems to
 6 acquire PET and MRI data, which is inconvenient for both the patient and referring physician and leads to
 7 software-based image fusion error, extra radiation exposure from the CT scan, and typically weeks of delay to
 8 acquire both pieces of information necessary to make informed decisions about the disease treatment. Hybrid
 9 PET/MRI can acquire PET and MRI studies simultaneously, avoiding the stated issues with two separate studies.
10 Unfortunately, the access to PET/MRI is limited by the high cost of the commercial permanently-integrated
11 PET+MRI systems, which is about $5M for purchasing the system plus a $1.5-2M room renovation cost. Today,
12 only about 50 integrated PET/MRI systems are installed in the US compared to 13,500 installed MRI systems.
13 Moreover, current whole-body PET/CT and PET/MRI systems are limited in spatial resolution and photon
14 sensitivity achievable for brain imaging. To address these needs, PETcoil is developing a portable TOF-PET
15 system that can be inserted into (and removed from) any MRI system to lower the cost to achieve simultaneous
16 PET/MR brain imaging by up to 10-fold compared to procuring a permanently-integrated PET/MRI system. It can
17 be used with multiple MRI systems for different applications (e.g., clinical and research) or employed as a
18 portable stand-alone system to provide flexible PET imaging capability. Moreover, the PET system will achieve
19 over 3 times higher photon sensitivity and over 4 times finer volumetric spatial resolution compared to state-of-
20 the-art PET/MRI systems. In Phase I, we have developed a partial PET ring of detector modules based on a
21 scalable detector module design and verified its performance and MRI compatibility. In Phase II, we will continue
22 our collaboration with Dr. Craig Levin at Stanford University to develop the full PET insert system (Aim 1), validate
23 the performance and MRI compatibility of the PET insert (Aim 2), and conduct first-in-human pilot studies to
24 validate the clinical image quality acquired with the PET insert (Aim 3). The outcome of Phase II will be the first
25 commercial prototype radiofrequency (RF)-penetrable TOF-PET insert for simultaneous PET/MR and validation
26 of its image quality in clinical pilot studies of neurological disorders. The data collected in the first-in-human study
27 will form the basis of the 510(k) submission of the device. We contend that the proposed PET insert, which allows
28 institutions with at least one MRI system to achieve PET/MRI with up to 10-fold lower cost and superior PET
29 image quality compared to current permanently-integrated PET/MR products offered on the market, will facilitate
30 dissemination of and access to PET/MRI for studying neurological and mental health disorders."
10909245,"Chronic pain contributes significantly to the current opioid epidemic. Up to 20% of postoperative patients
develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). CPSP is highly associated with chronic opioid use and dependence,
and yet routine multimodal analgesia as a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and anti-neuropathic
agents is only moderately effective in preventing CPSP. The incidence for CPSP is particularly high in patients
undergoing mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissections (25-60%). This specific
postsurgical pain condition is known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), and a recent study showed
that 1 in 10 patients continue to use opioids 3 months after surgery. We aim to study the effectiveness of
perioperative ketamine for the prevention of PMPS, within the NIH HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness
Research Network (Pain ERN). Our rationale is that ketamine can reduce key risks for CPSP including acute
pain severity, anxiety and depression, and pain catastrophizing, and in doing so can prevent the development
of PMPS. Mechanistically, ketamine is known to enhance endogenous cortical control of pain and mood. There
is strong clinical evidence for perioperative ketamine infusion in reducing postsurgical pain, and for a single
ketamine bolus (0.3-0.5mg/kg) to treat depression and anxiety associated with postsurgical pain. However,
studies are urgently needed to test the efficacy of ketamine in the perioperative period for preventing CPSP,
particularly PMPS, in a large cohort of patients and to assess clinical variables predictive for chronic pain
severity and for treatment effects. We aim to conduct a multi-site, three-arm RCT to study the effectiveness of
ketamine in reducing the incidence and severity of PMPS. 750 patients after mastectomy or breast conserving
surgery with lymph node dissection will be randomized to receive either a standard continuous ketamine
infusion starting after induction (bolus of 0.35mg/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 0.25mg/kg/hr) and
continued for 3 hours after surgery, a regimen of single-bolus ketamine (0.6mg/kg) administered right after
surgery, or placebo (saline) control. To maintain the pragmatic nature of an effectiveness trial, all patients will
receive routine postoperative multimodal analgesia. Compatible with recent NIH recommendations, we will
assess pain, function and mood over 12 months after surgery. We will use Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity
score at 3 months after surgery as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include pain incidence, BPI, short-
form McGill's Pain Questionnaire, opioid use, NIH PROMIS scales, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,
Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire. We will also build precision medicine
models to analyze clinical variables associated with CPSP and with success of ketamine treatment.
Agreements have been reached with 11 sites, including 7 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)
hubs, NYU, Columbia, Einstein, BWH, Washington University at St. Louis, Duke, and Univ. Washington, to
carry out this study successfully."
10909246,"Title: Protein assemblies as genetically encoded mechanical actuators for intracellular
mechanobiology research
Project Summary
Cells are continuously subjected to mechanical cues that regulate diverse biochemical and biophysical
processes. In the rapidly growing field of mechanobiology, various methods, including but not limited to
substrate engineering, optical/magnetic tweezers, atomic force microscopy, pipette aspiration, and
microfluidics, have been developed and exploited for mechanical manipulation of live cells. Though with
grand success, these paradigms primarily apply mechanical forces at the cellular surface, while direct
intracellular perturbation remains underexplored. The limited capability of intracellular force exertion
impedes in-depth investigation of critical fundamental questions such as how forces are translated inside
the cells and regulate the output functions. Therefore, we plan to fill the technological gap by developing
a toolbox of genetically encoded peptides/proteins as intracellular mechanical actuators. We will rationally
design and engineer peptides/proteins that can spontaneously form in-cellulo nanoscopic or microscopic
assemblies with various sizes, shapes, surface chemistries, and mechanical properties to mimic
intracellular mechanical milieu. The corresponding biological responses of cells will be probed by
molecular sensors and optical microscopy. With the assistance of numerical simulation, the mechanical
interactions between protein assemblies and subcellular structures will be recapitulated and correlated
to the change of biological processes. The tools, once developed, will be exploited to study
mechanoresponses of membrane receptors and cell nuclei. The genetically encoded mechanical
actuators can afford several distinct advantages: 1) It allows direct, chronic, and precise exertion of force
intracellularly; 2) A large number of cells can be transformed and characterized simultaneously, enabling
high-throughput probing and analysis; 3) The genetic delivery of the tool and the contact-free perturbation
makes it readily applicable to more complex and physiologically relevant biological systems, such as
organoids, ex-vivo tissues, and even the live animal models. We believe the new genetically encodable
tools can shift the paradigm for intracellular mechanobiology research and help advance our
understanding of organelle mechanosensing,"

10940906,"Tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway (KP) and kynurenic acid (KYNA)
accumulation occurs with prenatal insults, including maternal immune activation or excessive
stress. Our goal is to investigate mechanistically how specifically elevating KYNA during
pregnancy influences maternal sleep and the prenatal environment to produce negative outcomes
in the offspring. KYNA is of particular interest because it is an endogenous antagonist of α7nACh
and NMDA receptors. Increased KYNA levels reduce neurotransmission, disrupt sleep
architecture, and impair cognition. Increased brain KYNA levels (post-mortem or cerebrospinal
fluid analysis) are found also in individuals with neurodevelopmental dysfunction. We will explore
the novel hypothesis that accumulated KYNA and elevated KP metabolism, a common
denominator driving homeostatic disruption, exacerbates sleep problems during pregnancy and
contributes to disrupted neurochemical stability, sleep, and cognitive function in young adult
offspring. We predict that reducing KYNA by (i) targeting its primary synthesizing enzyme
kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) or (ii) mechanistically interfering with its sites of action
will lead to improved maternal sleep dynamics and offspring outcomes. KP metabolism and KYNA
levels will be increased by feeding kynurenine-laced chow to pregnant rats (‘EKyn diet’). We will
test the predictions that excessive prenatal KYNA plays a mechanistic role in a) poor sleep during
pregnancy and b) contributes to long-lasting neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities in
offspring. Aim 1: Define sleep problems during pregnancy when KYNA formation is up-regulated.
Hypothesis: Elevated KYNA in dams deteriorates sleep during pregnancy and targeted inhibition
of KAT II can improve sleep quality. Aim 2: Treat neurochemical abnormalities underlying long-
lasting poor outcomes (sleep and cognition) in adult offspring from elevated kynurenine during
prenatal period (EKyn diet). Hypothesis: Elevated brain KYNA in EKyn offspring drives
neurochemical imbalances, deficits in sleep and learning behavior. Aim 3: Prevent adverse
behavioral endophenotypes in offspring via choline-supplementation or dual-orexin receptor
antagonism during prenatal kynurenine treatment (EKyn diet). Adverse consequences of elevated
KYNA during pregnancy can be mitigated by potentiation the 𝛂7nACh-R via choline-
supplementation during neurodevelopment. Dual-orexin receptor antagonism in pregnant rats will
attenuate maternal sleep disruptions. The proposed research will advance our understanding of
common molecular mechanisms between a neurodevelopmental insult, sleep disturbances and
neurocognitive impairments, paving the way for novel therapies to alleviate these outcomes."
10941357,"Abstract
The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness and describe implementation of a home based exercise
intervention for persons with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This study is based on the NIH
stage model of behavioral interventions (stage III effectiveness) that aligns with the strategic mission of the
NHLBI, to optimize clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease (Obj #6). The
study intervention is based on the protocol and monitoring components that were developed in prior RCTs and
a pilot study conducted by our team. From these studies, we created a home based exercise program called
Exercise-ICD (E-ICD) for testing in a broader range of ICD patients, that assists individuals to start and monitor
exercise safely after an ICD. An randomized two group (E-ICD vs. usual care) pragmatic effectiveness mixed-
methods study is proposed, to determine the effectiveness of the E-ICD intervention and describe
implementation by cardiac rehabilitation (CR) clinical staff. Two hundred ten (N=210) patients in 3 local study
sites (70/site) in the greater Seattle, WA area will participate. E-ICD is guided by the Reach-Effectiveness-
Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) model. The E-ICD intervention consists of 12 weeks of home
walking exercise using exercise prescriptions and protocols validated in our previous work. The primary
effectiveness outcome is patient physical activity (steps/day) after the E-ICD intervention at 3 months. We will
determine the number of patients who reach the public health walking goal of moderate level exercise of 150
minutes/week at the end of the study. Measures will be taken at baseline, after the intervention at 3 months,
and at 6 and 12 months to determine maintenance. The specific aims are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that
participants randomized to E-ICD vs. usual care (UC) will demonstrate increased physical activity (minutes
walked/week) [primary outcome], health related quality of life, gait speed, mobility, exercise self-efficacy; and
reduced ICD shock anxiety and depression at 3 months (E-ICD Effectiveness), 2) Assess longer term effects of
E-ICD on participant and health care system Maintenance, captured by 1) participant retention, satisfaction,
and adherence at 12 months (total minutes/week), and 2) clinician and institutional intent to sustain use of the
E-ICD intervention after the study, and 3) Evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of E-ICD by CR
clinical staff. Reach will be assessed by the diverse patient participation rate, representativeness, and reasons
for non-interest. Adoption is the participation rate and representativeness of the settings and staff who
participate, and factors related to adoption. Implementation will be assessed by delivery fidelity of E-ICD and
workflow adaptations, implementation costs, and consistency of delivery across settings. Intervention
effectiveness will be described by participant social determinants of health (SDoH)."
10919787,"CARDIAC TOXICITY OF FLAVORINGS IN ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Tobacco cigarette smoking is on the decline, but the usage of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is
gaining popularity, specifically in the teen and young adult age groups. While the cardiac toxicity of tobacco
cigarette smoking has been widely studied and is well established, the possible cardiac toxicity of ENDS
products and their design characteristics, such as added flavorings, are largely underexplored. For instance, a
form of electronic nicotine delivery known as vaping, uses “e-liquid” in order to generate “e-vapor”, an inhalable
smoke-like aerosolized mixture containing nicotine and flavors. Here, we propose to investigate how e-liquids
with different flavors affect cardiac in-vitro and in-vivo toxicity, in cell culture and in animal models. Our
hypothesis is that inhalation exposure to e-liquid flavorings increases cardiac oxidative stress, leading
to electrophysiological toxicity and arrhythmogenesis. We will conduct our studies in three aims: 1)- To
investigate the in-vitro cardiac harm and toxicity of e-liquid flavorings, 2)- To investigate the in-vivo cardiac
harm and toxicity of e-liquid flavorings, and 3)- To investigate the role of oxidative stress in mediating the
cardiac toxicity of e-liquid flavorings. We believe that this proposal will produce new, useful and focused
insights into the potential in-vivo and in-vitro adverse effects of e-liquid flavorings using functional and cellular
indicators of cardiac harm. Our findings will hopefully be valuable in increasing our understanding of whether
the flavoring aspect of ENDS products design could cause cardiac in- vivo and in- vitro toxicities."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
   
Over five million Americans have Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this number is expected to triple by 2050 unless effective preventive strategies are identified. Veterans are at an even higher risk for AD than the general population, possibly due to their increased exposure to factors that accelerate AD pathology, including vascular risk factors, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. AD pathology occurs decades before cognitive symptoms occur and is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reduced regional cerebral blood flow in areas of the brain related to memory and learning. While cerebral arterial dysfunction occurs early in the development of AD pathology and decades before symptoms begin, the effects of treating such early vascular dysfunction in the brain are poorly understood. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves arterial function and cerebral blood flow, attenuates adverse brain changes related to β-amyloid protein, and improves cognition in animals - changes that could all potentially protect against AD. However, it is not clear whether EPA beneficially affects these processes or cognitive performance in cognitively-healthy adults at increased risk for AD. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first high-dose prescription EPA-only medication to treat hypertriglyceridemia, called icosapent ethyl (available as Vascepa(r) in the United States). This agent is readily available for use and has a good safety profile, making it a favorable agent to consider for AD prevention. The proposed study is a proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial assessing the efficacy of 18 months of icosapent ethyl therapy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognitive biomarkers for AD in 150 cognitively-healthy Veterans ages 50-70 with increased risk for developing AD due to parental history of the disease and increased prevalence of apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele. The overarching goal of this trial is to assess whether icosapent ethyl beneficially affects intermediate physiological measures associated with onset of AD in order to evaluate whether larger, multi-site, longer-duration Alzheimer's prevention trials are warranted to assess more definitive clinical outcomes. Hypothesis: In middle-aged and older cognitively-healthy Veterans with parental history of AD and high APOE4 prevalence, 18 months of treatment with icosapent ethyl will beneficially modify preclinical AD biomarkers, including regional cerebral blood flow, CSF markers of AD pathology, and cognitive performance. Specific Aim 1: To investigate the effects of 18 months of icosapent ethyl 4 g daily vs. placebo on arterial spin-labeling MRI regional cerebral blood flow in a pre-defined statistically-identified region of interest affected early in preclinical AD; Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of 18 months of icosapent ethyl vs. placebo on CSF biomarkers of preclinical AD pathology (CSF β-amyloid- 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181); Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of 18 months of icosapent ethyl vs. placebo on a composite measure designed to assess preclinical cognitive changes - the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). If icosapent ethyl beneficially modifies AD biomarkers in at-risk Veterans, the results from the proposed trial would be used to develop multi-site, longer-duration clinical trials using the VA Cooperative Studies Program to assess the efficacy of icosapent ethyl on not only AD biomarkers, but also on more clinically definitive outcomes, such as rate of cognitive decline and conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). If future studies show that icosapent ethyl delays the onset of AD by even an average of 5 years, estimates suggest that this could reduce the prevalence of AD by about 50%."
10919867,"Cognitive impairment related to dementia is frequently under-diagnosed in primary care settings. This problem is more prevalent in health disparities populations. We developed the 5-Cog brief cognitive assessment that is simple to use, standardized, takes <5 minutes, does not require informants, and accounts for major technical, cultural, and logistical barriers of current assessments. We are presently conducting a simple randomized clinical trial to examine the clinical efficacy of the 5-Cog paradigm (5-Cog brief cognitive assessment paired with a clinical decision-making tool) to improve dementia care in 1,200 predominantly minority sample of older adults with cognitive concerns presenting to a primary care clinic in the Bronx. Interim analysis revealed that the 5-Cog paradigm resulted in an over 8-fold increase in new cognitive impairment diagnoses and over 3-fold increase in improved dementia care actions by primary care physicians compared to an active control arm. Following up on these very promising results, in this renewal, we propose a hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation design in real-world settings to adapt and test the effectiveness of the 5-Cog paradigm to increase detection of cognitive impairment care in older adults presenting with cognitive concerns. Study aims include: 1. To evaluate, using a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial design, the effectiveness of the 5-Cog paradigm to increase ‘incident cognitive impairment’ detection (new MCI and dementia diagnoses) relative to enhanced usual care in 6,600 older patients presenting with cognitive concerns in 22 primary care clinics in Bronx and Indiana. As diagnosis without action will not improve patient care, ‘improved dementia care’ will be examined as a secondary outcome.  Results will also be examined in NIH designated health disparity populations including minority, socio-economically challenged, and rural underserved populations. 2. To measure, using mixed methods guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the mechanisms and the moderators of the implementation of the 5-Cog paradigm in the diverse primary care clinics. 3. To assess the cost effectiveness of the 5-Cog paradigm from a societal perspective. This proposed study, which is highly responsive to RFA-NS-22-009, focuses on scalable approaches to address the unmet need of early detection of incident cognitive impairment, including in populations that experience health disparities."
10920380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Present day multimodal monitoring for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is limited in its implementation as it
necessitates multiple invasive probes to measure intracranial pressure (ICP), intracranial EEG (icEEG),
intracranial temperature (icT), and brain tissue oxygen (PBTO2), the majority of which require their own
instrumentation and monitors. While there is increasing evidence to support multimodal monitoring in TBI and
other acute brain injuries, the present cumbersome systems make it nearly impossible to use outside of major
Level 1 trauma centers. The challenges include the need for expertise with both probe placement and data
interpretation as well as the integration of multiple electronic units from different vendors with diverse software
systems, each requiring training, IT and biomedical engineering support. Coupled with this is an increased risk
of bleeding and infection from the multiple entry points into brain parenchyma. Our objective is to develop a
single source brain monitoring solution for the management of severe TBI. We will integrate the modalities
indicated for severe TBI (ICP, icEEG, icT, PBTO2) in a brain implantable device called the NeuroProbe with a
target diameter which is equivalent to, or smaller than, individual current probes. We will develop a single
interface device called the NeuroLink to acquire the multi-modal intracranial data from the NeuroProbe as well
as scalp EEG and patient physiological data including systemic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), mean
arterial pressure (MAP) and blood oxygen (SpO2) and transmit these sensor signals to monitors as a time-
locked single digital data stream. We will develop a display unit called the NeuroMonitor to analyze and display
the acquired multimodal data in a synchronized real-time manner. We call the composite solution created by
the NeuroProbe, NeuroLink, and NeuroMonitor devices the NeuroProbe Solution. The technological
development of the NeuroProbe Solution dramatically expands the capabilities of the existing icEEG depth
electrodes developed at Yale University and multimodal probes currently on the market. The key innovations of
the NeuroProbe Solution are:
1. Integration of multiple physiologic sensors on a single intracranial probe (NeuroProbe).
2. Simplification of NeuroProbe to allow placement at bedside in a civilian or military facility.
3. Development of a multimodal interface device (NeuroLink) to store and relay time-locked digital data
 acquired from the NeuroProbe and extracranial sensors to the NeuroMonitor and other clinical monitors.
4. Development of an iPad sized monitor (NeuroMonitor) to analyze and display multimodal data.
5. Time-locked multi-stream data transfer which allows for real-time and post-hoc data review and analysis.
This innovative solution allows acquisition and integration of data from multiple physiological parameters
through a standard small tablet creating a simple single end-to-end solution from sensors to multimodal data
analysis and display in an otherwise fragmented and complex domain."
10920381,"SUMMARY: Obesity is associated with increased risk for 13 cancers. Critical questions are how and to what
extent underlying mechanisms of obesity-mediated increases in chronic inflammation may increase cancer risk
in a failure of “protective immunity”. This knowledge gap represents an untapped opportunity that our multidis-
ciplinary team is uniquely qualified to explore with a mission to improve understanding of cancer risk. We have
previously shown obesity alters T cell and macrophage functions that could decrease anti-tumor protections
and have expertise in human studies essential for this interdisciplinary challenge. Our objective is to identify
associations in human subjects and test mechanisms of mediators of cancer risk in various pre-clinical models
along an “obesitymicrobes metabolites protective immunity” axis. Our hypothesis is that obesity-altered
gut microbes enhance cancer risk through dysregulated protective immunity that allows increased initiation.
Aim 1 will define obesity-mediated dysregulation of microbial-derived metabolites and impacts on immune phe-
notypes and protective immunity in human subjects at greater risk for cancer by examining diverse subjects
1a) of varied age and adiposity; and 1b) obese patients pre- and post- bariatric surgery. Donors will be drawn
from the Memphis area, which offers a highly diverse population with 65% African Americans with a high inci-
dence of obesity. Patient analyses will inform studies in complementary pre-clinical models to allow for mecha-
nistic investigation to identify conserved mechanisms in the pre-cancer microenvironment. Aim 2 will deter-
mine the impact of microbially-derived metabolites on cancer risk by examining immune cells in spontaneous
transgenic models of breast cancer with established heterogeneity in latency, obesogenic response to high fat
diet, circulating bile acids, and gut microbes. Aim 3 will test dietary administration of a specific microbially-de-
rived metabolite or microbe on protective immunity in complementary carcinogenic and syngeneic models of
obesity-mediated breast cancer, respectively. Human subject and murine model studies complemented by ex
vivo and in vitro studies will test underlying mechanisms to determine how microbially-modified metabolites
may impact immune-cancer cell crosstalk. Collaborative funds for cross-consortium activities are reserved for
risk assessment across heterogenous lean and obese populations and models across aims to add synergistic
impact to our findings through NCI’s Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Program. In sum, outcomes will
define beneficial microbially-derived metabolites that impact protective immunity to reduce cancer initiation.
Thus, the strategy of this proposal is conceptually original, innovative, and significant to define conserved un-
derlying mechanisms that suppress cancer risk. Findings generated will have high impact because the obesity-
associated etiological impacts on risk will be heterogeneous and this study is designed to investigate those
varied mechanisms to translate to better risk management to improve patient outcomes."
10920382,"Mutant RAS genes drive cancer more frequently than any other oncogene. Oncogenic RAS proteins transform
cells only when associated with cellular membranes. Membrane association is mediated by post-translational
modifications, including farnesylation, aaX proteolysis, carboxyl methylation, and palmitoylation. For more
than two decades my laboratory has focused on the post-translational modification and membrane targeting of
RAS and related small GTPases. We have made paradigm-shifting contributions to the field including the
discovery that RAS traffics upon and signals from endomembranes as well as the plasma membrane (PM). These
observations established the field of compartmentalized signaling of RAS. Early attempts to treat cancer with
farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) failed in the clinic not because membrane association is dispensable for RAS
function but rather because FTIs did not block membrane association. We have since sought more effective
means of limiting membrane association of RAS. In recent work we have focused on KRAS and NRAS, the
isoforms most often mutant in tumors. We have established phosphorylation of KRAS4B as a means of
modulating membrane association and function, characterized the differential membrane trafficking of KRAS4A
and KRAS4B, the two splice variants of the KRAS locus, developed quantitative assays for KRAS4B membrane
association that were applied to genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR screens, and discovered differential effects of
the two splice variants on tumor metabolism. Perhaps most remarkable is our recent discovery that hexokinase
1 (HK1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in glycolysis, is an effector of KRAS that is specific
to the KRAS4A splice variant by virtue of its unique subcellular trafficking (in press in Nature). We have also
discovered that NRAS is uniquely sensitive to inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethytransferase (ICMT),
the CaaX modifying enzyme we first identified. Over the seven years of funding that we seek through the R35
mechanism we propose to build on these discoveries. The overarching scientific question to be addressed is
whether the differential modification and membrane trafficking of RAS proteins can reveal new therapeutic
vulnerabilities. Specifically, we will a) characterize HK1 as an effector of KRAS4A and explore more broadly
the differential effects on tumor metabolism driven by the two splice variants of the KRAS locus, b) pursue hits
from a recent, innovative screen that revealed previously unappreciated genes, including several druggable
protein kinases, that are required for efficient membrane association of KRAS4B, and c) determine if ICMT
inhibition is viable approach to treating NRAS-driven melanoma. Our approach will be innovative,
multidisciplinary, and collaborative. We have recruited experts to serve as collaborators in kinase biochemistry,
super-resolution microscopy, structural biology, genome regulation, metabolomics, cancer genomics, single-cell
transcriptomics, and rodent genetic engineering and imaging. We expect that the work proposed will lead to
new insights into basic RAS biology and reveal vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically."
10920619,"Abstract of the Funded Parent Award
Older African American (AA) women have the highest prevalence of both obesity and frailty. In academic, expert-
led interventions, obese, frail, older individuals both lost weight and improved their physical function. However,
because of high personnel costs and nonexistent nationwide infrastructure, large-scale implementation of these
interventions is impractical. The long-term goals are to eliminate the health disparities of obesity and frailty in
older AA women. This proposal’s overall objective is to determine the effects of a low-cost, community-based,
peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure on obesity, physical function, and healthcare
utilization in older AA women. To treat obesity and frailty in older AA women, it is critical to test a weight loss
intervention that 1) has preliminary evidence of benefit; 2) is acceptable to older AA women; 3) is affordable; and
4) can be broadly disseminated. Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) is a national, nonprofit, community-based,
peer-led weight loss program that meets these criteria. First, the applicant’s retrospective database analyses of
TOPS showed two important results: 1) Participants who renew their annual membership lose and maintain
significant weight loss (SWL) for up to 7 years; and 2) Compared to their younger counterparts, older women
are more likely to achieve SWL. Second, the applicant started three TOPS chapters for older AA women in a
successful pilot study. Though the study ended in 2012, one of the chapters was active almost 8 years later until
the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Third, TOPS is affordable; it only costs $92 annually. Finally, TOPS has
a nationwide infrastructure with chapters in all 50 states. Since obese, frail, older individuals in academic, expert-
led weight loss interventions can improve their physical function, the central hypothesis is that a low cost,
community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure can provide SWL, improved
physical function, and lower healthcare utilization for AA women, an underserved, vulnerable population. The
rationale for the proposed research is that TOPS and academic, expert-led weight loss interventions share
components critical to successful weight loss; therefore, TOPS can deliver similar outcomes. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following aims in obese, frail, older AA women: Determine the effect of
TOPS on 1) weight change and cardiovascular disease risk factors; 2) physical function and quality of life; and
3) healthcare utilization. This project is innovative because it uses a “community to academia” approach to treat
the health disparities; our study population focuses on older AA women; our outcomes focus on weight, physical
function, and healthcare utilization; and our unique study settings. The proposed research is significant because
determining the real-world effectiveness of the TOPS program and its impact on weight, physical function, and
healthcare utilization in AA women can have a widespread impact on the older population at large. Thus, it has
the potential to reduce adverse geriatric outcomes among all older individuals."
10941031,"Project Summary
Infectious disease is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Transmission dynamic models have
played a critical role in guiding interventions related to many infectious pathogens, including HIV, influenza,
SARS-CoV-1, ebolaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and mpox. Models project how potential interventions (e.g., non-
pharmaceutical measures, therapeutics, and vaccines) may affect disease future transmission. However, they
often rely on small scale studies to project effects, and there have been growing concerns that models may
produce inaccurate, overly optimistic estimates of population-level intervention effectiveness. Observational
causal inference models, which measure intervention effectiveness in real-world settings, could help address
this limitation, but applying these to infectious disease is not straightforward. Observational approaches, such
as difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, estimate the impact of an intervention based on
empirical counterfactuals: comparing outcomes of interest between treated units or places and similar
untreated units. While well-understood with linear outcomes, they can produce biased and misleading results
in the context of nonlinear transmission dynamics. Even where observational models perform well, it further
remains challenging to transport estimates to new settings to project the impact of future interventions. To
address these issues, this project will develop comprehensive theoretical architecture for synthesizing
transmission dynamic models with observational causal inference models – employing empirical
counterfactuals while accounting for complex biological and population dynamics. In the retrospective
workstream, I will propose robust specifications for observational causal inference models that can estimate
unbiased treatment effects in policy evaluations using infectious disease outcomes. I will also develop model
selection and decision-analytic methods to address potentially significant parameter uncertainty. In the
prospective workstream, I will develop approaches to generalize estimates from observational causal inference
models to new settings using transmission dynamic models and update projected effects in real-time based on
local surveillance indicators. I will illustrate the implications of our methods by re-analyzing prior studies on
COVID-19 as well as applying them to answer new questions about respiratory illness control, in collaboration
with partners in state and local public health institutions. Across both workstreams, I will develop and
disseminate open-source public tools and software to facilitate adoption of these methods. Overall, this work
will produce a suite of methodological innovations to improve understanding of the impact of past policies and
the accuracy of future projections, while also supporting their implementation in public health institutions to
guide planning and priority setting."

The ability to make appropriate actions, as well as to inhibit unbeneficial actions, is a key aspect of sensorimotor
learning. Our recent work has used the mouse whisker system as model for sensory-guided learning to identify
an important and previously unknown role for synaptic input from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to the
dorsal striatum (DStr) as a substrate for response inhibition. This renewal proposal aims to test the idea that the
relative synaptic innervation of striatal parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons compared to the spiny
projection neurons (SPNs) is a circuit mechanism for behavioral response inhibition. We will use a suite of in
vivo imaging and optogenetics experiments, as well as ex vivo electrophysiology experiments to measure and
manipulate neural circuitry from two important brain areas: S1 and thalamic posterior medial nucleus (POm) to
test their roles in modulation of DStr. Preliminary results suggest that S1 and POm influence behavioral
performance of a texture discrimination task in opposing ways, allowing for focused tests of our hypotheses of
the synaptic circuitry mediating these learned behaviors. Our integrative in vivo and ex vivo approach, combining
manipulation of specific neural pathways, longitudinal tracking of genetically identified neurons, anatomical
analysis, and ex vivo synaptic measurements will allow us to investigate the neural circuit basis of learned
response inhibition at a scale not before achieved. A major goal is to address the gap in knowledge on the roles
of S1 and POm projections to the striatum and their influence on behavior. The results will have implications for
the neural circuitry underlying cognitive control, which will aid our understanding the basis of neurological
disorders involving deficits in cognitive control."
10757346,"Abstract
The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, was identified in 1990, yet fundamental questions
remain unanswered concerning its intracellular location(s), binding partners, and signaling
properties. It is known that the large (>200kd) tumor suppressor protein contains a small
domain that turns of RAS proteins, so that loss of NF1 function leads to RAS activation on
cell stimulation. The remaining NF1 sequence can interact with a chaperone, SPRED1, and
other proteins in vitro and/or in specific cell types. In Schwan cells, NF1 loss results in
formation of neurofibromas, tumors in the peripheral nerves. It is still unknown which
interaction partners and RAS proteins are relevant in Schwann cells. Here we propose to
identify NF1 interaction partners, including relevant RAS proteins, that contribute to Schwann
cell tumorigenesis. This is because in mammals there are six highly homologous NF1-related
RAS paralogs, divided into two families. Our studies rely on interdisciplinary approaches,
including cell/mouse genetics, and state of the art biochemical and molecular biology
techniques, and our expertise in preclinical testing. Our preliminary data, enabled by new
reagents and technologies, supports key roles for canonical RAS proteins in NF1 mutant
Schwann cell proliferation. We will now assess the specific roles of RAS proteins in primary
Schwann cells in vitro, and in neurofibroma in vivo, and test a potential targeted therapy in
vivo. Importantly, whether neurofibromin has Schwann cell-specific interaction partners
beyond RAS proteins is unknown. Using proximity biotinylation our preliminary studies
identify novel potential NF1-interaction partners in Schwann cells. We will identify complexes
containing neurofibromin and these proteins and specific RAS paralogs, and additional
complexes that may form on cell stimulation, and test if blocking identified pathways is useful
therapeutically."
10907512,"Influenza alone kills as many as 500,000 people annually, and at least 4.5 million have died
from SARS-CoV-2 during this ongoing pandemic, with mortality from both respiratory viruses
largely due to viral pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Significant focus has been placed on regeneration of the epithelium after influenza, but relatively
little is known as to how the endothelium is repaired, a critical question since vascular
endothelial integrity is necessary to prevent ARDS-associated pulmonary edema, hypoxemia,
and mortality. We recently demonstrated that at least 20% of the lung's vascular endothelium is
regenerated by 1 month after infection, indicating a robust capacity for endothelial repair. We
therefore investigated signaling pathways which might modulate this regenerative functionality.
Somewhat unexpectedly given its role in promoting fibrosis, we observed that endothelial-
specific blockade of TGF-β signaling prevents effective repair of the lung endothelium and
results in inefficient physiologic recovery. Moreover, in order to achieve coordinated, functional
tissue repair, we reasoned that lung endothelial cells might influence repair of the adjacent
epithelium by release of angiocrine factors. In keeping with this notion, we identified a
matricellular protein, SPARCL1, which is secreted by injury-activated endothelial cells and
serves to enhance alveolar epithelial regeneration, at least in part by modulating TGF-β. Based
on our cumulative findings, we hypothesize that injury-activated endothelial cells engage
a TGF-β / SPARCL1 axis to coordinately regulate lung endothelial and epithelial repair.
The major objectives to address this hypothesis are 1) mechanistically define how TGF-β
promotes lung vascular repair and 2) determine whether and how SPARCL1 acts as an
angiocrine factor to promote alveolar epithelial regeneration. Successful completion of these
studies will inform approaches designed to enhance endothelial cell regenerative potential and
promote effective lung repair / prevent mortality in ARDS and viral pneumonia."

The prevalence of mental disorder is three times greater in humanitarian settings relative to global averages.
Challenges to implementing mental health services in complex emergencies amplify health disparities for hard-
to-reach populations. Migrants transiting to a destination country are among those hardest to reach and retain
in care given their mobility and peripheral connections with established health systems. Innovative strategies
are needed to improve access to mental health services for migrants in transit. The goal of this K01 Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award is to prepare the candidate for an independent research career
dedicated to improving access to evidence-based mental health services for the hardest-to-reach populations
in humanitarian emergencies. Through this K01 award, the candidate will leverage the training resources
available through Columbia University and her mentorship team to acquire the skills needed in systems
science and human-centered design to develop and test strategies for improving reach and retention of
migrants in transit in scalable psychological interventions. The goal of this K01 research is to optimize
implementation of Problem Management Plus (PM+), a scalable psychological intervention, to improve reach
and retention of Venezuelan migrants transiting through Colombia. This research builds on an ongoing
research partnership between Columbia University and HIAS, a humanitarian non-governmental organization
in Colombia. The specific aims are: 1) To describe the individual-, community-, and systems-level relationships
that influence reach and retention in mental health services among Venezuelan migrants in transit in Colombia
using group model building; 2) To design and optimize an implementation plan to improve reach and retention
in PM+ among Venezuelan migrants in transit in Colombia through human-centered design; and 3) To
compare reach and retention in PM+ using the locally designed implementation plan relative to PM+
implementation-as-usual among Venezuelan migrants in transit in Colombia with a comparative interrupted
time series analysis. This research is an integral component of a rigorous training and career development
plan involving intensive training and mentorship in systems science, human-centered design, adapting
implementation strategies, and understanding structural, cultural, and social determinants of access to care
among migrants in transit in Latin America. This study will be the first to optimize implementation of mental
health services for migrants in transit and will provide critical preliminary data to inform an R01 application to
test promising implementation approaches at scale. This research aligns with NIMH’s strategic objective to
develop innovative service delivery models to improve mental health in diverse communities and populations,
as well as the priorities of the NIMH Global Mental Health and Human Mobility Research Program."
10908478,"Implanted leads are critical for direct interfaces to the peripheral nervous system and have been used clinically
since the 1960s. Even so, no open-architecture or open-source leads are available for autonomic nerve
stimulation and recording. This is especially a problem for interfacing with soft, small diameter nerves measuring
1 mm or less. Since these are of great interest as targets in bioelectronic medicine, NEST 4 will introduce a new
open-architecture nerve interface based on a helical cuff format. This cuff addresses the limitations of
downscaling traditional materials and fabrication methods for polydimethylsiloxane-based cuffs and instead
adopts a different scheme to achieve practical nerve cuffs using a composite Parylene C-PDMS structure.
 The CARSS helical microfabricated cuff uses soft polymers and thin film electrodes to achieve a miniaturized
cuff form factor. The contra-rotational helical cuff design is achieved by post-processing the Parylene electrode
array using a thermoforming process to achieve the final three-dimensional shape. The helical design is self-
sizing and self-closing which avoids the need for sutures. The cuff is accompanied by a minimally invasive,
custom endoscopic tool that will simplify surgery and allow access to deeper autonomic nerve branches.
 In NEST 4, the Parylene helical cuff will be developed, benchtop tested, and demonstrated with the surgical
placement tool, paving the way for a widely accessible cuff for smaller nerves in clinical bioelectronic medicine

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Microbiota and Cancer Immunity, organized
by Drs. Giorgio Trinchieri, Jenny P.Y. Ting and Hsing-Jien Kung. The conference will be held in Taipei, Taiwan
from March 17-20, 2024.
The concept of inflammation being linked to tumor promotion or tumor microenvironment initiation has evolved
to include a complex network of interactions: innate and acquired immune response to the tumor; metabolism in
tumor and immune cells; local and systemic effects of the microbiota on tumor predisposition, promotion,
response to therapies; and finally, cancer co-morbidities and therapeutic side effects. The metabolic tumor
environment affects the activity and metabolism of immune cells, which modulates tumor progression and the
response to therapies, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Innate signaling also affects
the tumor microenvironment, and complex crosstalk involving innate receptors, trained immunity, and class I
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) regulates both inflammation and anti-tumor immunity. Further,
advances in experimental animals, and more recently, in cancer patients, are unraveling the complex interactions
between the microbiota at epithelial surfaces and within the primary tumor and metastatic sites with response to
therapy; these insights raise the possibility of predicting patient responses to various therapies and to target
microbiota for improving therapy responses, decreasing toxicity and preventing co-morbidity. These new
scientific areas featured in this conference program will bring together aspects of cancer biology and immunity
that are often only discussed at separate specialized meetings and will expose the audience of basic and clinical
investigators to these new concepts. The conference will also explore the clinical translation of these rapidly
emerging insights in cancer immunobiology, which will include a workshop entitled Effects of Race and Ethnicity
on Microbiome: Impacts on Cancer Health Disparities that will focus attention on health equity topics related to
cancer and therapeutic responses among ethnically distinct and/or disadvantaged populations."
10908309,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Bladder cancer is the 7th most common malignancy worldwide and has the highest recurrence rate of any cancer
(70%).1–3 Patients with risk factors (smoking, arsenic / chemical dye exposure) and / or hematuria are routinely
screened for bladder cancer via analysis of voided urine. The cellular elements of the urine are deposited to
glass slides, stained, and examined by a cytopathologist for features of bladder cancer using the gold standard
Paris System for Urine Cytopathology.4 However, the Paris System is subjective and the morphology of urothelial
cells is highly varied, making the process difficult and prone to high interobserver variability and human errors
borne of fatigue and overwork.5,6 A more quantitative, automated method of assessing urine cytopathology for
bladder cancer is needed. Machine learning (ML) technologies have proven to be highly effective in image based
classification in pathology, in that ML models operate reproducibly and without bias (unless the training data is
biased) or fatigue. Pap smears are already routinely processed by a semi-automated ML system (BD
FocalPoint), and share many common features with urine cytology specimens in that both are cancer screening
tests relying on cellular and nuclear morphology and prepared by Liquid Based Preparation (LBP, e.g. ThinPrep)
methods. Yet to date no system has been developed to harness ML for bladder cancer in this way, a fact I intend
to change. While it is my strong belief that pathology as a discipline is poised to make the transition to a 100%
digital service, there is significant inertia to overcome to replace the current analog microscope technology. We
must go beyond simply providing a digital alternative by augmenting the skills of the pathologist with ML
algorithms that empower them to work more efficiently, quickly and safely. Urine cytology screening for bladder
cancer is an ideal use case. Thus we sought to create a prototype ML based algorithm, dubbed AutoParis, that
would automate the tabulation of the Paris System. The initial prototype of AutoParis proved to be highly
effective at risk stratifying urine cytology specimens by tabulating statistics related to nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio
(NC ratio, a very important indicator of neoplasia) and cellular / nuclear morphological atypia.7 Deploying
AutoParis as a diagnostic aid to the cytopathologist will require several additional steps. Although I was skilled
enough to code the first iteration of the model, I am reaching the limits of what I can accomplish as a self-taught
programmer and data scientist. In order to complete my work on AutoParis and continue to innovate in the field
of digital pathology and ML, I need a more formalized education in specialized mathematics, statistics, ML theory
and programming. Through this award I will pursue a curriculum of courses at Dartmouth College guided by a
team of expert mentors. My mentors and collaborators were also selected for their ability to help with the testing
and validation of digital decision aids, grant and manuscript prep and lab management. I will emerge from this
experience with the skills I need to be a leader in the future of ML development and its adoption in clinical
medicine."
10908411,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ligament injuries are compounded by the drastically increased risks of reinjury and eventual osteoarthritis. These
risks result from a failure of differentiation; torn mammalian ligaments reform with fibrous scar tissue rather than
with true ligamentocytes, altering the biomechanical properties of the repaired ligament and destabilizing the
nearby joint. While the current models (mice and rabbits) used to study ligament repair recapitulate ligament
scarring, they are unlikely to yield novel insights into targets for regenerative therapeutics. To address this
shortcoming, our lab has developed the highly regenerative zebrafish as a model for craniofacial ligament
regeneration. Zebrafish have the remarkable capacity to regenerate their ligaments without scarring in under a
month. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the jaw joint-supporting interopercle (IOP) ligament in zebrafish
shows identical morphology to the uninjured ligament as soon as 28 days after transection. During this time, the
injured ligament is replaced with a dense mesenchyme which deposits a complex extracellular matrix to remake
a functional ligament. Additionally, preliminary lineage tracing experiments show that both the uninjured ligament
and the regenerative mesenchyme are cranial neural crest-derived. This project aims to identify the source of
the mesenchymal cells which reform the ligament, as well as the genetic and epigenetic changes which promote
ligamentocyte fate. In Aim 1, I will use enhancer peaks with increased accessibility after ligament injury to firstly
trace the lineage of the regenerative mesenchyme to the regenerated ligament, and secondly trace the lineage
of the periosteum through regeneration. In Aim 2, I will analyze my single-nuclei multiomic (gene expression
and chromatin accessibility for each cell) data from jaw joints through IOP ligament regeneration to generate a
short list of candidate transcription factors using a selection funnel of motif accessibility, gene expression, and
transcription factor binding. I will then assess in vivo if these transcription factors are expressed before
ligamentocyte fate is adopted, and generate knockout zebrafish lines to assess if each transcription factor is
necessary for ligamentocyte fate. Through these aims, we will unveil a novel population of cells capable of
regenerating ligaments, as well as the transcription factors necessary for ligamentocyte differentiation.
The training plan outlined through this proposal will develop the techniques, mentorship, and communication
skills necessary to establish my future career as an independent scientist studying craniofacial regeneration.
Through the mentorship of Dr. Joanna Smeeton (Sponsor), Dr. Stavros Thomopoulos (Co-sponsor), and my
thesis advisory committee, I will be well prepared for my transition to a postdoctoral fellowship at a leading
biomedical institution. Dr. Smeeton has extensive knowledge of the zebrafish as a model for craniofacial
regeneration, and Dr. Thomopoulos is an expert in translational mouse tendon development with an outstanding
mentorship record. Under their combined sponsorship, I will learn cutting-edge computational and in vivo
genetics to develop a productive career in regenerative craniofacial biology."
10908412,"Project Summary
This project describes a technology development effort that will generate three complementary methods for
measuring Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) kinetic rates between membrane proteins. In Aim 1, we develop a
new algorithmic approach for single-particle tracking analysis that generates trajectories from image/movie
data. It is based on Bayesian inference strategy. We then extend this to extracting kinetic rates of PPIs from
two color single particle tracking data. In Aim 2, we develop a ‘smart’ microscope that is capable of adapting
illumination and frame rates when a PPI is imminent (particles diffuse close to each other), thereby reducing
photobleaching, allowing long-term tracking with organic fluorophores and gaining a factor of 10 to 50 in
imaging speed during an interaction. In Aim 3 we implement and demonstrate a ‘quantum imaging’ approach
for making a quantum optimal estimation of the distance between two fluorophores of the same type. This
method can estimate the distance between incoherent point sources with an uncertainty in the distance
measurement near the limit of any possible measurement and substantially better than classical
image-then-estimate approaches. In practice, it gives the benefits of two-color tracking using a simplified
one-color labeling scheme.
Direct detection of PPIs at the single molecule level in living cells is difficult because labeling must be done at
densities low enough for single fluorescent labels to be identified and detected with diffraction limited optics.
Since molecules must come into contact with each other to initiate a PPI, often through diffusion limited
processes, the observed interactions can be temporally rare. The new methods proposed here will allow for
other fluorophores, including organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, to be used to quantify PPIs. Our long-term
goal is to provide a set of methods that can report on the dynamics of various types of PPIs. The rationale for
the proposed Aims is that by providing these new methods, a wider range of PPIs can be studied on living
cells, opening new doors for biomedical research.
This technology development project is a collaboration between three investigators with complementary
expertise. K. Lidke (PI) is an expert on single molecule imaging and microscopy development. F. Becerra
(co-PI) is a world leader in the area of ultra-sensitive measurements of coherent states of light using optimized
photon counting measurements with fast feedback. D. Lidke (co-I) has developed and applied innovative single
molecule techniques to quantify PPI in living cells."
10908421,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018
and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a
year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that
30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is
critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for
sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and
effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring
and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our
pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free
Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary
evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will
show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and
postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of
reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on
increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21
phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation
intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the
SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized
controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and
institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With
respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the
effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit-
partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the
prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the
universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the
international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is
expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region."
10908424,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background. Enactment of tobacco control policies is a vital response to the ongoing epidemic of adolescent
e-cigarette use in the US and is believed to have contributed to the decline in youth e-cigarette use from 2019
to 2020. During 2019-2020, two federal laws were enacted: (1) Tobacco 21 (increased the minimum legal
sales age for tobacco to 21 years; T21) and (2) a partial Flavor Restriction law eliminated pod/cartridge-based
e-cigarette products that contained flavors other than mint/menthol. While traditional policy evaluations (e.g.,
compliance checks, document analyses, and surveys) have been employed to evaluate policy impact,
complementary and innovative social media-based methodologies can be used to systematically examine
organic public discussion about policy-relevant issues. Such data are particularly valuable due to the ability to
uncover critical policy-relevant information, taking less time than traditional methodologies. Building on my
experience and learning from my research mentors’ expertise, I will conduct the first comprehensive social
media assessment aimed at uncovering highly valuable yet often difficult-to-ascertain information regarding
emerging tobacco access laws (that have already been enacted or are currently being discussed) in three
areas: policy efficacy, enforcement challenges, and industry interference. Research. The overarching goal of
the proposed investigation is to reduce youth/young adult access to tobacco products. Therefore, in this
proposal, we will (1) identify loopholes that may circumvent emerging federal tobacco access laws; (2) identify
key challenges related to enforcement of FDA regulated tobacco access laws; and (3) investigate tobacco
industry supported interference with emerging FDA regulated tobacco access laws. To achieve these aims, we
will use a specialized software and a comprehensive list of social media-optimized search terms to collect data
from several social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook). Using a two-step process, we
will ensure search strings are comprehensive, feasible, specific, and informal. After developing a codebook to
explore sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, and mixed/both) about tobacco youth access laws, two trained
independent coders will code a sub-sample of collected data, stratifying by month, day, and time. Finally,
content analyses and social network analyses will be used to explore loopholes, enforcement challenges, and
interference with emerging tobacco access laws. Training. Pedagogically, the training plan for this proposed
K01 is comprised of didactic training (certificate program, workshop, coursework, seminars), mentoring
(directed research, conference calls, in-person contact hours, readings), and dissemination deliverables
(publications, presentations, and proposals) required to complete the project on the projected timeline.
Outcomes from these research aims will complement my career-development aims (i.e., developing expertise
in tobacco control policies, social media analysis, and social network analysis) that focus on the intersection
between health, policy, communication, and technology."
10909395,"ABSTRACT: Noncoding genetic variation that alters gene regulatory element activity has major impacts on
health, disease, and evolution. Because measuring regulatory element activity has long been a major challenge,
the mechanisms underlying thousands of genetic associations with disease remain unknown. Recent advances
in high-throughput technologies have disruptively advanced the ability to measure the activity of individual
regulatory elements, and the first population- and genome-scale uses of those methods are now underway.
However, regulatory elements do not act alone. They interact with promoters, other regulatory elements, and the
surrounding chromatin, all in ways that are complex and difficult to predict. Though there are now a plethora of
technologies to measure the activity of individual regulatory elements, the ability to recapitulate the effects of
combinations of regulatory elements is woefully inadequate and severely hinders efforts to establish the gene
regulatory contributions to traits and diseases. The goal of the Duke FUNCTION Center of Excellence in
Genomic Science is to make the study of the combinatorial activity of regulatory elements routine. Aim
1 is to develop a suite of new technologies to measure the combinatorial effects of regulatory elements in their
endogenous genomic contexts. Those technologies will leverage very recent discoveries of CRISPR enzymes
other than Cas9 that greatly expand the ability to manipulate the human genome. Aim 2 is to develop the matched
computational, statistical, and evolutionary models needed to interpret and predict the measured effects of
combinations of regulatory variants on human traits and diseases. Aim 3 is to demonstrate the broad applicability
of the technologies developed through case studies of human diseases with prevalence ranging from common
to ultra rare. Example case studies will include studies of schizophrenia, rare recessive disorders, and
undiagnosed genetic disorders. We will also use a nationwide request for applications to identify Pilot Projects
that will expand applications to other disease areas. Aim 4 is to create an electronic platform for distributing
results from functional studies of the noncoding genome to the broad research community. The platform will
integrate our results with those from studies in other labs and consortia, such as ENCODE; and will enable
researchers with diverse expertise to benefit from the Center. Finally, our Education and Outreach Aim is to
expand genomics capacity locally and nationally, and with a particular emphasis on increasing use of our new
technologies for translational research. The expected outcome of this project will be a paradigm shift in human
genetic and genomics in which it will become possible to finally understand the full regulatory complexity that
controls the expression of human genes. We anticipate that ability will be particularly powerful for translating
genetic associations into disease mechanisms, thus creating a windfall of new knowledge about which genes
contribute most to disease, and how to manipulate those genes for therapeutic benefit. Long term, we envision
this work being critical to realizing the full potential of whole genome sequencing to detect causes of disease."
10909396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Extracellular polysaccharides play critical roles across all domains of life. Bacterial polysaccharides are a
diverse class of macromolecules with multiple biological functions, including mediating interactions with the
external environment and preserving cell wall integrity. Bacterial glycosyltransferases are responsible for
polysaccharide diversity through their differences in substrate specificity and linkage production.
Polysaccharide biosynthesis and elongation can occur by multiple mechanisms; the least understood is
processive polymerization. Processivity is elicited from an enzyme’s ability to retain the acceptor through
numerous elongation steps. This process reduces the production of short-length polysaccharides, which could
be harmful to bacterial fitness. Processivity may represent a common and critical mechanism for
polysaccharide biosynthesis and length control.
Production of the mycobacterial galactan by galactofuranosyltransferase 2 (GlfT2) was shown to proceed by a
processive mechanism. The galactan of Mycobacterium spp. is an essential structural glycan, functioning as a
component of the cell wall structure of human pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Mycobacterium leprae. Galactan truncation decreases cell fitness, promotes periplasm thinning, and increases
antibiotic susceptibility. Therefore, enzymatic processivity by GlfT2 likely ensures the galactan is of sufficient
length. The proposed studies seek to define the mechanism of GlfT2 processivity and the biophysical
parameters that dictate product length distributions. This project encompasses training in enzyme production
and characterization, enzyme kinetics assays, and enzyme structure determination. The Kiessling group,
leaders in chemical glycobiology, and the Department of Chemistry at MIT provide a rich environment to
acquire these research skills. The research environment also offers opportunities to engage in science
communication, literature analysis, and career development. The results from the investigations proposed are
expected to provide a framework for mechanistic analysis of processive glycosyltransferases found in other
bacteria and across the different domains of life. New insights into this under-characterized class of enzymes
will provide novel targets to combat the modern emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
10909399,"SUMMARY
Latinx older adults are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) than
White older adults. Despite older Latinx adults having lower rates of physical activity (PA) and a high burden of
comorbidities that are associated with ADRD, few studies have targeted this population with theory-based and
culturally adapted approaches to reduce risk for ADRD. Building on pilot work by the team, the proposed
project would allow us to culturally adapt a theory-based intervention to promote moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) for Latinx adults ages 55 to 89 years. In Stage I (R61/Aim 1), we will finalize the recruitment
and intervention strategy (including finalizing the target mechanisms of adherence to MVPA, initial cultural
adaptation and translation) through meetings with our community advisory board and pilot testing with 10
Latinx adults. In Stage II (R33/Aim 2), we will randomize 130 Latinx adults to receive the 16-week, fully remote
De Pié y a Movernos (De Pié) intervention or a control condition. The intervention will target the mechanisms
of self-efficacy, PA habit strength, social support, and PA enjoyment using a staircase approach where
participants will initially reduce their sitting by moving more to build confidence towards engaging in MVPA.
Participants will also receive a Fitbit activity tracker, health coaching contacts, feedback on meeting goals, and
will identify a support person. We will determine the effect of the De Pié intervention on activPAL
accelerometer-based MVPA minutes/day (primary outcome) and adherence to meeting the MVPA guidelines
of 150 minutes per week (secondary outcome). Further, mediation analyses will be conducted to determine the
effect of the intervention on mechanisms of adherence (self-efficacy, habit strength, social support, enjoyment)
and identify whether these mechanisms explain intervention effects on MVPA minutes/week and adherence to
MVPA guidelines. We will explore cognition, acculturation, age and sex as moderators of these associations.
Results will help identify important mechanisms of adherence to MVPA and inform culturally adapted, theory-
based approaches to prevent ADRD in the Latinx community."

The overall survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients has improved significantly over the past few decades,
but the 5-year survival rate for patients with stage IV CRC remains below 14%. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop more effective and safer treatments against CRC. New immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)
therapies have ushered in a new era of immunotherapy and emerged as important treatment options for a variety
of solid tumors. However, ICIs are only effective in CRC patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). For the approximately 85% of CRC patients who carry proficient mismatch
repair (pMMR) and microsatellite stable (MSS) or instability-low (MSI-L) CRCs, ICIs show little clinical benefit. In
a preliminary study, we examined the efficacy of low-dose sulindac in enhancing the response of pMMR/MSS
CRC to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Utilizing a syngeneic mouse tumor model and a humanized patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) mouse model, we compared the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 antibodies (Abs), sulindac at low
doses, and their combination on pMMR/MSS CRC. Our results demonstrated that the mice treated with the
combination therapy showed a significant reduction in tumor volume, along with an increase of CD8+ tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor tissues. While studying the mechanism of action, we found that sulindac
could transcriptionally inhibit PD-L1 expression and ultimately reduce the release of exosomal PD-L1 into the
circulation. As exosomal PD-L1 normally binds to and depletes circulating PD-L1 Abs, the combination of
sulindac and the PD-L1 Ab can potentially enhance antibody recruitment. Therefore, we hypothesize that low-
dose sulindac can sensitize CRC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In this application, we propose three specific aims to
systematically and rigorously investigate this new activity of sulindac. In Aim 1, we will study the mechanisms by
which sulindac sensitizes CRC to anti-PD-L1 therapy, specifically how sulindac regulates PD-L1 expression; in
Aim 2, we will use innovative and robust humanized PDX models to study the in vivo efficacy of low-dose sulindac
in enhancing anti-PD-L1 therapy. Both MSS and MSI CRC models will be tested. In Aim 3, we will investigate
whether the combination of sulindac and anti-PD-L1 therapy can block the metastatic progression of CRC. Since
sulindac and PD-L1 antibodies are FDA-approved drugs and their safety and toxicity profiles have been well-
documented, we hope that the success of our study will rapidly facilitate Phase II clinical trials to investigate the
utility of sulindac-enhanced anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC and address the important clinical challenge of poor
response to ICI therapy in the majority of CRC patients."

Cephalopods represent a unique opportunity in comparative neuroscience. They are the only branch of
the animal kingdom besides vertebrates to have evolved large brains, and they have remarkable
sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities. They can independently control eight flexible arms, they can
rapidly change their skin patterning to camouflage based on the visual environment, and they exhibit
learning and flexible behavior unlike any other invertebrates. Despite the many intriguing questions
surrounding the cephalopod nervous system, we have relatively little understanding of how their brains
function at the mechanistic level. However, the past few years have witnessed a rapid growth in
cephalopod neuroscience, due to the emergence of new tools and the availability of several
cephalopod species through efforts of the Marine Biological Laboratory. These rapid developments in
the field, along with the influx of new researchers, led us to propose the first-ever Cephalopod
Neuroscience Conference. This meeting will bring together the growing community of researchers
across cephalopod neuroscience, including genomics, neural development, systems neuroscience, as
well as computation and tool development. The primary goals of the conference are 1) to communicate
research progress, 2) to build an active and diverse community, and 3) to share techniques and
resources. To this end, we are planning to combine scientific talks with community-building and career
development activities, as well as hands-on workshops. We will also encourage and support
attendance for trainees from diverse backgrounds and disadvantaged groups. We expect that this
meeting will accelerate research in the field of cephalopod neuroscience through the combination of
scientific advances and community building."
10927459,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized veterans.
Unfortunately, AKI remains without a specific therapy. Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is expressed exclusively in
the kidney by cells of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) of Henle. We previously showed that AKI induces a state
of THP deficiency, and that THP is specifically targeted towards the interstitium of the kidney during recovery
from injury. We established that the presence of THP is needed to terminate inflammatory signaling in the
epithelium and promote healing through altering the phenotype of immune cells such as macrophages.
Furthermore, chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by chronic THP deficiency, is a high-risk
state for AKI. Therefore, developing a therapeutic strategy to exogenously supplement THP in veterans with
states of THP deficiency will likely be very beneficial in improving the course of kidney injury and provide direly
needed treatment and mitigation strategies against AKI
The central hypothesis is that recombinant truncated THP has a favorable pharmacological profile that can be
used efficaciously to improve the course of AKI, particularly in the setting of pre-existing deficiency. This
hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary and published data. The following specific
aims will be used to investigate this hypothesis.
Aim 1 will establish the pharmacokinetics and safety of systemic recombinant truncated THP in control and
murine models of AKI
Aim 2 will demonstrate the efficacy of recombinant THP administration in various models of murine AKI
(ischemia/reperfusion, cisplatin and LPS) using wild type and THP+/- mice.
This research will involve the use recombinant THP produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and various
models of murine AKI. Outcomes of kidney injury severity measured through biochemical measures (filtration /
injury markers), histological scoring, and assessing the burden of inflammatory cells. A long-term outcome of
fibrosis (measured histologically at 4 weeks) will also be included. THP knockout, wild type and heterozygous
mice will be used.
This research will provide key validation strategies to advance the use of exogenously administered THP in
AKI towards IND-enabling studies. The use of various models of AKI will ensure that the efficacy of
recombinant THP has a broad scope and is not model dependent, which will further de-risk this therapeutic
intervention."
10929555,"A hallmark of biological intelligence is the ability to learn from a remarkably small set of experiences to
select appropriate behaviors in novel contexts. This ability arises from inductive bias, referring to the
assumptions used in generalizing prior observations to novel data. In machine learning, inductive bias is
essential for efficient learning from a small number of examples as animals frequently do. In
neuroscience, inductive bias has been mostly considered as shaped by evolution to produce an innate
inductive bias. Although an agent’s inductive bias should be adaptive to changing task demands, how
brains develop inductive bias, use it to guide learning, and adapt it to task statistics, remain poorly
understood. The overall goal of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of inductive
bias adaptation by training non-human primates on a novel learning task, characterizing choice behavior
and neuronal activity, and developing computational models of learning in neural networks. Our
theoretical framework of neural kernel learning makes precise predictions for behavior and neural activity
that will be experimentally tested in the proposed studies. We will characterize behavior in a newly
designed “crosstalk” task, which is designed to characterize inductive bias and to drive a subject’s
adaptation through well-defined and variable task statistics (Aim 1). In this task, the subject learns through
experience to categorize stimuli composed of multiple features. Within a block of trials, certain features
are differentially informative of the category. Next, we will record simultaneous spiking activity from
neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum during task performance (Aim 2). In
parallel, we will develop and refine algorithmic and artificial neural network models of adaptive learning
(Aim 3) to generate testable predictions for behavior and neural activity. Results from these studies will
impact paradigms used to study the computational and neural bases of learning and generalization in
humans and animals."
10935967,"Most quantitative models in biomedical research have been formulated by ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs). Despite the great contributions ODEs have made to biology and beyond, the high-dimensional, 
time-dependent factors of the immune system still pose a significant challenge to the predictive value of 
ODEs as it would require several hundred equations and thousands of parameters to be estimated. The 
recent rise of machine learning as a powerful computational tool to integrate large datasets presents a 
special opportunity to deal with the inherent complexity of biological systems. However, machine learning 
approaches do not consider the mechanistic knowledge of the underlying interactions. Preliminary studies 
that combine ODEs and machine learning highlight that these computational algorithms could be on the 
cusp of a major revolution. Remarkably enough, however, no parameter estimation theory exists to 
integrate simultaneously both approaches. We propose to create new hybrid models and test their 
predictions in a mouse viral coinfection system to address a central vexation for infection biology which is 
how and when to modulate immune responses to mitigate mortality during lethal respiratory viral infection. 
At the interface between mathematical and life sciences, we will develop and analyze a novel suite of 
computational models that will integrate the underlying biological mechanisms to manage ill-posed 
problems and explore massive design spaces, allowing for robust predictions from complex biological 
systems. To validate and test our novel and foundational mathematical approaches, we will generate the 
biological data from a mouse infection system with a mild viral pathogen (rhinovirus) two days before 
infection with a lethal viral pathogen (influenza) that results in reduced disease compared to single infection 
alone. We hypothesize that this system can train our mathematical models in a natural way how the innate 
immune system can be manipulated to reduce mortality to lethal infections and beyond. Key model 
predictions will be tested by targeted immune system manipulation during lethal infection, paving the way to 
understanding the role of complex immune interactions in respiratory viral disease pathology."
10935991,"The emergence and re-emergence of pathogens and their impact on society has reinforced the need for 
integration and synergy across scientific fields and biological scales in order to advance understanding, 
predicting, and responding to pathogen spread. Multi-scale mathematical models that consider the timing 
and length of individual infections when modeling transmission into the population can aid 
recommendations for optimal interventions. One shortcoming when evaluating data using multi-scale 
models comes from data scarcity in the expansion stages of the infection and transmission, the differences 
in data magnitude and frequency at each scale, together with the complexity of the models considered. To 
determine the source of combined biases in parameter estimation, we will use a combined empirical-theoretical approach for investigating structural and practical parameter identifiability of multi-scale models 
of infectious diseases that may inform optimal experimental design. The proposed research will facilitate a 
better understanding of the sources of uncertainty when fitting multi-scale models to multi-scale infectious 
disease data, with a focus on Usutu and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. By combining empirical and theoretical 
approaches we aim to determine structural and practical parameter identifiability of multi-scale models, to 
inform optimal experimental design, and to improve our ability to make predictions and suggest 
interventions. Our proposal will focus on three major mathematical challenges: (1) Developing methods for 
improving practical identifiability in within-host systems; (2) Use experimental data to inform development of 
transmission models; (3) Build a quantitative framework to predict parameter identifiability in multi-scale 
systems. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to integrate multi-scale mathematical model 
development and statistical models for data fitting with collection of longitudinal virus titers and probability 
of transmission data in order to decrease uncertainty and improve results reproducibility. This will ultimately 
improve our understanding of infection disease transmission and persistence."
10935979,"Most microorganisms live in communities containing hundreds or thousands of species, each engaging 
in a rich web of interactions. The complexity of these interactions makes quantitative predictions about 
community dynamics difficult. To overcome this, simple proxies for natural communities, designated 
""model microbial communities,"" have been designed to support laboratory study. These models are 
complex enough to exhibit community-specific phenomena but simple enough to reveal governing 
principles of community interaction. Invasions are among the most destabilizing events that a microbial 
community can experience, often resulting in community dysfunction or host disease. We propose to use 
THOR, a model community that we developed, to characterize the response to invasion by Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. We will track population dynamics functionally profile molecular interactions. 
The multi-omics and multifactorial nature of this study present multifaceted opportunities for statistical 
innovation. A truly integrative analysis cannot simply perform parallel hypothesis tests across assays, and 
there is a need for a differential testing framework that blends data sources into a unified molecular 
interaction network. We will draw from advances in selective inference and multi-omics network analysis to 
develop methods that illuminate the molecular interactions driving community response. This will allow us 
to tailor interventions that shape dynamics in the THOR model microbial community. We propose: 
1. Aim 1: Functionally profile THOR's community response to P. aeruginosa using metabolomics, 
metatranscriptomics, and 16S rRNA sequencing and establish associated data curation workflows. These 
are the core data-generating experiments and quality control steps that provide accurate and 
complementary views of THOR under invasion. 
2. Aim 2: Develop differential testing methods that are sensitive to interaction effects and that control 
module-level false discovery rates. We will introduce methods for selective inference of differential 
interactome modules, like activated biosynthetic pathways. 
3. Aim 3: Consolidate software for differential interactome analysis and experimentally validate knockout 
targets. These experiments will illustrate a data-driven approach to control invasion dynamics, and our 
software will make such analysis easily accessible."
10914295,"Nearly all brain functions involve activity that is distributed across multiple areas. To understand these 
functions, it is critical to understand the flow of signals across this distributed network. To date approaches 
to understanding inter-areal signaling have been limited in several critical ways. First, they often focus on 
single neurons or a few voxels to summarize an area’s activity—an impoverished sample of the intricate 
neuronal population activity patterns that are known to represent and transmit information. Second, prior 
approaches often consider only pairwise inter-areal interactions, though the relevant network of areas is 
often much larger. Third, they rarely consider the concurrent flow of signals both from and to any given 
node in the network. In this project, we aim to overcome all three of these limitations. In Aim 1, we will 
develop and validate statistical methods that allow us to assess the directed, multi-dimensional flow of 
neuronal population signals among multiple (more than two) brain areas. We will identify directed 
interactions based on if the activation of a population activity pattern in one brain area tends to reliably 
precede the activation of a population activity pattern in another brain area with a consistent time delay. In 
Aim 2, we will refine and deploy the methods we develop to assess signal flow across multiple stages of 
the macaque visual system, an ideal testbed given a great deal of prior work on the anatomical and 
functional properties of the sampled areas. Specifically, we will record hundreds of neurons distributed 
across different layers of primary visual cortex (V1), V2, and V3. We will determine how columnar 
interactions within each area interact with feedforward and feedback processes, at a laminar level. Our 
project aims to provide insights that will strongly advance understanding of fundamental aspects of cortical 
function—how neuronal populations communicate with each other and how that communication relates to 
cortical processing. We expect the understanding we gain, and the analytic and conceptual tools we 
develop, will be broadly applicable across different brain systems. Our ambitious goals will be 
accomplished by pooling complementary expertise of three PIs, building on a successful collaboration that 
has extended over many years."
10933028,"Coming with the new century, integration of computer technology into medical practice has enabled
scientists to collect massive volumes of electronic health records (EHR) and, in the meantime, deep
learning has been developed as the major tool of massive data analysis. However, the EHR data are
heterogeneous [varied much for different groups of patients] and fragmented [consisting of a high
proportion of missing values], which poses a significant barrier to the applicability and generalizability of
current deep neural networks. This project aims to build a health prediction system based on a new type
of stochastic neural network (StoNet) with massive, heterogeneous, and fragmented data, while
considering integration of the omics, imaging and EHR data in training the system. The StoNet is
formulated as a composition of many simple regressions; it is asymptotically equivalent to the deep neural
network (DNN) in function approximation as the training sample size becomes large, but its structure is
more flexible for dealing with the complexity of EHR data. The StoNet is trained by an adaptive stochastic
gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. By leveraging on the flexible structure of the
StoNet and the sophisticated adaptive stochastic gradient MCMC algorithm, this project provides a
rigorous statistical framework for deep learning with massive, heterogeneous and fragmented EHR data.
We show that the StoNet forms a bridge from linear models to deep learning, enabling many of the theory
and methods developed for linear models to be transferred to deep learning. In particular, we show the
sparse learning theory developed for linear models with the Lasso penalty can be transferred to the
StonNet, leading to an innovative consistent sparse deep learning method; we address the data
heterogeneity issue by replacing each regression of the first hidden layer of the StoNet by a mixture
regression; and we address the missing data issue by training the StoNet with an adaptive stochastic
gradient MCMC algorithm where the missing data are imputed as for a linear model with multiple
imputation methods. The Markovian structure of the StoNet enables the network parameters to be locally
learned with fragmented data and leads to an innovative way for nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction
of high-dimensional data, facilitating integration of different types of data in StoNet training. We also show
the prediction uncertainty of the StoNet can be easily quantified with a recursive application of Eve's law."

includes only a small fraction of protein-RNA interactions in the cell, and we know particularly little of how RNA-
binding proteins cooperate to form complexes on noncoding RNAs, which make up the vast majority of human
transcripts. Further, while pipelines for identifying protein-binding molecules for therapeutic development are
informed by significant understanding of protein structure, there is no existing equivalent for designing small
molecules that target RNA and RNA-binding interfaces. Critically, there remains a lack of straightforward
technologies for discovery, definition, and drug targeting of protein-RNA interactions inside cells.
To illuminate features of RNA-protein complexes and discover new ways to control their functions, my laboratory
is developing a suite of novel live-cell chemical probing technologies based around my unique RNP-MaP
approach (RNA-protein networks analyzed by mutational profiling). By enhancing and modularly extending the
base RNP-MaP framework, we will develop new facile methods for 1) mapping multi-protein networks on RNA
across transcriptomes and identifying associated RNA-binding proteins, 2) mapping transcriptome-wide targets
of RNA-binding proteins while simultaneously measuring RNA site-specific occupancy, and 3) mapping small
molecule RNA-targeting potential inside cells.
Our ultimate goal is to create a set of tools that could enable any medical research laboratory to identify,
characterize, and target any RNA-protein interface relevant to their disease/pathway/model of interest. By
providing the means to probe the uncharted landscapes of RNA-protein networks, this work will be foundational
for expansive new RNA biology discoveries and RNA-targeted therapeutics."

This application seeks continued support for a new project, based on discoveries made during a research
program, funded by the NCI for over 45 years, on biology and evolution of retroviruses and their roles in AIDS
and cancer, with a particular focus on Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). The studies described in this
proposal will ccenter on a provirus in the relatively recent HERV-K (HML-2) group that integrated in a site on
chromosome 3, band q12.3 of a common human/gorilla ancestor at least 8 million years ago. In prior work, we
discovered that this provirus has several unique features consistent with its having evolved into a restriction
factor capable of strongly blocking the virion assembly step in replication both of the reconstructed, infectious,
HERV-Kcon and, remarkably, also of HIV. Adaptations to this role include an LTR mutation that leads to
widespread expression in all normal human solid tissues and a mutation (or mutations) in the gag CA encoding
region that lead to transdominant misassembly of the Gag precursor of the infecting virus at the cell membrane.
The current proposal will follow up on these observations with the aims of obtaining a detailed understanding
of the mechanism of co assembly and inhibition of HIV Gag assembly and release, understanding the evolution
of the 3q12.3 provirus and the scope of its activity against other retroviruses, isolation of HIV escape mutants
resistant to 3q12.3 inhibition, and testing the feasibility of using reactivation of the 3q12.3 provirus in HIV target
cells as a novel method of prevention of HIV replication."

This proposal will train the candidate to become a leading expert on the role of biological aging in cognitive
impairment that can affect persons with HIV (PWH). A detailed training plan has been developed, including
advanced coursework and instruction in the biology of aging and the epigenome, machine learning and
bioinformatics methods, and career-enhancing training through mentorship, leadership, and grant-writing
courses. This plan will both promote the success of the proposed Research Aims and set the candidate on a
trajectory toward an independent and productive career. Regular engagement with an experienced, multi-
disciplinary mentorship team will ensure the candidate’s success during the award period.
 The proposed research study will investigate the relationship between HIV-related cognitive impairment and
biological aging, including aging of the central nervous system. While combination antiretroviral therapy has
improved life expectancy for PWH, cognitive symptoms persist in 20–50% of this population. Growing evidence
indicates that elevated biological aging is associated with adverse health outcomes for PWH. However, it
remains unclear whether accelerated aging still occurs in PWH with undetectable viral load, especially in diverse
populations at greater risk for comorbidities and adverse social determinants of health. It is also unclear how
biological aging relates to cognitive function in such populations. These questions are of crucial importance for
the health and quality of life of the aging population of PWH in the US.
 The proposed study will address the central hypothesis that accelerated biological aging in PWH
contributes to cognitive impairment, in combination with comorbidities and social risk factors. The study will
represent a seminal effort to combine measures of biological aging from DNA methylation and brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with machine learning methods to build and test robust models of
cognitive impairment in PWH. This approach will be centered on two relatively novel but well-validated aging
biomarkers. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) will be measured using DNA methylation clocks, such as
GrimAge, which the candidate will derive from DNA methylation microarrays applied to blood samples from a
diverse group of PWH and control persons without HIV (PWoH). Analogously, deep neural network models will
be used to quantify brain-age acceleration (BAA) using volumetric brain MRI data from the same participants.
 The ultimate goal is to leverage epigenomics and brain morphology data to produce a predictive
computational model of cognitive impairment. The role of non-AIDS HIV-associated comorbidities such as
cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health including neighborhood deprivation will be considered
in parallel with biological measures. This study will provide insights into the origins of HIV-associated cognitive
impairment, a major clinical problem that reduces quality of life for millions of PWH, and launch the applicant on
a unique research career in neuroimaging and aging biology."

10916511,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects up to 1% of children in the United States, resulting in significant 
lifelong disability for the majority of those affected. Prior neuroimaging studies are limited to groupwise 
analysis between ASD and controls, which cannot differentiate or disentangle cortical abnormality from 
variability for a specific ASD subject. These difficulties originate from a lack of a novel brain structural 
descriptor that can effectively represent the human brain architectures of each individual and extract brain 
structural commonalities across individuals. Meanwhile, prior studies have demonstrated that mechanical 
factors play important roles in the formation of brain architecture, including abnormalities observed in ASD. 
Current brain mechanical models build upon simplified models with a focus on one specific mechanical 
effort, but fail to explicitly capture the physical complexity of brain models and the interplay of multiple 
mechanical factors simultaneously. This lack of knowledge is a crucial barrier to developing unbiased 
models to understand the brain structural commonalities across individuals, as well as models that can 
pinpoint the abnormalities in individual ASD brain. The overall objective of this research is to construct a 
transformative brain structural network (BSN) for each individual brain, disentangle BSN’s commonality and 
variability across individual health brains, discover the role of mechanics on the BSN’s commonality and 
variability across individuals via imaging analyses and data-driven computational simulations, and pinpoint 
cortical abnormality and evaluate their relevant impact in ASD brains by comparing BSN between ASD and 
healthy brains. Our central hypothesis is that the brain structural network and its underlying mechanical 
principles can be interpreted through a data-driven discovery of preserved, descriptive, universal, and 
evident brain structural descriptor across individuals. The goal of the proposed work will be achieved by 
completing the following three specific aims: (1) we will reconstruct individual cortical surfaces to identify 
and assess 3-hinge gyral junctions (3HGs) and 3HG-based brain structural network and therefore examine 
brain structure commonality across individual brains; (2) we will construct data-driven fetal whole brain 
models, perform massive simulations with varying mechanical conditions, and collect data for machine-learning analysis; (3) we will evaluate brain structural network’s abnormality in ASD by conducting 
comparison analysis with health brain and pinpoint mechanical factors that lead to this abnormality across 
individuals."

 Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe, often fatal intestinal disease of prematurity. Mortality rates
approach 50% if surgery is required to resect necrotic and irreversibly damaged intestinal tissue. Extensive
preclinical research supports a central role for deleterious unrestrained inflammation in intestinal injury and
destruction of the intestinal epithelium. Despite the insight gained from decades of research, treatment options
for infants with NEC are non-specific and often ineffective in the most severe cases. Factors that have impeded
the development of novel effective therapies for this disease include an incomplete understanding of disease
mechanisms in human infants, a lack of biomarkers, and the fragility of critically ill preterm infants. In addition,
NEC is a developmental disease associated with intestinal immaturity, which poses a further challenge in that
interruption of these developmental processes can have lifelong consequences. To overcome these obstacles,
future NEC research must be patient-focused, innovative, and highly collaborative.
 I have spent the last 14 years dedicated to studying NEC and the immunologic mechanisms of disease.
I created the largest biorepository in the world for NEC, which contains tens of thousands of samples obtained
prospectively from premature infants that developed NEC and age-matched control infants. The NEC
Biorepository is a multi-institutional collaborative of leading investigators in NEC research from across the
country. The development of this biorepository was motivated by an urgent need to study larger patient cohorts
and the logistical difficulties of obtaining intestinal samples from critically ill neonates undergoing emergent
surgery. In addition, my laboratory is pioneering efforts in biotherapeutic design and implementation for NEC.
We recently identified the polyfunctional cytokine interleukin-22 as a potentially powerful new immunotherapy for
this disease, and we currently hold a patent for its use in the treatment of NEC.
 This proposal will utilize the invaluable samples in the NEC Biorepository, our collaborative network, and
our extensive expertise in this specialized field to accelerate the growth and development of a new era of NEC
research. We will define new mechanisms of immunopathogenesis and employ innovative interventions to
interrupt the exaggerated injurious response that leads to NEC. In this effort to reprogram intestinal immunity,
we will redefine the paradigms that currently exist in our vague understanding of NEC pathogenesis. This NIDDK
Catalyst Award provides our research program with the opportunity to use groundbreaking techniques to answer
the elusive questions regarding the central disease mechanisms in NEC. We are determined to cure this
devastating disease by interrupting the deleterious inflammatory response that results in intestinal injury in
preterm neonates."

Admixture is a vital evolutionary process that profoundly shapes human genetic diversity and health.
Current evidence suggests that admixture is ubiquitous throughout human evolution and has been
accelerating during our recent evolutionary history. However, despite the paramount importance of
admixture, we still lack sufficient means to infer a complete admixture history in humans. Due to the
underrepresentation of non-European populations in biobanks, we also do not fully understand the
genetic basis of complex traits in admixed populations. Furthermore, constrained by our long
generation time, we do not have a holistic view of how admixture interacted with other evolutionary
processes such as selection, and how they shaped genomes over time. Synthesizing computational
methods development and empirical population genomics, my lab will decipher the evolutionary history
and biological impact of human admixture via three lines of work. First, we will develop machine learning
methods to investigate some of the oldest admixture events, the archaic introgression, in understudied
non-European populations. Specifically, we will search for evidence of introgression with unknown,
“ghost” hominins in East Asians, and leverage the evolutionary trajectory of adaptive introgression gene
regions to infer a comprehensive population history for South Americans. Next, we will focus on the
impact of recent admixture in shaping complex traits in modern humans. We will use simulations to
model changes in the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits caused by admixture and
develop novel statistical methods to improve the accuracy of complex trait phenotype predictions in
populations that experienced recent and ongoing admixture. Finally, we aim to elucidate the real-time
process and functional consequences of admixture using two nonhuman study systems with shorter
generations. We will use interbreeding Drosophila species to experimentally track the dynamics
between admixture and selection on admixed genomes over time. We will couple the work with an
admixed captive colony of rhesus macaques that has longitudinal records of genomic and phenotypic
data to investigate how admixture changes individual fitness and phenotypes directly relevant to
humans. Overall, this research will provide invaluable empirical evidence and powerful quantitative
tools to enhance our understanding of human admixture from complementary perspectives."

Aim: To develop a predictive mathematical model of obesity-induced diabetes and chronic wound that includes
a realistic representation of the main physiological factors that are correlated with high prevalence of type
1/type 2 diabetes, and that also take into account a more detailed process of glucose/glycogen exchange in the
liver.
The Need: Obesity is a risk factor for several diseases, two of which are diabetes and chronic wounds: 85%
of adult Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overweight or obese, and 30% of obese adults
have the disease. Studies have identiﬁed causes, mechanisms and obesity-related glucose/glycogen exchange
factors which impair healing of dermal wounds; these factors have been represented by constant parameter so
far. The overall premises of this proposal is to focus on better understanding the role of these factor and
model them by variable functions.
The Opportunity: Recent work have identiﬁed four main factors that are correlated with the high prevalence
of type 1/type 2 diabetes, and which impair healing of dermal wounds in diabetes patients: D1 = excessive
production of glucagon, D2 = excessive production of leukotrient, D3 = decreased production of stromal cell-
derived factor-1, and D4 = insulin resistance. However, these work main deﬁciencies were to take the Di's as
constant parameters. To make this model predictive, one must derive the Di's based on the dynamics of
glucose associated with obesity. But since this dynamics is also associated with obesity-induced diabetes,
there is need to develop this aspect as well. Some initial work already begun in our lab in this regard, where
developed a mathematical model that includes the mechanisms of glucose transport from the blood to the
liver,and from the liver to the blood, and explains how obesity is likely to lead to lead to T2DM, and used the
model to evaluate the efﬁcacy of an anti-T2DM drug that also reduces weight. However, here again there are
some parameters that were taken as constants, and again, to be a predictive model, these parameters will need
to be dynamics.
The Impact: Success in this work will open up entirely new ways to design and analyze within-host mathe-
matical models in general, and those of glucose-insulin dynamical systems in health and in the case of obesity-
induced diabetic chronic wounds in particular. We anticipate direct practical applicability as our modeling
techniques could be replicated and our conclusions used as hypotheses for clinical trials. Hence, this project
offers a potential to reinvent the modeling of glucose-insulin dynamical system in obese-induced diabetic
chronic wounds by enhancing the quality of virtual patients development, necessary for assessing new
experimental or approved drugs. Moreover, the same concepts readily translate to a wide range of important
chronic infections/diseases such as cancers, hepatitis B virus, and osteoporosis among others."

Therapeutic regulation of innate immunity remains underexplored. Our overall hypothesis, based on key
preliminary data, is that NHP kidney allograft survival can be extended and immunosuppression (IS) withdrawn
by innovative strategies and cutting-edge technologies that potentiate dendritic cell (DC) tolerogenicity. These
strategies will enable 1) selective inhibitory targeting of DCs in situ, or 2) adoptive transfer of autologous
regulatory DC (DCregs) pulsed with donor small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The regimens we propose will (i)
provide new mechanistic insight into the induction and maintenance/stability of donor-specific unresponsivess
and (ii) potentially identify novel predictive biomarkers. In due course, our findings may provide opportunities to
interact with/participate in NIAID-funded clinical trials, such as those currently assessing DCreg therapy in organ
transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh. Recent data show that activation of the inhibitory leukocyte
immunoglobulin-like receptor B (LILRB) family member LILRB3 (ILT5; CD85a) that is highly expressed on DCs,
confers profound immunoinhibitory functions on myeloid cells that induce T cell tolerance to alloAgs in
humanized mice. We will test our hypothesis that an agonistic LILRB3 mAb can extend graft survival/allow IS
withdrawal. An alternative novel approach to selective targeting DCs in situ is use of Ab-directed, DC-targeting
nanobiologics. We hypothesize that nanoparticles (NP) functionalized with mAb against the endocytic receptor
DEC205 (CD205) and loaded with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (mTORi-NP) will promote Treg generation,
extend graft survival and allow IS withdrawal. We discovered that acquisition of donor MHC Ag (via sEVs) and
upregulation of co-inhibitory/anti-inflammatory molecules by recipient DCs subverts anti-donor T cell responses
in rodent liver transplant tolerance. In patients, we have shown that infusion of DCreg results in acquisition (via
sEVs) of donor MHC, co-expressed with enhanced levels of co-inhibitory molecules on host DCs. We therefore
hypothesize that infusion of autologous DCregs pulsed with donor sEVs (sEV-DCs) will extend graft
survival/allow IS withdrawal. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: To determine whether agonistic LILRB3 mAb combined with baseline IS can extend kidney graft
survival/allow IS withdrawal (n=12 transplants)
Aim 2: To ascertain whether selective targeting of DCs in situ using novel DC (DEC205)-directed
nanoparticles (mTORi-NPs) can extend graft survival/allow IS withdrawal (n=6 transplants)
Aim 3: To assess whether post-transplant infusion of autologous DCregs pulsed with donor sEVs (sEV-
DCregs) can extend graft survival/allow IS withdrawal (n=12 transplants)"
10937299,"Compelling evidence highlights the central role of islet β-cell failure in the transition from insulin resistance to
Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Defects in the β-cell's secretory pathway accompany T2D onset and include changes
to insulin trafficking, reduced insulin storage, and impaired proinsulin processing. The cellular mechanisms
underlying these defects are not completely understood, yet could have considerable therapeutic value if β-cell
function could be restored. Our data highlight altered ER redox homeostasis as a novel mechanism that
contributes to β-cell dysfunction in human and rodent diabetes models. Using novel proinsulin trafficking
reporters, we identified a delay in the ER export of proinsulin that leads to inadequate insulin granule
production. We linked delayed proinsulin export to hyperoxidation of the ER lumen and showed that restoration
of ER redox homeostasis rescued proinsulin export and insulin granule formation. The hyperoxidized ER
environment may interfere with proinsulin export by contributing to the formation of misfolded disulfide-linked
proinsulin oligomers previously reported in human T2D β-cells. Ultimately, this proinsulin trafficking delay limits
the production of insulin granules, which may explain the increase of proinsulin and loss of insulin granules
prominent in T2D. Our proposed studies are designed to define the molecular mediators of β-cell ER redox
control and address how ER hyperoxidation develops in T2D. Our preliminary data have identified a novel
mechanism linking defects in mitochondrial and redox metabolism with changes to ER function in the decline of
insulin production in T2D. Our central hypothesis is that metabolically supplied reductive redox donors are
necessary for the β-cell's ER redox buffering capacity to sustain efficient proinsulin folding for insulin
production. The goals of this proposal are to establish a critical link between glucose metabolism and ER redox
control (Aim 1), define key mediators that buffer ER redox capacity (Aim 2), and determine how proinsulin
folding impacts ER redox homeostasis (Aim 3)."

 Ion channels in the voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily play pivotal roles in virtually all
physiological processes. This proposal delves into essential constituents of this superfamily, focusing on
elucidating the mechanisms governing voltage sensing and electromechanical coupling of these proteins in
pathophysiological contexts. Our investigation focuses on discerning the regulatory interplay between the
voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of VGICs and the lipid-ordered membrane domain (OMD) enriched with
cholesterol. Recent findings from our laboratory have unraveled the significant influence of OMD on modulating
membrane excitability in somatosensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. A reduction in OMD dimensions,
leading to augmented native ionic currents of pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
(HCN) channels, emerges as a contributing factor in neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain. These distinct lipid
nanodomains exercise direct control over the voltage sensor of HCN channels, consequently influencing channel
opening. This aspect of HCN channel regulation, integral to neuronal excitability and cardiac pacemaking,
necessitates in-depth investigation. Our biophysical approach employs patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) combined
with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to measure voltage-sensor conformational dynamics within
native lipid environments. Leveraging genetic-code expansion featuring noncanonical amino acids and bio-
orthogonal fluorescence labeling through click chemistry enables site-specific labeling and facilitates Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Furthermore, our approach includes an improved transition
metal FRET (tmFRET) technique in conjunction with phasor plot FLIM, with the primary goal of investigating the
potential intermediate states of VGIC voltage sensors. By successfully implementing this approach, we intend to
discern the influence of OMD localization, lipid composition, and disease-associated mutations on these
intermediate voltage sensor states. This extensive investigation holds the promise of significantly deepening our
understanding of the voltage-sensing mechanism of VGIC in physiological processes."

Cells are exquisitely-organized entities, with the location of biomolecules within intimately tied to the maintenance
of the organism and the regulation of its genes. Where an RNA is located within the cell determines whether it
will be stored, processed, spliced, or degraded. Although early studies in the 80s and 90s established the cis-
and trans- regulators associated with localization of specific RNAs, for the vast majority of mRNAs, we do not
know how they get to their destinations and what confers specificity and selectivity in space and time. Such
location-based RNA regulation continues to pose new mysteries for the field yet promises to reveal insights into
fundamental cell biology and disease mechanisms. Consequently, during his postdoc, Dr. Furqan Fazal
developed an RNA-seq-based technology exploiting APEX (APEX-seq), a peroxidase enzyme, to spatially tag
RNAs and generate subcellular transcriptomes in living human cells at nm-spatial and minute-temporal resolution
(Fazal et al., Cell 2019). A preliminary atlas of localization revealed that thousands of genes and transcript
isoforms show differential RNA subcellular localization, which has profound consequences for our understanding
of development, neurodegeneration, and cancers. This proposal outlines a five-year research program for Dr.
Fazal, an early-stage investigator, to determine the role of cytoskeletal motor proteins in RNA subcellular
localization. Investigating molecular motors is likely to yield significant findings in the field since they have been
shown to transport mRNAs in singletons both in vitro reconstituted systems and inside cells. These motors
include kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein that walk on microtubules and processive myosins that traverse actin
filaments. However, it is unclear inside cells what the mRNA selectively pattern of these motors is, whether they
cooperate or compete, and what cofactors confer specificity of location. In this proposal, we will investigate the
role of motor proteins in RNA localization. As a model system, we will focus on mRNA transport to the
mitochondria, an essential organelle that has over 1000 species of mRNAs associated with its outer
mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Program IA will focus on identifying the RNA cargo and individual contributions
of the motors. Program IB will use inducible degradable versions of motor proteins and their associated cargos
to identify the exact mechanisms of RNA transport by motors, whether by active transport, organelle hitchhiking,
translation, or others. Program II will study the protein and RNA interactome of motor proteins to identify
sequence (cis-) elements and protein (trans-) factors important for RNA localization. Using a combination of RNA
proximity labeling using APEX-seq along with computational, chemical, genetic, and biochemical experiments,
we expect to decipher the scope and regulation of RNA transport by molecular motors. As mutations in motors
and their associated interactors and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been linked to several diseases
associated with mRNA transport and localization, our experiments will inform how such mutations disrupt these
processes in disease."
10903571,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy worldwide and primarily affects adolescents. While the 5-year survival rate is around 70% with localized disease, metastatic disease survival remains a dismal 20% with little improvement over past years. It is recognized that interactions within the microenvironment can either facilitate or inhibit cancer cell metastasis, thus a deeper analysis of these interactions may identify targetable vulnerabilities of metastatic OS. Previous studies by our lab and others have shown that platelets promote metastasis of several types of cancer. In contrast, the role of megakaryocytes (MKs), platelet producing cells, in cancer metastasis has not been established. While MKs are primarily recognized as platelet producers, they also serve as dynamic regulators of bone production that both influence and are influenced by bone cells. A previous study found that co-culture of OS cells with MKs increased OS proliferation suggesting that MKs could influence OS cells within the bone microenvironment Additionally, a study found that breast cancer tumor bearing mice displayed altered MK polyploidy and increased platelet RNA and protein content demonstrating that tumors can influence MK function and alter the produced platelets. My preliminary data suggests that platelet depletion in mice decreases initial lung seeding of OS cells administered via tail vein. My preliminary data also shows increased MKs but decreased MK ploidy in mice with orthotopic OS tumors. Based on these previous studies and my preliminary data, I hypothesize that OS and MK bidirectional signaling contributes to OS progression and metastasis by exchanging signaling mediators that lead to alterations in MK differentiation, maturation, platelet production and function, while also increasing OS cell proliferation and migration in the primary tumor. To study this mechanism, I will use a novel tibial implantation technique to establish orthotopic primary tumors in both wild-type and MK-depletion mice (PF4CreiDTR mice). I will use this approach to test the following specific aims: Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that OS primary tumors dysregulate MK differentiation and maturation leading to altered platelet proteome content. and function. I will perform the tibial implant procedure or a sham procedure on WT mice and compare bone marrow MK maturation and differentiation via flow cytometry across three time points to evaluate changes in MKs throughout OS tumor progression. I will assess platelet function and activation from both groups via aggregometry and flow cytometry. Finally changes in MK transcriptome and platelet proteome will be compared between groups. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that MK-OS interactions during primary OS tumor development promote OS cell proliferation and metastasis. I will deplete MKs in OS tumor bearing mice and examine how tumor growth, proliferation, lung metastasis, and the tumor transcriptome compare to wild-type (WT) mice. The results of these experiments will reveal how OS-MK interactions affect OS metastasis and identify candidate mediators for future study of the mechanisms involved and of their potential as therapeutic targets."

Adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age, have serious
health consequences not just during infancy but across the life course. Past research shows an immigrant
advantage in birth outcomes compared to women born in the United States; however, recent studies
increasingly show that immigrant women have worse birth outcomes than non-Hispanic white women. Much
research at the intersection of migration and reproductive, maternal, and child health has focused on individual
exposures and risk factors. Yet there is growing evidence that structural factors such as migration policies are
associated with health disparities, and there is limited understanding of the process by which social and policy
environments impact individual-level maternal–fetal medicine outcomes. This K01 Mentored Research
Scientist Development Award focuses on conceptualizing this structural context and its potential impact on
women’s pregnancy and birth outcomes through pathways of structural stigma, social disadvantage, and
spatial isolation. Three proposed areas of training will allow the candidate to develop an independent research
career focused on migration and structural determinants of perinatal health: 1) perinatal epidemiology and
demography, 2) spatial and data science techniques, and 3) qualitative methods. The specific aims will be
achieved using National Center for Health Statistics period-linked infant birth–death data, the National Survey
of Family Growth, and qualitative data on immigrant experiences of social and policy environments collected
during the project period. These data will be used to carry out the following aims: 1) to examine multilevel
effects of social and policy environments on foreign and US-born women’s pregnancy and birth outcomes, 2)
to investigate area-level measures of social and policy environments and foreign and US-born women’s
pregnancy and birth outcomes, and 3) to explore immigrant women’s experiences of stress due to social and
policy environments at destination and their implications for birth outcomes. Expected outcomes are rigorous
knowledge of the impact of structural contexts on pregnancy and birth outcomes as well as health system
precursors of birth outcomes for immigrants in the US. Findings from this research can both identify immigrant
responses to social and policy environments and suggest educational and behavioral interventions that could
improve immigrant responses to structural environment stressors, access to prenatal care, and birth outcomes.
Training and insights from this project will lead to development of a large-scale R01 study extending this line of
research and will further help develop policies that promote maternal, perinatal, and child health."

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common histological subtype of epithelial ovarian
cancer. The overarching goal of the proposed Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) is to apply a by-
design approach based on biology of HGSOC pathogenesis and unmet clinical needs to identify, verify and
prioritize, and validate biomarkers, and to develop them into an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay
(IVDMIA) with the intended use to capture HGSOC in high-risk women at the early stages including i)
precursors, ii) confinement to the ovary/fallopian tube or iii) low-volume diseases in high-risk women (BRCA1/2
carriers). The biomarkers that we propose to discover and validate in this proposal are intended for early
detection but not necessarily for screening in general population. The BCC’s capability in advanced data
generation technologies, multiplexed target assay development, and bioinformatics/data science will serve as
resources for the EDRN. Based on the success of our current EDRN projects, this BCC will continue our on-
going biomarker development studies including the validation of candidate biomarkers that we have identified
through the current BDL. We propose the following specific aims:
1. To optimize and use novel specimen collection and processing technologies, and an iterative and
 cumulative process that takes advantage of our newly gained knowledge of the biology in ovarian cancer
 pathogenesis. BDL
2. To optimize and apply innovative bioinformatics, data sciences, and AI/ML tools that incorporate existing
 knowledge and data to improve discovery of low frequency biomarkers that with their functionally shared
 pathways/networks could collectively deliver an improved sensitivity while retaining a high specificity. BDL
3. To further develop and optimize the process for efficient multiplex targeted assay development with respect
 to analytical performance, throughput, and specimen volume requirement for a broad spectrum of
 candidate biomarkers using a “fit for purpose” approach. BRL
4. To optimize and apply a by-design approach to translating discoveries into clinical tests. Its application had
 been critical in the development of two FDA cleared tests by JHU team members for the preoperative
 assessment of ovarian malignancy risk. BDL/BRL
5. To provide expertise and analytical and data science capabilities to the entire EDRN community.
The multi-disciplinary team that we have assembled (molecular cancer biology, pathology, clinical chemistry,
mass spectrometry, biostatistics, data science, bioengineering), the unique, novel yet biologically and
statistically sound approaches, and our long-standing experience in biomarker research and translating
discoveries to FDA cleared clinical tests all together ensure the success of this proposed BCC."
10906900,"Technology and digital media (TDM), which includes TV viewing, playing computer games, and mobile device
use, is common among preschool aged children. Many young children exceed the recommended <1 hour/day
of parent supervised TDM use. This is concerning because excessive TDM use has been linked to health
problems, such as higher risk of overweight and obesity among children. The pathways linking TDM use with
risk of obesity have not been robustly established, but sleep is one hypothesized mediator that warrants
investigation. Any impact TDM has on child sleep could also influence other health and developmental outcomes
previously associated with poor sleep in children. Past studies of TDM use among young children primarily relied
on parent report of children’s typical use of TDM, resulting in both over- and under-reporting of TDM use. The
validity of findings from these past studies are therefore questioned. FLASH-TV is a new technology developed
by our team to passively, objectively measure children’s viewing of large digital screens, such as TVs or video-
game consoles. In this proposal we propose to leverage FLASH-TV along with new approaches for measuring
children’s use of mobile devices, to robustly assess children’s use of TDM across multiple platforms (TV, mobile
devices, and videogame consoles) over 10 days at two time-points, 12 months apart. We will combine the novel
TDM use assessment with robust, valid approaches for measuring children’s sleep (wrist-worn acigraphy) in a
diverse cohort of 4-year old children (n=200). Height and weight will be collected on the children and parents.
Parents will report on home environmental variables that are hypothesized to influence the child’s TDM use
(TDM parenting practices, TDM inventory of the home, parents’ outcome expectations for child’s TDM use, and
neighborhood disorder) and sleep (sleep parenting practices, child’s sleep hygiene environment, parents’
outcome expectations for child’s sleep). For the first time, these novel approaches to passively and objectively
measure children’s TDM use in their home environment over multiple days allows us to assess the with-in and
between child association of children’s TDM use and children’s sleep at baseline and over 12 mo. This study
design will also allow us to more robustly assess the association between children’s TDM use and their weight
status over 12 mo, and whether sleep mediates the association between TDM and weight status. Lastly, we will
explore the association of the home and social environments on children’s TDM use and sleep in cross-sectional
and longitudinal models. To promote synergy and cost-effectiveness within this program grant, the cohort
established in project 1 will be leveraged by project 2 to investigate the impact of TDM use on children’s
developmental outcomes. A Digital Assessment Core will provide the technology and processing support for the
TDM and sleep assessments of all projects and a Biostatistics and Database Management Core will ensure
harmonization of variables, database integrity, and statistical support. This project will thereby help provide the
first robust data for the influence of TDM use on children’s sleep and weight status to inform future guidelines."
10906808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Over the quarter century of this grant funding, we have been developing tools to investigate the fate of
single mRNA molecules in living cells. Most recently we have been able to image the real time translation
of proteins in living cells, and the degradation of mRNAs at a precise moment during the cell cycle. We
now would like to integrate all these processes into one coherent scheme, by imaging a single mRNA
molecule from birth to death. This provides technical challenges, due to the photobleaching of fluorescent
proteins and the difficulty of tracking mRNAs in a crowded cytoplasm. We propose in this application to
address these obstacles by developing new approaches to reduce photobleaching in order to track mRNAs
for longer times, equivalent to their lifetimes. We will reversibly photoactivate the mRNAs as they are
transcribed in the nucleus, and then follow the few mRNAs as they export into the cytoplasm, translate
and degrade. We will likewise simultaneously follow proteins bound to the mRNA in the nucleus that may
regulate these processes. This will allow us to follow a single mRNA and proteins bound to it throughout
its entire life cycle."
10917082,"Project Abstract
Approximately 350,000 people suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year, with an average survival
rate with good neurological function of only 9.0%. In response to the clear public health imperative signaled by
these statistics, the Institute of Medicine in 2015 called for studies on implementation of interventions for
OHCA at the community, emergency medical services (EMS), and hospital levels. The lack of consistent use of
effective interventions across the country is largely due to the lack of high quality evidence from randomized
trials on how to implement these interventions at the systems (community) level. The proposed Regional
Approaches to Cardiovascular Emergencies- Cardiac ARreSt (RACE-CARS) cluster-randomized trial has been
designed to develop new systems-based high quality clinical trial evidence on how to improve outcomes for
OHCA. The premise for RACE-CARS is based on prior observations showing substantial regional
heterogeneity in care correlated with variations in outcomes. In 11 North Carolina counties, we observed
improved rates of bystander CPR and first responder defibrillation, associated with a 37% increase in survival
with good neurologic outcome over a 4-year period.
RACE-CARS, a 7-year pragmatic, cluster randomized (1:1) trial of 50 counties in NC, will test whether
implementation of a customized set of strategically targeted community-based interventions can improve
survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function in OHCA relative to control/standard care. Our
intervention program will consist of 4 main elements: (1) optimized medical 911-dispatch performance with
rapid recognition of cardiac arrest and dispatch of emergency response, (2) enhanced 911-dispatch telephone
coaching of bystander CPR, (3) improved first responder performance with AED use, and (4) comprehensive
public training of CPR and AED use. Quality of life and neurological functional status will be assessed at 6 and
12 months. RACE-CARS will leverage our statewide emergency care network, which has successfully
collaborated on improving quality of emergency cardiovascular care over the past 14 years, and ongoing data
collection of the majority of cardiac arrests in NC using the CARES registry. We will enroll ~20,000 patients
with cardiac arrest over the study period, to give us >90% power to detect a 30% increase in bystander CPR,
and 50% increase in bystander or first responder defibrillation, and > 85% power to detect a 33% increase in
survival with good neurologic outcome. While all the intervention approaches have evidence for improved
outcomes in prior observational studies, RACE CARS is unique in combining these efforts into a pragmatic
randomized systems-based implementation trial that can be adjusted to the needs and abilities/resources of
regions that vary according to population density, demographic and socioeconomic status.

Behavior (NB&B). The goals of this program, established in 1995, are two-fold: First, to prepare exceptional
predoctoral students for productive careers in neuroscience research and related fields; and Second, to
train scientists who seek to broaden our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the nervous
system and the many disorders that affect it. We achieve this through a multidisciplinary training program
aimed to provide students with a solid foundation in rigorous experimental design and strong quantitative
and analytical skills, coupled with broad based knowledge of neuroscience and allied disciplines. The first
year begins with a student run orientation – “Bootcamp” – which introduces trainees to current research
approaches. During the first year, students take Analysis for Neuroscientists, which lays a foundation for
rigorous research during three laboratory rotations and subsequent thesis research. A year-long Survey of
Neuroscience course provides an in-depth introduction to Cellular and Molecular neuroscience during the
Fall semester and to Systems and Developmental Neuroscience during the Spring, ensuring core
knowledge for all students independent of prior academic background. By the end of their first year in the
program students select a mentor to guide their thesis research. In their second year, students begin thesis
research, develop a research proposal, select two advanced elective courses, and take a qualifying exam.
Research progress is monitored by the mentor, Co-Directors, the student’s thesis committee, and a Student
Progress Committee. Students gain professional skills in writing, presenting, and cutting-edge research
techniques through research-in-progress talks, a weekly seminar series, skills-based nanocourses, journal
clubs, and a program retreat. These events also ensure an active and cohesive community of mentors and
students. Students participate in nationally- recognized outreach programs including NeuWrite and
Columbia University Neuroscience Outreach (CUNO). The program is administered by the Department of
Neuroscience, and is strongly interdisciplinary with 63 participating faculty from departments across the
Health Sciences campus, Schools of Arts and Sciences/Engineering, and the Zuckerman Institute. Mentor
labs provide a broad range of research topics and training opportunities for NB&B students. The program
receives feedback from External, Internal, and Student Advisory Committees. Between 2013-2019 we
received an average of 423 applications per year, with 64% of these training grant eligible. In 2019 we
accepted 35 students and 18 will enroll, for a 51% yield. We actively recruit applicants from
underrepresented groups and between 2-8 have matriculated annually over the last 10 years. Graduates
go on to make substantial contributions to biomedical research within academia and in science-allied
careers outside of academia. We request stipend and tuition support for 10 students total in years 1 and 2."
10917222,"When an observer moves through the environment, self-motion creates large-field patterns of
visual motion known as optic flow. Cortical processing of optic flow is important for perception of
self-motion, as demonstrated in animal models. In most navigation behaviors, such as driving a
vehicle, optic-flow processing is part of an active sensing loop in which self-motion produces
optic flow which is, in turn, used to change direction at the next instant of time. While this is a
natural mode of optic flow processing, almost all previous studies of neural processing of optic
flow involve passive self-motion without an active control component. Indeed, the patterns of
optic flow that are experienced when steering a vehicle along a curved path are quite different
than those typically used to study cortical neurons. Thus, what we know about cortical
processing of optic flow is generally not applicable to control of steering. Furthermore, to
effectively steer, control theory indicates that optic flow signals should be combined with
efference copy of motor commands and working memory signals, but essentially nothing is
known about these critical interactions. We propose a tightly integrated program of research,
involving behavior, neurophysiology and theory, that will provide the first systematic study of the
neural mechanisms of visually guided steering control. In Aim #1, we train monkeys to steer
through a virtual environment to align their heading with the remembered direction of a briefly
flashed target. We develop optimal stochastic control theory for our task, and we fit the model to
behavioral data to extract estimates of key latent variables that govern steering control. In Aim
#2, we record from populations of neurons in areas MSTd and 7a during performance of the
steering task. Using both model-free and model-based analyses, we test specific hypotheses
about how and where the critical variables for steering control are represented in the brain. Our
strong preliminary data suggest that we will make important advances in understanding cortical
processing of optic flow in a more natural active-sensing context. The proposed research is
directly relevant to the research priorities of the Strabismus, Amblyopia, and Visual Processing
program at the National Eye Institute."
10917414,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small Animal Radiation Research (SARR) is of paramount importance for the advancement of human
radiotherapy (RT) by serving as a critical counterpart to perform comprehensive preclinical studies on a large
number of subjects under controlled experimental conditions at low costs. SARR relies on dedicated platforms
to administer radiation dose to animals in a similar way as in the clinic. Current-generation SARR irradiators,
developed in the past decade, have failed to keep pace with technology advancements in human RT. In stark
contrast to modern RT treatments where novel anatomical and functional imaging, inverse treatment planning,
and intensity modulated delivery techniques are routinely employed to precisely form an extremely conformal
dose distribution to the tumor, the therapeutic form in current SARR systems resembles an obsolete form of
human RT. This technology disparity has substantially impaired SARR study relevance to human RT, impeded
explorations in RT research, and hindered rapid conduction of SARR studies. Towards addressing this
problem, in response to PAR-15-075, this project will develop and translate a next-generation SARR platform
through an academic-industrial partnership, joining medical physicists and radiobiologists at UT Southwestern
Medical Center (UTSW) with engineering experts at Faxitron Bioptics LLC (Faxitron). The developed system
will be substantially superior to the current state-of-the-art SARR platform due to its novel imaging methods
(dual energy cone beam CT and PET), intensity modulated radiotherapy, and high computation and treatment
delivery efficiency. These novel features are expected to improve SARR research relevance to human RT by
delivering treatments of clinical quality, to support exploration in modern RT by offering technical freedom to
realize novel imaging and therapy approaches, and to increase research efficiency by enhancing
computational speed and workflow. We will perform studies with the following specific aims (SAs): SA1: Refine
hardware design and construct the hardware system including mechanical, imaging, and therapy subsystems.
SA2: Refine software design and develop an imaging and treatment planning system accompanied with the
hardware platform. SA3: Perform comprehensive system tests, develop a translation plan, and demonstrate
achieved advantages of the system via an animal study on image-guided intensity-modulated lung stereotactic
body radiotherapy using rats. The innovation of this project includes novel technological capabilities enabled by
the next-generation SARR platform, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end-
users. Project feasibility is ensured by extensive preliminary studies, and the research team integrating medical
physicists and radiobiologists (UTSW) with strong clinical and research expertise and engineers (Faxitron) with
extensive commercial product development experience. By filling the critical void between SARR and human
RT, the developed system will become an essential component in preclinical research for the exploration of
novel radiotherapeutic strategies with high relevance to human RT."
10905517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually transmitted infections and
infectious blindness, with over 150 million cases worldwide. Yet, it is still considered a neglected disease
pathogen by the World Health Organization. Once inside the cell, Chlamydia replicates within a parasitic
compartment called an inclusion, the integrity of which is essential for Chlamydia survival. Inclusion
membranes are decorated with ~60 transmembrane Inc proteins that directly interact with host cell
components and play a critical role in sustaining Chlamydia’s life cycle. These inclusion proteins include IncA,
which is required for the homotypic fusion of chlamydial inclusions. This fusion event is important for
pathogenicity as patients infected with non-fusogenic C. trachomatis strains that express mutated forms of
IncA display fewer clinical symptoms than those infected with WT C. trachomatis. Yet, how Chlamydia controls
homotypic fusion is unknown. While the chlamydial protein IncA is involved, little is known about the molecular
mechanism regulating homotypic fusion. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that the bacterial fusion
protein IncA uses a combination of intra- and extra-molecular regulatory mechanisms to control membrane
fusion and ensure the proper maturation of the inclusion. Our extensive expertise in membrane fusion and
Chlamydia pathogenesis places us in an ideal position to address this significant knowledge gap.
 Unlike membrane fusion driven by eukaryotic cells and enveloped viruses, which are extensively studied,
membrane fusion driven by bacteria is poorly understood. This project will characterize a novel prokaryotic
fusion system, thus providing a roadmap to identify similar fusion systems in other bacteria. In parallel, data
gathered here will determine the extent to which this homotypic fusion event is essential for C. trachomatis
fitness, thus providing new information about disease progression."
10907563,"Despite the notable scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among pregnant and postpartum women
living with HIV (PWLWH) globally, reductions in new HIV infections in children have plateaued and significant
numbers of PWLWH are still not able to achieve optimal health outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, emerging
evidence indicates some vulnerable sub-groups of PWLWH are at higher risk of poor ART adherence,
disengagement from HIV care, and unsuppressed viral loads. In order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission
and protect maternal health, it is critical to identify these PWLWH at risk of suboptimal outcomes early and
provide effective interventions that address key challenges. There is significant evidence that psychosocial
stressors—HIV-related stigma, intimate partner violence, and lack of ability to disclose HIV status—are major
drivers of treatment lapses in this population. Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a lay health worker-delivered
intervention that has high potential to address psychosocial stressors and promote treatment engagement for
high risk PWLWH. PM+ combines problem-solving therapy and behavioral strategies to address mental distress
and has been adapted and implemented in other populations in Kenya. In the current study, we propose to
develop and validate a multivariable prediction tool (i.e., “risk calculator”) using socio-demographic, clinical, and
psychosocial data from our recent longitudinal studies with large samples of PWLWH in southwestern Kenya,
the same setting where our current study is proposed (Aim 1). We will establish risk prioritization scores (critical,
moderate, minor) that predict the combined outcome of a missed visit (> 30 days) or treatment failure (elevated
viral load >400 copies/ml). Next, we will utilize a human centered design (HCD) approach to work collaboratively
with PWLWH and key stakeholders to tailor modifiable components of the PM+ intervention to address
challenges to achieving optimal HIV treatment outcomes in this population (Aim 2). We will collaborate with
PWLWH and lay health workers to develop both mobile phone (mHealth) and in-person PM+ delivery formats to
be able to deliver the intervention safely and efficiently to a mobile population. Finally, we will pilot our tailored
intervention in a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in which pregnant women identified as critical
or moderate risk are randomized to one of three study arms 1:1:1 standard of care, in-person PM+, or mHealth
PM+ and followed through 6 months postpartum (N=120). Feasibility, acceptability, intervention satisfaction, and
preliminary effects on mental health and HIV outcomes will be assessed. Findings from this research will prepare
us for a large-scale trial in which we intend to use an adaptive design to test which interventions (including
adapted PM+), combination of interventions, and sequence of interventions are the most effective and efficient
to support the most vulnerable PWLWH in low-resource settings. This research will result in effective tools and
adaptive intervention modalities which will contribute to eliminating mother-to-child transmission and achieving
related global maternal and child health goals."
10907717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA and is
anticipated to become the second leading cause by 2030. Its characteristic desmoplastic stroma, constituting
60–70% of its volume, is one of the critical factors that contributes to the dismal outcomes. Fibroblast activation
protein (FAP)-expressing Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most important stromal
constituents because they play a fundamental role in the carcinogenesis, fibrosis, tumor growth, metastases,
and treatment resistance. FAP expression in PDA is an independent predictor of poor outcomes. Lack of
noninvasive tools to precisely profile CAF identity and function both temporally and spatially in vivo is a critical
barrier for translation of existing knowledge of the tumor microenvironment to address unmet clinical needs.
68Ga-FAP-inhibitor (FAPI)-46 has emerged as a PET radiotracer with optimal properties for FAP-targeted clinical
imaging and theranostics in PDA. These include low nanomolar affinity to FAP, near-complete internalization of
radioactivity bound to FAP, absence of physiologic uptake, rapid blood clearance and prolonged tumor retention,
and operational characteristics that offer tremendous flexibility to suit the clinical context, PET scanner profile,
and workflow for patients with PDA. Traditionally, long regulatory and reimbursement approval pathways coupled
with high costs of comparative studies have delayed clinical access to promising precision tools such as 68Ga-
FAPI-46 PET. Thus, for the clinical translation of a theranostic radiotracer such as 68Ga-FAPI-46, an academic-
industrial partnership (AIP) based on complementary strengths and a coherent clinical development strategy is
needed to reduce the risk and raise the likelihood of meeting FDA standards and consumer expectations. Our
AIP - Mayo Clinic and Sofie Biosciences (“SOFIE”) - will undertake a clinical investigation in compliance with
FDA standards to form the basis of a new drug application (NDA) with the goal to deliver a new capability to end
users, consistent with this FOA’s intent. Our hypothesis is that 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be an accurate technique
to detect and quantify CAFs and that metrics derived from 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be novel biomarkers in PDA.
In Aim 1, using immunophenotyping as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-FAPI-46
PET will be evaluated for the detection and quantification of CAFs in PDA, along with inter-reader and intra-
reader reliability, and the dynamic changes in 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET biomarkers in response to neoadjuvant
treatment. In Aim 2, 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be compared, correlated, and combined with other mechanistically
distinct investigations to improve pre-surgical staging and to predict post-surgical outcomes. Our AIP has the
potential to deliver a noninvasive molecular imaging assay that can provide greater insight into disease biology,
impact clinical practice, predict outcomes, potentiate existing therapeutics, and yield a pathway to novel
therapeutic approaches. Given the wide and evolving role of FAPI imaging and theranostics, our AIP has the
potential to scale our impact beyond PDA to other oncologic and non-oncologic applications."

10909116,"Women with breast cancer and co-morbid Type 2 diabetes (T2D) have up to 40% worse overall survival
compared to non-diabetic women; this co-morbidity burden is disproportionately high among vulnerable cohorts,
such as patients at safety net hospitals in the U.S., where it can affect half of the patient population. Yet, current
models of breast tumor progression and immunotherapy are based on data from metabolically healthy cancer
patients, ignoring metabolic /inflammatory components of T2D. Preliminary and published data support an overall
hypothesis: specific metabolic and immune exhaustion networks in breast cancer patients with co-morbid T2D
promote tumor aggressiveness. We propose an innovative multiscale modelling framework to identify these
networks by integrating metabolic, inflammatory and immune signatures in multi-omics cancer models
encompassing RNA-seq and phosphoproteomics data. We take a systems biology approach to combine
innovative computational, clinical and patient-derived tumor organoid experiments to investigate interactions
among putative driver genes, T2D and immune exhaustion, with tumor progression/aggressiveness as the
primary outcome variable in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer, which has poor prognosis and is
highly prevalent among safety net hospital patients. We will model how T2D rewires signaling hubs, nodes and
edges in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, then test these networks in breast organoid models. We will
develop a unified model through three Aims: Aim 1: Determine how T2D reprograms immune exhaustion and
metabolism in the tumor microenvironment of ER negative (ER-) breast cancer. We will apply RNAseq and
scRNAseq to primary ER- breast cancer cells and tumor immune infiltrates to compare three groups of patients
(T2D, T2D+ metformin-medicated (T2D+M), non-diabetic (ND) controls) to construct a preliminary network
supplemented with TCGA data. Differential gene and pathway analyses will elucidate regulatory relationships
and key hubs. We hypothesize that the connectivity of the ER- cluster in T2D will be altered and denser than in
ND or T2D+M. Aim 2: We will generate patient-derived organoids, including organoid-primed T cells (OpT), to
test the computational model for metabolism and immune checkpoints. We will evaluate mechanistic hypotheses
that T2D medications, immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies and chemical inhibitors of BET bromodomain
proteins (which regulate checkpoint expression) overcome immune exhaustion to improve OpT cell metabolism
and tumor cell killing. TCR sequencing will reveal emergent OpT oligoclonality; deep immunophenotyping will
reveal T2D-driven signaling networks. Aim 3: Determine abnormal signaling networks impacting cancer immunity
in organoid and OpT models. We will perform deep phosphoproteomic profiling of primary tumors, organoids,
circulating T cells and OpT cells, from the three metabolic groups, then use pathway projection and network
analyses to refine our integrated model. Together, our unique systems biology approach will capture the complex
interactions among tumor, immune infiltrates and metabolic genes to address the cancer burden of T2D."

Computer aided drug discovery (CADD) can dramatically accelerate and lower costs for the often long and
expensive process of drug development. However, most CADD techniques are created for small organic
molecules, and tend to be less accurate for drugs designed around biological scaffolds or that include
unique chemical properties. The overall goal of the Walker lab is to develop and apply multiscale models
for rational design of complex biomolecules. In this proposal, we detail our strategies to: automate the
creation of large, high quality datasets with accurate simulations, and develop and apply machine learning
(ML) models to design new nucleic acid-based imaging agents and carbohydrate-based drugs.
Carbohydrates, particularly polysaccharides, are highly flexible, and our previous work has demonstrated
the inaccuracy of even very high quality docking scores as compared to experimental affinities. Similarly,
the rational design of synthetic fluorescent nucleobases (SFNs) is challenging because understanding their
photophysics requires computing excited state properties. In both cases, we hypothesize that by creating
ML models that learn the statistical correlation between highly accurate simulations and known
experimental properties, we can both learn new rational design principles and predict novel drug targets."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share critical common risk factors, including type
2 diabetes (T2D), chronic inflammation, and hypercholesterolemia. The coexistence of CVD and AD can lower
the threshold for cognitive impairment, indicating a synergistic interaction among those diseases. Meta-
analyses have demonstrated that atherosclerosis, a leading underlying cause of CVDs, is positively associated
with AD. Human genetic studies uncovered that variants in the CCDC92 gene are significantly associated with
coronary heart disease and T2D. Our recent studies demonstrated that CCDC92 ablation reduces insulin
resistance and hypercholesterolemia in mice. In the parent grant, we demonstrated that CCDC92 has a
prominent role in atherosclerosis via inducing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switch and the
release of VSMC-derived proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, CCDC92 is a potent regulator of transcription
factor EB (TFEB), which suppresses inflammation and controls autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Notably,
strong evidence shows that TFEB overexpression in neurons and astrocytes inhibits AD pathogenesis. Our
preliminary data indicate that CCDC92 expression is regulated in AD patients' cerebral vessels. However,
vascular CCDC92-dependent behavioral studies, neuropathology, and neuroinflammation have yet to be
determined. This Administrative Supplement will examine the central hypothesis that VSMC CCDC92
contributes to AD formation and progression via modulating neuroinflammation. Male and female VSMC-
specific Ccdc92 knockout (KO) mice and knock-in (KI) mice carrying the Ccdc92 S70C coding variant on a low-
density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr KO) background, as well as TFEB activators, will be utilized for
these studies, which are within the scope of the parent grant. We will examine this hypothesis utilizing two
specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of VSMC-specific Ccdc92 in neuroinflammation and
atherosclerosis-induced AD. Aim 2 will determine the effect of the CCDC92 S70C coding variant on
neuroinflammation and the development and progression of AD. Cerebrovascular function, atherosclerosis, β-
amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation will be measured in those mice. Single-cell
RNA seq analysis will be conducted to understand the gene regulatory networks and cell-cell communications
in AD brains. We will use Morris Water Maze test to evaluate cognitive function and magnetic resonance
imaging to assess cerebral blood flow. Elucidating the role of CCDC92 in cerebral vessels and

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic and therapy-resistant cancer. The role of
the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC remains elusive with studies supporting both tumor-promoting or tumor-
restricting functions. The failure of stroma targeting therapies suggests that a deeper understanding of the
complex cancer-stroma interaction is needed. Type I collagen (Col I), the major ECM protein in PDAC, can
physically restrain tumors and limit nutrient availability. Yet, PDAC cells adapt and exploit the surrounding stroma
to acquire more advanced malignant traits. Moreover, the desmoplastic collagen-rich stroma may suppress
immunosurveillance and activate tumor-promoting mechanosensitive signaling. It is likely that tumor-promoting
and tumor-suppressive effects of CAF and ECM occur in parallel and that their balance determines the net effect
on PDAC growth. We seek to better understand these opposing functions by focusing on Col I as a key mediator
of stroma-PDAC crosstalk. Clinical studies show improved progression-free survival (PFS) after resection in
patients with “inert stroma” characterized by extensive ECM deposition and low fibrolytic activity, whereas highly
fibrolytic stroma is associated with much shorter PFS times. Based on this finding we hypothesize that rather
than the sheer quantity of CAF and stroma, collagen fibrolysis and differential effects of receptors that
discriminate between intact and cleaved Col I dictate tumor growth and immunity. Our preliminary data support
this hypothesis, indicating differential regulation of cancer cell metabolism by intact and cleaved collagen through
a specific receptor, DDR1; as well as high expression of the inhibitory Col I receptor LAIR1 on immune cells and
a role for Col I in immune cell infiltration and activation in PDAC spread to the liver, the most common site of
metastasis and a suppressor of systemic anti-tumor immunity. Our long-term goal is to develop therapies that
target collagen receptors and shift the balance from immunosuppression and tumor promotion by cleaved
collagen to tumor starvation, growth inhibition and enhanced anti-tumor immunity, rather than CAF depletion or
modulation, which so far had resulted in untoward effects. Our interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical-
translational investigators will utilize clinical specimens, tumor slice cultures, single cell RNA-sequencing, spatial
transcriptomics, mouse models and PDAC-ECM co-cultures to elucidate the role of collagen receptor signaling
via two closely integrated specific aims: 1. Test the hypothesis that collagen fragments and fibers antagonistically
control PDAC metabolism through the PDAC-intrinsic collagen receptor DDR1, whose inhibition can switch off
tumor metabolism and induce cell death. 2. Test the hypothesis that stimulatory and inhibitory collagen receptors
control anti-PDAC immunity and can be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors to increase anti-tumor
immunity. The successful completion of these research goals will provide us with novel tools for converting
stroma-mediated tumor growth and immunosuppression to growth inhibition and anti-tumor immunity."

We are requesting support for a new interdisciplinary “Clinical Translational Research Certificate of Added
Qualification” (CTR-CAQ) training program for graduate students enrolled in any of the PhD-awarding graduate
programs at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). This program has strong support from BCM leadership,
graduate faculty and students. The mission of the rigorous two-year program is to provide students who seek a
career focused on the translation of biomedical discoveries into molecular medicine advances, with integrated
education in the foundational knowledge and professional skills required to lead effective translational research
teams. The rationale for this program builds upon our 14-year experience of successfully integrating
translational research training in a single graduate program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine
(TBMM). A diverse group of TBMM graduates are currently engaged in multiple diverse translational research
careers. This success provided the premise that translational research training accessible to all graduate
students at BCM is vital to develop a diverse research workforce in all subdisciplines of biomedical science.
This need cannot be reliant on physician-scientists alone and must include a diverse cadre of PhD scientists.
Internal evaluation of TBMM outcomes and review of national priorities for education and skills development to
enhance career preparedness of an increasingly important translational research workforce, form the basis of
measurable objectives of the new program. We will combine the best components of the legacy TBMM
program with several new innovative strategies for: (a) Recruitment and retention of a diverse cadre of
students in the translational workforce; (b) Mentor training, mentor collaboration, and mentorship oversight; (c)
Practical skill development and career preparedness for translational research, including training in regulatory
knowledge and its practical application in meaningful team-based science, and in leadership; (d) Formal
evaluation of overall programmatic effectiveness, individual perceived benefits during the trainee trajectory
through the program, and of short- and long-term outcomes upon completion of the program.
Thus, the primary objectives of the program are: (1) to prepare students for careers in translational research by
combining formative didactic teaching, skill development workshops and experiential learning in clinical
research settings with a mentored translational research project deliverable in the form of a capstone project
with team-work components; (2) to effectively integrate this program with the training in the primary PhD-
training programs; (3) to develop and monitor best mentorship practices; (4) to formally evaluate programmatic
and individual outcomes during and after students participate in the CTR-CAQ program. We anticipate that this
program will develop a cadre of leaders in translational molecular medicine and team-based research who will
remain engaged in a diverse array of academic and non-academic biomedical science careers."
10941082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Collective migration is a type of cell migrationwhere groups of cells move together in a coordinated
fashion that is essential for development and disease progression, including wound healing or metastasis. During
collective migration, a few cells at the front (i.e. leader cells) define the leading edge, integrate signals from the
surrounding environment and send signals to neighboring (follower) cells. Recent findings in our lab demonstrate in
order for collective migration to occur, leader cells must first arrive (or polarize) at the front edge to begin the
collective migration cascade. However, it is largely unknown how leader cells interpret signals from the
microenvironment via sensing of mechanical forces and how cell junction forces contribute to leader cell activation
and collective migration. Thus, there is much interest to understand leader cell mechanotransduction and the
signaling mechanisms used to drive collective migration.
Hypothesis: Our central hypothesis is that dynamic extracellular matrix cues activate leader cell mechanics
via both cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts, are required to initiate and sustain directional collective migration.
Goals: This project is divided into 3 main goals: 1. Investigate the effect of biomechanical cues to activate
leader cells and directional collective migration 2. Elucidate which and how leader cell mechanics are
responsible for leader cell development, and 3. Investigate the functional role of forces at cell contacts and how
cell junctional forces contribute to collective migration
Study Design: We will combine microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices which can modulate multiple
microenvironment features, and investigate how mechanical cues effect leader cell development and
directional collective migration. We will also incorporate FRET-based tension sensors to our microfluidic
platform so we can quantify changes in cell-cell load during leader cell driven collective migration in real-time.
To understand how cell-matrix interactions effect leader cell development, we will measure matrix deformation
rate as exerted by leader cells on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, we will perform series of targeted
knockdowns and rescue experiments to investigate our ability to disrupt, prevent, or revive collective migration
by disrupting leader cell signaling. These studies will reveal how microenvironment cues, cell-matrix, and cell-
cell interactions contribute to leader cell development and mechanics that is essential for collective migration.
Impact: Understanding the development of collective migration, and the role of leader cells in driving collective
migration will pave the way for accelerated understanding of biological processes where collective migration is
fundamental to its success."
10907503,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are difficult to study and treat with pharmacological interventions
due to the need for personalized medicine regimens, limited availability of human myocardium
samples, and the difficulty associated with culturing primary cardiomyocytes in vitro for preclinical
drug testing. In vivo animal studies are currently used to screen novel CVD therapeutics but are
inefficient due to the associated high cost and advanced technical skill level. Incorporating human
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived cardiovascular cells into relevant microfluidic
devices provides a controlled, reproducible, and patient-specific (targeted) platform to study in
vitro the complex process of CVD progression along with the cellular response to biochemical
and biophysical changes in their microenvironments. Current in vitro cardiovascular tissue models
incorporate cells from different sources and have not yet demonstrated a functional integration of
cardiomyocytes with capillary-like networks composed of endothelial cells. Furthermore,
microfluidic devices used with these models predominantly rely on external pumps to move fluid
through the system.
My long-term goals are to develop a patient-specific cardiovascular tissue model and
autonomous-flow microfluidic culture platform to: 1) assess the effects of pharmaceutical drug
exposure on human myocardium in vitro and 2) conduct fundamental studies of real-time
cardiomyocyte-endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interaction for cardiomyopathy, atrial
fibrillation, and atherosclerosis. The central hypothesis is that combining hiPSC derived 3D
cardiovascular tissue with an autonomous-flow microfluidic device will create a patient-specific,
physiologically relevant model that facilitates in vitro study of functional human myocardium. The
primary impact of this work is development of a targeted, single source cardiovascular tissue
model that will contribute to more effective drug discovery by reflecting human response to
therapeutics and help reduce the use of costly animal models. This work also contributes to
expanding the genetic diversity in preclinical drug testing studies so results are more
representative of the general population."
10907506,"ERPS Project Summary
Given the large impact of Iowa's egg handling industry, providing high quality inspections based on
the scientific principles of feed/food safety is paramount to protecting Iowans and consumers
throughout the nation and world. Furthermore, the federal governments continues to focus on food
safety nationally as demonstrated by the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).
Similarly, within Iowa we have found an added interest in food safety.
The Bureau has identified that we will be no longer able to keep up with the growing number of
questions and requests to provide assistance and speak to various groups regarding egg safety. As
part of the ERPS cooperative agreement option, the Bureau is requesting funding to craft the
documents needed for ERPS compliance, for training of personnel, and to conduct outreach and
public education. Continuous improvement in Egg Safety and Quality is absolutely essential to meet
the needs of Iowans. However, the State's resources are currently not adequate to respond to the
growing needs of egg handlers and consumers across Iowa.
The Bureau anticipates participation in this cooperative agreement will result in significant
enhancement in the quality of inspections and inspectors egg and bio-security knowledge for Iowa's
egg handling facilities. This will be obtained by the following:
 • The State will achieve and sustain significant to full conformance with the Egg Safety
 Regulatory Program Standards (ERPS).
 • The State has and will continue to actively engage through an annual face-to face meeting (if
 applicable) and participation in committees supporting ERPS.
 • The State will collaboratively develop strategies and share those strategies with FDA, States,
 Counties and local agencies.
 • The State will work with FDA establishing the foundation for pursuing regulatory action based
 upon the findings of state inspections at state egg handler facilities.
The goal of this project is to attain full conformance with the ERPS within 3 years and to put into
place the tools necessary to allow continuous improvement and to ensure continued compliance
once the funding is discontinued."
10907515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease, is the leading cause
of death in the United States. A better understanding of the pathomechanisms of atherosclerosis is critical to
identify more effective therapeutic strategies to treat atherosclerosis. Recent studies demonstrated that majority
of the circulating monocyte pool in patients with atherosclerosis are lipid-laden foamy monocytes and
pharmacological depletion of foamy monocytes in hypercholesterolemic mice attenuates atherosclerosis
development. Although these studies suggest that monocyte uptake of plasma LDL is a therapeutic target in
atherosclerosis, the mechanism of foamy monocyte formation is currently unknown. Preliminary studies
demonstrate for the first time that chemical stimulation of macropinocytosis promotes native LDL uptake, leading
to foamy monocyte formation in vitro. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of macropinocytosis and genetic
deletion of the macropinocytosis regulator, NHE1, selectively in myeloid cells attenuates atherosclerosis
development in hypercholesterolemic mice. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that stimulation of
macropinocytosis promotes monocyte lipid uptake and foamy monocyte formation. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that physiologically relevant stimulators of macropinocytosis increase foamy monocyte formation in vitro. We will
assess the ability of human primary and THP1 monocytes to uptake lipids in the presence or absence of
physiologically relevant macropinocytosis stimulators and pharmacological inhibitors. The relative contribution
of scavenger receptor-mediated lipid uptake vs. macropinocytosis will be quantified using monocytes from wild
type, CD36-/-, SRA-/- and CD36-/-/SRA-/- mice. Finally, we will assess phenotypic and functional changes in foamy
monocytes relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that myeloid cell-
specific deletion of the macropinocytosis regulator, NHE1, inhibits foamy monocyte formation in vivo. Monocytes
from NHE1f/f Lysm Cre+ and littermate Cre- mice injected with AAV8-PCSK9 will be isolated and analyzed for lipid
content, inflammatory cytokine secretion, inflammatory markers, and adhesion ability. Additionally, we will use
wild type and CD36-/-/SRA-/- mice to assess the effect of a repurposed FDA-approved drug that inhibits
macropinocytosis in attenuating circulating foamy monocyte levels. This project will allow me to develop new
technical skills, gain expertise in conducting rigorous, hypothesis-driven research and improve my independent
skills. The project will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Gabor Csanyi and Dr. Neal Weintraub in the
Vascular Biology Center at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, which has a rich history of
successful pre- and post-doctoral training. The proposed project is for 3 years of funding with the aims divided
amongst the 3 years of funding, culminating with a dissertation defense at the end of the third year. We anticipate
that findings from this novel proposal will identify macropinocytosis as a key mechanism by which monocytes
internalize lipids and will highlight this pathway as a new therapeutic target in atherosclerosis."
10907644,"Project Summary/Abstract
Annually, over one million newborns are born to obese mothers in the US and suffer a higher risk of
developing type 2 diabetes at a younger age. The development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the
offspring of obese mothers is secondary to a combination of insulin resistance, increased adiposity,
increased inflammation, and decreased β cell function. Using preclinical models of maternal obesity,
we and others have shown that male offspring are more likely to develop islet insulin secretory
dysfunction compared to female offspring. However, the underlying molecular processes remain
unclear. Our preliminary data also showed that the sex-differences in glucose intolerance and islet
dysfunction correlated with differential expression of Regenerating islet derived protein 3-Gamma
(Reg3g). Reg3g is a ligand to Exostosin-Like Glycosyltransferase 3 (EXTL3) that initiates heparan
sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSG) polymerization. Specifically, we found that female offspring
exposed to maternal obesity exhibited higher islet Reg3g HSG, and were protected from glucose
intolerance and islet dysfunction. The protection was diminished in Reg3g haploinsufficient female
offspring. In contrast, male offspring born to obese dams had unchanged islet Reg3g and HSG, and
exhibited significantly worse glucose tolerance and a decrease in ex-vivo insulin secretion. Finally,
treatment with recombinant Reg3g and a heparan sulfate analogue improved glucose tolerance in
male offspring of obese mice. Our preliminary data also implicated ERK1/2 signaling as the
downstream pathway activated by Reg3g and HSG that maintains β cell insulin secretion. Given
these findings, we hypothesize that the upregulation of Reg3g induces HSG formation and protects
offspring of obese mice from β cell dysfunction by maintaining ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also
hypothesize that Reg3g preserves islet insulin secretion in offspring of obese mice and in human
islets through HSG polymerization. In this proposal, we will 1) define the role of Reg3g-HSG-ERK1/2
signaling in mediating sex-differences in islet insulin secretion in the offspring of obese mice, and 2)
determine the therapeutic potential of Reg3g-mediated HSG polymerization in rescuing pancreatic
islet dysfunction in offspring of obese mice and in human islets. This research plan will inform novel
and amenable molecular pathways that regulate sex-differences in islet dysfunction in offspring of
obese mothers. This career development award also allows the principal investigator to receive
training in the state-of-the-art concepts of islet biology and laboratory skills necessary to become an
independent physician scientist."
10907646,"Early childhood adversity is associated with significant risk for engaging in problematic substance use across
the lifespan. Adolescents living in low-income neighborhoods are both more likely to experience adverse
childhood events and less likely to have access to evidence-based preventative substance use interventions.
Thus, there is a critical need to identify interventions that can effectively prevent the escalation of substance use
in vulnerable youth and be feasibly disseminated in low-resource, traditionally underserved communities. Delay
discounting has emerged in the literature as a critical etiological marker of substance use risk and a potential
pathway from early life disadvantage to problematic alcohol and drug use. Elevated delay discounting is
characterized by an exaggerated tendency to select rewards that are immediately available. Higher (more
problematic) rates of delay discounting during adolescence are associated with more severe and frequent
substance use and are predictive of steeper escalations in alcohol, marijuana and tobacco use. Working
memory, the capacity to store and manipulate information utilized in decision making, is closely linked to delay
discounting and a plausible neurocognitive mechanism linking early adverse environments to problematic
discounting tendencies and subsequent substance use. Guided by an experimental therapeutics framework,
recent findings from our own research team and others suggests the efficacy of utilizing a computer-based
working memory training program to improve discounting among mid-life adults. Computer-based training
programs may be particularly suitable to implement in low-resource communities for at-risk adolescents.
Specifically, adolescence is a critical period for the development of both working memory and delay discounting,
and interventions targeting working memory during this life stage have evidenced favorable clinical results.
Further, computerized interventions require limited staff and space resources, making them both feasible and
scalable in traditionally underserved communities. Building on promising findings from the investigator team’s
formative research, this application proposes to pilot a computer-based working memory intervention among
adolescents exposed to early life adversity in the low-resource community of Detroit, Michigan. Primary aims
include establishing the preliminary feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of delivering a
computerized working memory intervention in a community setting serving low-income adolescents as well
as conducting a small-scale Stage I randomized control trial to examine the effectiveness of this intervention
in reducing rates of delay discounting. The subsequent impact of this intervention on changes in adolescent
substance use over a three-month follow-up period will also be examined as an exploratory aim. The proposed
research will provide valuable insight into the utility of targeting a specific pathway from early adversity to later
substance use during adolescence and will establish a model for disseminating interventions in low-resource
communities. Results of this study will also set the stage for future large-scale (R01) prevention research."
10907651,"According to NIDCD, 6 to 8 million people in the United States have some form of speech or communication
disorder. Speech perception requires a listener to map variable acoustic signals onto a finite set of phonological
categories known as phonemes, and to integrate those categories over time to form larger linguistic units such
as syllables and words. It remains speculative where these different speech features are encoded and what
cortical computations are needed for their calculation from an acoustic signal. A better understanding of what
neural circuits are involved, how they are organized, and what computations they perform to support speech
comprehension is critical for developing a detailed neurobiological model of speech perception. The major aim
of this proposal is to use a joint framework to study the encoding of acoustic and linguistic features and the
computational underpinnings of natural speech processing, using invasive surface and depth electrodes
implanted in human neurosurgical patients. To study the cortical organization of acoustic features, we will
characterize the encoding and anatomical organization of acoustic features in auditory cortical regions. To study
the cortical organization of linguistic features, we will measure the encoding of phonetic, phonotactic, and
semantic information using multivariate linear regression. To understand the underlying computational
mechanisms, we will train convolutional neural network models to predict the neural responses to speech and
use a novel method to express their computation as a set of linear transforms. By interpreting these models, we
will uncover nonlinear computations used in different auditory areas and relate them to the encoding of acoustic
and linguistic features. These complementary analyses will extend our knowledge of speech processing in the
human auditory cortex and lead to new hypotheses about the mechanisms of various speech and language
disorders. Together, the proposed research will greatly improve the current models of cortical speech processing,
which are of great interest in many disciplines including neurolinguistics, speech pathology, speech prostheses,
and speech technologies."
10905265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The aim of this grant is to elucidate the novel role of endothelial Cu uptake transporter CTR1 as a
“mechanosensor” that promotes Cu-dependent inflammation and cuproptosis involved in
atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial (mito) dysfunction in endothelial cells (ECs)
contributes to atherosclerosis, predominantly occurring in arterial regions exposed to disturbed blood flow (d-
flow), while those in the stable laminar flow (s-flow) regions are protected. The mechanisms by which d-flow and
s-flow regulate atherogenesis are still poorly understood. Copper (Cu), an essential micronutrient, is greatly
increased in human atherosclerotic plaques, while Cu promotes, and Cu chelation inhibits atherosclerosis in
mice via unknown mechanisms. The bioavailability of intracellular Cu is tightly controlled by Cu transport and Cu
chaperone proteins including Cu uptake transporter CTR1 and cytosolic Cu chaperone Atox1 that also functions
as a Cu-dependent transcription factor to upregulate inflammatory gene expression. Recent evidence reveals
that excess Cu induces a new type of programmed cell death, termed “cuproptosis”, characterized by decrease
in lipoylated TCA cycle proteins and Fe-S cluster proteins, resulting in mito dysfunction. However, the roles of
Cu and endothelial CTR1 in d-flow-induced mechano-signaling, inflammation, mito dysfunction and any
involvement of cuproptosis are entirely unknown. Our preliminary data are consistent with the hypothesis that
endothelial CTR1 funcions as a novel disturbed flow “mechanosensor” that orchestrates cytosolic Cu-
mediated Atox1 nuclear translocation via ROS-dependent acetylation leading to inflammation (early
phase) as well as mito Cu accumulation following CTR1 binding to mitoCu transporter, leading to
cuproptosis (late phase), which contributes to atherosclerosis. Aim 1 will establish the role of CTR1 as a
d-flow sensor to drive Cu- and ROS-dependent Atox1 nuclear translocation and inflammation and address
molecular mechanisms in cultured ECs. Aim 2 will determine whether d-flow induces mito dysfunction and
cuproptosis via increasing mitoCu following CTR1 binding to mitoCu transporter SLC25A3 in ECs. Aim 3 will
determine the role of endothelial CTR1 in vascular inflammation, cuproptosis and flow-dependent atherosclerosis
and address underlying mechanisms in vivo. We will use inducible EC-specific Ctr1-/- or -Atox1-/- or -SLC25a3-/-
mice or newly developed CRISPR/Cas9-generated “acetylation dead” Atox1 knock-in mutant mice with high fat
diet or partial carotid ligation to induce atherosclerosis. We will also use compartment-specific redox-sensitive
biosensors; biotin-labeled CysOH trapping probe; scRNAseq and scATACseq; newly developed, highly specific
mito-targeted Cu-depleting nanoparticle (mitoCDN); highly innovative ICP-Mass Spec, X-ray fluorescence
microscopy and mito-targeted Cu fluorescence probes to measure Cu levels in cells or tissues. Our proposal will
provide new insights into endothelial CTR1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of flow- and Cu-
dependent atherosclerosis."

The setting of this training activity within the Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE)
between the University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is unique in its
ethnic diversity and its distant location. Pacific Islanders are extremely underrepresented in the nation’s
biomedical workforce, which limits progress in research and prevention of cancer health disparities. PIPCHE
addresses training Pacific Islander cancer researchers in the context of the vast diversity and geography of the
region. The impact of the two previous cycles is remarkable. Without a cancer center in Guam, young
researchers and students had no opportunity to be involved in cancer research despite the high incidence of
many cancers. During the past 10 years, an infrastructure for research training in Guam and Micronesia has
been built; many UOG faculty members are collaborating in cancer research with UHCC. Since the initiation of
PIPCHE, two previous trainees moved into faculty positions at UOG, two graduates supported in cycle one are
now in faculty positions on the US mainland, and one trainee is now employed at the National Institute of
Minority Health Disparities. To date, ten trainees have entered doctoral programs in different locations. Of the
45 PIPCHE research assistants, at least nine went on graduate and professional degree programs. This
Research Education Core (REC) will continue the successful path with three specific aims: 1) Provide
guidance, support and opportunities to acquire research skills and experience to Pacific Islander students
pursuing a master’s degree with a focus on cancer-related health disparities in the Pacific Island region.
Students will be supported at UOG, or at UHCC in programs not offered at UOG, and mentored in a research
project under the supervision of one or more PIPCHE faculty. An expanded curriculum consisting of an online
course and a journal club will address critical current topics in cancer research. 2) Provide guidance, support
and opportunities to acquire research skills and experience for students interested in cancer health
disparities in the Pacific who are enrolled in a graduate degree program (master’s or doctoral). Students will
participate in biomedical, epidemiologic, psychosocial, and community-based research projects led by UHCC
faculty. 3) Support, guide and develop Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) to become independent investigators in
cancer health disparities with the help of a mentoring committee, an annual manuscript and grant writing
workshop, attendance at scientific meetings, and course releases. Important enhancements are incorporated
into the proposed program: increasing support from four to six UOG master’s students per year due to high
demand; novel online modules related to health disparities in the Pacific; extension of UHCC funding from
doctoral to master’s students; travel scholarships for trainees to attend scientific meetings; an annual intensive
writing workshop at UOG to improve output in published manuscripts and grant applications; implementation of
mentoring committees and funds to provide ESIs with protected time for grant and manuscript writing."

Plex technology and 5). Lipoprotein Sub-Core, which will measure lipid and lipoprotein levels in mouse plasma
and also provide standardized preparations of LDL and modified LDLs (and other needed lipoproteins) for
investigators’ use.
 The Core will be centered and organized in Dr. Witztum's laboratory at UCSD, who will be the overall
director and responsible to see that all of the Sub-Cores fulfill their missions. The Atherosclerosis Morphology
and Liver Morphology Sub-Cores will be housed at UCSD under the Direction of Dr. Witztum with assistance of

throughput selected proteomic type analyses of cytokines, chemokines and related proteins will be performed at
the Salk Institute under the direction of Drs. Ron Evans and Michael Downes. Finally, the Lipid Maps Lipidomic
Core, under the direction of Drs. Oswald Quehenberger and Ed Dennis is also located at UCSD in the same
building as Dr. Witztum’s laboratories. Thus, all sample collection will be centralized in a central laboratory at
UCSD, where they will be logged into an Excel spreadsheet to provide a central organizational pathway for
distribution of samples to proper Sub-Cores and in turn, a central site for data collection of results."

Project 1. Macrophage-specific targeting of LXRs in CVD and NASH
Fatty liver diseases account for rapidly growing morbidity in the United States, where it is estimated that 80 to
100 million individuals have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 6 to 16 million have the more severe
liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is a spectrum of liver conditions strongly coupled
with obesity, insulin resistance, CVD, and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Long term prospective studies indicate that
the presence and severity of NAFLD independently predicts fatal and nonfatal CVD events. The development
of NAFLD and CVD is influenced by combinations of genetic and environmental factors, some of which are
disease-specific and others that affect both disease processes. In this Project, we will investigate the central
hypothesis that impaired function of liver X receptors in Kupffer cells in the liver and macrophages within the
artery wall represent a common underlying mechanism that contributes to both NAFLD and atherosclerosis,
and that this mechanism can be reversed by treatment with desmosterol mimetics. A major limitation in
targeting LXRs for treatment of atherosclerosis is that most synthetic agonists cause marked
hypertriglyceridemia by inducing the expression of SREBP1c in hepatocytes. Our studies of macrophage foam
cells led to the finding that desmosterol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, is the most
abundant endogenous LXR agonist. Unlike conventional agonists that selectively bind to LXRs, desmosterol
also binds to SCAP, thereby inhibiting processing of SREBP1 and SREBP2. Unexpectedly, we recently
discovered that desmosterol and synthetic desmosterol mimetics do not activate LXR or suppress SREBP
target genes in hepatocytes. In vivo studies with a synthetic desmosterol mimetic further demonstrated
activation of LXR target genes in Kupffer cells but not in the liver as a whole. Our findings reveal cell-specific
differences in LXR responses to natural and synthetic ligands in macrophages and hepatocytes that provide a
conceptually new basis for prevention of NASH and atherosclerosis. Three Specific Aims are proposed.
Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that LXR activity in Kupffer cells is required for normal liver
homeostasis and that Kupffer cell-specific deletion of LXRs results in exaggerated NASH and atherosclerosis.
These studies will exploit new mouse models allowing Kupffer cell-specific deletion of LXRs. Specific Aim 2
will use a combination of pharmacologic and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that selective activation
of LXRs in Kupffer cells with synthetic desmosterol mimetics protects mice from NASH and atherosclerosis
independent of effects of these ligands within the artery wall. Specific Aim 3, performed in collaboration with
Project 4, will test the hypothesis that monocyte gene expression signatures and epigenetic landscapes in
peripheral blood monocytes correlate with CVD phenotypes and the extent of fibrosis in human subjects. The
proposed studies may result in qualitative advances in understanding roles of LXRs in regulation of NASH and
atherosclerosis and establish the potential of desmosterol mimetics to be advanced for clinical investigation."

Project 2. Tissue-specific roles of FXR in CVD and NASH
Hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance are commonly associated with both cardiovascular and liver diseases,
however causal relationships between atherosclerosis and NASH are not well established. The farnesoid X
receptor (FXR) is a regulator of systemic sterol and glucose homeostasis, and is known to contribute to the
initiation and progression of both cardiovascular and liver diseases. Loss of hepatic FXR, but not intestinal
FXR, results in elevated circulating and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In contrast, both hepatic and
intestinal FXR enhance hepatic repair and cholesterol excretory activities. Consistent with this, FXR agonists
reliably reduce atherosclerosis and have been reported to show promising effects in liver disease models.
Thus, the goal of Project 2 is to dissect the tissue-specific activities of FXR in the context of integrative
hepatovascular pathophysiology. Specifically, we will explore the notion that FXR drives distinct protective
programs in cardiovascular and liver diseases.
The macrophage is central in the development of atherosclerosis and steatotic hepatitis through the deposition
of vascular fatty lesions, as well as driving or resolving liver damage. As a key regulator of inflammation and
multiple steps in the reverse cholesterol transport and excretion pathways, FXR is an established target for
mitigating the development of foam cells that underlie vascular plaque deposition. Our preliminary findings
indicate that plaque deposition and facets of liver disease are divisible with tissue-specific modulation of FXR
activities.
This project will explore the hypothesis that tissue-specific modulation of FXR will affect the progression of
CVD and NASH. To achieve this goal, proprietary FXR agonists that target either the liver (hepFexD) or gut
(intFexD) will be used in combination with ldlr-/- mice lacking FXR expression in either the liver (hepFXRko) or
the intestine (intFXRko) to dissect the association of fatty liver disease and CVD risk. In Aim 1, the impact of
hepatic FXR on atherosclerosis and liver disease will be explored, including the contribution from FXR-
regulated crosstalk between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells in collaboration with Project 1, and the
role for hepatic FXR in OSE levels or clearance in collaboration with Project 3. In Aim 2, the ability of systemic
signaling from intestinal FXR to affect macrophage cholesterol homeostasis will be determined in collaboration
with Project 1. Finally, the relevance of our pre-clinical findings studies to human disease will be determine by
interrogating curated clinical samples for biomarkers of FXR activity in collaboration with Project 4. The
proposed comprehensive genetic, pharmacologic and comparative biological approach will provide a better
understanding of the physiology and mechanisms by which tissue-specific FXR crosstalk impacts
atherosclerosis and steatohepatitis."

In the past several decades, researchers have made extraordinary progress in our understanding of enteric
nervous system (ENS) development and function. Vital scientific advances have occurred in identifying the
major signaling pathways, transcription control, migratory behavior, enteric neuronal and glial subtypes,
microenvironmental factors, genetics, and neurotransmitter physiology require for normal ENS development.
This exponential growth in scientific contributions to the field of ENS development has greatly enhanced our
understanding of Hirschsprung's disease, the most common congenital enteric neuropathy, and has informed
recent studies in the generation of neuronal stem/progenitor cells for cell-based regenerative medicine
therapies to treat enteric neuropathies.
The first international ENS development meeting occurred in New York in 2006, supported in part by a R13
grant from the NIH. This triennial meeting was subsequently held in London (2009), Hong Kong (2012),
Rotterdam (2015), Boston (2018), and Ferrara (2022). The symposium is truly bench to bedside, bringing
together bench researchers such as molecular and cellular biologists, geneticists, physiologists, and stem cell
investigators and bedside clinicians such as gastroenterologists and surgeons, who all share a common
interest in the development and function of the ENS and improving current management for enteric
neuropathies. All of the ENS development meetings have been quite successful, with a growing number of
attendees from 130 to nearly 200 in recent years from over 20 different countries in 5 continents from around
the world. The 7th International Enteric Nervous System Development Meeting: Connection, Cross-talk and
Collaboration will be held in Philadelphia in March 2024. This will be the first meeting focused on ENS
development held in the U.S. since the COVID-19 pandemic and builds upon the success of prior meetings as
well as the growing significance and relevance of ENS research.
The specific aims of this R13 application are 1) to encourage and inspire the participation of young
investigators, especially groups under-represented in science such as women, minorities, and
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at this 7th International ENS Development Symposium by
offering 20 Travel Awards to offset registration costs and travel expenses as well as 12 Scientific Merit Awards
to highlight and promote accomplished young investigators; and 2) to improve the likelihood of long-term
success for young investigators pursuing academic careers in the field of ENS development and function by
establishing lasting mentored relationships with select faculty and members of the meeting’s International
Organizing Committee. We anticipate that this unique ENS Development meeting will build meaningful
mentorship and collaborations that will enhance the career development of the award recipients."
10907152,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Decades of research has revealed the complexity of cellular signaling networks involved in control of cellular
processes and their exceptional vulnerability as target of dysregulation in many disease states, like cancer.
During the multistep process of tumor initiation and progression, cancer cells acquire unique capabilities termed
the “hallmarks cancer” that include: a) sustained proliferation in the absence of growth-promoting signals, b)
evasion of growth-inhibitory signals, c) activation of invasion and metastasis, d) enabled replicative immortality,
e) induction of angiogenesis, and f) resistance to cell death. Unsurprisingly, aberrant activation or inactivation of
signaling pathway components, which typically integrate extrinsic or intrinsic cues to guide cell division, growth,
and migration, is a defining feature of malignant cells. Decades of research aimed at unraveling the complexity
of cellular signaling networks in the context of cancer has revealed many of the principles of intracellular
communication essential for normal physiology and ushered in the era of targeted therapeutics for cancer
treatment. While small molecular inhibitors that target signal transducers have been clinically efficacious, several
challenges, such as emergence of resistance, tumor cell heterogeneity, and undruggable targets, has limited the
widespread use of these agents in cancer. There are three specific objectives of the FASEB 2024 Cell Signaling
in Cancer: from Mechanisms to Therapy. The first objective is to disseminate and synthesize the most up-to-
date knowledge and newest technologies surrounding mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of cancer cell
signaling pathways. To accomplish this goal, we have planned a series of keynote and plenary speakers from
many of the leading experts in the field, multiple short talks selected from the poster abstracts, poster sessions,
several focused workshops, and informal discussions. Since the challenges in this field are daunting and will
require collaborative efforts to solve them, the second objective is to enhance interactions between academia,
industry, and clinical science. To this end, we have specifically invited speakers representing each of these
topics, and are planning a workshop to discuss career trajectories in different disciplines and navigating
productive collaborations. The third objective is to invest intellectually and financially in the future by supporting
promising young trainees. The goal is to encourage trainees to be successful and stay in the field by providing
intellectual support through discussions with senior scientists, poster sessions, opportunities to speak, awards
that recognize their achievements, and by providing financial support with competitive travel awards. To
specifically increase opportunities for trainees, we have planned a designated Junior Scientist Symposium at the
start of the meeting including a Keynote Presentation from a Junior Investigator, Christina Towers from the Salk
Institute which will give trainees more opportunities to present and discuss their work. The expected outcomes
are increased collaborations, promotion and training of young scientists in the field, identification of new
approaches for identifying and developing therapeutic targets and strategies to combat cancer."
10909026,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the neural circuitry and signaling in health or diseased brain requires new tools that can image
neuronal activity and functional connectivity with superior spatiotemporal precision across various scales from
individual and population of neural cells and microvessel at microscopic scale, neural circuits and cortical
layers/columns, and functional connectivity at mesoscopic (or laminar) scale to neural networks at macroscopic
scale and the nervous system level. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood-
oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has gained a prominent position in neuroscience, and it is the
only neuroimaging modality that can noninvasively map human neuronal activity and dynamic change to the
level of neural computational units, and image functional connectivity and resting-state networks (RSNs)
covering the entire brain. However, the fMRI BOLD signal is determined by a complex interplay between vascular
and metabolic changes, thus, indirectly reflecting neuronal activity. The inference of underlying neuronal activity
on the fMRI BOLD signal can be affected by many unknown factors at microscopic and mesoscopic scales.
Although great efforts have been made to study the correlation between fMRI signals and neuronal activity, the
neurophysiology origin of the BOLD signal and its specificity in mapping neuronal activity and functional
connectivity at cortical lamina level remains elusive.
 To tackle technical challenges and address critical neuroimaging and neuroscience questions, we have
formed an interdisciplinary team with experts in the ultrahigh-field (UHF) fMRI and multi-photon microscopy
imaging research fields from two research institutions to develop the world first MRI fully compatible volumetric
two-photon microscopy imaging (VTPMI) system, which works in one of the highest field animal MRI scanners
at 16.4T Tesla. This novel VTPMI-fMRI multimodal neuroimaging system will make it possible to simultaneously
measure key neurophysiological information related to activities and dynamics of excitatory/inhibitory neurons,
astrocytes, different sized vessels, and ultrahigh-resolution fMRI data, thus enables delineation of cell- and layer-
specific neuronal activity in the living brain. The VTPMI-fMRI technology developed in this project will be
employed to study the neuro-vascular correlation and the specificity of resting-state fMRI BOLD signals for
mapping the layer-specific functional connectivity in anesthetized and awake brains, with particular emphasis on
investigating the roles of inhibitory interneurons. The findings and knowledge from this project will be
transformative and beneficial for understanding and interpreting the human fMRI BOLD signals at the fine scale
of fundamental computational units."
10909027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A diverse biomedical science research workforce is vital to the nation in remaining globally
competitive in scientific discovery and innovation. One of the leaky pipelines in the pathway to
research science careers is the matriculation of students at community college (CC) institutions
and subsequently to baccalaureate programs at four-year institutions. Thus, this proposal aims
to develop a program, which will support this pipeline between the University of Texas Rio
Grande Valley and our partnering CCs, Texas Southmost College (TSC) and South Texas
College (STC). These three institutions are in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) of South Texas,
which bears the disproportionate burden of health disparities such as obesity, diabetes and
mental health issues which are exacerbated by poverty and illiteracy and are underserved in
healthcare. These academic institutions are located in Cameron and Hidalgo County, which is
characterized by a large Hispanic population (89.8 and 92.3%, respectively) and a high poverty
rate (27.7 and 29.5%, respectively of the population living below the federal poverty line).
Although UTRGV has memorandum of understanding with both TSC and STC to facilitate
seamless transfer from the community colleges to, transfer rates to a BS degree program and
specifically to the BS in Biomedical Sciences (BMED) at UTRGV are very low or vary between
years. The impediments in transfer rates may be associated with a lack of awareness of the
BMED degree program and career opportunities in biomedical sciences, specific academic
preparation and adequate advising and support services for transfer and success in a 4-year
college. Currently, we do not have a formal program that supports successful transfer
from TSC or STC to UTRGV and successful completion of a BMED degree. In an effort to
fulfill the long-term goal of the Bridges to Baccalaureate program to increase diversity in the
biomedical research workforce, UTRGV, TSC and STC are committed to increase the number
of underrepresented students who: 1) successfully complete their Associate degrees and
transfer to the UTRGV BMED program, 2) complete the BMED program and 3) apply to
graduate school and/or enter the biomedical science research workforce. Through self-
assessment of areas that need to be improved and strengthened to achieve this goal, the
following specific aims have been proposed: 1) Establish Partnership with community colleges
to Recruit Potential Students who are Interested in Biomedical Sciences, 2) Develop Advanced
Courses for Research Skills Development, 3) Provide Mentored-Research Experience
Supplemented with Activities to Develop Research Competencies and 4) Develop Methods to
Improve Biomedical Science Education."
10909029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Successes in therapies for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have exponentially improved survival in this
population. There is now a critical need for better understanding of how to promote optimal long-term health in
this newly aging population, which is at high risk for development of glucose intolerance and CF-related
diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is clinically and pathophysiologically distinct from type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and it drastically impairs quality of life and survival. Unfortunately, specific factors contributing to CFRD onset
and progression remain unknown. Our preliminary data implicate diet as a precipitating factor in glucose
intolerance in adults with CF. Historical links between body mass index (BMI) and survival in CF have
encouraged the life-long prescription of an unrestricted high-calorie, high-fat diet to meet specific BMI goals.
However, the focus on the quantity of calories and fat has come at the expense of the quality of the diet,
resulting in the widespread consumption of excess dietary added sugars. The impact of the typical high-added
sugar, high-fat CF diet on glucose tolerance has not been rigorously tested. Currently, there is insufficient
research available to enable evidence-based dietary recommendations regarding carbohydrate quality specific
to individuals with CF. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent that excess dietary sugars serve as
a precipitating factor in glucose intolerance in adults with CF and to identify potential underlying mediators.
Based on our preliminary data, we propose that the high-added sugar diets that are typically consumed by
individuals with CF exacerbate a decline in first-phase insulin secretion and insulin resistance by enhancing
visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and other ectopic fat deposition and by promoting an imbalance in systemic
aminothiol redox towards an oxidized state. We will test this hypothesis using a rigorous, double-blind feeding
study. Specifically, we will determine if insulin secretion and sensitivity assessed by a combined hyperglycemic
clamp and glucose-potentiated arginine stimulation test (Aim 1), VAT and other ectopic fat deposition assessed
by magnetic resonance imaging (Aim 2), and systemic aminothiol redox (Aim 3) can be improved over eight
weeks by replacing the typical high-added sugar, high-fat CF diet with a eucaloric low-added sugar, high-fat
diet. We will also assess relationships between the changes in glucose tolerance and changes in VAT and
systemic redox. This study is in line with the recent 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research goal
of using nutrition to reduce the burden of disease in clinical settings. Successful achievement of our aims,
using a rigorous dietary intervention with gold-standard metabolic testing and imaging, will deliver new
pathophysiological insight into the role of diet towards the development of CFRD. Such data will inform
evidence-based design, with mechanistic support, of dietary approaches and other lifestyle or medical
interventions that may have a sustained impact on the health and quality of life of individuals living with CF."
10909030,"ABSTRACT Moderate-to-severe cancer pain is common in patients with advanced cancer and is often effectively treated with prescription opioids. Effective pain management is crucial for optimal quality of life and health outcomes in these patients. However, the emergence of the opioid crisis in the United States has sparked widespread fears about the use of opioid pain medications, given the potential for negative outcomes such as addiction and overdose. Despite being exempted from restrictive opioid policies, patients with cancer experience adverse consequences of efforts to address the opioid crisis, including stigma associated with prescription opioid use (“opioid stigma”). Based on our recently published Opioid Stigma Framework, we anticipate that opioid stigma results in several  proximal (e.g., impaired patient-provider communication, suboptimal health behaviors, emotional distress, maladaptive coping skills) and long-term health consequences (e.g., less effective pain management, reduced health-related quality of life). Emerging evidence indicates that opioid stigma is common, pervasive, and has the potential to seriously impact patient well-being. However, there are no known interventions to mitigate opioid stigma in patients with advanced cancer. Additionally, perspectives from underserved communities at high risk for pain undertreatment – people of color, people in rural areas, and women – are lacking, and understanding these experiences is critical to build a robust, inclusive opioid stigma intervention Thus, the proposed project will develop and test a novel behavioral intervention for opioid stigma in an effort to fill this unmet need. Together with her mentors, Principal Investigator Dr. Bulls will explore opioid stigma experiences and treatment priorities reported by a diverse group of 75 patients with advanced, painful cancer using rigorous concept mapping methodology (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Bulls will design a theory-based intervention to reduce negative proximal impacts of opioid stigma in patients with advanced cancer, soliciting feedback from patients and community-engaged resources prior to piloting (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Bulls will conduct a pilot trial of the intervention with 45 patients with advanced cancer pain to evaluate feasibility and acceptability in preparation for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (Aim 3). This project will facilitate training crucial to Dr. Bulls' career development: advanced skills in participatory and stakeholder-engaged research methods, in-depth training in behavioral intervention development, and expertise in conducting clinical trials. Dr. Bulls has convened a dedicated, multidisciplinary
26 mentorship team with expertise in essential content and methodological areas including palliative oncology,
27 opioid pain management, health-related stigma, concept mapping, behavioral intervention development and
28 testing, and research in underserved groups, among others. This proposal represents a comprehensive training,
29 mentoring, and research plan to support Dr. Bulls' transition into a successful independent investigator. At the
30 end of the award period, Dr. Bulls will contribute substantially to the field as a leader in behavioral approaches to
31 improve opioid stigma in patients with advanced cancer.

10927561,"In kidney transplant recipients (KTR), cytomegalovirus (CMV) increases short- and long-term morbidity,
mortality, and allograft failure, mainly due to limitations in current preventive strategies. ~90% of CMV disease
occurs in the ~20% of recipients who are CMV seronegative (R-) and receive of an organ from a CMV
seropositive donor (D+) [D+R-], and results from immune-suppression-impaired development of protective
CMV-specific immune responses. The strategies for CMV prevention in D+R- KTR are Antiviral Prophylaxis
[AP] (suppressive antiviral drug [valganciclovir [VALGAN] or letermovir [LET] given for 200d), and Preemptive
Therapy [PET] (CMV DNAemia is monitored by sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) for 100d and VALGAN is
given only to those with CMV DNAemia. AP is used by >90% of centers due to a smaller evidence base for
PET (especially with ATG use) and uncertainty about other long-term outcomes with PET vs AP. In CMV D+R-
liver txp, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) showed that PET was feasible (>90% adherence), reduced antiviral
drug days by ~40% (62d vs. 100d), increased protective CMV-specific immunity (multifunctional CD4/CD8 T-
cells, NK cells, and neutralizing antibody [nAb]) and decreased CMV disease by >50% vs. AP. These results
cannot be directly extrapolated to KTR due to important differences between liver and kidney txp, including the
intensity of immunosuppression and different established/approved prophylaxis regimens. As a result, despite
potential advantages, use of PET in D+R- KTR remains minimal. The long-term goals are to reduce the
negative impact of CMV in D+R- SOT by harnessing CMV-specific immunity, to define CMV immune correlates
for future immune-based preventive strategies, and to provide high-quality evidence to change clinical
practice. The central hypothesis is that PET, compared to AP, through permissive viral replication and
associated antigen exposure-mediated immune priming, leads to increased CMV-specific humoral and cellular
immune responses that result in lower CMV disease incidence in high-risk D+R- KTR. The Specific Aims are
1) To compare PET and AP in D+R- KTR for the prevention of Endpoint Committee confirmed CMV disease by
1-year post-txp (primary endpoint) and longer-term outcomes (graft and patient survival, biopsy-proven acute
allograft rejection, and eGFR by end of follow-up (secondary endpoints), and 2) To characterize longitudinal
CMV-specific humoral (nAb) and cellular (T-cell, NK cell) immune responses and their association with
prevention strategy, CMV infection (DNAemia) in the PET arm, and Endpoint Committee confirmed CMV
disease. The Aims will be accomplished with a 5-center trial of 360 adult CMV D+R- KTR who will be
randomized 1:1 to a standardized PET protocol for 100d (described above) or to AP (200d of VALGAN or
letermovir). CMV-specific immunity assessments at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months will include nAb, NK cells, and
multifunctional T-cells with multi-color flow cytometry that incorporates a novel computational approach
(COMbinatorial Polyfunctionality analysis of Antigen-Specific T cell Subsets [COMPASS])."
10929304,"ABSTRACT
Sustained retention in HIV care is critical for viral suppression, but people living with HIV (PLWH) frequently
transition in and out of care over time, putting them at high risk for ongoing viremia and drug resistance. Even
when PLWH return to care after loss to follow-up (LTFU), rates of becoming LTFU again in the future are very
high. Our preliminary data from Zambia suggests that 30% become LTFU again within 6 months, and that 50%
of those who are currently LTFU have previously cycled in and out of care. The time of reengagement in care is
thus a critical period to intervene in this high-risk population, and strategies to improve post-return care delivery
are urgently needed to break ongoing cycles of disengagement. After returning to care, PLWH often report being
scolded, health care workers (HCW) delay ART re-initiation due to adherence concerns and do not consistently
monitor virologic response, and PLWH likely still experience the life situations (e.g., competing obligations, travel
away from home, or psychosocial factors) that led to their initial LTFU. Strategies to 1) target HCW behaviors
(i.e., welcoming returning patients, prompt ART re-initiation) using implementation strategies such as practice
facilitation and audit and feedback and 2) offer PLWH support services tailored to their initial reasons for LTFU
(e.g., extended refills, transfer coordination, peer-navigation) may be promising. To be successful, however, we
need to understand how to effectively implement these approaches into existing care, including 1) how to engage
HCWs in attitude- and behavior-change strategies, 2) what support services to prioritize for different barriers,
and 3) how to integrate activities into existing workflows. This R34 proposal will build the necessary foundation
for implementing a multicomponent reengagement strategy to support sustained reengagement after returning
to HIV care. In Aim 1a, we assess patient and HCW needs and preferences for reengagement strategies with
patient semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus group discussions with HCWs and clinic leadership (4 FGDs,
n=8-10 each). In Aim 1b, we conduct discrete choice experiments (200 PLWH, 100 HCWs) to quantify relative
preferences for the contents and attributes for our reengagement strategy. In Aim 2, we undertake a human-
centered design process that engages key stakeholders (PLWH, HCWs, clinic leadership, Ministry of Health) in
co-developing the content and features of a multicomponent reengagement strategy focused on 1) improving
the patient reengagement experience, 2) optimizing ART re-initiation and viral load monitoring post-return, and
3) providing tailored services that target individuals’ specific reasons for LTFU. In Aim 3, we will pilot the
developed strategy at one urban and one rural clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. We will use a mixed-methods approach
to assess the implementation (e.g., acceptability, appropriateness), service delivery (e.g., time to ART re-
initiation, viral load monitoring), and clinical outcomes (e.g., retention and viral suppression at 6 months post-
return). Results from this proposal will directly inform a future R01 to formally test this health-system intervention
for patients reengaging in HIV care in a Type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized trial."

This is our revised competitive renewal application (R01 NS048216-16 A1, 02-04-2005 to 01-28-2021), “Na/H
exchanger in microglial metabolism and function”. In this renewal proposal, we will study Na+/H+ exchanger
isoform 1 (NHE1) in regulating microglial immunometabolism and cellular function in brain tissue repair.
Microglial phagocytosis is important for debris clearance, remyelination, and synapse remodeling for tissue repair
in neurodegenerative diseases [stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), ADRD, etc.]. Therefore,
modulating microglial phagocytosis functions presents a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.
However, to date, the mechanisms that govern coordinated regulation of microglial energy metabolism and
phagocytosis are not completely understood, filling this knowledge gap is the central scientific premise for our study.
We reported previously that NHE1 protein-mediated H+ efflux (in exchange of Na+ influx) alkalinizes intracellular
pH (pHi) in microglia, which promotes sustained NADPH oxidase (NOX2) activation because the latter is inhibited
by low pHi. We obtained the following new findings: 1). selective deletion of microglial Nhe1 in the Cx3cr1-CreER+/-
;Nhe1f/f (cKO) mice reduced pro-inflammatory microglial responses but increased their restorative transformation
after ischemic stroke; 2). Nhe1 cKO microglia exhibited increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), post-
stroke phagocytosis and spine stripping activities; 3). bulk RNAseq transcriptome analysis showed that the cKO
microglia displayed significantly elevated genes encoding key rate-limiting enzymes for OXPHOS, the hallmark
LXR/RXR-APOE-TREM2 pathway genes for phagocytosis and cholesterol efflux, and genes for phagolysosomal
function; 4). the cKO stroke mice concurrently exhibited enhanced oligodendrogenesis and remyelination with
improved cognitive functions. These findings strongly suggest that microglial NHE1 activity is involved in regulating
microglial immunometabolism and functions in post-stroke brains and emerges as a novel therapeutic target. We
will test our hypothesis by investigating: 1) the impact of selective deletion of microglial Nhe1 in cKO mice on
phagocytosis transcriptomic and functional changes in post-stroke brains; 2) how Nhe1 cKO microglia enhance
phagocytosis and cholesterol efflux for remyelination in post-stroke brains; 3) how Nhe1 cKO microglia boost
mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS to support cellular functions in post-stroke brains.
Impact, completion of this study will improve our understanding on coordinated regulation of immunometabolism
and cellular functions in microglia; and will shed light on NHE1 protein as a therapeutic target for promoting
restorative microglial metabolism and functions for brain tissue repair in neurodegenerative diseases."
10939530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most biological tissues are not simply static materials but active living composites. They are composed of living
cells dispersed in nonliving polymers known as extracellular matrix. Decades of research in biomaterials have
demonstrated a multitude of ways in which polymeric materials can influence cells, and cells can modify
polymeric materials. Thus, recent advances in biomaterials design have shifted from pure elastic to viscoelastic
polymeric biomaterials featuring time-dependent mechanical properties. However, existing biomaterial design
largely relies on flexible linear polymers; such a simple molecular architecture intrinsically limits using linear
polymers to create biomaterials with nonlinear elasticity and relaxation dynamics matching the complexity and
variations in tissue-specific mechanics for dissecting intricate cell-matrix interactions. Moreover, there remains
a grand challenge in assembling cells and soft, viscoelastic biomaterials to create tightly organized structures
matching that of three-dimensional (3D) tissues for probing and exploiting cell-cell interactions. Trained as a
theoretical polymer physicist but later switched to experimental soft (bio)materials and bioengineering, I have
identified compelling opportunities for me to uniquely help address these challenges. Leveraging our expertise
in polymer physics, polymer chemistry, and bioengineering, I will develop platform technologies for constructing
voxelated 3D tissues with molecular architecture encoded modular biomaterials to understand and control stem
cell function. This is based on two research areas that I have been pioneering: (1) bottlebrush polymers and
networks and (2) voxelated bioprinting. In Thrust 1, I will develop modular bottlebrush gels to understand and
control cell-matrix interactions. This thrust is built on my lab's recent breakthrough in discovering a new way to
control the relaxation time without altering the shape of viscoelastic spectra of polymer networks. Leveraging my
expertise in theoretical polymer physics and soft matter, and based on how cells interact with matrix, I will
introduce two new sets of parameters to provide a more complete description of matrix strain-stiffening and
viscoelasticity. Further, I will develop general strategies for independently encoding stiffness, strain-stiffening,
relaxation time, and the shape of relaxation profile into the molecular architecture of bottlebrush gels. Using
these modular bottlebrush gels, I will dissect the impact of each parameter on the behavior of stem cells. Recently,
my lab proposed and showed the concept of voxelated bioprinting, a technology that enables precise
manipulation and assembly of highly viscoelastic spheric bio-ink droplets in 3D space. In Thrust 2, I will advance
our voxelated bioprinting technology to print multiple material voxels in which are encapsulated different types
of cells. I hypothesize that pre-defining the specific location and cell-cell interactions of different cell types
enables highly functional 3D tissues. Leveraging voxelated bioprinting and modular bottlebrush bio-inks, I will
test this hypothesis in the context of engineering a 3D stem cell niche."

Low-income pregnant and postpartum patients (PPP), especially persons of color, experience significant
inequities in quality of care and health outcomes across the perinatal period; this is driven, in part, by lack of
access to care, inadequate coordination and integration of primary care and maternity care, and failure to
address unmet social needs. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) could play a central role in addressing
these maternal health challenges, as the unique FQHC model includes providing access to culturally
competent care for underserved patients; integrating and coordinating primary and maternity care; and linking
patients to social services. While use of FQHCs versus other outpatient settings for primary care has been
associated with improved care quality, the impact of FQHC use for pregnancy care is unknown. Moreover, one
key factor affecting the ability of FQHCs to improve perinatal outcomes may include whether the FQHC directly
provides maternity services, with our preliminary data finding that 1 in 3 US FQHCs do not directly provide
prenatal care. Yet, there is no known literature on how offering maternity services at FQHCs may impact
pregnancy outcomes, despite important policy opportunities to expand services at FQHCs. Our long-term goal
is to identify effective health system reform strategies that improve outcomes and equity for low-income PPP.
As an immediate objective, this R01 will use a quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach to study if and
how FQHCs may improve access, quality, and equity of care for PPP, using national data on the universe of
Medicaid-covered births. The specific aims are to (1) Characterize Medicaid-enrolled PPP who receive care at
FQHCs vs non-FQHC practices (1-A) and compare quality of care-sensitive measures for these groups across
the prenatal (e.g., timely prenatal care), delivery (e.g., SMM, preterm birth), and postpartum (e.g., postpartum
linkage to primary care) periods, using entropy balancing to balance on observables (1-B); (2) Among PPP
who receive care at FQHCs, evaluate how expanding FQHC services to include maternity care impacts quality
of care-sensitive measures using a difference-in-differences study to compare measures for Medicaid-enrolled
PPP at FQHCs that implement maternity care vs FQHCs with continuous maternity care vs FQHCs with
continuous referral-only maternity care; and (3) Assess the role of FQHCs in integrating, coordinating, and
providing access to care for PPP through semi-structured interviews with health systems and FQHC
leadership, including successes and challenges of FQHCs in integrating and coordinating primary care,
maternity care, and social services for PPP, implications for quality and equity, and key policy opportunities
and challenges in expanding maternity care at FQHCs. All Aims will examine differential impacts by
racial/ethnic identity. Collectively, these aims will fill critical evidence gaps to help policymakers, Medicaid
providers, and managed care plans understand how FQHCs may shape maternal health outcomes and equity
at scale, which in turn can inform policy, delivery system design, workforce initiatives, and plan contracting."
10938815,"ABSTRACT
All eukaryotic cells face the critical problem of regulating the subcellular distribution of lipids. The
lipid composition of organelle membranes is distinct, with each membrane containing a specific
subset of lipids that defines organelle identity and regulates organelle function. These membrane
lipids are also critical for intracellular signaling pathways and for proper control of lipid metabolism.
Not surprisingly, defects in the subcellular distribution or metabolism of these macromolecules
underlie many devastating human diseases. We recently identified and unified a novel family of
proteins: the bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs). BLTPs are very large, rod-shaped proteins
with uninterrupted inner hydrophobic channels that serve as lipid superhighways between
apposing membranes at organelle contact sites. Although mutations in BLTPs are associated with
human disease, BLTPs are not required for single cell viability, a fact that has limited efforts to
understand how disruption of BLTP function contributes to disease. Our goal in this proposal is to
use an animal context to tackle this gap and, in doing so, uncover the biological significance of
BLTPs—and bulk lipid transport—to physiology and disease. We identified a Drosophila model
system where disruption of a single BLTP, BLTP2, results in dramatic physiological and cellular
phenotypes, leaving us uniquely poised to systematically dissect the molecular and cellular
functions of this protein and understand how BLTP dysfunction leads to disease. We will pursue
the following two specific aims: 1) Define the essential molecular properties of BLTP2. 2) How is
BLTP2 function at membrane contact sites regulated? Our long-term goal is to understand BLTP

studies to reveal essential insights into the role of BLTPs in human disease which, in turn, we
hope will lead to novel therapies to treat disorders caused by BLTP dysfunction."
10924582,"ABSTRACT
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating health problem that affects 4.7% of adults in the
US and has a total economic cost of $232.2 billion, annually. Effective evidence-based treatments exist but are
underutilized. Substantial barriers to receiving proven cognitive-behavioral treatments include cost, time,
difficulty finding qualified clinicians, and perceived stigma. Thus, it is critical to develop novel therapeutics that
overcome these obstacles and increase widespread accessibility to effective treatment for PTSD. To this end,
this Fast Track project aims to develop OTX-601, a mobile app, digital therapeutic to treat PTSD. During Phase
I, we will develop a usable app, determine the optimal dose, and determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
usability of OTX-601. We will also conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the
preliminary efficacy of OTX-601 in treating PTSD. During Phase II, we will conduct an RCT to determine the
effectiveness of OTX-601 in treating PTSD. Positive results will be the critical initial step for facilitating the
widespread implementation and commercialization of the digital therapeutic to enhance access to highly
personalized PTSD intervention."
10928697,"Metabolic reprogramming occurs during tumorigenesis and holds promise for cancer therapy. However, the
underlying mechanisms that control these metabolic alterations and their contribution to tumor maintenance
are generally lacking. Mutations in NRF2 and its negative regulator KEAP1 are found in 15-34% of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lead to constitutive NRF2 activity. Many NRF2-regulated processes center on
the production and utilization of the antioxidant glutathione, which is synthesized from the amino acids
cysteine, glycine and glutamate. In our previous work, we found that glutathione synthesis was critical for the
pro-proliferative effects of NRF2 during tumor initiation. Furthermore, we found that NRF2 promotes metabolic
rewiring to increase glycine availability to support glutathione synthesis. To define how constitutive NRF2
activity induces metabolic reprogramming to support GSH synthesis, we generated genetically engineered,
conditional knock-in mouse models of the cancer mutations NRF2D29H and KEAP1R554Q. Our preliminary
analysis of NRF2-regulated metabolism indicates that cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1) limits glutathione
production by NRF2, produces toxic byproducts, and is silenced during tumorigenesis. We have established a
metabolomics platform for the analysis of sulfur-containing metabolites, and a genetically engineered NRF2
and KEAP1 mutant lung cancer mouse models for in vivo studies and are now poised to define the tumor
suppressive role of CDO1 and its metabolites during lung tumorigenesis.
In Aim 1 we will examine the whether CDO1 antagonizes the NRF2-regulated antioxidant response by
depleting cysteine.
In Aim 2 we will examine the selective toxicity of CDO1 expression to cells with NRF2 activity due to toxic
byproduct production.
In Aim 3 we will examine whether CDO1 loss promotes lung tumorigenesis using our genetically engineered
KEAP1 and NRF2 mutant mouse lung tumor models and patient tumor samples.
The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project are to characterize CDO1 as a novel metabolic liability
for tumors with NRF2/KEAP1 mutations in order to define opportunities for therapeutic intervention for patients
with these mutations, which currently lack targeted therapy."
10928704,"Abstract
Oxidative transformation of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochromes P450 gives
rise to endogenous lipid mediators that regulate cellular processes in homeostasis and disease. These lipid
mediators form an evolving and expanding family referred to as eicosanoids. This application comprises two
projects that both are concerned with novel transformations in eicosanoid biochemistry and present important
ramifications for the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit their biosynthesis. The
first project is centered around the 5-LOX/COX-2 cross-over biosynthetic pathway while the second project is
concerned with novel metabolic transformations of eicosanoids, and what these mean for the use of plasma
and urinary prostanoid metabolites as markers of drug response. Today, novel members of the eicosanoid
family are often discovered in lipidomics approaches by their similarity with known eicosanoids. We have
employed an approach based on understanding the structure-function of the biosynthetic pathways, enzymes,
and substrates that allowed us to make predictions of novel transformations. This has led to the discovery of
the 5-LOX/COX-2 cross-over biosynthetic pathway forming hemiketal eicosanoids (HKE2 and HKD2) and 5-
hydroxy-prostaglandins, the identification of 15R-prostaglandins formed by aspirin-acetylated COX-2, and the
identification of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidative pathway underlying the metabolism of PGD2 to 11-dehydro-
thromboxanes. Underscoring the relevance of our approach is the fact that the novel eicosanoids we have
shown to be formed in vitro and in vivo have not been identified in lipidomics analyses, likely due to their
unusual properties that make them difficult to detect in standard analyses. We have designed analytical
procedures that allow to detect and quantify the novel eicosanoids in vitro and in vivo. We plan to continue the
identification of novel eicosanoids and to establish their cellular targets and biological role in homeostasis and
in models of inflammatory disease. Our ongoing investigation into the biological effects of the cross-over
eicosanoids has identified the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) VEGFR2 as a target for the pro-angiogenic
activity of HKE2, as well as other RTK and an unknown target that mediates inhibition of platelet activation that
are to be further analyzed. For the 5-hydroxy-prostaglandins we plan to employ screening approaches as well
as targeted testing of prostanoid receptors in order to identify their cellular targets and determine biological
effects. We aim to identify compounds that can be used to manipulate biosynthesis of 5-LOX/COX-2 cross-
over eicosanoids independent from the formation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. We will continue to
characterize novel metabolic pathways of prostanoids and establish the relevance of these pathways in vivo.
Identification and characterization of novel eicosanoids, their biological effects, and novel prostanoid metabolic
pathways will result in a refined understanding of the pathophysiologic conditions for which NSAIDs may be
used and effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on prostanoid biosynthesis in vivo."
10928705,"Critically ill patients are at heightened risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) that worsen outcomes. Critical care
pharmacists (CCPs) prevent ADEs, improve patient-centered outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs through
performing medication interventions. However, CCPs are an inequitably distributed and non-optimized
healthcare resource due to lack of health information technology (IT)-based predictive tools that can identify
CCP-driven medication interventions that prevent ADEs. To identify these preventative medication
interventions, delineating the medication outcome causal pathway among patient features, medication
interventions, ADEs, and patient-centered outcomes is required. Here, novel causal inference methodologies
incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will be applied for the first time to medication
safety questions in the ICU. The strategy will focus on developing a novel scoring tool designed for prediction,
the medication regimen complexity-intensive care unit (MRC-ICU) Scoring Tool, to predict intervenable ADEs
in this causal pathway that are predictable by patient features, preventable by CCPs, and otherwise associated
with poor outcomes. The central hypothesis of this AHRQ Health Services Research Project (R01), based on
preliminary data, is that an AI-informed dashboard visualizing the medication outcome causal pathway can
optimize CCP care to improve patient-centered outcomes. The objective of this work is to apply AI and ML
methodology to multi-center data to create prediction tools for integration into visualization dashboards that
answer vital questions including (1) what is the best metric for predicting ICU intervenable events and CCP
workload?; (2) what causal factors of intervenable events can be prevented by CCPs?; (3) how can CCPs
efficiently use AI-based predictions at the bedside? The long-term goal of the proposed work is to establish
validated prediction models that can be embedded into dashboards in the electronic health record (EHR) to
help guide CCP delivered care. The rationale for this work is that it will establish the MRC-ICU Scoring Tool as
a means of predicting medication safety events and CCP interventions. The central hypothesis will be tested
using large, multi-center datasets of ICU patients via these specific aims: (1) Create robust prediction models
of intervenable events to guide CCP medication interventions; (2) Explore causal relationships among
intervenable events, CCP interventions, and outcomes; (3) Design an EHR-integrated platform (ICView) to
visualize predictions to guide CCP care. Applying user centered design methods to create a health IT product
will result in a visualization dashboard (ICView) that houses MRC-ICU based, AI-informed prediction models
for CCP interventions that can improve patient outcomes. This innovative approach applies state-of-the-art ML
methodology to causal outcome predictions using the novel MRC-ICU Scoring Tool. The proposed work is
significant because any advances in the understanding of how CCPs improve outcomes would have a
profound public health impact due to their established role on the interprofessional healthcare team."
10893013,"Computations performed by single neurons result from integration of a large myriad of synaptic inputs 
distributed throughout complex dendritic topology. Synaptic inputs vary in substantial ways; sensory-driven 
activity patterns, probability of activation, synapse location within the dendritic topology, local dendritic 
organization, and ultrastructural characteristics are all thought to be critical for determining how synaptic 
inputs influence the spiking output of a neuron. Populations of synaptic inputs, ultimately, determine the 
coding capacity and computations single neurons can perform. Despite this fact, studies largely overlook the 
synaptic input population within a single neuron, instead focusing on the activity of cellular populations, using 
biophysical models or constructing models that create hypothetical weights or synapses (e.g. deep-neural

vivo and what are the fundamental principles of synaptic organization which describe neural computation. 
To address this issue, we present a tightly integrated experiment-theory approach. We propose to (1) 
measure the sensory-driven activity patterns of large populations of dendritic spines on layer 2/3 visual 
cortical neurons in ferret visual cortex in vivo, and (2) use a statistical physics approach to characterize the 
structure and computing of synaptic populations in multiple contexts. Thus, this project will provide
fundamental knowledge about the synaptic architecture of neurons in the brain. The"

Millions of adults in the U.S. with overweight or obesity would like to improve their health and quality of life via
weight loss, yet utilization of evidence-based weight loss interventions is low. Instead, adults commonly
attempt self-guided weight loss, which has poor efficacy. When adults do use evidence-based interventions
(which include behavioral, dietary, commercial, surgical, and pharmacological options), long-term engagement
is suboptimal, as some individuals select interventions that are poorly matched to their needs. The proposed
project is designed to test the use of patient navigators to increase uptake of and persistence with evidence-
based weight loss interventions. Navigators have been successfully used in other areas of healthcare to
facilitate engagement with various treatment and prevention services. However, no data are available on the
feasibility, acceptability, or efficacy of a weight loss navigator program in adults. In the proposed study, the
weight loss navigator will assess treatment barriers and preferences, provide education about evidence-based
options, support decision making, and address ambivalence about change. The navigator will not directly
provide weight loss intervention; rather, the navigator’s role will be to assist participants in utilizing existing
evidence-based interventions for weight loss from other sources. Navigators will maintain long-term
relationships with participants to monitor adherence and acceptability of the selected intervention and, as
needed, revisit other intervention options. Participants (N = 68 adults with a BMI >27 kg/m2 who are interested
in weight loss) will be randomly assigned for a 12-month period to either enhanced care or the navigator
condition. Enhanced care and navigator counseling will be delivered remotely. Participants in enhanced care
will receive education about weight loss options, dietary intake, and physical activity through workshops and
standardized text messages. In the navigator condition, participants will attend individual sessions and receive
personalized text messages. Assessments will be conducted at months 0, 6, and 12, with the primary outcome,
weight loss, being assessed remotely with wireless scales. The proposed research project is highly responsive
to NIDDK’s new “Small R01” funding opportunity, which supports pilot clinical trials that acquire preliminary
data regarding the effects of an intervention. Specifically, this project will 1) demonstrate the feasibility and
acceptability of various aspects of the project, 2) calculate effect sizes for weight loss and utilization of
evidence-based interventions, and 3) collect qualitative feedback from navigators and participants to inform
improvements in the navigator program for future research. This innovative project will provide much needed
data about the promise of navigators in meeting the needs of adults with overweight and obesity. It is expected
that if benchmarks for this study are met, funding will be sought for a fully powered clinical trial that examines
efficacy, cost, mediators, and moderators. This line of research has the potential for a large impact on clinical
practice and public health by enhancing the utilization of evidence-based weight loss interventions."
10906903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Technology and digital media (TDM) use has been associated with poorer developmental and health outcomes
in young children. Given the high rate of TDM use, which on average exceeds recommendations, among
preschool age children, it is important to examine TDM use effects on development and health outcomes
during this critical early stage of child development. Using a multidisciplinary approach (clinical psychology,
developmental psychology, electrical engineering, and pediatrics), one of the main goals of the proposed larger
P01 application (of which this project is a part of) is to use innovative, objective, and passive measures to
precisely quantify children’s TDM use. The first aim of this specific project will be to focus on examining
associations between preschoolers’ TDM use and executive functioning (EF) as well as testing EF as a
cognitive mechanism linking TDM use with child BMI. The second aim will be to test bidirectional associations
between executive functioning, child BMI, and TDM use. Finally, the third aim will test the novel moderating
influences of general parenting (warmth/sensitivity, intrusiveness), parent scaffolding in two contexts (non-TDM
and TDM), and TDM content, which are candidates for disrupting the cascade from children’s TDM use to their
EF and BMI. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to use a comprehensive and objective assessment
tool to measure TDM use, its association with EF, and the mediating role of EF on the TDM-BMI association in
preschool children using a longitudinal design over a 12-month timeframe. Also, to our knowledge, this is one
of the only studies to consider bidirectional associations – specifically that TDM use is not only related to
children’s outcome, but also that children’s EF and BMI may influence their subsequent TDM use. As part of
our focus on TDM use, educational content will be assessed advancing developmental research beyond a
common focus on the amount of TDM use. Using multiple direct observational measures of EF in a controlled
setting, this project will also inform the development of child cognition as well as obesity. Finally, adapted from
existing tasks and coding procedures, a novel lab-based parent/child TDM task will be employed to examine
parental scaffolding behaviors, known to improve child EF, and how these scaffolding behaviors may moderate
links between TDM use and children’s EF. Advancing our understanding of the role of TDM use on the areas of
cognition and health using innovative methods will assist in the development of effective strategies for
improving child outcomes and provide parents and health service providers actionable information informing
children’s TDM use guidelines."
10906908,"Project Summary/Abstract: Administrative Core (A-Core)
This Program, led by an overall Program Director, is comprised of three Projects and three Cores. The proposed
program of research examines the associations of technology and digital media (TDM) with preschool-aged
children’s development and health outcomes. The Administrative Core (A-Core) is the central organizing body
for the Program. Its goal is to successfully coordinate the activities of the Projects and Cores in a way that
facilitates teamwork, cooperation, and, ultimately, synergy in an efficient, cost-effective manner. The A-Core has
5 Specific Aims that were carefully constructed with this goal in mind. Specific Aim 1 begins this process by
establishing a management plan for the overall Program. The plan consists of an Executive Leadership Team
comprised of one Lead from each Project or Core, a program-wide communication and training plan, an external
scientific advisory board, and a data safety and monitoring board. Specific Aim 2 will create a secure, centralized
management system to house key documents and promote an atmosphere of transparency by providing ready
access to key study documents. Specific Aim 3 will ensure Program activities are consistent with existing policies
and procedures of both the Children’s Nutrition Research Center and the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor
College of Medicine. Although Projects 1 and 3 will independently recruit participants for their respective
Projects, Specific Aim 4 will help ensure consistency by coordinating and monitoring overall recruitment. And
finally, Specific Aim 5 will develop risk mitigation plans that address risks to both participants and faculty/staff.
By establishing a framework for promoting synergy among both the team and the Projects and Cores, a feedback
loop will be created whereby team synergy and Project/Core synergy interact to promote overall Program
synergy, thereby leading to greater Program impact. This approach will also create the framework for a
sustainable system that will enable continuation of this research. Ultimately, the impact of this work is that it will
contribute to more precise TDM guidelines. The proposed research is consistent with NICHD’s overall mission
as well as the overall intent of RFA–HD-22-009."
10906910,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Previous studies of children’s TDM use and sleep have frequently relied on parent-report of these behaviors.
Parent reporting of children’s TDM use is either very brief and inaccurate (reporting typical use with about 3
questions) or very labor intensive, requiring parents to actively report on their child’s TDM use every 15
minutes during the day (TDM diaries). Both can lead to gross under and over-reporting of children’s TV viewing
or mobile device use. Leveraging advances in digital sensors which permit the objective and passive (i.e.,
requiring little to no effort by the parent or child) assessment of TDM use and sleep/activity behaviors, the DA-
Core will support the overall program by ensuring high-quality assessment of children’s TDM and sleep across
Projects 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, Project 1 will use FLASH-TV, and applications that track mobile device use
and wrist worn accelerometer to examine the association of the amount, timing, and type of children’s TDM
use on children’s sleep. Using the same cohort and TDM use assessment as Project 1, Project 2 will examine
the impact of TDM use on children’s executive functioning and weight status, and examine the moderating role
parents can play. Project 3 systematically examines the impact of the timing of children’s mobile device use in
the home environment before bed on their circadian timing, sleep (as measured by wearable devices in the
home), and executive functioning. The DA-Core will support the overall program by ensuring high-quality
objective and passive (i.e., requiring little to no effort by the parent or child) assessment of children’s TDM and
sleep across Projects 1, 2, and 3. The DA-Core will establish a sustainable, multi-disciplinary core to service
the current proposal and future research in the use of digital sensors and wearable devices. Aims and
objectives of the core will include management and maintenance of an inventory of devices (i.e., FLASH-TV
and actigraphs), training staff in assessment procedures, processing of data, conducting quality control
procedures to ensure the quality of the data, integration of data across our various platforms to allow for hour-
to-hour examination of the interaction of TDM use and rest/activity patterns, and storage and maintenance of
the raw, processed, and extracted data on a secure data server that is accessible by all of the cores, projects,
and team members across institutions. The over-arching goal of this application is to launch a sustainable
multi-disciplinary research program to robustly investigate the short- and long-term influence of TDM use on a
diverse sample of preschool aged children’s sleep, circadian rhythms, EF, and weight status. The projects and
cores established with this research program will permit the research team to address the specific aims of each
project, in addition to position us to seek additional funding to continue to follow this cohort of preschoolers
over a longer duration. Future objective assessment of TDM use among these children as they start
elementary school and then move into middle school would greatly enhance our understanding of the impact of
TDM use, whether good or bad, on children’s health and development."

Interactions between the auditory and visual systems are among the most well-established cases of
crossmodal interplay, yet the overwhelming bulk of the sensory physiology literature reflects studies examining
processing confined to a single modality and we understand comparatively little about the circuitry mediating
crossmodal interplay, or under what conditions such circuits are active. Audiovisual interactions exist even in
primary auditory cortex (AC), with latencies too low to be mediated through purely top-down connections. How
does this information influence sound processing? Which connections relay visual information to the auditory
cortex? What are the functional consequences of these early crossmodal interactions, and what general
computational principles account for interactions within this system that could extend our understanding of
crossmodal processing elsewhere in the brain? Our proposal will leverage the strengths of the awake
transgenic mouse model to address the core aspects of these overarching questions. We will combine
translaminar recording in auditory and visual cortices of awake mice with optogenetic manipulation techniques,
quantitative modeling, and behavior. We will determine how visually driven inputs affect responses, dynamics,
and functional connectivity across auditory cortical layers and cell types, identify and functionally characterize
circuitry relaying visual information to auditory cortex, and determine the extent to which behavioral goals
modulate visual influence on auditory cortex and communication from visual to auditory cortex."

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are cancer-causing viruses. More than 250,000 people die each year from
these cancers, particularly cervical, anal, and head and neck (H&N) cancers. Immune proteins known as
antibodies can protect against these viruses and successful vaccines must induce such antibodies. Current
vaccines can protect us against only two of the 15 HPV types found in cervical and H&N cancers. Better and
more lasting control of HPV infections requires improved knowledge of how these antibodies protect and which
are the “best” antibodies to provide this protection.
Our studies are focused at understanding the exact interactions between HPV capsids and human cells during
an infection. We will use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computer-driven high resolution techniques to
define these interactions at atomic resolution, starting with a better more detailed examination of the capsids. For
decades researchers have relied on the use of various virus like particles (VLPs) that are now known to have
different characteristics, especially in the regions that illicit a host immune response. Part of this characterization
is to map the location and incorporation of the minor structural protein (L2) that has important function during
entry and is conserved across species. Understanding L2 function will reveal a significant target that has
remained uncharacterized until now and may allow researchers to redirect the immune antibody response
towards a more effective and long-lasting protective HPV vaccine. Finally, we are engaged in understanding the
mechanisms that drive entry of HPV. We have begun to understand how the virus changes shape during entry
into human cells. Targeting the conformational changing virus is an important new direction for creating new
drugs to stop infection."

 The vast majority of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have sensory processing atypicalities,
with sensory over-responsivity (SOR) in particular being a common challenge to their quality of life. SOR has
been associated with poor social adaptive, emotional and daily-life skills. Despite its impairing effect on the daily
functioning of ASD children, there are currently few evidence-based treatments for SOR.
 The proposed dissertation research will examine the role of cerebellar function in youth with ASD and
SOR. The cerebellum plays a key role in sensorimotor coordination and has been repeatedly reported to be
structurally and functionally abnormal in ASD individuals. Abnormalities in the ASD cerebellum have also been
linked to multiple ASD symptoms, including general sensory processing atypicalities. However, to our
knowledge, no studies to date have investigated the link between cerebellar function and SOR in ASD. The
proposed study will characterize functional alterations in the ASD cerebellum during sensory exposure, as well
as at rest, and examine how these atypicalities relate to SOR. Participants will consist of 60 ASD and 40 typically
developing (TD) participants, ages 8-17, matched for age and sex. The aims of the study include using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate 1) atypicalities in cerebellar activation in response to mildly
aversive sensory stimulation in ASD compared to TD, 2) the association between cerebellar activation in ASD
and both behavioral and neural markers of SOR, and 3) how task-based (during sensory stimulation) and resting-
state cerebellar functional connectivity differs in ASD compared to TD youth and whether these differences relate
to within-ASD SOR severity. Characterizing the neural basis of SOR is an important step towards formulating
effective interventions to improve the everyday lives of children with ASD who experience SOR and ensuring
that treatment is personalized based on individual differences in ASD-related symptomatology. These aims are
consistent with the NIMH strategic plan goal of delineating functional development of brain regions and circuitry
to characterize developmental trajectories of mental illness.
 This R36 Fellowship will provide Melis Cakar, a Neuroscience graduate student at the University of
California, Los Angeles, with financial support and resources to carry out the proposed dissertation research and
advance the field’s knowledge on the cerebellum’s role in ASD. The applicant will be supported by mentorship
provided by co-advisors, Drs. Shulamite Green and Mirella Dapretto, and the dissertation committee members,
including Dr. Susan Bookheimer (referee), experts in neurodevelopmental, autism and SOR functional
neuroimaging research as well as by ample resources and infrastructure for research and training available to
the candidate at UCLA. The proposed project will prepare the candidate to pursue her career goal of becoming
an independent academic researcher who will be able to conduct cutting-edge research on typical and atypical
neurodevelopment using state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods."

Background: Effective HIV treatment during pregnancy is critically important, both for the health of women living
with HIV (WLHIV) and for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. There are knowledge gaps though, that limit our
ability to deploy new effective antiretroviral therapy agents in this special population. The proposed mentored K23
application is an investigation led by Dr. Ahizechukwu Eke on the effects of pregnancy on the pharmacology of new
HIV drugs, including effects on adherence measures, and on these drugs’ safety in pregnant women.
Candidate: Dr. Ahizechukwu Eke is a Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Pharmacology-trained Physician-Scientist
who has spent the past 4 years conducting research on the clinical pharmacology of drugs in pregnant women. He
helped establish a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV) at Johns Hopkins, developed strong scientific
collaborations with pharmacometricians and scientists through the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS
Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network, and authored 65 PubMed-cited publications related to his research.
Research: In Aim 1, among pregnant WLHIV taking tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Dr Eke will characterize the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tenofovir (TFV) and its active form (intracellular tenofovir diphosphate – TFV-DP), and
establish PK adherence benchmarks in pregnancy using PK modeling. Aim 2 examines pregnancy-specific safety of
TAF by exploring its association with development of metabolic syndrome in pregnant WLHIV, and Aim 3 uses
physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling to predict maternal and fetal bictegravir and doravirine concentrations,
confirming results in pregnant WLHIV enrolling in a prospective multi-center PK cohort study (IMPAACT 2026).
Career Development Plan: Dr. Eke’s long term goal is to become an independent physician-scientist focused on
HIV therapeutics in pregnant women. His short term goals and the focus of this K23 application, are to fill the gaps in
his research skillset that he and his mentoring team have identified by focusing on these objectives:1) To grow his
skills in advanced PK modeling, including models that incorporate adherence, and pharmacometrics; 2) to gain skills
in safety assessments in pregnancy via data analysis and focused coursework on longitudinal data analysis and
pharmaco-epidemiology study design, and; 3) to understand how PBPK models are developed and can be used to
facilitate drug and dose selection for pregnant women. Dr Eke plans to achieve these objectives by working with
mentors with expertise directly relevant to his career goals: Dr Craig Hendrix and Kelly Dooley (Clinical Pharmacology
and HIV); Dr Jeanne Sheffield (Perinatal Epidemiology, Maternal Fetal Medicine, and HIV); and Dr Joga Gobburu
(Pharmacometrics, PBPK modeling).
Environment: The institutional environments at both Johns Hopkins (Hendrix, Dooley and Sheffield) and the
Pharmacometrics Division at the University of Maryland (Gobburu) are ideal for training and research in the
pharmacology of drugs in pregnancy. The long-standing collaboration between these institutions and the strong
collaboration with members of IMPAACT will provide Dr. Eke with strong mentorship to advance his research career."

The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Coordination Center will extend its outreach efforts to strengthen
the HPRC’s collaborations with scientific, clinical, and other stakeholder communities, and to foster the
development of a new ecosystem of analysis tools that involves broad community engagement via training and
education. We will do this by synergizing with adopter programs to facilitate collaborative science. We will form
a Cross-Consortia Working Group which will comprise members of sister consortia and meet regularly to promote
adoption of the pangenome by enhancing communications across the programs and by coordinating
collaborative projects, analysis efforts, and development of tools for using the new reference. We will coordinate
and host cross-consortia meetings and jamborees focused on incorporating the pangenome reference into
pipelines of various consortia labs and clinical labs to see if molecular diagnoses change, new variation is found,
haplotypes are better defined, and benchmarks are better defined. We will also develop a framework for
international partnerships, collaborations, and coordinating activities that respect non-western modes of data
ownership and ensures bi-directional knowledge exchange. We will identify, recruit, and facilitate future
international partnerships and the democratization of the pangenome reference by developing and supporting
the Human Pangenome Project, and creating a framework and infrastructure that will extend well beyond the
next phase of the HPRC."

The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) direct key signaling processes in obesity and at least 70 other diseases.
However, focus on this signaling node alone has not achieved the promise of predictable angiogenic control. Current models
are incomplete as other growth factors, besides VEGF, contribute to vascular disease progression, presenting a complexity
that cannot be predictably regulated by targeting one node in this system. Therefore, there is a continuing need to account
for the complexity of additional, multi-component signaling networks, a goal that can be achieved via data-driven,
computational systems biology in close concert with experimental analysis of signaling and functional response.
Toward this goal, we aim to examine a novel paradigm of network regulation called cross-family signaling, in which
members from one growth factor family [e.g., platelet derived growth factors (PDGFs)] bind to and signal through members
of another family (e.g., VEGFRs). We hypothesize that systematic examination of protein structure and downstream
signaling within the cross-family paradigm via simulation, ligand-engineering, network quantification, and computational
modeling can uncover novel mechanisms to control angiogenesis. We will test this hypothesis through three aims,
sensitively quantifying receptor activation rates and functional responses of cross-family binding (e.g., proliferation,
migration, and barrier function); predicting and measuring the structural properties of cross-family binding via molecular
simulations and directed evolution; and developing validated deterministic models (mass-action kinetic modeling) of cross-
family signaling and applying them to study and control the dynamics of cross-family signaling in human cell systems, in
silico.
We are primed to lead this new research because we are among the first to pursue this important theoretical paradigm, and
we lead this cause to understand cell signaling via structure/function–based computational modeling. This work will
catalyze a shift in perspective and innovation in the areas of cell signaling, systems biology, and predictive design of obesity-
focused therapies."

no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many of them
use closed architectures.
 To address this challenge, we propose to develop the mechanical modules for the implantable pulse
generator (IPG) platform and external charger, which will be based on a flexible, open-architecture, and modular
approach. Such flexibility will allow a significant degree of customization for different clinical indications,
including open-loop and closed-loop IPG operation. The IPG modules will be designed for interfacing with a
large selection of sensing and stimulation leads. Once the IPG and charger modules are developed, they will
be subjected to the benchtop mechanical testing."

decades as traditional vascular risk factors burgeon in these populations. Indeed, hypertension and dyslipidemia
are the top 2 modifiable risk factors for stroke in Africa with population attributable fractions of 90.2% and 35.8%,
respectively, positioning them as prime targets for secondary risk reduction after stroke. Identifying strategies to
reduce vascular risk in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) will meet a global goal of reducing chronic
disease death rates by an additional 2% per year, with only a moderate rise in health expenditures. Ghana is a
LMIC in SSA with a profound lack of human resources for health care coordination for stroke survivors, especially
in the implementation of evidence-based secondary prevention therapies. Fixed-dose combination pills, also
known as “polypills”, containing generic drugs: aspirin, a statin, and blood pressure (BP) lowering medication(s),
may be a viable low-cost avenue to broadly improve medication adherence and consequently reduce further
disability or death on a large scale among stroke survivors in SSA. Therefore, the overall objective of Stroke
Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic agents in Routine Treatment II (SMAART-II) study is to deploy
a hybrid study design to 1) demonstrate the efficacy of a polypill (Polycap ®) containing fixed doses of
antihypertensives, a statin, and antiplatelet therapy taken as two capsules, once daily orally in reducing
composite vascular risk over 24 months vs. usual care among 500 recent stroke patients encountered at 12
hospitals in Ghana; 2) develop an implementation strategy for routine integration and policy adoption of Polypill
for post-stroke cardiovascular risk reduction in an under-resourced system burdened by suboptimal care and
outcomes. SMAART-II is premised on the feasibility and relative safety of the Polycap ® for ischemic stroke
among Ghanaians in a single center trial (SMAART-I) conducted with the support of an R21 grant (NS103752)
from the NIH Global Brain Disorders program. We now seek to test the definitive efficacy and safety of the polypill
to improve meaningful post-stroke global risk factor control in a larger sample, across several sites, across
diverse health care settings, beyond tertiary level care, and over a longer period. In addition to assessing clinical
outcomes, SMAART II will assess implementation outcomes such as adoption, acceptability, cost, pertinent to
uptake of the Polypill strategy in Ghana to inform policy. Regardless of its outcome, findings from SMAART-II
will contribute meaningful information from the African perspective to inform the formulation of guidelines for
global adoption of polypills into routine care for secondary CVD risk prevention by international bodies such as
the World Health Organization."

The Wind River Conference on Prokaryotic Biology (WRC) is held each year over four days in the Rockies.
There are two features of this meeting that are unique, major strengths. First, the WRC is a small meeting that
mingles investigators working on a wide variety of microbial questions. Second, interactions between trainees
and senior investigators at the WRC take place on a level playing field, a situation one has to experience to
appreciate. A critical goal of the WRC is to foster collaborations among and between junior and senior
researchers who may only cross paths at a broad meeting such as the WRC. This enables junior scientists to
build networks and identify opportunities for postdoctoral research and/or careers in government, industry or
science writing, for instance. Our scientific program changes annually based on recent developments in the
field, but each year we aim for strong representation in the areas of bacterial pathogenesis, physiology, and
environmental microbiology. Many of our meeting participants, increasing so in recent years, direct or are
supported by NIH-sponsored research programs studying diverse aspects of microbiology. We draw
researchers from across the nation, with the aim of stimulating new ideas for collaborations on unexplored
areas of scientific research. The active participation of principal investigators, including the keynote speakers,
ensures the presence of an expert audience for the presentations given by the students and postdoctoral
fellows.

Core 3: Primate Studies
Abstract
The Primate Studies Core facilitates the conduct of late-stage preclinical studies of mitigators of
radiation damage in nonhuman primates (NHP), following the specific priorities of the RadCCORE
consortium and sharing tissue and data with other CMCRs nationwide. Because of the high degree of
genetic and physiologic similarity of nonhuman primates to human beings, this resource is a critical
component of translational assessment of candidate deliverable agents, in an experimental setting
under which relevant doses of whole-body irradiation can be given to healthy subjects. Core
investigators have unique skills in the experimental use and clinical medicine of nonhuman primates,
including irradiation, veterinary medical care and management of myelosuppressed animals,
comparative pathology of primates, pathology of radiation injury, biochemistry, clinical pathology and
endocrinology of primates, and adaptation of molecular biologic techniques to the primate model. Core
services include study planning, regulatory approvals, acquisition and maintenance of specific-
pathogen-free nonhuman primates, exposure of animals to radiation, administration of therapeutic
interventions, and clinical and pathologic assessments of treatment outcomes, including
necropsy/tissue collection and sharing for baseline characterization of radiation responses and
assessment of mitigating interventions. The Core also provides extensive data management services
for primate studies, including data sharing and interaction with the biostatistics core to facilitate analysis
and publication of findings. The main core user for the proposed funding period will be Project 3, FSL-1
as a GI and hematopoietic mitigator, but all Projects will be served, through sharing of tissues, fluids
and data; design and review of plans for future prospective studies."

Vocalization is used in many species for social and emotional communications. Interestingly, mice can emit
two types of vocalizations: ultrasonic vocalizations during social and courtship interactions (USVs) and
audible squeaks in response to stress and pain. While previous studies, including our owns, have
uncovered higher centers regulating vocalization, such as the gating of USV production by neurons in the
periaqueductal gray (PAG), the precise neuronal cell types and the mechanisms for producing the actual
sounds via vocal cord adduction and vocal-breathing coordination remain poorly understood. The circuit
elements that selectively required for eliciting audible squeaks in mice also remain unknown. The objective
of this research proposal is to solve these two fundamental questions of vocal control. In preliminary
studies, we have used activity-dependent method that identified excitatory vocal premotor neurons located
in the retroambiguus nucleus (RAmVOC) as sufficient for driving vocal-cord closure and elicit USVs. RAmVOC
neurons are also absolutely necessary for both USVs and squeaks Here, we will (1) transcriptomically
define the cell types of all laryngeal premotor (pre-MNlary) and as well as all RAmVOC presynaptic (pre-
RAmVOC) neurons; (2) determine the activity and function of preBotCInh – RAmVOC pathways in vocal-
respiratory coupling; and (3) determine the roles of different populations of periaqueductal gray (PAG),
Kölliker-Fuse (KF), nucleus solitary tract (NTS) neurons in driving audible emotional vocalizations. We
expect to not only identify the hitherto unknown circuits that trigger emotional cries but also reveal precise
cells and mechanisms underlying vocal-respiration coordination and lay molecular foundations for future
dissection of other aspects of vocal control (pitch and shape of syllables), for finding potential treatment
targets for dysphonia and other disorders related to motor speech productions, as well as for revealing how
other physiological needs control vocal cord movements in health and diseases."
10941078,"During cell division, the precise positioning of the cell-cleavage plane at the center of a ~ 10-15
um long cell is essential for maintaining genome integrity. Consistently, cytokinesis failures can
lead to aneuploidy, a hallmark of tumorigenesis. This motivates a fundamental question: How
does a dividing cell find its center? It is now well established that an overlapping array of
antiparallel microtubules, known as the spindle midzone, plays a critical role. The midzone acts
as a micron scale ‘mark’ for the cell center to direct the signaling reactions that further precisely
define the site of cell-cleavage. An essential signaling protein that relocates from the
chromosomes to the midzone microtubules in anaphase is the AuroraB kinase, which is part of a
4-protein complex called Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC). AuroraB is maximally
activated proximal to the midzone in anaphase. Its activity is important for the phosphorylation of
key cytokinesis factors that direct the formation of cell cleavage furrow. However, despite an
appreciation for its critical functions in anaphase, our knowledge of how intrinsic biophysical and
microtubule binding properties of CPC contribute to localization and activation at antiparallel
arrays is limited. Additionally, how the CPC is specifically concentrated on a specific subset of
microtubules in the spindle remains confounding. The overarching goal of the work proposed here
is to decipher how CPC is specifically localized to a narrow region of overlap formed by the plus
ends of antiparallel microtubules, and how the kinase activity of AuroraB is maximally activated
at such structures. To achieve this goal, we build on previous research where we reconstituted
antiparallel microtubule bundles, the minimal structural units of the midzone, from the collective
activity of conserved midzone motor and non-motor microtubule associated proteins. We will first
determine the intrinsic dynamics and microtubule binding properties of recombinant full-length
CPC using biophysical methods. We then take a small-scale systems biochemistry to elucidate
how the collective activity of key midzone motors and MAPs regulate the microtubule localization
of CPC. Finally, we will test key findings from our biochemical studies in cells using quantitative
analysis of CPC localization and activity in anaphase cells. In addition to fundamental mechanistic
insights on AuroraB, these studies have the potential to uncover new therapeutic strategies to
modulate its activity. The proposed in vitro reconstitutions, combined with structural and cellular
analysis, promises to provide significant new insights into the broader question of specific subsets
are microtubules are located by dense networks by signaling proteins for spatially confined activity
within the cellular cytoplasm."

Genome stability is necessary for fertility and health. Transposable elements disrupt genome stability by
selfishly replicating within host genomes, producing insertions that disrupt functional sequences and cause
ectopic recombination. Transposable elements are widespread across eukaryotes, and can occupy a
substantial portion of the genome. Organisms defend against transposable element invasion with a complex
system based on small RNA. Essentially, small RNA produced from transposable elements (termed piRNA) is
used as a guide to cleave transposable element transcripts and direct epigenetic silencing. In most organisms,
exemplified by Drosophila, there are separate systems for TE suppression in somatic and germline cells –
somatic suppression is achieved largely by a single canonically transcribed locus. Germline suppression is
achieved by many redundant loci which produce piRNA through non-canonical transcription.
Much of what we know about the function of the piRNA system has been derived from carefully executed
experiments in developmental biology, where typically a single genotype of Drosophila melanogaster is used.
Some of the generalizations from this work are that regions of the genome that produce piRNA are large and
conserved. Furthermore, the primary suppression system is thought to be piRNA targeted heterochromatin or
transcript degradation, despite at least one TE being suppressed by alternative splicing. My lab recently has
made discoveries that bring some of these conclusions into question – for example many germline piRNA
clusters appear to be genotype specific. Even the largest and most prolific piRNA region identified in the
original developmental biology experiments appears to be unimportant for piRNA production in some
genotypes. In addition, the primary locus responsible somatic suppression was thought to be deeply conserved
but we found it to be evolutionarily labile, having duplicated in Drosophila simulans and potentially functionally
diversified. Lastly, alternative splicing of many TEs appears to occur, but we know nothing about how
functionally important this is for TE suppression. This has profound implications for fitness variation in
populations of individuals from Drosophila to humans.
The consequences of transposable element mobilization are dire, yet the system which suppresses them
evolves rapidly and is not well conserved between even closely related species. My lab will work to understand
the forces that generate and maintain variation in the production of piRNA in the defense against transposable
elements, the evolution of piRNA producing regions, and the evolution of alternative mechanisms of
transposable element suppression.
The proposed work represents advances in a number of fields, including population genetics, post-
transcriptional regulation, transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, and small RNA biology. Taken
together, this research will offer a unified picture of the evolution of host defense systems against transposable
elements which can be extended into humans and other economically important systems."
10919767,"There are high rates of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among treatment-
seeking veterans with substance use disorders (SUD). Comorbid PTSD among veterans with SUD contributes
to poor treatment outcomes and is associated with worse overall mental and physical health. While addiction
programs traditionally do not address PTSD, increasing evidence suggests that trauma treatments not only
treat PTSD, but may even improve SUD treatment retention and outcomes among those with comorbidity.
Veterans with SUD are usually treated in SUD specialty clinics, where staff are not trained in trauma, and thus
do not offer PTSD treatment. So, although the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) prioritizes the
administration of effective evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD, only a small percentage of veterans with
SUD receive this treatment. Written exposure therapy (WET) is a brief trauma-focused intervention shown to
effectively treat PTSD. WET has several advantages over traditional therapies; it can be delivered in 5 sessions,
has lower dropout compared to other PTSD treatments, has high patient satisfaction, and can be easily
delivered with minimal therapist training requirements making it cost efficient and therefore an ideal
intervention for administration in a busy outpatient SUD clinic. A previous study suggested written exposure is
feasible and effective in decreasing symptoms of PTSD among women in residential SUD treatment. In a recent
acceptability and feasibility pilot study, SUD treatment-seeking veterans (N=12) with comorbid PTSD were
randomized to WET plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU augmented by a neutral writing condition. Results
showed this writing-based intervention was feasible and acceptable. WET was associated with a greater
decrease in PTSD symptoms at 8-week post-baseline follow-up and a greater decrease in the average number of
days of alcohol and drug use at follow-up compared to controls.
 The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial within a SUD specialty clinic to evaluate whether TAU
plus WET is superior to TAU augmented by neutral topic writing on both PTSD and addiction outcomes for
veterans in SUD treatment. The proposed study will also examine a biological marker of autonomic arousal,
heart rate variability (HRV), in order to determine whether it might be a potential objective measure of
treatment efficacy. Emerging evidence suggests high-frequency HRV may be sensitive to SUD and PTSD
symptom improvement and a possible mechanism underlying the connection between stress and substance
use. [This study will examine the association between HRV and treatment outcomes. We will also examine
whether change in HRV scores over time correlates with treatment outcomes (PTSD symptoms and days of
substance use).]
 The specific aims of the project are to examine whether WET augmentation of TAU: a) improves trauma
symptoms for veterans with SUD and PTSD who are receiving outpatient SUD treatment compared to TAU
with a neutral writing control; and b) improves SUD outcomes for veterans with comorbid PTSD compared to
TAU with a neutral writing control. Veterans seeking SUD treatment who present with co-occurring PTSD will
be randomized to either WET plus TAU or TAU augmented by a neutral topic writing condition. Measures of
trauma symptoms, distress, and mood will be collected at each writing session, with resting HRV and
additional assessments at baseline, at post-treatment (approximately 6-weeks), 8-weeks, and 12-weeks post-
baseline assessment. Main outcomes will be change in trauma symptoms, substance use, and HRV. If results
prove promising, they will support WET as an effective brief, cost efficient, easy to disseminate, adjunct to
current SUD treatment for veterans with comorbid PTSD."

Rural Appalachia is a medically underserved area whose residents experience significant healthcare
disparities. Because of the insular nature of rural Appalachian communities, change from within is
particularly important. Thus, attracting residents from these areas to the biomedical, behavioral, and
clinical research workforce may be essential for reducing the critical health disparities in the region.
However, we cannot assume that increasing science and math-related interest and skills will be sufficient
to attract students from this region to these careers. Nationwide, high school graduates from low-income,
low-minority, rural schools (which describes much of Appalachia) have the lowest college enrollment rate
(44%; National Student Clearinghouse [NCS], 2015), suggesting barriers and supports related to higher
education in general must be addressed in addition to barriers and supports related to science,
technology, engineering, math, and medical science (STEMM) related careers. Our long-range goal in
this effort is to develop efficacious interventions that reduce these contextual barriers and increase
supports for and interest in both post-secondary education in general and STEMM in particular among
Appalachian youth. Our objective is to determine the extent to which such a multifaceted intervention
strategy leads to increased intentions to pursue an undergraduate STEMM degree. Our hypothesis is
that students who experience such interventions will show increases in these important intrapersonal
social-cognitive factors and in their intentions to pursue a postsecondary degree compared to students
not exposed to such interventions. Our specific aims are to 1) Increase science identity, as well as self-
efficacy, outcome expectation beliefs, and interests related to college-going and STEMM; 2) Teach skills
to help students navigate barriers and increase supports for pursuing post-secondary education and
STEMM careers; and 3) Determine the additive effects of multiple program experiences on college-going
and STEMM beliefs. We will use a closely-matched comparison group to compare students who receive
the interventions with those who do not. Achieving these aims will provide concrete tools for schools
across rural Appalachia, and perhaps other rural regions, to use to increase the number of their students
equipped with the skillsets required to join the high-growth biomedical and clinical research industry
workforce."
10941241,"ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a rapid-developing and life-threatening condition and is one of the most common causes of death in
hospitalized patients in the US. Sepsis is generally caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. For well over
half a century, blood culture has been the main diagnostic method, but can only inform us of the presence of
microorganism growth. Although empirical antibiotic treatments are usually started as soon as patients
presenting with signs of severe sepsis, gaps remain in our ability to rapidly identify sepsis-causing pathogens to
guide treatment with higher precision. Studies have shown significant risks to septic patients associated with
delayed results and inappropriate therapy, with each hour of delay in administration of appropriate antibiotics
associated with increased mortality. Although molecular diagnostic technologies are available to improve
identification accuracy, they still rely on a positive blood culture result which may take 12 to 48 h or even longer
if the initial culture is unsuccessful. In this MIRA R35 project, we propose to develop novel nanopore- and click-
chemistry-based approaches for accurate detection of sepsis-causing pathogen independent of blood culture in
about 2 hours to support the early administration of source-directed antibiotics. To fit in the clinical sepsis
treatment procedure, we will employ rapid automatic sample preparation and assay methods. Our methodology
will target proteomic biomarkers, such as outer membrane proteins and virulence factors released into circulation,
as they are less prone to interference of blood components compared to bacterial genomic materials, and are
only secreted by viable microorganisms.
The PI will accomplish the proposed goal by engineering nanopore biosensors meet clinical needs of sepsis
causing pathogen detection and developing multiplex click chemistry amplified nanopore sensing for sepsis
causing microorganism detection and prognosis. The scientific and clinical promises of our research lie in the
innovative biosensing mechanism with unprecedented sensitivity for detecting sepsis causing pathogen protein
biomarkers directly in blood; the user-friendly device prototype readily applicable in clinical settings; and the
discovery of potential prognosis value of virulence factors. In the past years, the PI has established a successful
research trajectory by mentoring a postdoctoral fellow and six PhD students, publishing high-impact research
papers, and securing competitive research grants. We will utilize our group’s diverse expertise on biochemistry,
proteomics, nanotechnology, and microelectronics in conjunction with our collaborators’ expertise on high
specificity high affinity binding ligands and sepsis clinical diagnosis and treatment to ensure the success of
proposed research. The nanopore biosensing platform resulting from this project will also benefit the general in
vitro diagnostics field by offering a sensitive, user-friendly, cost-effective, and robust method for assaying protein
biomarkers in biological samples."
10941246,"Project Summary
Aging is a major risk factor for the development of chronic pain with 50% of adults over the age of 65 suffering
from at least one chronic pain condition. Unfortunately, there is a major knowledge gap regarding the interaction
between age and pain. There is an urgent need for basic research using aged animal models to validate targets
relevant to chronic pain treatment in this specific population.
As humans and animals age, senescent cells accumulate in tissues throughout the body, and if not effectively
cleared by the immune system, can disrupt homeostasis. Certain senescent cells secrete factors that induce
inflammation, known collectively as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and include
cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. Interestingly, several of these SASP factors are known pain-inducing
cytokines released in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) where primary sensory neuron cell bodies reside and drive
hyperexcitability. Senescent cells therefore warrant investigation within the pain circuit in aged mice, and even
in young mice after peripheral nerve injury. Our central hypothesis is that age-and injury-induced senescent
neurons promote DRG hyperexcitability through production of SASP factors, causing persistent pain following
peripheral injury. This hypothesis is founded on our robust preliminary evidence confirming: 1) Induction of
senescent neurons within the DRG after peripheral nerve injury, 2) Increased senescent cell burden in the DRG
of aged compared to young mice with and without injury as indicated by increased expression of senescent
markers, p21 and p16, and 3) Localization of the SASP factor and pain mediator, IL6, to senescent neurons.
Additionally, we have preliminary data demonstrating that treatment with a senolytic (anti-senescence) drug
improves spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced mechanical allodynia while maintaining overall sensory function in
young adult and aged mice. Therefore, a potential mechanism underlying enhanced pain susceptibility following
injury in aged mice may be the combination of age-related and injury-induced senescent cells. The overall goal
of this proposal is to rigorously validate senescent cells as a target for future therapeutic development. We will
pursue validation by genetically, functionally, and phenotypically characterizing deleterious SASP-producing
senescent DRG neurons using cross-disciplinary approaches across multiple laboratories. Our approach will
leverage three clinically-relevant mouse models (SNI, paw incision and orthopaedic trauma) as well as human
post-mortem DRG tissue to strengthen the evidence that our target is likely to be robust in translation. This
research will be the first of its kind to investigate and validate cellular senescence in pre-clinical mouse models
and has the potential to open a new therapeutic avenue, using senolytic agents, to alleviate pain."
10928143,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade have revolutionized cancer therapy, but responses are seen only
in a subset of patients. Though tumor-intrinsic factors such as tumor mutational burden (TMB) or IFNγ “inflamed”
signature partially predict sensitivity to checkpoint blockade, these correlations are limited—most patients with
“inflamed” tumors or high TMB still fail to respond. A critical step for efficacy of T cell-mediated immunotherapies,
including checkpoint blockade, is dendritic cell cross-presentation of tumor antigen (Ag) to CD8+ T cells. Cross-
presentation in vivo requires Batf3-expressing type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), though these DC have additional
functions, including secretion of T cell-recruiting chemokines, driving tumor-reactive T cell (TRT) responses.
Because patients with cDC1-enriched tumors have improved responses to anti-PD1, we developed an in situ
vaccination (ISV) combining FLT3L, radiotherapy (XRT), and TLR agonism to enhance cDC1 cross-priming of
TRT and observed that ISV potentiated anti-tumor effects of PD1 blockade and induced systemic tumor
regressions in treated patients. Additionally, we have shown that adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells into
syngeneic RAG-/- mice clears tumors, while transfer into allogeneic RAG-/- mice fails to control tumor growth,
highlighting that APC cross-priming of CD8+ T cells is required for efficacy of antitumor T cells. Despite the critical
role of cDC1 cross-priming of CD8+ T cells for effective therapy, there is no established method for measuring T
cell cross- or direct-priming in vivo. Consequently, there is a critical need for methods to directly measure CD8+
T cell cross-priming for identifying novel therapeutic targets to enhance cross-priming, and to understand
mechanisms of therapy resistance. We hypothesize that cross- and direct-primed T cells, and ISV-primed vs
untreated T cells, will harbor distinct signatures, mirroring their differential antitumor efficacy. In Aim 1, we will
develop mouse models of cross- and direct-priming using H2Kd knockout, H2Kb-transfected, GFP/OVA-
expressing lymphoma and breast cancers and transfer of Ag-specific T cells into syngeneic and allogeneic
RAG-/- mice. We will sort tumor-reactive T cells and perform bulk RNA-seq and spectral flow cytometry to identify
a cross-primed CD8+ T cell signature. In Aim 2, we will use bulk RNA-seq and spectral flow cytometry to
characterize the T cell response to ISV and checkpoint blockade across tumors (lymphoma, breast cancer),
model antigens (GFP, OVA, luciferase), and endogenous tumor antigens. The outcome of this study will be
elucidation of a cross-primed CD8+ T cell phenotype and a novel immune monitoring technique that allows
targeted design of novel immunotherapies by targeting novel checkpoints or costimulators to increase cross-
priming of tumor-reactive T cells."

NH CREATES the Future: the NH Collaborative for Regenerative Medicine Education
and Training for Engineers and Scientists of the Future
The University of New Hampshire, in collaboration with faculty participants from the New
Hampshire IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (NH-INBRE), as well as
school district and industry partners, propose an NIH Science Education Partnership Award
to establish and advance NH CREATES the Future: the NH Collaborative for Regenerative
Medicine Education and Training for Engineers and Scientists of the Future (hereafter, NH
CREATES). The overall goal of NH CREATES is to establish a robust pipeline extending
from middle school to higher education for the burgeoning regenerative medicine and
biofabrication (RM&B) industry in New Hampshire. Aim 1 of NH CREATES will provide
formal professional development and training for twelve grades 6-12 teachers per year, in
project-based learning implementation through the lens of RM&B and its foundational concepts,
(1) organisms for regeneration, (2) cellular and molecular biology, (3) computational methods in
biology, and (4) molecular structure and function, as well as responsible conduct of research.
Aim 2 provides a set of summer programs for forty under-represented youth annually,
incorporating project-based learning that is focused on RM&B. This specific platform will also
provide a forum where parents, school administrators and industry partners can bring students
into a community of near-peer mentors, to establish them on a biotechnology career pathway.
Additionally, these youth project support the teacher training by serving as a learning laboratory
for the professional development of the teachers.
Moreover, aim 3 of NH CREATES will
establish a NH CREATES Ecosystem, to provide an infrastructure that will build relationships
and develop connections between educational institutions within NH INBRE, school teachers
and administrators, parents, youth, employers, community resources, and philanthropy. The
combination of these stakeholder relationships and their activities establish an innovative
ecosystem in New Hampshire that facilitates the entry and retention of students in a
biomedical education pipeline spanning middle school to higher education, in order to
sustain the workforce to meet NH’s RM&B and biotechnology needs. NH CREATES is a
training mechanism to supply the RM&B industry with an educated workforce so that, in turn,
this burgeoning industry can fulfill its potential to cure disease."
10933386,"Early life adversity is a pervasive impediment to healthy brain development and mental health in the long term. 
Exposure to early life adversity is distressingly common, with nearly two-thirds of people experiencing at least 
one significant adversity event before the age of 18. Despite decades of research documenting the long-term 
physical and mental toll these early experiences have on individuals, there continues to be a lack of specificity 
in how subtypes or dimensions of child adversity propagate particular patterns of neurodevelopment and mental 
health aberrations. In recent years, dimensional approaches have led to field-shaping discoveries whereby shared 
features of adversity (e.g., threat, deprivation, unpredictability) can be used to make meaningful, domain-specific 
predictions about developmental outcomes. A next step in this line of inquiry is to use a dimensional adversity 
approach to probe the biological sequalae that initiate and propel adversity-related neurodevelopmental 
cascades. Pubertal development, specifically, has been highlighted as a candidate biological process that is both 
sensitive to early adversity and occurs in a uniquely plastic developmental window. Puberty induces a major 
influx of pubertal hormones that instigate dramatic changes in structural and functional neural development, as 
well as stark physical and psychosocial changes. Even in otherwise healthy developmental contexts, 
adolescents are at remarkably increased risk for a wide range of psychopathology. To date, early adversity has 
been shown to facilitate adaptations that accelerate or preserve resources related to survival, including shifted 
or altered pubertal development. However, how specific dimensions of adversity modulate pubertal development, 
particularly with respect to sex hormones (e.g., testosterone, estradiol), continues to be weakly characterized. 
Even less is known about links between early adversity, puberty, and neurodevelopment, although initial insights 
have indicated the possible mechanistic role puberty plays in propagating neuro-phenotypes that increase risk 
for psychiatric symptoms. Our novel preliminary results have highlighted specific effects of adversity subtypes 
(e.g., threat exposure) as well as pubertal hormones on brain function and structure, which in some cases 
amplified risk for psychopathology in adolescents. In the current study, we will integrate these processes into an 
overall framework by leveraging a high-risk sample of youth with highly heterogenous adversity experiences, 
enrolled from the Boys Town Youth Care program, to investigate how distinct dimensions of adversity affect 
puberty and neurodevelopment. To do so, we will use state-of-the-art adversity, neuroimaging, and pubertal 
measures, including gonadal and adrenarcheal hair hormone assays (Aim 1). The proposed study will be 
designed to test how adversity affects the pubertal transition and will provide fundamental insights into the 
neurobiological dynamics that prime individuals to develop psychopathology (Aim 2). Given that pubertal 
development is a paramount event marked by malleability, this project has the potential to yield insights on novel 
targets for intervention that could promote healthy neurodevelopmental trajectories following childhood adversity."
10906927,"Neurosarcoidosis (NS) represents the neurologic manifestations of sarcoidosis, a multisystemic granulomatous
inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. NS may be observed in 5-15% of patients with sarcoidosis, a
worldwide disease that disproportionally impacts African Americans and whites of northern European heritage.
Our preliminary studies showed NS has a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that includes meningitis,
encephalitis, and myelitis. We also found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with NS reveal a unique
profile of immune mediators frequently associated with infections (interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and
interleukin-6) and antibody signatures linked to Mycobacteria antigens. Based upon these observations, we
hypothesize that the pathogenesis of NS is due to a neuro-inflammatory response to antigens derived from
exposure to infective agents in susceptible individuals with the clinical phenotype determined by specific gene
expression signatures. This study engages two centers with existing cohorts of NS patients with prospective
collection of clinical data and biological samples to dissect CSF immunopathogenic pathways, define immune
profiles, and uncover antigens or pathogens which may be associated with NS phenotypes. Our specific aims
focus on associating clinical NS phenotypes with immune profiles and gene expression pathway signatures in
CSF and the link with host or pathogen-associated antibodies. In Aim 1, we will perform rigorous phenotyping
of NS patients, and use biological samples such as CSF to characterize previously identified cytokine and
acute phase reactants and their usefulness as biomarkers of disease outcome. In Aim 2, we will use host
CSF transcriptional profiling to identify specific molecular signatures and pathways present in NS will establish
immunopathogenic mechanisms and factors that contribute to dynamic neuroinflammation and disease
progression. In Aim 3, we will use state of the art phase display libraries and phage-displayed
immunoprecipitation sequencing techniques to determine the presence of antibodies to host and microbial-
associated antigens which may identify triggering mechanisms related to the NS inflammatory process. All
aims are well integrated as Aim 1 will provide a well characterized and phenotyped cohort of patients with NS
which would facilitate a more precise identification of disease pathways in the CSF transcriptomic analysis
outlined in aim 2, and host- or pathogen-related antibody response discovery in Aim 3. The studies proposed
will address critical voids in our understanding of the pathogenesis of NS and suggest future novel therapeutic
strategies."

One out of every ten infants is born preterm. Preterm birth can cause retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a
leading cause of childhood blindness. Even in the absence of ROP or neurological disability, children born
preterm exhibit subtle impairments in visual acuity and visual function, though the etiology of this suboptimal
vision in preterm infants remains unclear. The fovea, an indentation in the central retina, is the most critical
region determining visual acuity. The fovea is surrounded by anastomosis of three layers of capillaries, forming
the foveal avascular zone. It is well-established that children and adults with history of prematurity have a small
or absent foveal avascular zone, retained foveal inner retinal layers, and decreased photoreceptor function,
and that these abnormalities are more severe in individuals with history of treated ROP. The development of
human perifoveal vasculature, however, is difficult to study due to the absence of fovea in most easily
accessible animal models and the rarity of human histopathological samples during late gestation.
Our multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise will work together to use advanced bedside handheld
optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography imaging to fill the gap in our knowledge of perifoveal
vascular development in infants. We propose to elucidate the human perifoveal vascular development through
the following specific aims: 1) optimize bedside handheld infant OCT angiography to visualize perifoveal
vascular development; 2) determine if perifoveal vascular development is delayed in preterm infants compared
to term infants, further delayed in ROP, and associates with poor outer retinal maturation; and 3) determine the
association of macular edema and decreased perifoveal deep vascular complex formation and outer retinal
maturation in preterm infants. This research will expand our knowledge of human foveal development and
inform the pathophysiology of diseases of macular and retinal vascular development."

The human body hosts multiple complex microbial ecosystems consisting of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and
fungi — collectively referred to as the microbiota. The microbiota impact human health and are associated with
a wide variety of complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how the microbiota is maintained across the
body is of major importance. My research program focuses on investigating the factors responsible for
microbiota composition in the human host and determining how the microbiome influences human health.
Specifically, I tackle these questions from the perspective of a human geneticist. I treat the microbiome as a
complex trait and use human genetic approaches to understand its genetic underpinnings. Recent work from
myself and others revealed the effect of host genetics in fecal microbiome composition. Major gaps in our
understanding of microbiome heritability remain, however, which I aim to tackle in my lab. For example, we
lack an understanding of whether host genetics impacts microbiota directly adjacent to mucosal surfaces, what
the underlying host physiological mechanisms are, and whether host genetics influences the eukaryotic
viruses, fungi, or other single-cell eukaryotic organisms in the microbiota, as the bacterial and archaeal
components of the microbiota have been the focus to date. Research in my lab seeks to address these gaps
by developing and applying a combination of microbiome and functional genomic research methods to gain a
better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of host-microbiota interactions across the body. Over
the next five years I will lead projects under three broad themes: (1) identify relationships between host genes
and mucosal bacterial and archaeal abundance, (2) identify non-prokaryotic elements of the microbiota
associated with human gene expression, and (3) determine causal relationships between the microbiome and
host traits across two distinct body sites: gut and lung. Specifically, my efforts will focus on physiologically
relevant sampling, including pairing sequencing of the microbiota from lung and gut mucosal surfaces with
single-cell RNA-seq of adjacent host tissues. Using these data, I will identify individual microbial taxa, host cell
types, and host pathways important for maintaining cross-kingdom interactions in healthy individuals. By
examining two distinct organ systems, I will identify components both shared across and unique to the host
tissue type. Application of genetic epidemiological methods and confirmation in vitro will establish direction of
causality: Which aspects of the microbiota drive changes in gene expression in the host, and vice versa?
Results from my research program will provide insights into the physiological mechanisms that underlie
heritability of the microbiota. Ultimately, this will improve our understanding of host control of the microbiome
and provide insight into which elements of the microbiome could be targeted for therapeutic benefit."

Myelin—the electrical insulator around neuronal axons—is essential in vertebrates for rapid nerve signaling,
and its loss in diseases like multiple sclerosis and following injury causes severe disability in patients. In the
central nervous system, oligodendrocytes build myelin by first extending their membrane processes to
ensheath axons, then wrapping spirally around the axon while compacting their membranes to become
electrically insulating. In chronic multiple sclerosis lesions, oligodendrocytes ensheath axons but fail to wrap,
suggesting that wrapping is a rate-limiting step for remyelination. To ultimately understand why remyelination
fails in multiple sclerosis, we first aim to understand the mechanism by which myelin wraps normally. It was
long hypothesized that the assembly of actin filaments provides the force required to drive wrapping, like the
lamellipodium of a motile cell or a neuronal growth cone. However, we and others recently discovered that the
dramatic disassembly of the oligodendrocyte actin cytoskeleton is required for wrapping. This finding was
completely unexpected and suggests two models for wrapping. Cycles of actin disassembly and reassembly
could be required to “ratchet” the oligodendrocyte membrane forward. In contrast, based on our preliminary
data, we propose that actin disassembly acts as a “trigger” to initiate actin-independent wrapping and that the
major role of actin disassembly is to allow myelin to compact. To test these models, we are using a suite of
innovative approaches including first-in-class genetic tools we created to experimentally induce actin
disassembly (DeActs) or block actin disassembly (StablActs) in oligodendrocytes during wrapping in vivo,
advanced microscopy techniques to resolve myelin in vivo, and live cell imaging of oligodendrocytes in culture.
Our preliminary data demonstrate: (1) actin filaments disassemble in oligodendrocytes prior to wrapping, (2)
experimentally inducing actin disassembly specifically in oligodendrocytes in vivo increases myelin wrapping,
and (3) experimentally blocking actin disassembly impairs myelin membrane compaction in a culture model of
myelination. These data support the “trigger” model of myelin wrapping, laying the foundation for future
translational studies to test whether this actin disassembly-based mechanism is recapitulated or perturbed
during remyelination. By defining the role of actin disassembly in myelin wrapping and compaction, this project
will open up new research directions towards understanding myelin formation, plasticity, and disease in the
central nervous system."

10907627,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Synaptic transmission and its plasticity are based on a core group of synaptic receptors that rapidly sense
neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA. Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), are typically thought to signal on slower time scales, but have also been shown to regulate the induction
and expression of synaptic plasticity. Despite both neurotransmitter and neurotrophin signaling underlying most
forms of synaptic plasticity and serving as major mediators of the pathophysiology and treatment of
neurogenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, little is known about how these different receptor classes work
in concert through direct and indirect forms of crosstalk. Motivated by the paucity of direct tests of
neurotrophin/neurotransmitter crosstalk, our preliminary studies have indicated that the neurotrophin receptor,
TrkB, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) are able to mutually regulate each other in both native
and heterologous systems. In contrast to previous studies which have focused on the ability of GPCRs to activate
RTK signaling, we have identified one of the first examples of an RTK (TrkB) engaging a GPCR (mGluR5) as a
signaling effector. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that mGluR5 is a critical mediator of TrkB effects
by amplifying and altering the spatiotemporal dynamics of downstream signaling to canonical effectors to drive
a unique form of crosstalk-dependent synaptic plasticity. Collectively, this new form of TrkB-mGluR5 signaling
may contribute to the diverse higher order nervous system functions related to neural plasticity that have been
attributed to the BDNF-TrkB neurotrophin system. Aim 1 will define BDNF-TrkB receptor mediated signaling
crosstalk with mGluR5. Aim 2 will decipher the signaling mechanisms that regulate TrkB/mGluR5 crosstalk. Aim
3 will determine the impact of TrkB-mGluR5 synergy on BDNF-LTP and mGluR5-LTD."
10907636,"5/8 NADIA UO1. Effects of Adolescent Alcohol on Adult Brain Neurocircuitry.
Abstract
Our studies find adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure increases adult risky decisions, disinhibition,
behavioral inflexibility, and reduces sensitivity to adult ethanol challenge as well as increasing alcohol drinking,
all risk factors for human AUD. Acetylcholine is reduced by AIE and plays a critical role in cortical activation and
integration as well as maturation of adolescent neurocircuits that could impact ethanol sensitivity. Although AIE
does not change adult ethanol elimination, it does reduce adult ethanol motor-sedative, anxiolytic, PFC
immediate early gene (IEG) c-fos, and cortical functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI)
responses. We discovered AIE increases adult HMGB1 and its receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] and
receptor for advanced glycation end products [RAGE]) on neurons, and these signals are linked to epigenetic
silencing of cholinergic phenotype genes (i.e., ChAT, VAChT, TrkA) and loss of hippocampal neurogenesis,
which are examples of AIE-altered neurocircuitry. Low response to ethanol is associated with AUD, and these
changes are found in post-mortem human adult AUD brain. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons integrate
neurocircuits, and reductions of these neurons may contribute to AIE pathology. We hypothesize AIE
HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE epigenetic silencing of cholinergic neurons alters basal forebrain-cortical-
hippocampal neurocircuitry, leading to reduced ethanol sensitivity and increased alcohol drinking in
adulthood. Reductions of adult ChAT+ neurons caused by AIE were initially interpreted as neurodegeneration;
however, the surprising discovery that AIE reductions of ChAT+ neurons are reversible by exercise and
indomethacin supports HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE→NFκB epigenetic silencing of ChAT within neurons persisting
into adulthood. Reversal of neuroimmune ChAT silencing suggests AIE pathology is persistent, but not
permanent. However, it is not known if AIE-mediated adolescent-like low adult ethanol sensitivity can be
prevented or reversed. This proposal therefore has the following Aims. AIM 1. Test the hypothesis that AIE
decreases adult ethanol sensitivity to brain fcMRI changes, c-fos expression, ethanol response behaviors
(ERBs), and increases adult alcohol drinking. AIM 2 will extend studies testing the hypothesis that
HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE→NFκB signaling reduces basal forebrain ChAT+ cholinergic neurons by reversible
epigenetic mechanisms. AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that adolescent ChAT silencing mimics adult AIE low-
ethanol response and other pathology. AIM 4 will test the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory treatment known to
reverse AIE-altered ChAT, neurogenesis, and epigenetic changes, will also recover AIE-altered c-fos, fcMRI,
ethanol low behavioral response sensitivity, and adult ethanol drinking. Identifying molecular mechanisms and
key neurocircuits regulating low response to alcohol will contribute to our understanding of adolescent brain
development and the mechanisms determining low response to ethanol challenge, a known risk factor for AUD,
as well as possibly identifying treatment targets."

million cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2018, each predicted to increase by more than 60% by the year 2040.1
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized oncology through engineered targeting of
antigens on previously untreatable cancers. However, less than half of patients on CAR T cell therapy experience
long-term disease control, and CAR T cells have not mediated sustained responses in solid tumors.2 T cell
exhaustion has been extensively characterized and linked to CAR T cell dysfunction, but the role of senescence
is still poorly understood.3 Senescent T cells have been shown to manifest defective killing abilities and the
development of negative regulatory functions.4 Moreover, levels of telomerase have been shown to control the
lifespan of human T cells, with increased levels delaying senescence.5
My central hypothesis for this project is that T cell senescence limits the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy, and I
can delineate telomere-dependent and -independent roles of telomerase in T cells and identify senescent
markers predictive of CAR T treatment response and correlated with patient characteristics. In the proposed
work, I will: (i) define senescent features in CAR T cells and correlate with exhaustion and functionality, (ii) utilize
genetic engineering to interrogate the impact of telomerase activity on T cell function and phenotype, and (iii)
correlate T cell senescent features in apheresis and CAR T infusion product with clinical measures. Collectively,
the proposed work will investigate CAR T senescence as a stratifying and predictive clinical correlate, providing
mechanistic insights informing increasingly effective CAR T cancer treatments.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating disease (without curative therapies) that is critically influenced
by dysregulated inflammatory pathways. This A0 R42 STTR application focuses on a highly novel humanized
monoclonal antibody (mAb), ALT-100, to target and neutralize eNAMPT (extracellular nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase), a damage-associated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) that robustly activates
innate immunity-driven inflammatory pathways via ligation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We speculate
the eNAMPT-neutralizing ALT-100 mAb to be a strategy to address the unmet need for therapies that limit
inflammatory bowel injury/fibrosis and reduce the severity of IBD. Published and unpublished data strongly
support involvement of eNAMPT in human IBD pathobiology. First, NAMPT RNA and protein expression are
significantly increased in intestinal tissues from IBD patients and are highly upregulated by IBD-relevant stimuli
including growth factors and cytokines. Second, plasma/serum eNAMPT levels are elevated in IBD subjects
and correlate with disease severity and responses to anti-TNFa therapies. Thirdly, NAMPT polymorphisms
(SNPs), previously linked to inflammatory disease severity in ARDS and pulmonary hypertension (PH),
associate with IBD severity in GWAS studies. Lastly, compellingly published data demonstrate eNAMPT is a
highly druggable target, with ALT-100 mAb profoundly attenuating multiple preclinical systemic
inflammation/organ injuries (ARDS, PH, radiation-induced fibrosis, cancer). Importantly, ALT-100 mAb
reduces preclinical IBD severity, colon inflammation and fibrosis. The feasibility of ALT-100 mAb as an
IBD therapy is supported by completed acute IND-enabling pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and 28-day toxicity
studies showing the IV ALT-100 mAb formulation has a T1/2 half-life of 10 days and is without discernable toxicity
(rats and pigs). In addition, we have completed CMC manufacturing development (stable cell line,
Research/Master Cell Banks) and a 200L GMP Bioreactor run (expression 6 gms/L) of the IV ALT-1000 mAb
formulation (10mg/mL). We anticipate FDA IND submission for ARDS in May 2022. In PHASE I of this R-42
STTR PHASE I/II Fast Track application, Specific Aims #1/2 will assess pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of
ALT-100 mAb in well-established acute (7 days) and chronic (28 days) preclinical DSS-induced murine colitis
models and optimize ALT-100 mAb dosing (0.4 mg/kg, 1mg/kg, 4 mg/kg) and route of delivery (IV vs subQ)
using IV formulations (10 mg/mL) and subQ formulations (100 mg/mL). In PHASE II studies conducted in rats
and minipigs, Specific Aim #3 will characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of the subQ and IV
ALT-100 mAb formulations and Specific Aim #4 will evaluate chronic subQ ALT-100 mAb toxicokinetic
properties. Successful completion of these PHASE I/ II STTR studies will establish ALT-100 mAb as a viable
IBD therapeutic and enable the submission of an FDA IND application to allow Aqualung to conduct IBD clinical
trials that address ALT-100 mAb as a novel therapeutic to address the unmet needs in subjects with severe

10905368,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with high mortality,1 few effective treatments,2–4 and
high relapse rates.5 Current evidence-based treatments for EDs often result in only 50% of individuals reaching
full remission of their symptoms.4 Further, even among those who do recover, many relapse. Up to 50% of
those who recover experience a relapse after treatment, about 25% of individuals go on to experience a
severe and persistent course of illness.5–13 Despite these high rates of relapse, the past decades of research
have culminated in very little improvement to prevent relapse within the EDs. To date, we still know very little
about why relapse occurs; in part, because ED relapse has been studied primarily as an outcome (i.e.,
relapsed or not) rather than a dynamic process can be intervened upon.9,14 Reconceptualizing and studying
ED relapse as a dynamic process will aid the identification of mechanisms of relapse and inform the
development and refinement of interventions and relapse prevention efforts. A well-established model of
relapse in substance use disorders (i.e., the cognitive behavioral relapse model; CBRM)15 can inform the initial
formation of a similar model in EDs. With research design informed by the CBRM, the proposed study will use
micro-longitudinal (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) and longitudinal (i.e., 3-month follow-up) methods
to capture lapses and relapse among those with EDs. The use of theory-driven, fine-grained assessment will
move the field toward the elucidation of distal and proximal mechanisms of relapse as it unfolds in real-time.
First, we will capture the presence and dynamics of lapses (i.e., momentary engagement in ED behaviors), and
whether features of lapses (e.g., frequency, time between lapses) predict eventual relapse (Aim 1). The CBRM
specifies that both tonic processes (i.e., stable, chronic factors) and phasic responses (i.e., immediate
precipitants) increase the risk for relapse. As such, we will test the associations between tonic processes and
the propensity for lapsing (i.e., higher urge valence and stability and lower urge variability; Aim 2). Additionally,
we will use generalized estimating equation models to examine whether each proposed phasic response (e.g.,
affect, emotion regulation skill use) predicts a lapse at the next survey (Aim 3). Lastly, the CBRM posits that
“high-risk” situations increase the likelihood of an individual lapsing. This study will aid in the initial identification
of said high-risk situations in EDs by using mixed-method (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) analyses to explore
contextual factors contributing to individuals’ reported lapses (Exploratory Aim 4). Overall, the proposed
project will implement advanced statistics and micro- and macro-longitudinal design to provide an
initial mechanistic understanding of relapse as it occurs in the EDs. Findings from this study will
inform the refinement of relapse prevention interventions and just-in-time adaptive interventions, and
ultimately, promote lasting, long-term recovery for those with this impairing and persistent disorder."

Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA beta-herpes virus that has co-evolved
with humans for ~200 million years. Over 90% of octagenarians are seropositive for CMV antigens, often with
no knowledge that they harbor the virus. While its prevalence goes relatively unnoticed by the general public,
CMV is the primary infectious cause of congenital birth defects and causes significant morbidity and mortality in
immunocompromised individuals. Despite considerable effort, the many therapeutic antibodies and vaccines
evaluated in clinical trials have not progressed, while commonly used antivirals have significant toxicities and
induce resistance. The largest vaccine trial to date observed ~50% efficacy, which correlated with non-
neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting key roles for antibody-dependent effector functions in protection.
A challenge in developing CMV antibody therapeutics and vaccines is the arsenal of immune evasion strategies
deployed by this virus. Antibody MSL109 failed phase II trials apparently due to an escape mechanism that
resulted in new viral particles being coated with MSL109. The mechanism appeared to involve viral proteins that
bind human IgG Fc domains (viral Fcg receptors or vFcgRs) and impeded antibody effector functions by blocking
interactions with host Fcg receptors on immune cells. We hypothesize that blocking antibody capture by viral
Fcg receptors will enhance protection by anti-CMV antibodies. We will evaluate this hypothesis using two
complementary aims with translational relevance. Aim 1 will engineer the human IgG1 antibody Fc to identify
variants that resist vFcgR capture and could be incorporated into future anti-CMV therapeutics, while Aim 2 will
evaluate the ability of antibodies whose Fab domains bind the vFcgRs to block Fc capture and thereby enhance
antibody protection. The antibodies produced in this project will be rigorously characterized in vitro for antigen
and host Fc receptor affinities, the ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and prevent viral
spread using CMV-infected cells in vitro since there is no simple animal model of CMV disease.
The long-term goal of this research is to support development of potent antibody therapeutics and vaccines
that prevent cytomegalovirus disease in high-risk populations, including newborns and organ transplant
recipients. The specific objective of this proposal is to determine the impact of antibody Fc capture on anti-
CMV antibody activities and the potential for strategies blocking these interactions to eliminate CMV-infected
cells and prevent viral spread. The expected outcomes include (i) engineered human IgG1 Fc variants that
resist capture by the two best characterized vFcgRs and (ii) determining the increased protection that can be
gained by blocking Fc capture. This project will provide insights into a key CMV immune evasion strategy and
the contributions of Fc-dependent functions to CMV protection with relevance for future CMV therapeutics."

 There are ~1.4 million adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) in the US and their number is
increasing by 40,000-50,000/year due to improving pediatric CHD care. Up to 85% of the ACHD patients fail to
establish or maintain ACHD specialist care which results in poor outcomes, the most vulnerable period for these
gaps being at the time of transition and transfer from pediatric to adult healthcare. Transition includes fostering
of patients’ knowledge of their CHD and of self-management and self-efficacy skills needed for lifelong
management of chronic disease. Transfer is the event when a patient's care is taken over by the adult healthcare
team. Since chronic management of CHD interferes with daily life activities (such as job, family planning,
traveling), it is difficult for many of these adults to engage in their own care. Knowledge, self-management, self-
efficacy, and patient activation are important skills for patient engagement, and strategies that enhance these
skills are known to reduce gaps in ACHD care.
 Majority of the ACHD patients are young and own smartphones. This provides a unique opportunity to
use mobile app-based intervention as a relatively inexpensive and scalable solution to support ACHD patient
engagement skills. But, for its success, it is critical to incorporate theory of behavior change into its design. Thus,
my central hypothesis is that an automated, interactive, mobile app-based intervention refined using ‘Capability,
Opportunity, Motivation-Behavioral’ theory to evaluate the determinants of behavior can enhance skills known to
support ACHD patient engagement and ACHD specialist visit. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will shed light on
the pertinent features of a mobile app to support patient engagement skills using semi-structured interviews of
the ACHD patients, clinicians, researchers, and clinic staff. Aim 2 will use an iterative process with inputs from
an Advisory Board of ACHD patients, clinicians, and researchers to design and revise an automated interactive
user-friendly app. Aim 3 will carry out a pilot study to determine feasibility and acceptability of the mobile app to
enhance ACHD patient engagement skills. These aims will create foundational knowledge for future studies to
determine effectiveness of a mHealth based intervention to support ACHD patient engagement and ensure
ACHD specialist visit. Candidate is an ACHD cardiologist and health services researcher at UCSF. The
candidate, her mentors and her scientific advisors have developed a comprehensive career development plan
that includes training in mHealth-based behavioral interventions, qualitative methods, and clinical trials. With
strong institutional commitment, the candidate is well-positioned to attain research independence."
10908572,"Project Summary: This project aims, for the first time, to bring digital pathology image generation and assis-
tance seamlessly into the standard clinical workflow by developing PathCAM, a Computer Assisted Microscope
system for pathologists. The field of digital pathology (DP) at first glance seems poised to make significant im-
pacts in precision medicine. However, the generation of the digital images at the heart of DP is currently outside
of the analog clinical workflow used for the overwhelming majority of clinical slide diagnoses. This is because,
until now, digital image generation in pathology has been relegated to acquisition in expensive and slow whole
slide imaging (WSI) systems, that are outside of the standard clinical workflow. Thus, the current analog micro-
scope workflow will be the prevalent standard for now and the foreseeable future, meaning that any form of
digital assistance for pathologists, via artificial intelligence (AI) or external second opinions, is currently signifi-
cantly disconnected from practice. Moreover, hospitals and patients that do not have access to WSI systems on
a routine basis cannot benefit from these assists. Our low-cost proposed solution is based on a simple insight:
using video feeds from “onboard cameras” commonly installed on clinical microscopes, the camera and associ-
ated software can build an exact digital record of the clinical review. Through our technical innovations, these
images will be created passively, requiring no change in pathologist behavior. Our approach will provide a
pathologist with a real-time preview of what they explored on a slide, giving them feedback on the “whole picture”
of their review and context of their evaluation. Moreover, it allows the direct integration of AI assistance technol-
ogies during clinical review. A transformative aspect to our approach is that images collected during review that
are captured regioselectively from the pathology slide across resolution scales, will be combined into a single
variable resolution image (VRI), which contains an optimal sampling of the tissue section, containing the exact
balance of magnification and resolution needed to render the clinical decision. This optimal image is ideal for
immediate data transfer for a remote pathology consultation – with no waiting for a separate digitization system
to scan the slide. PathCAM’s applicability to both real-time digital assistance and remote second opinions will be
studied in this work. Beyond the direct benefits to clinicians, the data produced by the PathCAM approach can
be transformative for DP technologies going forward. PathCAM can cheaply image data from millions of slide
reviews that would be otherwise be lost, and would enable more equitable data collection via wide and immediate
open-source deployment through our collaboration with Kitware Inc. PathCAM also captures rich information
about how pathologists reach clinical decisions (i.e., diagnostic provenance). These records of how pathologists
clinically search and view slides across resolution scales and relationships between spatiotemporal attention
and diagnosis can support the development of new self-supervised AI algorithms that learn from, but are not
limited by, human-machine interaction data, as well as new human-in-the-loop decision support systems."

This application is being submitted in response to NIH's INCLUDE (OT-OD-20-025) Notice of Special Interest.
The purposed R01 provides the first longitudinal investigation of the time-ordered effect of four lifestyle factors
- physical activity, sleep, cognitive stimulation, and social engagement - on early Alzheimer's disease (AD)
neuropathology and the transition to clinical AD in adults with Down syndrome (DS). These lifestyle factors will
be assessed at a total of three time points, each spaced 16 months apart, in 140 adults with DS enrolled in the
NIH-funded Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium in DS (ABC-DS; https://www.nia.nih.gov/ research/abc-ds).
Adults with DS are at genetic risk for AD due to the triplication of chromosome 21, which contains the gene for
the amyloid precursor protein and thus results in an overproduction of amyloid-bet (Aβ). Despite this genetic
risk, there is variability in the age of onset of clinical AD in the DS population. Lifestyle factors may contribute
to this variability, as has been found in non-DS populations including adults with early-onset familial forms of
AD. Indeed, as a group, adults with DS have been found to engage in a relatively high rate of sedentary
behavior, experience a high rate of sleep problems, and to have lifestyles marked by low levels of cognitive
stimulation and social engagement. In the proposed study, we will collect information on physical health, sleep,
cognitive stimulation, and social engagement across a 7-day/night period at three time points (spaced 16
months apart). Self/information report and objective measures (actigraph and WatchPAT) are used to assess
these lifestyle factors. This data collection will correspond in time with ABC-DS data collection of AD
biomarkers, cognitive functioning, and dementia symptoms and status. Time-ordered associations between
lifestyle factors and AD biomarkers (PET Aβ, PET tau, PET FDG, structural and functional MRI, and CSF Aβ
and tau, and blood) and cognitive functioning and dementia will be examined. The specific aims of the study
are to: 1) Examine the association between lifestyle factors –physical activity, sleep, cognitive stimulation, and
social engagement – and AD biomarkers longitudinally (T1 to T3; each spaced 16-months apart); 2) Determine
the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive functioning and dementia symptoms and status
longitudinally (T1 to T3); 3) Evaluate the moderating role of lifestyle factors on the relation between early AD
neuropathology (indexed by biomarkers) and cognitive functioning and dementia symptoms and status
longitudinally (T1 to T3). These lifestyle factors may be important modifiable resiliency mechanisms for
delaying clinical AD in adults with DS despite their genetic risk."

 Stem cells replenish tissues and organs over an organism’s lifetime and can repair damage after injury.
With their special capacities for self-renewal and differentiation, stem cells promise to revolutionize medicine.
To develop better and safer stem cell therapies, it is critically important to improve the understanding of stem
cell regulation. Most of the knowledge about stem cell regulation comes from studies that investigate the
aggregate behaviors of thousands to millions of stem cells. However, recent studies suggest that individual
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) behave substantially differently from one another in both mice and humans.
These newly discovered inter-cellular differences present exciting new opportunities for studying HSC
regulation. However, they also present significant technical challenges that are difficult to address with
conventional approaches. The proposed research program will use a novel systems biology approach
combined with quantitative single-cell analysis to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
HSC heterogeneity and coordination, as well as their influences on aging and the pathogenesis of
hematopoietic diseases. Many hematopoietic diseases—such as bone marrow failure, myeloproliferative
disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes and other age-associated hematopoietic problems—are initiated by rare
cells. The proposed research program will map the precise pathogenesis of these diseases and identify
disease founder clones and genes using newly developed single cell tracking and molecular profiling
technologies. With these technical advances, the proposed research will also produce new fundamental
knowledge about blood regeneration, the foundation of bone marrow transplantation. The long-term objective
is to apply the knowledge obtained from the proposed basic research to control blood regeneration for
therapeutic use, to detect leukemia and other clonal diseases at early stages, and to effectively treat diseases
with advanced stem cell therapies."

10940122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Thrombosis and bleeding are the major causes of morbidity and mortality among
survivors of myeloid malignancies. Previous studies proposed clinical and laboratory
variables associated with these life-threatening comorbidities, such as older age.
However, these crude predictors do not capture the heterogeneity of patients’
pathology, genomics, laboratory, and clinical profiles to arrive at accurate and
personalized risk assessment. In addition, conventional machine learning prediction
models cannot elucidate the biological mechanisms underpinning the observed
correlations, and association-based prediction models do not provide reliable treatment
suggestions. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the hemorrhagic and
thrombotic disease burden among patients with myeloid malignancies by providing
personalized risk predictions that enable treatment optimization. The central hypothesis
is that causal machine learning methods will empower a reliable analytical platform for
hematologic comorbidity risk prediction and mitigation. In this study, we will employ
large and diverse clinical datasets from multiple clinical centers to develop integrative
causal machine learning models. Specifically, we will (i) integrate laboratory, pathology,
and clinical data to identify the key predictors of thrombosis for patients with myeloid
malignancies, (ii) quantify the risk of bleeding by machine learning and causal inference
methods, and (iii) personalize treatment protocols to minimize risks of bleeding and
thrombosis using causal machine learning. We will validate our data-driven models
through rigorous external validation. Our methods are innovative because they depart
from the status quo by linking advanced causal inference methods with machine
learning algorithms. Our proposed studies are significant because they will create a
reliable data-driven framework for multi-modality data fusion and enable personalized
treatment strategies to mitigate hematologic comorbidities. This novel causal machine
learning platform will guide individualized clinical decisions to reduce hematologic
adverse events among patients with myeloid malignancies. Our approaches address
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Compelling Question 5.CQ.10 on
reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors."
10940501,"Abstract:
This proposal describes the development of sustainable methodologies using Earth-abundant Ni-based catalysts
to synthesize nitrogen-containing molecules. The proposed projects target improving the synthesis of amines,
amides, and nitriles by overcome pervasive challenges in the field, like the limited scalability of current state-of-
the-art photocatalytic methods and the need for toxic reagents for nitrile synthesis. These functional groups are
both commonly relied upon as readily manipulated synthetic intermediates and are also ever-present in
biologically active molecules, commercial drugs, and polymers.
The first project describes the design of Ni catalysts to mediate C−N bond-forming reactions. The objective is to
enable reaction mechanisms similar to those observed under light irradiation with Ir cocatalysts, but while
bypassing the limitations of those systems. Specifically, we aim to enable processes that do not require Ir or light
to proceed. This is because photochemical reactions are difficult to perform at industrially relevant scales and
avoiding the use of Ir will reduce the reaction cost. If successful, the new systems will enable the coupling of
amines and amides at ambient temperatures. This contrasts with other non-photochemical approaches that
require high temperatures and strong bases to promote these reactions. It is expected that the milder conditions
will allow for a wider functional group tolerance and thus increase the scope of molecules that will be directly
accessible by these methodologies.
The second project describes the use of aryl nitriles as cyanide sources. Aryl nitriles are ideal CN precursors
because, unlike most cyanide sources, they are non-toxic. Consequently, the development of synthetic methods
relying upon them would be highly advantageous. In this context, preliminary data is presented for two different
transformations: (i) the carbocyanation of alkenes and (ii) the addition of electrophiles and cyanides to
cyclopropyl ketones to yield open-chain ketones. Both these transformations facilitate the introduction of two
different groups in a single step. As a result, these protocols enable direct access to a broad range of nitrile-
containing products in an efficient and sustainable manner."
10940864,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects over 300,000 Americans annually with a 43% mortality rate.
Inflammation plays a key pathogenic role in mortality, particularly in the one-third of patients with
hyperinflammatory ARDS. Inflammation also drives subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis and
interstitial lung disease (ILD) that leads to progressive respiratory failure among ARDS survivors. Cytokines,
such as Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), suppress inflammation and
promote lung repair in ARDS animal models. However, current systemic administration approaches to deliver
these cytokines in therapy remain plagued by poor biodistribution, toxicity, infections due to deleterious systemic
immunosuppression, and paradoxical pro-inflammatory responses, all of which limit clinical translation. We have
overcome these critical limitations by developing an innovative and translational cell therapy platform that
enables sustained locally administration to the lungs. We have engineered retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells
to produce IL-1Ra and IL-10 in a more physiologically relevant paracrine fashion at high local concentrations
without systemic absorption and have encapsulated them in alginate-based core-shell capsules, shielding them
from the host immune system and allowing them to serve as a regulatable in situ cytokine “factories”. We have
demonstrated that local delivery modulates inflammation and improves outcomes in ARDS. In this proposal, we
hypothesize that pulmonary implantation of RPE cytokine factories will enable sustained local, and titratable
delivery of IL-1Ra and IL-10 to the lungs, with temporal control. We will develop 2 novel RPE capsule systems
that will be tailored specifically for: (i) airway-instillation (Ai-RPE) that allows direct contact with inflamed alveolar
epithelial surfaces for acute suppression of inflammation and (ii) pleural-instillation (Pi-RPE) which can support
long term RPE cell survival for chronic sustained therapy required to stimulate tissue remodeling. In Aim 1, we
will engineer Ai-RPE IL-1Ra capsules to suppress acute lung inflammation and prevent lung scaring in endotoxin
and viral (influenza) inflammation ARDS rat models. We will incorporate programmable biodegradation for
therapy cessation and airway clearance. In Aim 2, we will validate Pi-RPE for sustained delivery of IL-10 and IL-
1Ra cytokine factories as mono- or combination therapies to reverse pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin ARDS
rat model. We will assess the long-term fate of RPE cells in vivo and integrate an apoptotic cell safety switch to
cease therapy post-administration. In Aim 3, the ability to titrate and cease therapy post-implantation in a clinically
relevant fashion will be evaluated in a porcine model. Efficacy of RPE therapy will be tested in a porcine ARDS
model. Overall, these studies will develop therapeutic “off-the-shelf” RPE cytokine factories with sustained
survival and function for application for ARDS. The proposed analyses will notably also link functional recovery
across both small and large animal models of ARDS to foundational mechanistic insights into both host immune
responses in ARDS, and how leukocyte activity affects fibrosis and angiogenesis."

Nothing is more central to the human experience than memory, and no human capacity is more devastating
when it is lost. Memory has been intensely studied in basic and disease research for many decades but to my
knowledge we do not have any physical explanation of how memories alter complex behavior. This is in large
part because we do not have a mechanistic explanation of how most behaviors are executed in the first place,
but also because memory formation is best understood in brain regions like the hippocampus, which are far
removed from action control centers, which themselves are not well understood in the mammalian brain.
Drosophila courtship behavior stands out from other complex behaviors because it is exceptionally well
understood at the circuit level. Here I describe a new and robust paradigm for courtship learning in which the
memories appear to be formed, stored, modified, implemented, and erased within core courtship circuitry.
In both insects and mammals, dopamine has long been known to translate memory-relevant information from
the outside world into an internal teaching signal. In our new courtship learning paradigm we find that
dopamine signaling is both necessary and, under the appropriate circumstances, sufficient for memory
formation. I propose to test the hypothesis that dopamine-induced memory is written directly within courtship
circuitry, likely within a set of command neurons called P1. We will identify the specific dopaminergic neurons
required to write the memory, as well as localize the neurons that receive the dopamine signal. We will then
use our established activity monitoring and behavioral assays, together with the courtship wiring diagram, to
understand how memory alters the flow of information through behavioral circuitry. The results will provide new
insights into how memories directly impact behavioral decision-making, a goal that has been unachievable in
systems lacking detailed behavioral circuit maps. The conserved role of dopamine in memory writing suggests
that our findings will generalize to mammals.
Learning usually requires repetition or extreme events. This prevents the over-generalization that might occur
with single-trial learning. By analyzing the contributions of various known components of the courtship circuitry
to memory formation, we find a striking and novel role for a group of neurons, called mAL, in setting a
threshold for memory formation. mAL stimulation can even erase old memories, but only while they are being
recalled. I believe this is the first circuit-level manipulation that has been shown to disrupt memory
reconsolidation. I outline experiments designed to leverage this new behavioral paradigm and its circumscribed
neuronal populations to understand the nature of memory thresholding, maintenance, and removal in
behavioral circuitry at the molecular, circuit, and physiological levels. We will work to establish the new and
potentially transformative hypothesis that within populations of neurons that inhibit the execution of behaviors,
there exist subsets of neurons that can limit or even erase memories associated with those behaviors."
10938877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kidney transplantation improves survival in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Immunosuppression,
however, leads to infectious complications which cause significant morbidity and mortality in this fragile
population. Infections are mostly diagnosed at the time of clinical presentation and clinical factors do not
adequately anticipate infections. Predicting infectious complications is thus an important goal in kidney
transplantation to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.
The long term goal of this study is to develop comprehensive microbial biomarkers in the stool, blood, and the
urine for diagnosing and predicting infections in kidney transplant recipients. Our objectives are: 1) Develop a
fecal SCFA assay that predicts the risk for infections 2) Develop blood and urine cfDNA assays that can
comprehensively diagnose infections as well as predict the risk for infections. These objectives are
inspired by observations from several recent pilot studies: 1) We have found that the fecal abundance of short-
chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria is associated with decreased future development of bacterial and
viral infections 2) We have demonstrated that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) profiling in the blood and in the urine can
simultaneously detect changes in the microbiome and virome over time and detect infections in transplant
recipients. Importantly, with respect to cfDNA profiling, we have developed a novel technique called SIFT-seq to
overcome the challenge of environmental contamination in low biomass specimens. By biochemically tagging
the biological specimen prior to downstream DNA isolation, we can bioinformatically remove DNA introduced
during sample preparation and accurately identify the microbiome and virome in low biomass specimens.
In this study, we propose to recruit 300 kidney transplant recipients at the time of transplantation for serial fecal,
urine, and blood specimen collections during the first year after transplantation. We will profile the gut microbiome
using metagenomic sequencing to identify taxa at the species level and using metabolomic SCFA profiling. In
addition, we will profile the blood and urine specimens using our novel technique, SIFT-seq, to identify the blood
and urine microbiome and virome with high sensitivity and specificity. In Aim 1, we will determine the fecal
bacterial and SCFA profiles that predict the risk of infections in kidney transplant recipients. In Aim 2, we will
determine the blood and urine cfDNA profiles that are diagnostic and predictive of infections in kidney transplant
recipients. Significance. Establishing microbial biomarkers as predictive of infections will allow for identifying
kidney transplant recipients at high risk for infections and will allow for future clinical trials involving preemptive
changes in immunosuppression, preemptive antibiotic/antiviral therapies, and/or potential gut microbiota-based
therapies to prevent infections in these high risk individuals."
10938886,"Project Summary / Abstract
The discovery of new catalyzed methods to generate key bonds in organic molecules is vital to the sustainable
synthesis of biologically relevant molecules. The rapid diversification of simple chemical scaffolds using
automated parallel synthesis technologies allows for the generation of chemical libraries to screen for new
biological activity, and to assess structural-activity relationships, which facilitates the design of novel medicinal
targets with improved activity. New catalytic methods for parallel synthesis benefit from catalysts that can
selectively functionalize one site on the chemical scaffold, without changing other reactive functionalities on the
molecule. Developing a single catalyst that can select one reactive functionality, and then be switched to select
and react at a different site on the molecule, will allow sequential control of iterative reactions, thereby building
advanced synthetic targets in one pot using a strategy amenable to automated technologies. The proposed work
is centered on developing an organometallic catalyst with site-selective reactivity that can be switched by the
irradiation of different wavelengths of visible and ultraviolet light. The optimized organometallic catalysts will be
applied to iterative one-pot cross-coupling technologies, selectively activating either C(sp2)-X or C(sp3)-X bonds
for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds depending on the external light stimulus. Investigation of the ability
of the switchable organometallic complex to undertake hydrogen-atom transfer from bound alcohols will also be
conducted, resulting in the oxidation of the alcohol in situ for subsequent reductive cross-electrophile coupling
strategies. This approach facilitates temporal control of the rates of the multiple catalytic cycles according to the
wavelength of the light irradiation and will be applied to the coupling of alcohols with a range of different
electrophilic species. These methodologies will enable the iterative formation of key biological motifs, such as
stereodefined polyol sequences, that can be used to study novel medicinal targets. The program will also train
a diverse group of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in scientific
research encompassing organic, organometallic, and physical organic chemistry, and will provide these
colleagues with the professional development necessary to ensure success in their future careers."
10937742,"Nucleophilic Cobalt Photocatalysis and Organic Single-Electron Photoreductants; Two Enabling
Approaches for Chemical Synthesis – Project Summary
The objectives of this proposal are two-fold and include the development and fundamental advancement of
nucleophilic cobalt photocatalysis and organic single-electron photoreductants. The unifying theme of these two
distinct proposed research programs is the expansion of the breadth of carbon radical precursors available to
practitioners of synthetic organic chemistry. The successful completion of both objectives will positively and
fundamentally impact the field of chemical synthesis by giving medicinal chemists new synthetic methods that
provide access to new chemical space, thereby benefiting human health.
While carbon-centered radicals have become an increasingly important tool in organic synthesis, the breadth of
radical precursors available to synthetic chemists remains underdeveloped. One underutilized strategy for radical
generation is the use of nucleophilic catalysts to engage electrophiles as radical precursors. We hypothesize
that simple cobaloxime complexes can serve as nucleophilic photocatalysts for the visible-light-generation of
carbon-centered radicals from non-traditional electrophilic precursors including haloforms, electron-deficient
alkenes, iminium ions, vinyl halides and triflates, and primary alcohols. Cobaloximes are among the strongest
nucleophiles known when in the Co(I) oxidation state and can undergo classical substitution reactions with
electrophiles. The resulting alkyl–cobaloximes can undergo facile homolytic cleavage when irradiated with visible
light to generate carbon-centered radicals. This work will advance our understanding of the reactivity of these
cobaloxime complexes, allowing for the development of more efficient catalytic processes that can access new
classes of radical precursors, enabling new bond disconnection strategies for organic synthesis.
To further advance the field of radical chemistry, general approaches that serve to generate radicals directly
from readily available alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds which circumvent the use of tin hydrides and ground
state metal reductants would be of great value. We hypothesize that organic single-electron photoreductants can
serve as a general platform for visible-light-mediated radical generation directly from unactivated precursors.
Our approach will be enabled by two distinct strategies: namely, halogen-bonding photocatalysis and 1,4-
dihydropyridine (DHP) anion photoreductants. For our halogen-bonding photocatalysis approach, our substituted
hydroquinone catalysts directly engage with carbon–halide bonds via a halogen-bonding interaction, leading to
a catalytically generated electron donor-acceptor complex that can be activated by visible-light irradiation. This
work is expected to lead to a general strategy for radical generation from a broad range of alkyl halide precursors,
yielding methods that have unprecedented functional group tolerance. For our second approach, we hypothesize
that simple 1,4-DHPs in the presence of a suitable base can serve as potent excited state reductants. Our work
on 1,4-DHP anions will lead to a mild and operationally simple method for ketyl radical formation, which has
been shown to be valuable synthetic intermediates in the synthesis of complex, highly functionalized compounds."

ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core of this U19 Center will be responsible for coordinating all activities associated
with the CW2IP2. This will include the scheduling of the biweekly calls of the Center Executive Steering
Committee and other Center participants. The Administrative Core will also organize the annual meeting
of the External Liaison Committee and participate in the monthly meetings of the NINDS Proteinopathy
Imaging Consortium. The Administrative Core will provide the oversight needed to direct the efficient
operation of the CW2IP2 on a day-to-day basis, such as the shipment of research materials between the
different labs involved in the consortium, financial oversight of the U19 Center, and be responsible for
obtaining regulatory approval for the PET radiotracers chosen for translation for first-in-human studies.
The core will be directed by Robert H. Mach, Ph.D. the Director of this U19 Center application.
Given the collaborative interactions between the different groups of the Medicinal Chemistry and
Radiochemistry (MCRC) Core, and the interactions between the MCRC Core and Projects 1 and 2, we
found that the bi-weekly calls are essential in maintaining communication between the basic science
research labs of this U19 Center. Since the competing renewal of this U19 Center will feature a very
active translational imaging component, the Clinical Core will also provide an update on patient
recruitment and progress achieved at the different clinical imaging sites."
10940632,"MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY AND RADIOCHEMISTRY CORE
ABSTRACT
The Medicinal Chemistry and Radiochemistry (MCRC) Core is responsible for the development of radiotracers
for Projects 1 and 2 and the Clinical Core. The MCRC Core is composed of three sites: University of
Pennsylvania (Penn), Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). The
MCRC also benefits from a collaboration on structural biology through the NINDS U01/U19 Proteinopathy
consortium. The studies conducted during our first 4 years of U19 support have provided 18 putative alpha-
synuclein (Asyn) PET tracers and >10 putative 4R tau radiotracers. We will optimize candidate ligands to
develop: 1) disease-specific radiotracers for imaging Asyn in Parkinson’s disease (PD) or Multiple System
Atrophy (MSA), 2) pan-Asyn radiotracers for both PD and MSA, and 3) 4R tau selective radiotracers for
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
The MCRC Core will guide these efforts with a unique combination of 1) chemical biology approaches (photo-
crosslinking MS proteomics and fluorescent probes); 2) structural biology approaches (both solid state NMR and
cryo-electron microscopy); 3) computational modeling (ultra-high throughput screening, molecular dynamics,
and machine learning); and 4) extensive radiochemistry expertise. Chemical biology studies will take place at
Penn in conjunction with structural biology studies done through the U01/U19 Proteinopathy consortium to
determine high resolution structures of the candidate molecules bound to Asyn or tau fibrils, as well as the
selectivity determinants between binding sites. The resulting structural information will be used in computational
modeling and ultra-high throughput screening at Penn to guide the design of new leads. The Asyn compound
synthesis will take place at Penn and WUSTL. The tau lead compound synthesis will take place at Pitt in
collaboration with Penn. These leads will be tested in radioligand competition binding assays, and where
desirable, new radioligands will be synthesized for binding assays and animal experiments. The radiochemistry
studies will be done at Penn to support the rodent imaging studies in Project 1, WUSTL to support the radioligand
binding assays and nonhuman primate imaging studies in Project 1, and Pitt to support the radioligand binding
and non-human primate imaging studies conducted in Project 2. The chemical biology studies of the MCRC
Core, in combination with the structural biology done in collaboration with the U01/U19 Consortium, represents
a comprehensive approach for determining the molecular interactions of U19 radiotracers with Asyn and 4R tau
fibrils isolated from patient brain samples. This structural information will guide the in silico and SAR studies to
generate a suite of high affinity radiotracers that are specific for the different subtypes of the synucleinopathies
(PD and MSA) and 4R tauopathies (CBD, PSP, FTD), as well as radiotracers for pan-Asyn imaging studies in
both PD and MSA patients."
10940634,"PROJECT 1: Development of Alpha Synuclein PET Radioligands for Imaging Synucleinopathies
ABSTRACT
The goal of Project 1 is to conduct a series of in vitro binding studies, PET imaging studies, and autoradiography
studies in postmortem brain sections as a means of evaluating radiotracers for imaging aggregated alpha
synuclein (Asyn) in the synucleinopathies, Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and
multiple system atrophy (MSA). The compounds evaluated in this project will be identified via in silico ultrahigh
throughput screening and traditional structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies conducted in the Medicinal
Chemistry and Radiochemistry (MCRC) Core. The in vitro binding assays described in this project will consist
of three different types: 1) screening of “in silico hits” in Asyn fibrils using radioligands for the different binding
sites with the goal of identifying “compounds with an affinity of <10 nM; 2) in vitro binding assays of the fibril
confirmed hits to identify new lead compounds with an affinity for ASyn in PD and MSA tissue of <5 nM; and, 3)
measurement of off target binding to Aβ and tau. Compounds with a high affinity for Asyn and good selectivity
versus other proteinopathies (Aβ, tau and TDP43) will be advanced to a series of in vitro autoradiography and
in vivo studies as a means of identifying a suitable candidate(s) for translational imaging studies in humans.
Another function of Project 1 is to cross-validate potential PET radiotracers with a high affinity for 4R tau
developed by the MCRC Core and evaluated in Project 2. The successful accomplishment of the research
objectives of this U19 Center will require frequent communication between the members of the MCRC Core,
Project 1 and Project 2. This will be accomplished by through the series of bi-weekly teleconference calls and
meetings of the Center Steering Committee, MCRC Core members, and members of Projects 1 and 2 as outlined
in the Administrative Core. The ultimate goal of the research described in Project 1 is to provide 1-2 new PET
radiotracers/year for translational imaging studies described in the Clinical Core."
10938632,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Mammals have evolved an extensive nuclear network of DNA replication and repair proteins that are
tasked with amplifying and maintaining the fidelity of their genetic code. These signaling mechanisms are always
active, surveying the genome to maintain its integrity in the face of attack from external abiotic factors (such as
radiation and chemicals) and biotic factors (bacteria and viruses). To counter the sentinels of genome integrity,
viral pathogens have evolved strategies to usurp these host replication and repair proteins for their own benefit.
Viral strategies to hijack the nuclear compartment include: localizing to cellular sites of DNA damage, generating
additional DNA breaks on the host, amplifying the cellular DNA damage signals and tethering themselves extra-
chromosomally to DNA break sites to persist long-term. However, the mechanisms by which viruses carry out
these pathogenic activities remain largely unknown. Better mechanistic understanding of how viruses
dysregulate host DNA repair and replication pathways are essential for developing therapeutic interventions for
human health. The goal of this research program is to understand how genome stability is impacted by viral
pathogens by building on existing technologies to develop novel tools that will help us interrogate how replication
and repair proteins are usurped, modified and leveraged by DNA viruses. We propose to answer fundamental
questions about host genome stability that are utilized by viral pathogens for short-term and long-term benefit.
We will determine how cellular signals are modulated on a global scale by DNA viruses and how these signals
impact host replication proteins. We will then decipher how viruses utilize cellular signals to localize their proteins
and genomes to cellular DNA break sites. Lastly, we will interrogate how cellular proteins are used by viruses to
tether themselves in proximity to DNA break sites for long-term persistence. Not only are these fundamental
discoveries, they also have the potential to inform cancer therapies and human DNA repair in addition to
generating knowledge about viral life cycles. These basic studies on viruses and DNA damage will benefit a
diverse array of biologists who study viral signaling in the biosphere. These strong foundational methodologies
can be applied broadly to study all eukaryotic viruses as well as bacteriophages."
10904555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To make good decisions we mentally cast ourselves into the future to consider the identity and value of the
outcomes of our potential choices. This prospective consideration is facilitated by an encoded internal model (aka
cognitive map) of environmental associative relationships, e.g., between stimuli and the specific rewards they
predict. Such cue-reward learning enables one to contemplate potential forthcoming events and facilitates adaptive
decision making. While we know of brain regions that contribute, the pathways and circuits of cue-reward learning
and decision making are less explored. Given that substance use disorders are characterized by deficits in cue-
reward learning and decision making, this gap in knowledge limits clinical advance. The goal of this project is, thus,
to expose the neuronal pathways and circuit motifs that support the cue-reward learning and memory processes
that enable adaptive decision making.
 In the last funding period, we discovered the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a hub for the encoding and use of
the detailed, identity-specific cue-reward memories, i.e., cognitive map, that enable flexible decision making. The
BLA output pathways that subserve these functions are largely unknown. Our preliminary data suggest the BLA
may mediate cue-reward memory via projections to the lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) orbitofrontal cortex.
Activity in these projections is critical for using cue-reward memories to guide decision making, with the BLAlOFC
and BLAmOFC pathway needed for identity and value predictions, respectively. The information conveyed by
these pathways and whether they also support cue-reward learning is unknown. The BLA may also mediate cue-
reward learning and decision making via projections to the striatum, including the dorsomedial striatum (DMS),
nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell. Whereas DMS and NAc shell have been implicated in choices based on
predicted reward identity, NAc core has been implicated decisions based on predicted value. Little is known about
how these functions are achieved. Our general working hypothesis is that BLA projections to lOFC, NAc shell, and
DMS contribute to encoding and using identity-specific cue-reward memories to enable adaptive decisions,
whereas BLA projections to mOFC and NAc core contribute to aspects of cue-reward memory that enable
decisions to adapt based on predicted reward value. We will test this hypothesis using a suite of modern systems
neuroscience tools including pathway-specific, optogenetic neuronal activity monitoring and bidirectional
manipulation coupled with precision behavioral assessments of cue-reward learning and its influence on decision
making with outcome-specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and devaluation tests. We will expose critical
functions of 5 BLA output pathways, fill important gaps in knowledge of the neuronal pathways that support cue-
reward learning and decision making, and reveal an appetitive learning and decision-making circuit motif. This
project will also enable future work on the learning and decision deficits that characterize addiction."

CSU is an urban university with a vision to be “a student-focused center of scholarly excellence that provides
an accessible, engaged and exceptional education to all”. Of CSU’s undergraduates, 39.6% are Pell eligible,
with 22% under-represented minorities (URM). CSU serves the most diverse student body of any non-
historically black university in Ohio. Cleveland, with its abundance of biomedical and academic health
institutions along the Health-Tech Corridor, is an attractive destination for students interested in STEM and
healthcare. Within this healthcare landscape, CSU’s partnership with LRI provides a rich training environment:
with LRI’s exceptional NIH-funded cardiovascular research and strong mentoring history, complemented by
centers of excellence at CSU, such as GRHD, the Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, and
CHMS, the Center for Human Machine Systems. CD-Cavs will expand upon this robust partnership with LRI by
bringing under its umbrella, the 3 joint CSU:LRI Ph.D. programs: Regulatory Biology, Clinical and Bioanalytical
Chemistry, in the College of Sciences and Health Professions, (COSHP) and Applied Biomedical Engineering
in the Washkewicz College of Engineering (WCOE). Underrepresented students, exclusively, will be recruited
through TRIO McNair Scholar programs, through joint marketing with LRI at national conferences, such as
Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), and through CSU student
organizations such as Scientista, National Society of Black Engineers, and Society of Women Engineers.
Nineteen faculty from CSU, plus 18 from LRI will serve as mentors, with each CD-Cavs trainee supported by
one CSU and one LRI mentor. CD-Cavs will be the first T32 Training Program in Cleveland devoted
exclusively to support of under-represented pre-doctoral students. We request support for 5 pre-doctoral
students in each of the 5 years of CD-Cavs funding, to be supported for 2-2.5 years subsequent to passing
their candidacy exam.The breadth of research training encompasses translational control of gene expression,
susceptibility genes in complex diseases, aging and the circadian clock, blood coagulation disorders,
inflammatory mechanisms in atherosclerosis and asthma, pulmonary hypertension, human-robot systems in
rehabilitation, 3D-bioprinting on micro-pillar chips, remote patient monitoring, and tissue matrix engineering.
This unique cross-disciplinary training will be enriched by a clinical immersion experience at the Cleveland
Clinic, by Student-Mentor Discussion Groups, a Cardiovascular Sciences Seminar series, Cardiology Grand
Rounds, plus multiple support mechanisms from CSU’s Graduate Student Resource Center.

glycoprotein following the engagement of CD4 and coreceptors (CCR5 or CXCR4). At least two host factors,
SERINC5 (serine incorporator 5) and IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) protein families, are known to
incorporate into HIV-1 particles and reduce their infectivity by inhibiting the virus-cell fusion. The mechanisms by
which these restriction factors inhibit viral fusion are poorly understood. The main difference in the antiviral
activity of these two proteins is the range of restricted viruses. Whereas IFITMs inhibit fusion of many unrelated
viruses, SERINC5 is only reported to interfere with retroviral fusion. However, SERINC5 and IFITMs also share
striking similarities, including the ability to reduce HIV-1 fusion when expressed in target cells and the varied
resistance of HIV-1 strains to these factors that maps to the gp120 variable loop 3. The most accepted model of
IFITM-mediated inhibition of fusion, which is supported by our pilot results, is through increasing the membrane
stiffness and curvature. Based on the above similarities, the lack of strong evidence for Env-SERINC5 binding

SERINC5 and IFITMs inhibit HIV-1 fusion by a similar indirect mechanism that involves altering the properties of
viral membrane. To test this hypothesis, we will imlpement several cutting-edge techniques to assess the
membrane protein and lipid distributions and dynamics on single HIV-1 particles. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will
identify SERINC5-resistant Env mutants by deep mutational scanning and characterize these mutants using flow
virometry, super-resolution microscopy and correlative cryo-EM. Aim 2 will focus on delineating the effects of
SERINC5 on the lipid order and mobility in the viral membrane. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether, like
SERINC5, IFITMs alter the architecture and/or dynamics of the HIV-1 membrane. Finally, Aim 4 will test the
hypothesis that plasma membrane tension increases, which are mediated by Env-receptor/coreceptor signaling,
drive the late stages of HIV-1 fusion at the cell surface and that SERINC5 may inhibit HIV-1 fusion by attenuating
these cellular responses. Completion of the proposed Specific Aims will elucidate the mechanism(s) of HIV-1
restriction by unrelated host factors. If these factors inhibit viral fusion through a conserved indirect mechanism

10906810,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Viral infection is a common cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, the underlying mechanism is
poorly understood. For most viruses, it is unclear whether SNHL is caused by direct viral infection of inner ear
tissue or by a secondary effect through an immune response, or a combination of both. Antiviral drugs and
steroids only improve the outcome for a small group of patients. It is therefore imperative to understand the
molecular etiology of virus-induced SNHL for the development of effective preventions and treatments. The
research proposes a systemic evaluation of viral effects on the inner ear using mumps virus (MuV), a human
virus that causes SNHL after birth (acquired SNHL), and murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) to understand human
CMV disease that causes SNHL during embryonic development (congenital SNHL). There is no small animal
model to assess SNHL caused by MuV. In Aim1, it is proposed to establish novel in vivo mouse models to
assess how mCMV and MuV infections affect inner ear cells. Infection will be done locally and controlled via the
posterior semicircular canal. The onset and extent of hearing loss will be measured by auditory brainstem
response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Histochemistry will quantify apoptotic cells, virus-infected
cells, and immune cells in defined anatomical locations of the cochlea from apex to base.
Because the model is
expected to be highly controllable, it will be optimized so that the detrimental mechanisms of different viruses
can be compared to advance the mechanistic understanding of virus-induced SNHL. Aim2 focuses on
understanding the etiology of the tissue damage -direct viral infection or immune response- in mCMV- and MuV-
administrated cochleae, and to analyze the mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level. Susceptible cell
subtypes will be quantified in P2 and P21 mice injected with mCMV and MuV before and after the onset of
hearing loss by using known and recently identified markers. These include new pericochlear cell subtypes in
the neonatal cochlea that were recently reported by the principal investigator (PI), as well as the new subtypes
of type I spiral ganglion cells. The expression of a ganglioside called GM2, a MuV receptor which the PI identified
in a previous study, and various viral host factors will be also quantified in each cochlear cell subtype to
understand their correlation with cellular damage. Further, the types and numbers of infiltrating immune cells
post PSC injection of mCMV and MuV in P2 and P21 mice will be assessed with flow cytometric analysis with
cell type-specific markers. Together, completion of these aims will provide essential details of the mechanism of
SNHL caused by mCMV and MuV, and will establish a protocol that can be applied to other hearing loss-causing
viruses such as Lassa virus, which is not suitable for animal model development because of its high biosafety
level. The PI envisions this project as the first step of her future research journey as a clinician-scientist with a
focus on prevention and treatment of viral-induced SNHL."
10906811,"Neuroinflammation has emerged as a critical feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis
and alcohol-related brain damage. Previous studies, including our own, have shown that innate
immune signaling pathways particularly NLRP3 inflammasome activation play an important role
both in AD and in alcohol-induced neuroinflammation. However, the influence of heavy alcohol
use on AD remains largely unknown. The focus of our research is to evaluate the effect of
excessive alcohol consumption on the development and progression of AD and identify critical
molecular pathways that may provide therapeutic targets. Activation of the multiprotein complex,
inflammasome, by PAMPs or DAMPs involves two signals: first, TLR-mediated activation that
increases pro-IL-1ß and second, NLRP-mediated inflammasome assembly and caspase-1
activation that cleaves pro- IL-1ß to mature IL-1ß. We previously showed increased IL-1ß
production as a result of NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and caspase-1 activation in the brain after
chronic alcohol feeding. In the APP/PS1 and Tau22 mouse models of AD, caspase-1 activity and
IL-1ß production is dependent on NLRP3 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation drives Aß and tau
pathology. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that chronic alcohol exposure
accelerates and exacerbates AD features. We postulate that chronic alcohol-induced
NLRP3/ASC inflammasome activation contributes to the development and progression of AD via
amplified neuroinflammation. The aims of this study are 1. To characterize the effect of long-term
and excessive alcohol consumption on AD features using APP/PS1 and Tau22 mice 2. To
delineate the role of NLRP3/ASC inflammasome components in alcohol-mediated
neuroinflammation in AD mice 3. To evaluate the contribution of IL-1 signaling pathway in
inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation in response to alcohol consumption in AD mice.
These experiments will provide novel insight on the role of alcohol-mediated inflammasome
activation in the development and progression of AD and evaluate preclinical interventions that
interrupt inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation by targeting key pathogenic pathways
discovered in this research."
10929280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Aging water infrastructure across the United States still contains significant amounts of components that
contain lead. There are many old service lines in use that are made of lead and other components, such as
elbows and solder, containing some lead that leeches into the drinking water. The negative health impacts of
lead are primarily attributed to chronic exposure to sources with undetected lead, which are particularly
troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children. Current lead testing methods are
either accurate, expensive, slow, and difficult; or low-cost, fast, easy to use, and notoriously inaccurate. The
frequency of current testing is inadequate. The regular use of the NanoAffix Science, LLC (NAFX) handheld lead
tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby
accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in those locations that are at the highest
risk.
 NAFX proposes to address the above unmet need by increasing access to quantitative water quality
monitoring with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld lead test kit for rapid detection of total lead in
drinking water. The handheld lead testing kit combines a novel proprietary sensor chip with nanoscale thin film
coatings in a proprietary test cell with a portable meter that communicates via Bluetooth with a smartphone app
for direct readout of testing results. The Phase II project successfully developed a minimum viable product that
has led to some initial sales orders by early adopters and potential business partners. A proprietary and novel
solution for dissolving particulate lead was developed and market research was conducted through a beta-testing
program using prototype devices. NAFX successfully transitioned from lab scale production to pilot scale
production.
 As part of the commercial readiness pilot (CRP) program, NAFX will scale up manufacturing beyond pilot
scale, conduct additional product development based on the feedback received from initial customers and the
field validation conducted as part of the beta-testing program. Product and method certifications will be obtained
to ensure that customers who test for regulatory compliance purposes are able to use the NAFX product. Scaling
up manufacturing will lead to reduced variability, reduced costs, and the ability of NAFX to fulfill larger orders.
NAFX will continue to engage in market planning and research to better understand our current target markets
and to learn of new target markets."
10905755,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a significant global health problem with high mortality
rates. HPV-negative HNSCC patients undergo morbid treatments combining surgery, radiation, chemotherapy
and molecularly targeted therapy, but the 5-year survival rate is low (63-68%) and even lower (<50%) for locally
advanced disease, and has remained unchanged during the last four decades. Indeed, although
immunotherapies have revolutionized the landscape of treatment options, <20% of HNSCC patients respond to
immune check point blockade (ICB); thus new therapeutic options to prevent and treat HNSCC are urgently
needed. A major reason for the poor response rate to ICB therapy is that HNSCC tumors deploy multiple
mechanisms that culminate in a highly immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) deficient in cytotoxic
and antigen presenting immune cells that are required for tumor elimination and ICB treatment efficacy.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that intratumoral priming with chemokines that recruit and activate cytotoxic CD8 T
and NK cells, and antigen presenting conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), will dramatically improve ICB treatment
responses and patient outcomes. We also hypothesize that activation of their inhibitory Gαi-coupled chemokine
receptors will counter stimulatory G protein (Gαs) signaling mechanisms that lead to T cell exhaustion and cDC
dysfunction. In this proposal we will employ novel syngeneic mouse models of HNSCC that closely mimic the
human tobacco-associated disease to investigate the anti-tumoral efficacy of two chemokines: (i) CXCL10, a
chemokine that recruits and activates cytotoxic CD8 T and NK cells through the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and
(ii) XCL1 which recruits and activates conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) through the receptor XCR1. These
chemokines will be investigated as single agent treatments (Aim 1 and 2) and as priming agents, individually
and combined with anti-PD-1. In addition to the effect of these treatments on tumor growth, the abundance and
phenotype (e.g. pro- or anti-tumoral properties, activation or dysfunction) of the TME immune infiltrate will be
determined using state-of-the-art quantitative profiling methods and functional assays. Intratumoral location,
spatial distribution, clustering and trafficking of cells between tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes will also
be determined. Although a major focus will be on cells directly affected by CXCL10 and XCL1, the extent to
which these chemokines broadly reprogram the TME as a consequence of interconnected signaling networks
and cell-cell communication will also be explored. Our overall premise is that the chemokine system can be
harnessed to override immune suppressive mechanisms deployed by cancer cells, thereby potentiating ICB
responses. This premise is supported by strong preliminary data in all three Aims. Our ultimate goal is to provide
viable treatment options for HNSCC patients by exploiting chemokine priming to dramatically enhance the
efficacy of existing ICB treatments, and to understand the underlying mechanisms for their success."

10909126,"Abstract
Electrotransfer (ET) or electroporation has been widely used to deliver molecular cargo into cells for genome
and epigenome editing, cell engineering, and DNA vaccination in treatment and prevention of diseases (e.g., the
COVID-19 pandemic). To enhance ET efficiency, different chemicals have been combined with electric pulses
in treatment of cells. However, a challenge with this strategy is how to screen for chemicals. In most studies, the
screening process is accomplished empirically in vitro, but this approach is impractical or prohibitive in vivo.
Furthermore, a chemical treatment that works well for ET in cultured cells may not necessarily work for ET in the
body. To this end, the proposed study will explore a new approach to chemical screening. Since mechanisms
governing molecular transport are conserved across different cells and tissues, can chemical treatments that
assist DNA transport be used to ubiquitously improve ET in vitro and in vivo?
To answer this question, the Yuan lab will build upon their previous successes to deepen the understanding of
transport mechanisms. One area of focus is to investigate cytoplasmic transport. Specifically, the study will
determine mechanisms of vesicular transport and the escape of DNA from vesicles prior to nuclear entry. The
second area of focus is to investigate the nuclear entry of DNA in non-dividing cells. The study will address key
questions such as: How does DNA travel through the nuclear pore complex? How does the transport depend on
the size and structures of DNA? How does the amount of nuclear localization signal or DNA nuclear targeting
sequence per DNA molecule influence the transport? In addition to the mechanistic studies, the Yuan lab will
develop new techniques to screen for nontoxic compounds and nanoparticles that can be used to improve
cytoplasmic transport and nuclear entry. The third area of focus is to explore different combinations of strategies
to simultaneously improve intracellular and extracellular transport of DNA in tissues. The study will demonstrate
that the combination can synergistically enhance ET efficiency and prolong the transgene expression in vivo.
The Yuan lab has extensive experiences in the analysis of molecular transport in cells and tissues, especially in
the context of ET research. This R35 will give the lab the flexibility and power to advance the understanding of
transport mechanisms, and open new avenues for research and applications. Findings from the studies
mentioned above will lead to the development of common strategies to enhance DNA transport that in turn will
improve ET in vitro and in vivo."
10909248,"Project Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR), which codes for an ion channel that transports Cl- ions. CF affects many organs but lung failure
caused by repeated respiratory infections is the leading cause of death. When CF was first described, most
patients died as children. Therapeutic interventions that do not restore CFTR function still enabled patients to
survive into adulthood. Recently developed small molecule modulators restore CFTR function modestly and
have been shown to reduce pulmonary exacerbations. However, these therapies are expensive, have side-
effects and cannot treat all CF patients. As a monogenic disease, CF has been the target of several in vivo gene
therapy studies that aimed to restore CFTR function. However, these studies were unsuccessful due to
challenges in delivery and immunity mediated against viral vectors. Ex-vivo gene therapy in which corrected
airway stem cells are transplanted into patients have been proposed. However, these are limited by our failure
to efficiently correct CFTR mutations in a readily accessible airway stem cell type. W e have identified the sinuses
as a readily accessible source of sinus basal stem cells and optimized the use of Cas9 and adeno-associated
virus (AAV) to gene edit these basal stem cells. We have corrected the most common CFTR mutation (F508del
mutation) in >40% alleles. However, several other mutations which cannot be treated using current therapies
remain. Moreover, the safety of gene editing using Cas9 and the long-term differentiation potential of edited
sinus basal stem cells to regenerate the sinus and bronchial epithelia need to be characterized. Here, we propose
to use Cas9/AAV to insert the CFTR cDNA with a truncated CD19 (tCD19) enrichment marker at exon 1 of the
endogenous CFTR locus to achieve universal correction of CFTR mutations. We will characterize the safety of
genome editing using next-generation sequencing and the differentiation potential of edited sinus basal stem
cells using single-cell RNA seq and immunohistochemistry. Preliminary results show that we can obtain an
enriched population of tCD19+ sinus basal stem cells after gene editing. These corrected sinus basal stem cells
retain their differentiation potential to produce epithelial sheets that show >90% CFTR function (response to
CFTR inhibitor or activator) relative to wild-type samples in an Ussing chamber electrophysiological assay.
However, further work is needed to determine if the corrected sinus basal stem cells generate all the other airway
cell types. Over the period of this grant, we will further validate the safety and efficacy of this platform and
evaluate the long-term differentiation potential of these cells to generate all the cell types present in both the
sinus and bronchial epithelia. These experiments are an important first step to optimize the autologous
transplantation of edited airway stem cells to treat CF. The knowledge developed in this process can be applied
to other airway diseases in the future."
10909249,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading public health crisis in the United States. Individuals with opioid use
disorder frequently use other substances, including cocaine. Past year opioid withdrawal was associated with 4
times greater odds of current cocaine use, which may represent an attempt to ameliorate opioid withdrawal
effects but also increases overdose risk, as evidenced by preclinical and clinical findings. Approved OUD
pharmacotherapies are modestly effective, but these medications are not indicated for treating cocaine co-use,
highlighting the need for a novel intervention approach to improve outcomes in co-morbid OUD and cocaine use
disorder. Mechanistically, drug-motivated behaviors are regulated by glutamate signaling within corticostriatal
circuitry. Both opioid and cocaine self-administration (SA) down-regulate the glial glutamate transporter (GLT-
1), and alter synaptic plasticity measured as changes in dendritic spines and AMPA-to-NMDA current ratios
(A/N) within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Thus, glutamatergic plasticity is a conserved neural
mechanism underlying drug motivation in both opioid and cocaine use. The combined effects of opioid and
cocaine co-use on glutamatergic systems, however, are unknown. n-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown
translational promise for treating multiple drug use disorders, including cocaine and opioids. NAC is capable of
restoring glutamatergic alterations induced by either drug alone, likely by increasing glutamate clearance from
the synapse following drug use through upregulation of GLT-1. Clinically, we have shown that NAC reduces the
incentive salience of cocaine-related stimuli, which controls drug seeking. As well, others have shown that NAC
normalizes glutamate function in cocaine-dependent individuals. Whether NAC reduces drug intake and reverses
glutamatergic alterations induced by co-use of opioids and cocaine is unknown. The work proposed here will
begin to fill those crucial knowledge gaps. Our overarching hypotheses are that (1) persistent brain glutamate
changes induced by chronic opioid use will exacerbate use of cocaine during opioid physical dependence and
withdrawal and (2) that NAC will ameliorate glutamatergic dysregulation, and thus will reduce both oxycodone
and cocaine use. We propose a two phase, translational project supported by the R21/R33 mechanism. In the
first phase (R21), we will characterize NAcore glutamatergic signaling in opioid and cocaine co-use as a neural
biomarker for pharmacotherapeutic targeting with NAC using preclinical laboratory methods. Upon meeting the
milestones set forth for the R21, we will conduct the second phase (R33), in which we will determine the influence
of NAC on glutamate function and reinforcing effects of cocaine in co-morbid opioid and cocaine use disorder
using human laboratory methods. The milestones completed during this translational project will elucidate
glutamatergic dysregulation underlying opioid and cocaine co-use, laying the groundwork for effective
pharmacotherapeutic treatment for this pattern of polysubstance abuse through targeting glutamate signaling."
10910012,"ABSTRACT
 The misuse of ionizing radiation or nuclear devices as weapons of terrorism has been recognized as a
major U.S. public health threat. The greatest risk to these victims of radiation exposure is the hematopoietic
acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS), which results in life-threatening complications such as infections and
refractory bleeding. Specific therapies directed at H-ARS to accelerate hematopoietic regeneration following
radiation injury have been few. Since marrow endothelial cells can govern hematologic recovery after
irradiation without homing to the bone marrow, endothelial cells can mediate their radioprotective effects
through elaboration of hematopoietic cytokines or soluble factors. Another mechanism of cellular
communication is through transfer of proteins and nucleic materials via secretion of extracellular vesicles
(EVs). EVs range in size from 100-250 nm and bear both nucleic acids and proteins that have potential to
regulate neighboring cells. We hypothesize that ECs exert their regenerative effects through EVs. We have
shown that treatment of irradiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with either syngeneic or allogeneic EVs
from genetically distinct mice results in comparable expansion of the stem cell pool, suggesting they could be
immunologically tolerant. Compared to control mice treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
it is possible that EVs are at least comparable and are likely superior to G-CSF for prolonging survival after
lethal-dose irradiation. Our overriding goal is to demonstrate the radiotherapeutic capacity of EVs. In doing so,
we will develop a cellular-based therapy for H-ARS with potential for off-the-shelf delivery to victims in the
setting of a mass casualty disaster."
10941362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human gut is a complex ecosystem, where trillions of microbes interact with dietary and host-derived
molecules, mediating biotransformations that significantly affect both the microbial community and their human
hosts. Central to this metabolic interplay are ene-reductases, a versatile class of oxidoreductases that facilitate
the reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Stool metabolomics data implicates the existence
of numerous unidentified ene-reductases, constituting a gap in our understanding of gut microbial metabolism.
While these enzymes are pivotal in modulating metabolite bioavailability, impacting both microbial physiology
and human health, most remain unidentified. This research proposal aims to systematically characterize novel
gut microbial ene-reductases based on the hypothesis that these enzymes play a critical role in shaping the
chemical milieu of the gut. To achieve this goal, we will develop a platform that fuses microbiology, biochemistry,
and bioinformatics in a four-stage strategy to systematically identify and characterize gut microbial ene-
reductases responsible for the reduction of a target metabolite. First, we will identify microbial strains capable of
metabolite reduction. Second, we will identify candidate reductase genes through comparative genomics and
RNA-seq. Third, we will experimentally validate the candidate enzymes for their reductase activity. Fourth,
studies will be performed to understand the mechanistic basis of the novel enzymes. Through this research, we
aim to deepen our understanding of the chemical dialogues occurring between gut microbes and their host.
Specifically, the study will illuminate the roles that ene-reductases play in performing consequential
biotransformations and shaping microbiome community structure. While this proposal focuses on fundamental
characterization of key gut microbial enzymes, it lays the groundwork for translational advancement by
uncovering metabolic mechanisms that will ultimately facilitate precise, personalized microbiome modulation."
10920403,"ABSTRACT: Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is a debilitating problem that afflicts 15-20% of reproductive age
women.1 The significant suffering it causes leads to multiple surgeries and long-term medical therapies at a
cost of at least $2.8 billion annually, and many women undergo hysterectomy with consequential fertility
implications in hopes of pain resolution.1 Pain and suffering often persist despite treatment, and lead to
decreased productivity and reduced quality of life.2,3 The limitations of current surgical and pharmacologic
treatments for CPP have been well documented.
One of the most significant clinical challenges in CPP is predicting which treatment is likely to be effective for
an individual patient, due in large part to the heterogeneity of CPP. Management of other chronic conditions
has improved with development of clinical phenotypes, which help clinicians more quickly match patients with
effective treatments. However, clinical phenotypes have not yet been extensively explored in CPP.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), acupressure, and physical activity interventions have been shown to be
effective in a wide range of chronic pain conditions.4-6 Among patients with CPP, several small studies have
demonstrated efficacy of CBT, acupressure, and physical activity interventions.7-12 Effect sizes of individual
non-pharmacologic interventions are typically small (0.15-0.3).13-15 However, interventions that integrate
several of these modalities appear to have substantially improved efficacy (0.3-0.8),16-19 indicating possible
synergistic rather than additive effects. Web-based self-management programs help to reduce barriers to
access and many have been shown to be as effective as traditional face-to-face interventions.9,20,21 Our project
will build upon Fibroguide, a successful web-based cognitive/behaviorally-focused self-management program
for fibromyalgia. Patients with fibromyalgia demonstrated improvements in pain (0.64) and physical function
(0.38) utilizing Fibroguide compared to usual care.20
We propose to develop a web-based, self-management program for patients with CPP and to conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial to evaluate preliminary effectiveness of the intervention and phenotypic factors that
predict positive response. Our overall hypothesis is patients with CPP will find a web-based self-management
program to be a valuable treatment strategy, and that patients who participate in this program will demonstrate
improvements in pain, physical function, and quality of life with this integrative self-management approach.
This project will generate preliminary data to support an R01 application to perform an RCT efficacy trial with a
focus on patient phenotyping and will ensure that the candidate has the skills to conduct independent research
in development and evaluation of personalized therapies for CPP."

Broad Objectives: The Knox Scholars Data Science Research Program will work to promote the
power of young people, especially Black and Latinx youth, to diversify the science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Participants will be Boston area high school students who are
underrepresented in STEM fields (Black and Latinx youth, first-generation college students, low-income
students). Combining paid data science internship opportunities, college access and persistence,
career readiness supported by professional mentorship, and social-emotional learning programming will
enable youth to access the financial stability associated with a booming STEM industry without leaving
the city where they grew up, while also supporting local industry with a more diverse and well-prepared
applicant pool.
Specific Aims: The Knox Scholars Data Science Research Program will reach 150 Boston-area high
school students typically underrepresented in STEM fields over five years to increase: (1) Knowledge
and skills of data science through programming over two years; (2) Career readiness in data science
through mentorships for each participant with a data science professional, data science career
exploration events, and career readiness workshops; (3) College access and persistence through
college visits, college readiness workshops, and individualized college application, financial aid, and
scholarship application support; and, (4) Youth leadership supported through social emotional learning
programming and opportunities such as a Youth Leadership Team and youth-led workshops.
Design and Methods: This two-year program will consist of: (1) two paid data science internships, the
first summer focused on training and the second summer focused on applied skills; (2) college access
and persistence programming; (3) career readiness supported by mentorship; and, (4) social-emotional
learning programming for a total of 150 Boston-area high school students underrepresented in STEM
careers. Each summer 30 youth (24 of whom will be paid through this grant) will begin the program with
a five-week paid data science training internship at MIT. Youth will learn quantitative methods, data
analysis and coding alongside basic wet lab skills to better prepare them for internships and careers in
data science fields. In addition, youth will gain skills critical to success such as time management,
proactive communication, networking, and public speaking. These 150 youth will be part of a larger
program called the LEAH Project that will place a total of 500 Boston-area high school youth in paid
STEM internships during the grant period."

The centerpiece of the MATCHES Center is a pragmatic trial, MATCH-UP (MAking Telehealth-delivery of
Cancer Care at Home—Upscaled Services Protocol), which we will conduct across MSK’s network of
outpatient practices. MATCH-UP will be a Type I hybrid implementation-effectiveness study with a two-arm
cluster-randomized design across eight clusters. It will assess a multi-component intervention, MSK@Home,
which supports the ability of patients receiving select therapies to receive routine oncology care at home via
telehealth and a suite of enabling strategies. MSK@Home includes capacity for at-home phlebotomy, vital
signs, and treatment administration or supervision by nurses. The motivation for MSK@Home stems from the
COVID-19 pandemic: although telehealth was feasible under emergency conditions, patients were still required
to visit the clinic for labwork or to receive therapy. To make care delivery more efficient and convenient for
patients, experts in oncology, clinical trials, informatics, health system transformation, and data science have
joined forces to develop the expanded telehealth model, MSK@Home. This intervention includes telehealth
training and, to avoid deepening the digital divide, support for web and hardware access for patients lacking
these resources. Seven outpatient clinic sites in MSK’s network will make up eight clusters to be randomized to
MSK@Home or to usual care for breast and prostate cancers. A minimum of 400 patients per cluster, for a
total of 3200 patients split between breast and prostate cancer, will power us to detect meaningful effects in the
primary outcome (proportion of visits at home) as well as an array of secondary outcomes. This three-year
trial’s effectiveness outcomes span multiple dimensions of care quality: efficiency, safety, timeliness, equity,
and the patient and clinician experience. Implementation outcomes include feasibility, acceptability,
appropriateness, and sustainability from the diverse perspectives. The Research & Methods Core will integrate
the multiple data streams from synchronous and asynchronous encounters and patient and clinician surveys,
enabling analysis and interpretation of the data and building the evidence base for telehealth-delivery in routine
cancer care. MATCH-UP’s specific aims are: Aim 1: to determine if MSK@Home is efficient, reducing the need
for in-person visits by at least 20%; Aim 2: to assess whether MSK@Home improves the patient experience;
Aim 3: to determine if MSK@Home is non-inferior to usual care based on clinicians’ experiences and
perceptions of quality; Aim 4: to characterize the barriers and facilitators to implementation of telehealth in
oncology. Eligible patients will be prostate and breast cancer patients treated at MSK with non-intravenous
therapy. This includes many of the most commonly administered therapies such as GnRH agonists, hormonal
therapies, capecitabine, and the PARP inhibitors; therefore, the results of this pragmatic study are expected to
be broadly generalizable for these two common malignancies and could transform how thousands of patients
each year in the U.S., and many more worldwide, receive their care."
10907487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The setting of this training activity within the Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE)
between the University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is unique in its
ethnic diversity and its distant location. Pacific Islanders are extremely underrepresented in the nation’s
biomedical workforce, which limits progress in research and prevention of cancer health disparities. PIPCHE
addresses training Pacific Islander cancer researchers in the context of the vast diversity and geography of the
region. The impact of the two previous cycles is remarkable. Without a cancer center in Guam, young
researchers and students had no opportunity to be involved in cancer research despite the high incidence of
many cancers. During the past 10 years, an infrastructure for research training in Guam and Micronesia has
been built; many UOG faculty members are collaborating in cancer research with UHCC. Since the initiation of
PIPCHE, two previous trainees moved into faculty positions at UOG, two graduates supported in cycle one are
now in faculty positions on the US mainland, and one trainee is now employed at the National Institute of
Minority Health Disparities. To date, ten trainees have entered doctoral programs in different locations. Of the
45 PIPCHE research assistants, at least nine went on graduate and professional degree programs. This
Research Education Core (REC) will continue the successful path with three specific aims: 1) Provide
guidance, support and opportunities to acquire research skills and experience to Pacific Islander students
pursuing a master’s degree with a focus on cancer-related health disparities in the Pacific Island region.
Students will be supported at UOG, or at UHCC in programs not offered at UOG, and mentored in a research
project under the supervision of one or more PIPCHE faculty. An expanded curriculum consisting of an online
course and a journal club will address critical current topics in cancer research. 2) Provide guidance, support
and opportunities to acquire research skills and experience for students interested in cancer health
disparities in the Pacific who are enrolled in a graduate degree program (master’s or doctoral). Students will
participate in biomedical, epidemiologic, psychosocial, and community-based research projects led by UHCC
faculty. 3) Support, guide and develop Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) to become independent investigators in
cancer health disparities with the help of a mentoring committee, an annual manuscript and grant writing
workshop, attendance at scientific meetings, and course releases. Important enhancements are incorporated
into the proposed program: increasing support from four to six UOG master’s students per year due to high
demand; novel online modules related to health disparities in the Pacific; extension of UHCC funding from
doctoral to master’s students; travel scholarships for trainees to attend scientific meetings; an annual intensive
writing workshop at UOG to improve output in published manuscripts and grant applications; implementation of
mentoring committees and funds to provide ESIs with protected time for grant and manuscript writing."
10907488,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of the Clinical Practice Network (CPN) of the MATCHES Telehealth Research Center is to
provide the environment for conducting and evaluating the Center’s investigations of telehealth-supported
cancer care. MSK’s New York City locations and six regional care sites will constitute the CPN. MSK is a high-
volume cancer center with a robust infrastructure for delivering telehealth via both synchronous and
asynchronous technologies. As such, the CPN also will serve as the Center’s practice innovation and digital
innovation hub for implementing and evaluating telehealth, as well as nimbly translating the generated
evidence back into clinical practice. The CPN will convene patients, clinicians, staff, and scientists to test and
refine equitable telehealth solutions, and novel computational and hybrid practice models, all based on
principles of user-centered design. The CPN’s specific aims are 1) to develop and equitably deploy enhanced
telehealth tools, 2) to develop and deploy MSK@Home telehealth-supported services in the context of the
Center’s Pragmatic Trial, 3) to identify and implement sustainable methods of patient and clinician engagement
to refine telehealth-enabled interventions, and 4) to test and refine novel computational, operational, and
staffing models for the delivery of telehealth-supported cancer care at home.
Led by Peter D. Stetson, MD, MA, with Co-Directors Diane Reidy-Lagunes, MD, and Gilad J. Kuperman, MD,
PhD, and support from a multidisciplinary leadership team from across MSK, the CPN will act as the effector
arm and feedback sensor for implementing the MSK@Home
intervention to be evaluated via our Pragmatic
Trial and will perform similar functions across the planned pilot studies.
It will orchestrate the deployment of
telehealth solutions across the study sites, as well as coordinate data collection and management for the study
interventions. The CPN team will establish and monitor the experience of patients, clinicians, and front-line
staff through regular review of key success metrics with the Administrative Core’s Patient Engagement Unit
and Clinician & Staff Engagement Unit. The CPN team will develop and deploy a novel, standardized common
data model for telehealth and patient-generated health data. They will extract, aggregate, and deliver
multimodal data insights from the telehealth platform and additional key systems for operational leadership in
the CPN to adjust to conditions on the ground, as well as for the data scientists in the Research & Methods
Core to develop new digital biomarkers and computational models. The CPN team will manage the process to
adjust implementation of the study interventions as a result of change in regulatory and financial requirements
and as cancer centers evolve best evidence in the use of telehealth. In collaboration with the Office of Diversity
Programs, the CPN will develop proactive monitoring tools, visualizations, and recovery mechanisms to ensure
telehealth technology reduces rather than exacerbates the digital divide and other barriers to high-quality
healthcare, with a particular focus on at-risk patients."
10907490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In Hawai‘i and Guam, Pacific Island Populations represent a highly underserved minority with
disproportionately high rates of lung, cervical, colorectal, liver, and oral cancers compared to other ethnic
populations in the US. Limited knowledge of cancer prevention, low rates of cancer screening, and unique high
risk behaviors such as tobacco and areca nut use contribute to the cancer health disparities found among
Pacific Island Populations. Also, Pacific Island Populations are highly underrepresented among cancer
researchers and cancer health care professionals. Culturally-grounded approaches to achieve parity in cancer
control are sorely needed, which is a focus of the Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity’s
(PIPCHE) Community Outreach Core. The objectives of the Community Outreach Core are to include Pacific
Island Populations’ community perspectives to assist and promote the research of the Partnership, build the
competencies of healthcare providers serving Pacific Island Populations, and help train new cadres of cancer
researchers and care providers from Pacific Island Populations. The Aims of Community Outreach Core are
to: 1) Provide an essential resource to PIPCHE research projects and to the Partnership overall, 2) Implement
evidence-based cancer prevention outreach, resources, and promotion of PIPCHE research, and 3) Assess
the Partnership’s capacity to design and implement culturally relevant research in Hawai‘i and Guam.
Achievement of these Aims is expected to lead to sustainable programs that seek to better understand,
address, and reduce cancer disparities and underrepresentation of cancer researchers in Hawai‘i and Guam’s
Pacific Island Populations. The long-term goal of the Community Outreach Core is to reduce barriers leading to
cancer disparities in Guam and Hawai‘i among Pacific Island Populations."
10907491,"Summary
The primary goal of the Administrative Core is to ensure productivity of the Program by promoting coherence
and synergy as well as intellectual and resource sharing, among the PIs and their lab members in order to ensure
that the outcome and value of the research performed in each Project is greater than the sum of its parts. This
Core will facilitate and coordinate the following activities that are essential for the success of the entire Program:
research planning and scientific review, monitoring progress relative the proposed Program goals, data
exchange, reagent and animal/tissue sharing, travel to annual Program meetings and between PI labs, and
reporting and fiscal oversight. Thus, Core A will provide the structure and organization needed to maximize
interactions and collaboration among the PIs and lab members in each of the three Research Projects, Core B
and Core C, which will, in turn, facilitate accomplishment of Program goals.
 Based on past experience, we believe that the key to effective collaboration is direct personal interactions.
Three of the five labs are in the Austin area. Dr. Manley’s group is at the University of Georgia. Drs. Hale and
Sempowski are at Duke. As Drs. Manley and Richie know from working together for nearly 20 years, travel
between Athens and Austin is relatively inexpensive with multiple direct flights available on a daily basis.
Similarly, traveling from Raleigh/Durham to Austin is straightforward. Personnel travel between labs facilitates
achieving scientific objectives, and is in some cases necessary for the proposed experiments. Lab member
exchange is the most effective mechanism for transfer of techniques between labs. All three Research Projects
will exchange lab members to achieve specific scientific goals. Travel to annual Program lab summits and
scientific meetings provides for efficient communication of results to each other and to the scientific community,
and affords the ability to learn new approaches and gain information to shape future work. Also, this is an efficient
and effective way for all lab members to meet and discuss data together. While face-to-face meetings are an
invaluable method of communication, in a geographically distributed collaboration they are of necessity limited
in scope. We are already engaged in and will continue web-based conferencing that permits multi-site visual and
audio communication, and facilitates analyzing data and images collaboratively.
 General administrative functions will provide vital additional levels of cohesion and facilitate program
productivity. While most administrative assistant related support will continue to be supplied by the home
institutions of each PI, Core A will perform any such services requiring coordination between the Research
Projects and Cores."
10907494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled quantification of underlying
heterogeneity within cell populations through identifying gene expression signatures of individual cells to reveal
transcriptionally distinct cellular subsets. In addition, scRNA-seq combined with appropriate bioinformatics
analyses enable modeling of developmental lineage hierarchies and discovery of rare cell types that would be
otherwise masked in bulk RNA-seq data. Comprehensive and systematic analysis of both scRNA-seq and bulk
RNA-seq data is critical to the success of the Research Projects (RPs) in this Program. The Bioinformatics and
Biostatistics Core (Core B) has been designed to meet this need. The Core B leader (Dr. Stephen Yi) has over
10 years of experience in research and teaching in bioinformatics and biostatistics, especially in gene expression
analysis, resulting in more than 30 high-impact publications in the field. Core B services will be used by all three
RPs for bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data on mouse and human (with Core C) TECs,
stromal cells, and HAPCs. The Core will also provide biostatistics support for all experiments in the Program.
The analytical approaches provided by Core B are essential to the goals of all RPs. The core will provide services
in three Tasks for the RPs as follows: Task 1. Data storage and maintenance for all Research Projects (RP) and
Cores; Task 2. Perform gene expression analyses on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data; Task 3. Provide
general biostatistics support for data generated from RP 1, 2, 3 and with Core C.
 The Core B leader will interact frequently with RP and Core C leaders to discuss experimental goals and
devise strategies for effective bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses. Successful delivery of Core B services
will greatly facilitate the overall program through: (i) serving as a key link of overall program synergy; (ii) mapping
transcriptional changes in cells of the human and mouse thymus microenvironment over the perinatal to juvenile
transition; and (iii) identifying candidate molecular mechanisms that may play a role in the differential functional
potential of cells in the perinatal versus juvenile thymic microenvironment."
10907498,"Abstract
 The Research Projects (RP) of this comprehensive discovery-based P01 seek to identify specific changes
in the transcriptional profiles and signaling pathways that control thymic epithelial cell (TEC), stromal cell, and
thymic hematopoietic antigen presenting cell (HAPC) compartment dynamics and lineage hierarchies during
the transition from perinatal thymus expansion to juvenile/adult homeostasis. Studies in the RPs will focus on
murine models, but the questions they seek to address require comparison of mouse and human thymus
biology across the perinatal to juvenile transition. However, human thymus tissue is not readily available at
most institutions and cross-species comparisons are not always straight-forward. In addition, the emphasis of
this P01 on deciphering heterogeneity in mostly non-overlapping cellular subsets of TECs (RP1, RP2), other
stromal cells, (RP2), and HAPCs (RP3) mean that data relevant to all three RPs can potentially be obtained
from each human tissue studied. Integration of this centralized Human Thymus Core into the P01 has resolved
these issues. Core C services will allow RP 1-3 to address the knowledge gaps regarding translation of their
mouse data and previously unstudied aspects of human thymus biology, via three focused specific
aims/Service Tasks: 1) Procurement and processing of human thymus tissues from healthy donors to meet
project-specific translation needs; 2) Enrichment and immunophenotyping of TECs, other stromal cells, and
HAPCs to validate human equivalent markers analogous to those identified in mice in RP 1-3; and 3)
Molecular analysis of thymic stromal cells and HAPC subsets through generation of standardized, quality-
controlled single cell (sc) and bulk RNA-seq data from sorted human thymus populations for analysis by Core
B. In addition to providing critical services to the RPs, the comprehensive database of gene expression in
subsets of TEC, stromal cells, and HAPCs from human thymus that will be generated by this Core will be a
significant new resource for both human and mouse thymus research communities."

The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) and our partners in the Retail Food
Safety Regulatory Association Collaborative (Collaborative) continue our joint efforts to reduce
foodborne illness. This cooperative approach of synergic initiatives supports the practice of food
safety and involves stakeholders at all levels of retail food safety. Aligning with core element
three of the Food and Drug Administration’s New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint, our
specific aims are: 1) develop a national Food Code adoption strategy; 2) improve the approach,
competency, and food safety culture among regulators; 3) increase enrollment, engagement,
and conformance in the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards; 4)
improve foodborne outbreak investigation methods; 5) increase the number of establishments
that have well-developed and implemented food safety management systems; and 6) develop a
strategy to enhance communication and better tell our story.
The members of the Collaborative have committed to systematic, routine coordination across
our portfolios of activities. Under our national Food Code adoption strategy, NEHA, in
partnership with our Collaborative partners and the National Conference of State Legislatures,
will bring heightened awareness of the benefits of Food Code adoption and deliver fact-based,
nonpartisan information to legislators across the country. The Food Code Adoption Map will be
further developed to include data on the Food Code adoption status of U.S. territories and tribal
nations. To help support the training and education needs of the retail food safety workforce,
NEHA will partner to create and deliver educational programs, tools, and resources throughout
the project period including partner-developed training and educational programs from the
National Association of County and City Health Officials, National Restaurant Association
(NRA), and Association of Food and Drug Officials. In partnership with NRA and the Conference
for Food Protection, NEHA will assess the training and education needs of retail food handlers
and work to develop resources that meet those needs. NEHA will lead the strategy to enhance
communication through the continuation of our Telling the Story of Food Safety Project by
creating video vignettes with calls to action to support food safety programs and by the
execution of robust marketing, communication, and website maintenance strategies. We will
continue to support Collaborative project work by participating in working groups throughout the
project period. Through this work, the Collaborative will leverage our collective strengths and
expertise to work toward a reduction in foodborne illness."

A leading cause of death worldwide, heart failure is often linked to deficits in energy production in
mitochondria. Mitochondrial uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ plays a critical role in matching energy production to
demand by stimulating ATP production. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ in excess can lead to permeability
transition pore opening and potentially cell death. Animal models of heart failure more closely akin to heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are linked to increased mitochondrial Ca2+ in some studies and
decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ in others; even less is known regarding the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With the long-term goal of helping to develop therapies to limit
or restore mitochondrial Ca2+ when appropriate to improve clinical outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF, this
application will map out the contribution of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ to cardiac dysfunction
in homeostasis and in mouse models of pressure overload and high fat/high sucrose diet with L-NAME.
Tamoxifen-inducible cardiac-specific deletion of Micu1, the gene encoding the “gatekeeper” of mitochondrial
Ca2+ uniporter complex (mtCU), will be used to induce mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. In the same manner,
deletion of Emre, the gene encoding the essential regulator of the mtCU, will be used to eliminate mtCU
activity and lower mitochondrial Ca2+. The overall objective in this application is to systematically compare the
effects of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ on measures of cardiac health – mitochondrial function,
tissue histology, contractility before and after stimulation – in homeostasis and in two different types of induced
heart failure. The central hypothesis is that elevated mtCa2+ impairs heart function in homeostasis and in
HFrEF, whereas lowered mtCa2+ has negative effects in energetically demanding states and in HFpEF. The
rationale is that based on the literature and our preliminary data, pressure overload forces the heart to work
harder, elevating mitochondrial Ca2+, while some indications suggest that mice fed the high fat/high sucrose
diet with L-NAME have lower mitochondrial Ca2+. Hence, in the former conditions, increased mitochondrial
Ca2+ is detrimental, and in the latter, decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ is detrimental. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact
cardiac homeostasis; and 2) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact HFrEF and HFpEF-
MetS. This research is conceptually innovative in using genetic manipulation to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+,
and in directly comparing elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ in models approximating HFrEF and
HFpEF. The outcomes of this research are expected to be significant by establishing a new paradigm
regarding mitochondrial Ca2+ in HFrEF and HFpEF, with the potential to inform future therapeutic strategies."
10905369,"Abstract
Chromosomal ends harbor repetitive DNA sequences, termed telomeres, that are recognized by the shelterin
complex to form a lariat structure called the T-loop, which protects vital genetic information and prevents erro-
neous DNA double strand break repair. Each cell division these telomeres are shortened until they reach a crit-
ically short length, causing cellular apoptosis or senescence. This shortening can be counteracted by the ribo-
nucleoprotein telomerase, which functions to maintain telomere integrity by elongating the 3’ end of telomeres.
Because of this fundamental role played by telomerase, about 85 - 90% of all cancers upregulate telomerase
to lengthen telomeres and achieve immortality. Therefore, understanding telomere biology and how telomerase
maintains telomere ends is vital for understanding carcinogenesis. One such telomeric change is the insertion
of ribonucleotides (ribos) in telomeres by telomerase. Ribos represent the most prevalent form of genomic
DNA damage. Unrepaired genomic ribos are linked to multiple types of cancer and are a source of PARP-trap-
ping lesions which can compromise genome stability. Similar to genomic ribos, ribos inserted by telomerase at
telomeres are highly susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis and may promote premature telomere shortening
through strand breakage. However, the biological impact of ribos within telomeres has been unexplored. This
is, in part, because introducing ribos at telomeres without altering the rest of the genome has not been possi-
ble. We have overcome this limitation by developing a telomerase mutant that is highly enhanced for ribo inser-
tion and identified a cancer associated telomerase mutation that is moderately enhanced for ribo insertion at
telomeres. We hypothesize that ribos are present at telomeres and impact telomere integrity, destabilize telo-
mere architecture, and activate ribonucleotide excision repair. To address this, our collaborative team pro-
poses cellular, biochemical, single-molecule, structural, genome ribo mapping, and proteomic approaches. In
Aim 1, we will investigate the levels of ribos in telomeres, the impact of ribos on telomere integrity and cellular
viability, and how ribos in telomeres alter the DNA damage response at telomere ends. In Aim 2, we will deter-
mine how telomeric ribos alter the binding of the shelterin complex to telomeric DNA and how ribos alter the
formation, stability, and telomerase dependent resolution of G-quadruplexes. In Aim 3, we will investigate how
ribos within telomeres are identified, removed, and repaired by the ribonucleotide excision repair pathway. This
application is relevant to cancer because: (1) changes in telomere integrity are associated with an increased
risk of cancer; (2) the presence of unrepaired ribos are linked to cancer; (3) there is a significant gap in our un-
derstanding of the impact of ribos on telomere integrity; (4) ribos likely promote telomere instability, which
would induce extensive chromosomal instability and drive malignant transformation in surviving cells; (5) we
are characterizing a cancer-associated variant with enhanced ribo insertion; and (6) understanding how ribos
alter telomere integrity and maintenance will aid in developing strategies to protect telomere integrity."

 The purpose of this R13 submission is to request funds to support a limited number of trainees, individuals
identifying as underrepresented minorities (URMs), junior investigator-invited speakers and those with family
caring responsibilities to participate in the 2024 FASEB Science Research Conference on “The Biological
Methylation: Fundamental Mechanisms in Health and Disease”. This will be the 15th FASEB SRC on Biological
Methylation and will be held at the Sheraton Porto Hotel from 28th July-1st August 2024. The last FASEB meeting
was held in Catania, Italy in 2022, where Dr. Davies and Dr. Ge were elected as co-chairs to work jointly with
Prof . Van Rechem and Prof. Strahl who will be the two co-organizers for 2024. The 2024 conference builds
upon the scientific excellence of previous meetings, bringing together a diverse group of cancer and
developmental biologists, chemists and computational biologists, both clinicians and basic scientists, from
academia and biotech. The venue and scientific program will foster interaction between participants with different
expertise and career stages. Previous evaluations have ranked this conference highly for outstanding
presentations, ample time for scientific interactions and discussions, collegial atmosphere fostering mentorship
and collaboration, and for the high impact speakers, who remain for the entire duration of the conference. We
are committed to increasing the number of abstracts selected from early career
researchers/postdocs/trainees/URMs and will provide a platform for short presentations, poster sessions and
sufficient free time to foster collaborations.
 The 2024 program covers all major areas of high interest in the field of biological methylation such as
lysine and arginine methylation, DNA methylation and novel RNA methylations. These are particular relevant
fields of research given the recent promising clinical studies on several small molecule inhibitors in cancer
therapy. Other sessions will discuss the structure and function of RNA, DNA and protein
methyltransferases/demethylases, and their therapeutic targeting. During organized sessions at lunch,
attendees will have the opportunity to “Meet the Experts” and discuss “Career Development”. After the very
successful 2022 “Women in science” workshop, we will use a similar format that will be expanded to include
discussions about work/life balance.
 To summarize, the specific goals of this conference are to: 1) Provide a forum for the presentation of
unpublished, cutting-edge research by investigators from diverse fields applicable to biological methylation, both
from academia and pharma; 2) Provide an opportunity for scientists studying diverse aspects of the biochemistry,
structure/function and disease relevance of methylation, to discuss recent research developments and to initiate
collaborations; 3) Ensure development and integration of young investigators from diverse backgrounds and
those traditionally under-represented in these fields into the broader research community."

10908574,"Project Summary
The gut is a central immunological organ, where host-microbe interactions shape immune tolerance and
inflammation, both locally and systemically. Yet prevailing immunological views conflate the two distinct organs
that comprise the gut—small and large intestine (or SI and LI)—which impedes more robust understanding of
mucosal immune regulation, and misses opportunities to develop safer, more targeted therapies for human
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The premise of this application, founded on recent discoveries from, and
synergy between, the two PIs (Sundrud, Weaver), is that mucosal CD4+ T cells use distinct sets of nuclear
receptors (NRs) in the SI and LI to interface with divergent classes of host- and microbe-derived metabolites,
respectively. Recent work from the Sundrud lab establishes that Foxp3- T effector (Teff) subsets—Th1, Th17
cells—use a NR with no previously known immunological function, the constitutive androstane receptor
(CAR/Nr1i3), to direct a ‘hepatocyte-like’ transcriptional response to contend with potentially cytotoxic bile acid
(BA) concentrations in the SI. A large gradient of BAs exists between the SI (millimolar) and LI (micromolar) due
to ‘enterohepatic’ circulation—primary BAs synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted post-
prandially into the duodenum are actively reabsorbed by specialized enterocytes in the ileum for portal
recirculation to the liver. Because BAs are lipophilic, they can be toxic and pro-inflammatory in enterohepatic
tissues; a host of nuclear receptors—including CAR—have evolved to suppress BA toxicity in hepatocytes and
enterocytes. Our data suggest that enterohepatic circulation creates a uniquely harsh SI microenvironment to
which infiltrating T cells must adapt to maintain tolerance and tissue homeostasis. The LI, by contrast, harbors
103-107 times more bacteria than the SI, and ~1000-fold less BAs. Accordingly, microbes and their metabolites—
short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g., butyrate), secondary BAs (produced via microbial metabolism of residual
primary BAs)—become central to immune regulation in the LI. SCFAs inhibit histone deacetylase enzymes
(HDACs) and stabilize Foxp3 gene expression in peripherally-induced T regulatory cells (iTregs), whereas
secondary BAs promote LI Treg maintenance through another NR, vitamin D receptor (VDR). Thus, while
antigens from the enteric flora are required for priming both pro- and anti-inflammatory T cell responses
throughout the intestinal tract, we hypothesize that marked differences in the abundance of bugs and bile in the
SI vs. LI establish consequential metabolite gradients that are sensed by different NRs to instruct
compartmentalized T cell regulatory functions. We test this hypothesis through complementary, but not inter-
dependent, Aims, leveraging new mouse models, as well as a library of recombinant protein-based NR activity
assays, to define the mechanisms governing the transcriptional regulation, biochemical activation, and
downstream cellular functions of CAR (in SI Teff cells) and VDR (in LI iTreg cells). Successful completion of
these Aims will establish new biological paradigms and inform more precise approaches to treat human IBDs."
10929528,"Control of hyperglycemia to prevent or delay the onset of vascular complications is a fundamental goal
of diabetes care. Intensive treatment is limited, however, by risk of hypoglycemia, a common and potentially
hazardous metabolic complication of glucose-lowering treatment. Traditionally, this risk was considered
unavoidable during treatment but new models of care focus on improving the safety of treatment while
optimizing glycemic control. To monitor for safety and foster better care, work is needed to develop
standardized methods and strategies for performance evaluation.
 The proposed research employs multiple methodologies to address the issue of hypoglycemia and
improved safety of diabetes treatment. For identification of the condition in the Veteran patient population with
diabetes, we propose to analyze national VA and non-VA structured data and claims, measure patient-reported
experience through patient surveys collected from stratified random samples of patients, and develop accurate
and efficient natural language processing (NLP) tools to search documentation in the medical records for
evidence of hypoglycemia. This will include development of a valid case-finding algorithm. These measures
will be combined and compared to obtain a unique and comprehensive evaluation of the condition in the
patient population and to provide practical information on the accuracy and completeness of various methods.
Patients with identified hypoglycemia will be followed forward to evaluate the risks of subsequent adverse
outcomes associated with the condition, including repeat hypoglycemia, preventable hospitalizations, and
death. We will combine all available and relevant information and model hypoglycemia to identify predictors in
the sample of patients who completed the survey and in the whole VA diabetes population, limiting candidate
predictors to factors available from structured medical data or from NLP extractions. We will identify those
factors obtained from surveys or NLP extraction that add substantially to the predictive models. These models
will inform the process of developing parsimonious predictive algorithms for the whole population and in
relevant subgroups. Risk algorithms will include branching to classify patients by contextual factors that are
useful in guiding clinical management. The best practical algorithms will be implemented in an integrated
system for near real-time hypoglycemia case finding and assignment of diabetes patients by predicted
hypoglycemia risks.
 This work will generate methods and tools for monitoring population health and safety among Veterans
with diabetes and for improving care to reduce risks. The near real-time hypoglycemia case-finding and risk
assignment system will be available for use by operations and research as it is implemented. This work could
form the basis for new measures of care quality, providing technologies for risk adjustment, facility and
provider profiling, and practice evaluations. It could be used in generating clinical alerts or as a point of care
decision aid, suggesting approaches for tailored risk reduction. Ultimately, it would improve monitoring of
population health and safety among Veterans and should facilitate precision medicine in diabetes care, with
the emergence of optimal, tailored, and patient centered approaches for managing diabetes."

10929308,"Current rehabilitation methods fail to restore normal gait for many stroke survivors leading to dependence on
others, recurrent falls, limitations in community ambulation and poor quality of life. The main objective of this
study is to test both efficacy and neurophysiological mechanisms of a novel approach to treat persistent gait
deficits after stroke with a combination of simultaneous non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial Direct
Current Stimulation (tDCS) and gait training. Rationale: Peripherally directed gait therapies are driven by
functional brain changes. tDCS has been shown to enhance functional brain changes during rehabilitation and
improve outcomes. Its ease of use and safety makes tDCS an ideal technology to pair with simultaneous gait
training methods. Upper limb studies showed that 10-session bihemispheric tDCS in combination with
movement therapy produced clinically meaningful improvement compared with minor changes after therapy
alone. We conducted pilot studies that demonstrated both feasibility and tolerability of the proposed
intervention. Our first single-session crossover pilot study demonstrated a potential benefit of tDCS combined
with gait training compared with gait therapy alone. Our second 10-session pilot study showed feasibility of the
intervention and demonstrated clinical improvements. The next important step is to test it in a randomized
control study. We will use a bihemispheric tDCS montage that can address a key adaptive neuroplastic
mechanism involved in post-stroke motor recovery, that is rebalancing interhemispheric interaction by 1)
facilitation of the residual ipsilesional motor output pathways for the lower extremity and 2) suppression of
transcallosal inhibition from the contralesional motor regions. Study Design: We will enroll 50 chronic stroke
subjects (>6 months) with gait deficits. Subjects will be randomized to 10 sessions of either active tDCS+gait
training or sham tDCS+gait training. Gait training will be accomplished in the treadmill-based Virtual Reality
environment targeting longer single limb stance with the paretic limb. Aim 1 is to determine whether the
combination of simultaneous tDCS and gait training produces greater improvement in gait performance
compared to gait training alone. The primary outcome measure will be both gait speed as measured by 10-
Meter Walk test (TMWT) and paretic single limb stance duration. Secondary outcome measures will assess
various components of gait-related functional domains and will include the following: spatiotemporal gait
asymmetry; another gait-speed-related measure (Timed Up and Go (TUG)); Ground Reaction Force; gait
kinematics; a measure of gait coordination (Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool); a measure of sensory-
motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer); a functional gait measure (Functional Gait Assessment); and dynamic balance
(miniBEST test). Aim 2 is to characterize the neuroplastic brain changes in response to bihemispheric tDCS
combined with gait training. Outcome measures are 1) ipsilateral corticospinal excitability (motor evoked
potential recruitment curve (MEP-rc)),2) asymmetry of interhemispheric excitability (bilateral MEP-rc ratio), 3)
functional connectivity between bilateral primary motor regions (resting state functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (rs-fMRI)). Aim 3 is to identify factors that predict gait improvement in response to tDCS with gait
training. We will evaluate the relationship between changes in gait speed and paretic single limb stance
duration and baseline assessment of structural and functional reserve (according to corticospinal tract lesion
load, clinical impairment, functional connectivity) and tDCS induced current density modeling. Significance:
This study will address an important problem for the VA patient population. We will test for the first time
whether bihemispheric tDCS can enhance gait training in chronic stroke and evaluate neuroplastic
mechanisms involved in this therapeutic approach. Combination of tDCS and efficient VR-based gait training is
a novel therapeutic approach that is being driven by promising preliminary data and supported by
multidisciplinary expertise."
10929591,"Project Summary (Parent Grant)
Categorization is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that allows for efficient learning, generalization, and
communication. Throughout development, humans categorize the objects, people, and events around them.
The proposed work examines social categorization with a focus on gender. Gender categories are early
emerging, yet influential throughout the lifespan. Broader societal ideas about gender appear to be changing,
however, and this grant asks how those changes may or may not be reflected in how adolescents are
categorizing gender, their beliefs about gender, and their self-categorization by gender. Using a pair of
longitudinal studies, including a 5-year annual study (ongoing from the previous grant period) and a month-long
daily experience sampling study, this grant will document how these constructs are or are not changing
amongst adolescents and the relation between these constructs and their social environments. Finally, in this
work, we examine the links between adolescents’ beliefs about gender, self-categorization with gender, and
their health and well-being. Participants include adolescents and adults who are gender diverse and cisgender.
Together this work will advance theory and practice about topics ranging from categorization and adolescent
gender development to reducing mental health disparities in transgender youth."
10929525,"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Healthcare: The first comprehensive qualitative study of the health
experiences of Gulf War era Veterans will yield significant insight into the features of effective care models and
treatments, as well as satisfaction with care. It will also create a rich, ongoing resource that can inform VA's
effort to improve customer service and care for Gulf War Veterans including a specific focus on those with
multisymptom illness and their caregivers. This research will identify better illness-specific health measures
and promising therapeutic approaches appropriate to VA settings. Finally, our goal is to activate Veterans to be
more engaged with the health system and VA research and policy processes, as well as to improve Gulf War
Veteran communication with VA care providers.
Project Background: While the proportion of Gulf War era Veterans seen in the VA is increasing rapidly, a
disproportionate number of these Veterans suffer from chronic multisymptom illnesses. Although great efforts
have been made to study the causes, we know little about the health experiences of Gulf War era Veterans
with or without multisymptom illnesses. Gulf War registry studies have used rigorous quantitative methods that
are well suited to broad and large-scale epidemiologic inquiry but are not well suited to characterize the
atypical symptoms, effects of co-occurring symptoms, particular challenges related to symptoms and symptom
combinations, and variations in symptom presentation among Gulf War Veterans with multisymptom illness.
Project Objectives: The overarching goal is to create a comprehensive repository of qualitative patient
interviews about experiences of Gulf War-related, chronic, multisymptom illness that can be used to motivate
system change; inform research, clinical practice, and VA policy; and provide an ongoing resource for
Veterans, caregivers, researchers, clinicians, and VA system leaders. The specific aims are: (1) Using
qualitative methods, amplify patient and caregiver voices in Gulf War-related research and clinical care to
improve understanding of experiences of illness and illuminate patient preferences which will contribute to the
design and conduct of patient-centered research and care models; (2) Using mixed methods, improve
understanding of the character of symptoms and functional problems specific to Gulf War era Veterans with
multisymptom illness, and provide this information as a resource to develop improved patient-reported
outcome measures; and (3) Using the results of these studies, develop products that identify promising
treatments, regimens, and care models that can be studied in randomized trials or implemented broadly
throughout the VA health system.
Project Methods: To achieve these objectives, we will use a proven methodology to structure the conduct of
video- and audio-taped interviews. The key features of this approach are (1) maximum variation sampling to
capture the widest possible range of views and experience and to ensure representation from marginalized,
seldom heard, historically underrepresented, and socially excluded groups; (2) in depth, individual interviews
with Veterans and caregivers rather than focus groups or questionnaires; (3) dissemination strategies that are
designed to accelerate system change and responsiveness to Veterans' problems; and (4) development of a
repository in which health experience research can be reapplied and updated rather than used for a particular
study and then lost. We will also employ mixed methods to ensure that broad and unbiased perspectives are
incorporated in our research and products, including (1) conducting surveys of Veteran participants to use in
triangulation and expansion mixed methods approaches, (2) linking findings with existing epidemiological
research, and (3) conducting a literature assessment according to IOM recommendations. These
comprehensive methods avoid bias in interpreting interview data and ensure consideration of factors
associated with key differences in patient experience (e.g., race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender
identity, sexual orientation, geographic region, previous treatment regimen, etc.)."
10924785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Public health emergencies, including conflict, natural disasters, and local and global epidemics and pandemics,
have the potential to disrupt progress towards ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Understanding the impact that
these disruptive events have on the HIV epidemic over time is essential to mitigating their effects. In the
present study, using the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa as a case example, we will establish applied
methods for estimating disruptions in HIV outcomes and identifying modifiable intervention targets. Specifically,
the research plan focuses on 1) building a database that harmonizes multiple national surveillance systems
across South Africa to enable the generation of robust HIV, mental health, and social determinant of health
(SDoH) estimates; 2) conducting an interrupted time series analysis to examine short- and long-term trends in
HIV prevention and care outcomes, mental health, and SDoH prior to and during COVID-19 in South Africa;
and 3) extending an existing agent-based model (ABM) to identify social factors predictive of HIV outcomes
during COVID-19 and simulate the impact of changes on predictive factors to identify targets for hypothetical
interventions. This application in response NOSI NOT-AI-21-057 (HIV/AIDS in the Era of COVID-19) is
extremely timely as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve and predictions indicate future
emerging epidemics and other disruptive events are imminent. Through this award, I will extend my prior
experience in program implementation in South Africa and training in epidemiologic methods to 1) acquire a
foundation of knowledge in techniques for harmonizing data across multiple national surveillance systems; 2)
develop proficiency in advanced data science methods, including an interrupted time series design analysis
and agent-based modeling; 3) cultivate expertise on the impact of disruptive events on the HIV epidemic,
including the role of social and contextual factors, and methods for identifying effective, policy-relevant
intervention programs; and 4) build the foundation for an academic career in global health research by
strengthening international collaborations and grantsmanship, research dissemination, and policy engagement
skills. To accomplish these goals, I will complete coursework, workshops, and independent study; participate in
mentored training and mentored original research; engage with South African policy makers; attend and
present at multiple meetings and conferences annually; and complete numerous manuscripts and grant
applications. Completion of this training program will allow me to develop the language, concepts, and
principles necessary to work with multidisciplinary teams of modeling and implementation experts, which will
be instrumental in securing subsequent funding to develop methods for forecasting disruptions and identifying
effective, policy-relevant interventions in real time. Importantly, this award will also allow me to launch a robust,
independent academic research career focused on conducting rigorous epidemiological research to prevent
future disruptive events from perpetuating health disparities in generalized HIV epidemic settings."
10924784,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage to pregnant women for life through Option B+ has been a
major advance in sub-Saharan Africa for maternal health; however, postpartum mothers living with HIV are at
risk for disengagement from HIV care and treatment non-adherence. Postpartum women are an important
population for efforts to improve HIV treatment adherence and addressing the role of HIV stigma is imperative
in the South African context. HIV stigma is also a key driver of weight and body size in this population. Larger
bodies have generally been preferred among women living with HIV to combat the perception of rapid weight
loss being an outward sign of rapidly declining health and AIDS-diagnosis. However, there are concerns about
excessive weight gain and adverse outcomes related to obesity in HIV positive populations, given ART
associated weight-gain concerns on top of population level increases in obesity. Excessive gestational weight
gain and postpartum weight retention are associated with poor maternal health outcomes including pregnancy-
related hypertensive disorders, large for gestational age babies, increased cesarean birth rates, childhood
obesity as well as maternal type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. HIV stigma and cultural preferences
must be addressed in interventions designed to improve HIV treatment adherence and postpartum weight
retention in this population, necessitating a contextually tailored intervention. This proposal will develop and
refine a lay health worker delivered multicomponent behavioral intervention to address the behavioral
determinants of both HIV viral suppression and postpartum weight retention. Aim 1 will refine the planned
intervention through participatory qualitative data collection with the patient population and key stakeholders.
Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the postpartum weight reduction and HIV viral
suppression intervention for postpartum women living with HIV. Aim 3 will assess the acceptability and perceived
usefulness of the intervention and identify potential mechanisms of change to be tested in a future large-scale
RCT. The proposed study will make a significant contribution to our understanding of intervention techniques to
address both HIV viral suppression and postpartum weight retention among mothers living with HIV, a critically
important population for improved prevention and care. Findings from this work will be used to develop an R01
application to test the efficacy of our culturally and contextually appropriate HIV treatment and postpartum weight
retention intervention in a large-scale RCT."
10924786,"ABSTRACT
Depression and other mental health conditions are disproportionately common in people with HIV and continue
to compromise quality of life and impede achievement of optimal HIV care outcomes. Problem-solving therapy
is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been shown to be efficacious at improving a range of mental
health outcomes when used across diverse settings, including in Africa. Where, how and when problem-
solving therapy is best implemented remains an open and critical question to advancing the scale-up of this
evidence-based treatment— particularly in settings where resources are limited or there is high variation in
patient, provider, or community wants, needs, and resources for mental health care delivery. This proposal
aims to address these issues by leveraging stakeholder-driven methods to develop a stepped, or adaptive,
problem-solving therapy implementation approach for people with HIV in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South
Africa. Specifically, I aim to: 1) determine stakeholder preferences regarding the distinct features of problem-
solving therapy implementation for PWH; 2) develop a contextually feasible, stepped problem-solving therapy
implementation approach using the Implementation Mapping protocol; and 3) evaluate the feasibility of using a
stepped problem-solving therapy implementation approach for PWH in a low-resource setting in South Africa.
My overarching goal is to become an independently funded researcher who leads multi-disciplinary teams, and
uses diverse, innovative methods (e.g., adaptive implementation strategies) to improve the mental and
physical health of people with HIV in low-resource settings. This K01 award will build upon my strong
foundation in advanced epidemiologic methods and applied experience conducting global mental health
disparities and intervention research to address identified gaps in my training and expertise. In collaboration
with my world-class mentorship team, I have designed an intensive 5-year training plan that incorporates
didactic and other capacity-building activities (e.g., seminars, one-on-one mentoring meetings) with applied
experience to achieve the following training goals: 1) Establish expertise developing interview and focus group
discussion guides and conducting qualitative thematic analyses; 2) Gain a robust theoretical understanding of
implementation strategies and community-driven program planning tools for the scale-up of mental health
interventions; and 3) Develop expertise in the use and evaluation of multi-stage implementation strategies. The
proposed research and training will ensure my successful transition to independence in the Division of
Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine and provide the skills and preliminary data
necessary to develop an R01 to further evaluate implementation and efficacy outcomes of adaptive problem-
solving therapy implementation strategies for people with HIV in South Africa. Moreover, this work will fill
urgent and widening gaps in access to mental health care for South African people with HIV and directly
address the NIMH’s third strategic goal to strive for prevention in care through tailoring existing interventions."
10927113,"Veterans who have experienced repeated blast exposures can develop a range of long-term consequences of
mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI). Their injuries also increase the likelihood of prolonged opioid use due to
pain related to the injuries and resulting treatment with opioids. The long-term consequences of mTBI include
an increased risk for developing PTSD and substance use disorders (SUDs), and this risk is likely
compounded by prolonged opioid exposure. Individual genetic and life experience factors can also contribute
to the risk of developing PTSD and SUDs. For example, the FKBP5 gene has sequence variants in the
population that alter the risk for developing PTSD and SUDs. It encodes the protein FKBP51, which regulates
glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. This study will investigate the additive effects of mTBI and prolonged opioid
exposure while asking whether inhibiting FKBP51 can ameliorate the long-term risks of mTBI and opioids.
We propose to use male and female mice in a fully parametric design to test whether mTBI and prolonged
opioid exposure exacerbate the risk for anxiety-like and drug seeking behaviors later and to test a possible
therapeutic solution. Mice will be exposed to overpressure blast in a well-defined protocol that is routinely used
at our facility followed by prolonged (four week) and continuous treatment with fentanyl. Four weeks later, we
will test the animals for the development of anxiety behaviors and their vulnerability to take fentanyl using a
novel oral self-administration procedure. We predict that animals that received both blast and prolonged
opioids will have worsened anxiety-like and fentanyl seeking behaviors afterwards. We will then test whether
SAFit2, a potent and selective FKBP51 small molecule antagonist, can mitigate these outcomes. Our goal will
be to translate these preliminary experiments into a Merit Award to test these ideas more fully in hopes of
developing an innovative new treatment for these long term stress-associated and substance use problems."
10940633,"CLINICAL CORE
ABSTRACT
This Clinical Core will implement first in human PET imaging with new radiotracers targeting α-synuclein (α-syn)
and 4 repeat tau (4R tau). These two types of radiotracers are key for investigation of Parkinson disease (PD)
and Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), diseases that have α-syn brain pathology, and Progressive Supranuclear
Palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementias (FTD) that have 4R tau brain pathology. A critical part of these studies
is the Clinical Core driven consensus diagnosis conferences to implement careful evaluation of each participant
since MSA and PSP can be particularly difficult to diagnose clinically. This represents a critical step for
understanding the clinical manifestations of these disorders and for developing new treatments for these and
related neurodegenerative diseases."
10940635,"PROJECT 2: Development of 4R-Tau PET Radioligands for Imaging Tauopathies
ABSTRACT
The goal of Project 2 is to develop a positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical useful for imaging
4-repeat (4R) tauopathies, which include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration
(CBD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau). Several useful PET agents for imaging mixed 3R/4R-
tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been reported, but none of these agents has proven highly
sensitive for imaging 4R-tau in non-AD 4R-tauopathies, and higher affinity 4R-tau radioligands are needed to
improve specific binding signal in vivo. Novel disease modifying therapies that target tau offer new treatment
possibilities for patients with different tauopathies. Key to a successful therapeutic strategy will be the ability to
discriminate patients with different tauopathies and to assess the efficacy of anti-tau treatments. The proposed
research in this project will pursue parallel tracks of lead compound identification and optimization, working
closely with the Medicinal Chemistry and Radiochemistry Core (MCRC) to identify new 4R-tau candidate
radioligands for subsequent evaluation in Project 2. Binding studies in tissue specimens of 4R-tauopathies and
other proteinopathies will characterize the sensitivity and specificity of candidate radioligands for binding to
aggregated 4R-tau, identifying the most promising leads to advance into in vivo studies in rodents and non-
human primates. The MCRC will prepare a series of analogs from two lead series: Z-indoles and substituted-
indazoles for in vitro binding assays in Project 2 and further define the structure-activity relationship of the
analogs. The MCRC will employ its computational resources to help guide the selection of new analogs to be
purchased from commercial sources or synthesized by the MCRC, and subsequently evaluated in Project 2. In
vitro binding assays conducted in Project 2 will test the predictive power of the in silico molecular similarity
studies conducted by the MCRC and help refine binding site features that most influence radioligand-4R-tau high
affinity binding interactions. Project 2 will employ a staged approach using both in vitro and in vivo assay
methods to characterize and evaluate candidate 4R-tau PET imaging agents provided by the MCRC, identifying
the most promising 4R-tau agents for subsequent evaluation in first-in-human studies of PSP and FTLD-tau
subjects in the Clinical Core."
10937266,"Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 are widely used to promote anti-tumor
immune responses in a range of human cancers, but can also lead to inflammatory toxicities,
collectively referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Colitis is a common and severe
irAE which can lead to treatment discontinuation, particularly in patients receiving anti-CTLA-4
antibodies alone or in combination with PD-1 blockade. Intestinal inflammation triggered by CTLA-
4 antibodies typically involves the colon and is characterized by the accumulation of CD4+ T
lymphocytes and neutrophils in the intestinal tissue. Analyses of colitis-associated lymphocytes
of melanoma patients receiving CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors have further implicated the
pathogenic contributions of tissue resident CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic features. However, the
role of the microbiota and the immune pathways critical for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
induced-colitis remain poorly understood. Our understanding of the immunological mechanisms
of ICB induced-colitis have been impeded by the lack of robust animal models of colitis caused
by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Laboratory mice are highly resistant to intestinal inflammation
following treatment with antibodies targeting immune checkpoints. We found that this limitation
can be overcome by using mice harboring the microbiota of wild-caught mice, referred to as wild
mouse microbiome-reconstituted (WildR) mice, which develop overt colitis following treatment
with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Intestinal inflammation is driven by unrestrained activation of IFN-
producing CD4+ T cells and depletion of peripherally induced regulatory T cells through Fc
receptor signaling. Accordingly, anti-CTLA-4 nanobodies that lack an Fc domain can promote
anti-tumor responses without triggering colitis. We hypothesize that bacterial symbionts present
in the WildR microbiota, but not conventionally raised specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory
mice, are required to trigger over colitis after ICB. We further hypothesize that specific members
of the WildR microbiota stimulate intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) to activate colitic antigen-specific
CD4+ T cells in mice depleted of RORγt+ pTregs in the presence of CTLA-4 blockade. In this grant
application, we propose three specific Aims to further understand how the WildR microbiota
trigger colitis after ICB."
10937390,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2
(SARS-CoV-2) are two enveloped RNA viruses that affect significant proportions of the global population. HIV-
1 and SARS-CoV-2 rely on lipid rafts to facilitate viral entry, assembly, and release, but the exact mechanisms
for how this occurs remain unclear. Lipid rafts represent distinct regions within cellular membranes that are
enriched in cholesterol, glycophospholipids, and protein receptors. Disrupting lipid-raft formation
pharmacologically reduces both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our long-term goal is to determine how
viruses hijack cellular proteins to disarm host defenses and co-opt cellular pathways to promote infection. The
objective in this application is to determine how the lipid-raft scaffold protein AnnexinA2 facilitates HIV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 assembly. Our preliminary data suggest that AnnexinA2 interacts with two distinct viral
membrane proteins: HIV-1 Nef and SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Our central hypothesis is that AnnexinA2 facilitates
the localization of Nef and Spike to lipid-raft compartments, thereby augmenting viral assembly and infectivity.
The rationale for this project is that identifying specific mechanisms by which HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 exploit
AnnexinA2 to enhance viral infection will open new aspects of viral biology and offer new therapeutic
strategies. We aim to test our hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify how AnnexinA2 facilitates
HIV-1 infection; and 2) Determine how AnnexinA2 promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Aim 1, we will validate
whether Nef directly binds to AnnexinA2, determine whether the Nef/AnnexinA2 interaction correlates with the
enhanced prevalence of HIV-1, map the molecular determinants required for interaction, and determine
whether AnnexinA2 enriches Nef in lipid-rafts at the cell surface. Additionally, we will knockout AnnexinA2 via
CRISPR/Cas9 in primary cells to determine whether Nef requires AnnexinA2 to enhance infectivity. For Aim 2,
we will produce SARS-CoV-2 Virus Like Particles (SC2-VLPs) in both the presence and absence of AnnexinA2
to determine its role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 assembly. We will also validate the SARS-CoV-2
Spike/AnnexinA2 interaction and delineate whether AnnexinA2 recruits Spike to lipid rafts at the ER-Golgi
Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC). The proposed research is innovative and significant because it will
generate novel models of retrovirus and coronavirus biology, vertically advancing both fields and providing
novel avenues for further mechanistic and therapeutic investigation."
10938747,"Project Summary. This R35 MIRA application concerns investigating the structure, function, and regulation of
two mRNA methyltransferase enzymes: RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (RNMT) and METTL3/METTL14.
The first RNA modification was identified in the early 1950s with the discovery of pseudouridine, followed some
years later by the identification of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in the 1970s.
Since then, over 150 RNA modifications have been discovered, with many more expected to be uncovered as
more sensitive and better tools for their identification are developed. As these modifications emerge,
researchers will need to uncover the protein machinery that writes and erases these marks, determine their
biological functions, and discern how they are regulated. Defects in the RNA modifications may lead to
diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular abnormalities, viral pathogenesis, or cognitive impairment. Therefore,
understanding the “code” and the enzymatic processes that govern the presence of RNA modifications are key
to revealing pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. The overall goal of
our research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms for how post-translational modifications
regulate the readers, writers, and erasers of RNA modifications, how these marks impact gene expression, and
how defects in this system contribute to disease. Many readers, writers, and erasers of RNA modifications
harbor PTMs, but our understanding of their influence on protein function is very limited. Therefore, we will use
a combination of protein semi-synthesis, enzymology, structural biology, mass spectrometry, and cell biology
strategies to unravel these novel regulatory mechanisms. In the next five years, we plan to investigate the
mechanistic basis for how RNMT and the METTL3/METTL14 complex are regulated by PTMs, with a long-term
vision of expanding to other readers, writers, and erasers in this family. RNMT catalyzes the methylation of the
5’cap of RNA, which is essential for transcript stability, splicing, nuclear transport, and cap-dependent
translation. RNMT and its interacting partner, RAM, are phosphorylated and ubiquitinated; however, the
molecular and structural details for their regulation and impact on biology are not well understood. The
METTL3/METTL14 complex methylates mRNA to generate N6-methyladenosine, which influences transcript
processing, stability, translation, and localization. The METTL3/METTL14 complex is regulated by arginine
methylation and ubiquitination; however, very little is known about how they impact the complex’s biochemical
and biological behavior. Therefore, we plan to assess the mechanistic and structural basis for how these
modifications regulate their biochemical and cellular functions using protein semi-synthesis. Furthermore, we
plan to characterize the ubiquitin E3 ligases that target these proteins for degradation and deubiquitinases that
reverse this process. Successful completion of these projects will provide the molecular underpinning for how
these RNA-modifying enzymes are regulated by PTMs and inform future therapeutic interventions."

Huntington’s Disease (HD) is caused by expanded CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting
in transcription of mutant HTT mRNA and translation of mutant protein, both of which form nuclear aggregates
in neurons. The mechanisms linking expanded CAG repeats to molecular features and outcomes of HD –
including what contributes to HTT aggregation – is unclear. With the clinical failure of therapies that lower mutant
HTT protein, it is crucial to better understand HD mechanisms to identify additional therapeutic targets for HD.
The presence of an alternatively spliced HTT isoform, called HTT1a, is positively related to HTT CAG repeat
length (predictor of HD onset), and associates with mutant HTT mRNA and protein aggregates in HD mouse
models. How HTT1a and mutant HTT interact to affect aggregates, and whether this interaction can be disrupted,
is unknown. It is also unclear what mechanisms favor HTT1a production. In HD patients, HTT1a is only detected
in brain regions where further lengthening of the inherited HTT CAG tract had occurred over time, a process
called somatic expansion. Somatic expansion, which occurs when repeats misalign after transcription, directly
contributes to HD progression in mice. Whether HTT1a production is a cause or consequence of somatic
expansion, and the effect of modulating this relationship on HD outcomes, has not been directly tested.
This project seeks to use small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dissect the relationship between HTT1a expression,
HTT aggregation, and somatic expansion in HD mouse models. siRNA scaffolds – called di-siRNA and tri-siRNA
– have been optimized to enable widespread, potent gene silencing in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice.
Aim 1 will determine the contribution of HTT isoforms to nuclear mRNA and protein aggregates. Delivery of di-
siRNA targeting mutant HTT or HTT1a to the CNS of HD mice had no impact on aggregates, suggesting
simultaneous knockdown of both transcripts may be needed to disrupt aggregation. In Aim 1, di-siRNA targeting
mutant HTT, HTT1a, or both will be injected into HD mouse CNS. HTT isoform mRNA and protein expression,
subcellular localization, and aggregation will be measured 1 month later. The Aim will use di-siRNA that localize
to cytoplasm or nucleus to dissect the role of HTT isoforms in each subcellular compartment in aggregation. Aim
2 will dissect the relationship between somatic expansion and HTT isoform expression in HD. Somatic expansion
and HTT1a are associated in HD patient brains, and co-silencing Msh3 (modifier of somatic expansion) and
mutant HTT by siRNA further decreases somatic expansion compared to Msh3 silencing alone. Aim 2 will
examine an interplay between somatic expansion and HTT isoforms by injecting tri-siRNA targeting Msh3, HTT
isoforms, or both into HD mice, and measuring HTT isoform expression and subcellular localization, and somatic
expansion 2 months later. Top siRNA that block expansion and HTT isoform expression will be reinjected into
HD mice, and motor function and pathology will be measured. This work will reveal HTT1a mechanisms, inform
HD therapy design, and provide the fellow with training in therapeutic development, HD biology, and microscopy."

This F32 application is intended to support Dr. Rachel Doser’s postdoctoral research and training, and to
effectively prepare her for a career as an independent researcher. Dr. Doser is a new (<6 months) postdoctoral
research associate in Dr. Tom LaRocca’s Healthspan Biology Lab at Colorado State University. Under this
fellowship, Dr. Doser will investigate a novel contribution of mitochondria-derived double-stranded RNA
(mt-dsRNA) to neuroinflammation in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The rationale for the proposed
studies is that dsRNA is a potent activator of innate immune/inflammatory signaling, and mitochondria are a
major source of dsRNA, as bidirectional transcription of the circular mitochondrial genome results in the
formation of mt-dsRNAs. Although mt-dsRNA-induced immune activation has been shown to contribute to
certain cancers and autoimmunity, it has not been studied in the central nervous system, or in the context of
aging or age-related neurodegenerative disease. However, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to
correlate with increased mt-dsRNA formation, and dysfunctional mitochondria are a key hallmark of both aging
and AD that may precede neuroinflammation, especially in metabolically demanding neurons. Thus,
investigating the downstream effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons due to aging and/or AD will
advance our understanding of how aging increases the risk of AD and neurodegeneration in general. The
preliminary data presented in this proposal suggest that mt-dsRNAs are released with older age and in AD,
and that they correlate with increased expression of dsRNA immune sensors. Therefore, the proposed
research is designed to test the hypothesis that age/AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction leads to
release of mt-dsRNAs that instigate an innate immune response. First (Aim 1), Dr. Doser will use both in
vitro and in vivo organismal models to determine if age/AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to mt-
dsRNA release. Then (Aim 2), she will use similar approaches to determine if mt-dsRNAs cause
neuroinflammation. Finally (Aim 3), Dr. Doser will investigate if /how mt-dsRNA levels correlate with cognitive
function or AD pathology in humans. Together, these aims will detail the hypothesized mechanism linking
age/AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction to neuroinflammation and assess its relevance to human
health/function, and they may identify novel targets for preventing or limiting inflammation. The proposed
studies will provide Dr. Doser with extensive new training in translational research using multiple models. She
will leverage and expand her current skillset, including by learning new cutting-edge techniques such as
bioinformatics, human neuronal cell culture and reprogramming, measurements of mitochondrial function and
clinical/data science. The relevant expertise of Dr. Doser’s sponsor, Dr. LaRocca, and consulting mentors Drs.
Karyn Hamilton and Chris Link, will support successful completion of the proposed aims and provide Dr. Doser
with an exceptional, interdisciplinary and translational research training experience."
10906845,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effector cells that play an immediate role in host defense. The
activation of NK cells is mediated by receptor-ligand interactions and downstream intracellular signaling path-
ways. One type of immunotherapy that has achieved great success in recent years is based on chimeric antigen
receptors (CARs). These are engineered receptors composed of both target recognition and cell activation func-
tions that can direct immune cells to mediate killing of cancer cells. Although T cells are the predominant immune
cell type used for CAR-based immunotherapy, NK cells provide significant advantages over CAR-engineered T
cells because they can be derived from non-autologous sources. However, most studies testing CAR-NK cells
have used CAR constructs based on T cell signaling pathways that are not optimized for NK cell signaling. In
addition, the development of CAR constructs is largely achieved using a trial-and-error experimental approach,
and there is no systematic understanding of how altering the CAR signaling domains influences cell activation.
 The main objective of this proposal is to identify effective NK based-CAR designs using systems biology
tools. Our approach combines computational modeling and quantitative phospho-proteomics to generate a de-
tailed understanding of CAR-mediated NK cell signaling and cytotoxicity. The outcome of our work will be a set
of validated NK CARs that target and kill BCMA-positive multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells. We will also test
the optimized CARs against CS1-expressing MM cells. The approach builds on our team’s extensive experience
in modeling and characterizing cell signaling and studying NK cell biology. Guided by strong preliminary data,
we propose to pursue three Specific Aims: (1) Characterize intracellular and cellular-level responses of CAR-
expressing NK cells; (2) Develop computational models to predict the dynamic responses of CAR-expressing
NK cells; (3) Identify novel CAR constructs that effectively activate NK cells.
 Collectively, our proposed research will generate a quantitative understanding of how CAR signaling encodes
NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and how NK-CAR constructs can be optimized for cancer immunotherapy. Our
research will broadly impact the field of cancer immunotherapy by providing insight into how intracellular NK cell
signaling and CAR structure influence NK cell activation. Ultimately, this research will expand our knowledge of
NK cell signaling and the design criteria for NK-CAR-based immunotherapy for other tumor types and cancer
antigens. Our work has the potential to unlock the transformative power of NK-CAR cells for cancer immuno-
therapy."

architecture.
P.I. – Richard J. McKenney
Research Summary
Intracellular transport is essential for cellular homeostasis in eukaryotes. This process is carried out
by molecular motors that convert the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into motion along the actin
and microtubule cytoskeletal networks. Decades of research has uncovered structural and molecular
details that explain how many of these motors move along their filament tracks. In the cellular milieu,
most of these motors act in concert with complex regulatory machinery that links them to their
respective cargos, modulates their motile properties, and dictates spatiotemporal activity. How
individual motor output is controlled by this machinery is currently not clear and difficult to dissect in
the complex environment of the cell. In addition, many cargos are moved by the concerted action of
simultaneously bound, opposite polarity motors, in a process called bidirectional transport. How
individual motors are recruited to cargo, activated, and integrated with other classes of motors
presents a large open challenge to the field. Importantly, defects in this process lead to a wide variety
of human diseases and these questions are thus directly related to human health.
 Microtubule network organization, dynamics, and motor activity along microtubules are all
impinged upon by non-enzymatic microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that dynamically bind to
microtubules. The specific functions, molecular properties, and dynamics of MAPs remains
underexplored. The tau family of MAPs are critically important for human health, as tau is well-
characterized to form insoluble inclusions/aggregates in a host of human neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease and Pick’s disease. Despite their identification over four decades ago,
the specific molecular functions and molecular properties of tau family MAPs remains unclear. This
application seeks to develop novel assays and tools to study the complexity of microtubule motor
regulation, bidirectional transport of cargos, and cytoskeletal functions driven by motors and MAPs.
Our approach to combine biochemistry and single-molecule analysis towards in vitro reconstitutions
that test molecular function, and translate our findings into in vivo systems that test hypotheses
generated by these reconstitutions, will open up fruitful long-term avenues of research. We propose
to: 1) Reconstitute and study the recruitment, regulation, and motility of cytoplasmic dynein and
kinesin motors bound to native cellular cargo scaffolding molecules, and 2) Reconstitute and study
evolutionary functions, dynamics, and pathological behaviors of tau family MAPs. These broad goals
build and expand upon our expertise and previous work in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of
the cytoplasmic dynein motor, and aim to provide powerful new tools useful towards dissecting
complex motor function. Our work will illuminate basic molecular and cell biological principles that
drive cellular homeostasis and provide insight into the pathological mechanisms that arise from
molecular motor malfunction."

In the United States, Mexico, and in many countries around the world, teens’ combustible cigarette (CCs) use
has declined in recent years, yet that progress is threatened by a dramatic rise in e-cigarette (EC) use. Prior
research finds that teen CC&EC use is similar among best friends, yet the mechanisms leading to this clustering
of behavior are unclear. Friends can influence each other, but peers with similar risk for and use of CC&ECs can
become friends (selection). Existing research on peer influence and CC use is almost exclusively based on best
friendship networks, but emerging research suggests that more intimate connections like best friendship relations
(strong ties) are empirically different from comparatively less intimate, and nowadays highly ubiquitous, online
interaction networks (weak ties), such as people with whom teens interact via social media. Furthermore, recent
school-based interventions have successfully leveraged interaction networks, not friendship networks, to reduce
teen bullying and CC use. This study will investigate these network mechanisms by gathering data through 6
waves over 2.5 years from a cohort of Mexican high schoolers, where we will separately measure their (best)
friendship and online interaction networks, measure teens’ preferences for CC&EC products that policy can
influence (e.g., flavors) using discrete choice experiments (DCEs), and evaluate initiation and progression of
CC&EC use. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs), a family of Agent-Based Models specifically designed
to permit statistical inference, will be used to analyze the co-evolution of social network dynamics and CC&EC
use dynamics, while accounting for the interplay between online interaction and friendship networks, as well as
the interplay between CC&EC use (e.g., exclusive vs. sequential vs concurrent CC&EC use). Our SAOMs will
incorporate DCE-derived individual-level preferences (i.e., CC vs. EC; tobacco vs. other flavors), something the
Agent-Based Modeling literature around health has not done to date. The resulting SAOMs will be used to
empirically calibrate Agent-Based Simulation Models that will serve as a virtual testbed for evaluating the relative
effectiveness of different network-based and policy intervention strategies to reduce teen CC&EC use.
Workshops with key stakeholder groups (e.g., students, school administrators, federal decision makers,
advocates) will solicit feedback around the relative effects of intervention strategies, the feasibility of adoption
and implementation of different strategies, alternative interventions that our models can simulate, and promote
further dissemination through stakeholder networks. Finally, we will harmonize our surveys with data currently
being collected in a cohort of high schoolers in Los Angeles, so that we can compare models based on Mexican
and Los Angeles data to evaluate the consistency of network effects on CC&EC use. The results from this study
will help extend theories around the importance of both friendship and online networks for influencing health
behaviors, and will help with efforts to promote and implement policy and network interventions that aim to reduce
CC&EC use."

Vision healthcare should be based on science; in this era of data deluge, evidence-informed practice is needed
more than ever. Cochrane is the only international organization that has as its core mission to synthesize (via
systematic reviews) and keep up to date the world's literature for all of healthcare. Systematic reviews use a
highly structured and reproducible methodology to identify, appraise, and synthesize available evidence for
specific clinical questions. Cochrane Eyes and Vision (CEV) aims to prepare and promote access to
systematic reviews of interventions used to prevent, diagnose, or treat eye conditions and visual impairment.
Since 2002, the CEV US Project (CEV@US) has published 101 systematic review protocols, 104 systematic
reviews, and 75 methodological papers and book chapters; has educated over 100,000 individuals in methods
for systematic reviews; and has informed 121 clinical practice guidelines in the US and internationally. Since its
start, CEV@US has been laying the groundwork for having an impact on practicing clinicians: demonstrating to
all who are interested how to conduct an excellent systematic review (e.g., education, journals, methods
research), how to apply this knowledge (e.g., clinical practice guidelines and decision-support applications),
and forming important partnerships (e.g., with clinicians and patients/consumers).
The current societal priorities and observed vision health disparities suggest an urgent need for evidence on
interventions to reduce vision health inequity among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The focus of
our 2022-2027 competitive renewal is impact – impact of CEV reviews on clinical practice, healthcare
equity, and health policy in the US and internationally.
Aim 1: We will prepare systematic reviews that address prioritized questions in collaboration with clinicians
and methodologists, publish the reviews, and regularly update them as new research emerges. We will apply
state-of-art methods in producing these reviews. Aim 2: We will partner with individual (e.g., clinicians,
patients) and organizational stakeholders (e.g., professional societies, academic medical centers, journals) to
ensure that the knowledge underpinning clinical practice and policy is reliable, available, and applied. Aim 3:
We will build research capacity by educating health professionals. Our education is flexible and tailored, and is
offered online and in-person, via professional organizations, clinical programs, and one-time workshops. Aim
4: We will conduct foundational methodological research related to systematic reviews and influence the field
of evidence synthesis. We will evaluate the impact CEV@US activities using a mixed-method study. Aim 5:
We will promote evidence-informed decision making by disseminating the results of our research widely."

APOE genotype is a major genetic risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders. Compared to APOE3,
APOE4 is associated with greater cognitive dysfunction in older adults, increases Alzheimer's disease risk and
exacerbates progression of vascular dementia, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Evidence supports a major
role of APOE4 in brain endothelial cell (BEC) dysfunction at the blood-brain barrier in all these conditions. BEC
dysfunction can lead to neuronal dysfunction through disrupting the complex neuronal homeostatic
environment and via entry of proteins and other toxins that can damage neurons directly and via effects on
supporting cells. Due to their unique location, BEC are susceptible to signals from the brain and plasma in
neurodegenerative disorders, which may be particularly relevant for inflammation. Indeed, APOE4,
neuroinflammation, peripheral inflammation and BEC dysfunction are intimately linked to dementia
risk/progression. Our novel in vitro data demonstrate that APOE4-BECs have a unique basal phenotype that
results in disruption of their barrier function with inflammatory stimuli, which we have also found in vivo. Based
on these data our hypothesis is that APOE4-associated BEC dysfunction is a novel therapeutic target for
neurodegenerative disorders. Our goals are to develop our in vitro assays (R61 Phase) and conduct screening
and target identification (ID) (R33 phase) to identify novel compounds that mitigate inflammation-induced
permeability disruption in APOE4-BECs. Our biological rationale is that APOE4 predisposes BECs to
inflammation-induced barrier deficits, thereby increasing the risk/progression of adult-onset
neurodegenerative disorders. The novelty lies in our isolation protocols and assays to target inflammation-
induced increases in paracellular permeability using APOE4-BECs. The clinical relevance is that APOE4 is a
risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders for which there are also in vivo models. Therefore, there are
pathways for the transition of positive hits targeting APOE4-associated BEC dysfunction from preclinical to
clinical studies."

Abstract
This application focuses on a central goal of the RFA for Centers for Medical Countermeasures
Against Radiation to “further develop existing as well as novel therapies to minimize tissue
damage, hasten tissue recovery, restore normal physiological function, and improve survival.”
Multi-organ radiation-induced injury is a major threat during targeted terror attack, and adaptive
and innate immunity are increasingly found to play a key role in this process. Innate immune
receptors collectively referred to as Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRR) have undergone an
explosive discovery phase. Prominent PRR families include the membrane bound Toll-like
receptors (TLR) which interact with extracellular ligands. These have been extensively studied
in infection and inflammatory diseases, and their impact on radiation-induced damage has
emerged in the last few years. Post-exposure, radiation not only causes acute injury but also
delayed injury such as fibrosis and defective cellular and immune development. We and others
have explored the roles of TLRs in radiation and unexpectedly found that certain TLRs and their
ligands are protective of radiation-induced damage involving both the hematopoietic system as
well as the gastrointestinal tissues. In addition to TLR ligands, we have also isolated beneficial
microbiota and metabolites from animals that survived lethal radiation, and propose to explore if
these microbes and their metabolites can mitigate radiation damage. This proposal will focus on
the use and mechanism of TLR ligands, commensal microbes and their metabolites as radiation
mitigators that can reduce radiation induced damage."

TRD 1 aims to translate QPI technology to in-vivo and deep-tissue imaging with specific markers developed via
computation and deep-learning. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is emerging as a powerful, label-free approach
to imaging cells and tissues, especially because it combines qualities found in microscopy, holography, and light
scattering techniques: nanoscale sensitivity to morphology and dynamics, 2D, 3D, and 4D (i.e., time-resolved
tomography) nondestructive imaging of completely transparent structures, and quantitative signals based on
intrinsic contrast. These capabilities have allowed QPI to be successfully applied in numerous biomedical
applications, including cancer diagnosis in histopathology and cell therapy. Recently, we have expanded QPI for
the first time to thick structures, such as embryos and spheroids, by developing gradient light interference
microcopy (GLIM, the 2018 Microscopy Today Method of the Year). However, despite enormous progress,
current QPI techniques are virtually absent from in-vivo and POC applications.
We will advance the QPI technology to a confocal reflection geometry, thus, boosting the out of focus light
rejection and improving high-resolution 3D imaging of thick tissue structures. Specifically, we will target first
imaging the 3D orientation of skin collagen in-vivo. We will develop a label-free endoscopic system (eGLIM)
capable of sub-micron spatial and millisecond temporal resolution, while maintaining nanometer pathlength
sensitivity. We will advance phase imaging with computational specificity (PICS) to real-time operation on in-vivo
data from CPT (Aim 1) and eGLIM (Aim 2). Specifically, in close collaboration with TRD 3, we will develop
computational tools for segmenting cellular and subcellular structures in spheroids, identifying collagen fibers
from in-vivo CPT skin data, developing rapid label-free viral testing, nondestructive live/dead cell assays, label-
free cell cycle phase identification."

In this technology research and development (TRD) project, advanced computational and machine learning
methods will be developed that address a variety of needs related to image formation and image analysis in
high-resolution label-free optical microscopy. Computational methods are being rapidly deployed that are
changing the way that measurement data are acquired and improving the formation and analysis of microscopy
images. The potential impact of such methods on the field of label-free microscopy is very high and can optimally
leverage inherent endogenous contrast mechanisms in innovative and informative ways. The developed
methods will serve as enabling technologies for many projects in the proposed center. The research will be
informed by and jointly developed and evaluated with the TRD and driving biological projects. A general theme
of this work is the integration of imaging science, physics- and deep learning (DL)-based approaches to
circumvent the limitations of label-free imaging and the use of objective image quality measures to systematically
validate and refine the developed methods. Three broad classes of computational methods will be investigated
that will enable the (1) image-to-image mapping of label-free images to provide computational specificity,
improved semantic segmentation, and/or enhanced spatial resolution; (2) improved reconstruction of images for
3D cellular imaging; and (3) extraction of biologically relevant information from multi-modality label-free image
data. The Specific Aims of the project are: Aim 1: Image-to-image translation methods for providing specificity,
semantic segmentation, and/or enhanced spatial resolution; Aim 2: Diffraction tomography and inverse
scattering methods for 3D imaging; and Aim 3: Biomarker discovery and multi-modal DL methods.
This successful completion of this project will result in computational and DL methods that will advance a variety
of label-free imaging technologies. These methods will enable improved computational staining, enhance of
spatial resolution, semantic segmentation, 3D image formation, and analysis of multi-modality label-free image

My research program is focused on the intersection of pro-folding chaperones and the pro-degradation 26S
proteasome. Protein Quality Control (PQC) is the balance of protein folding, unfolding and degradation, which
is central to human health and disease. An outstanding question in the PQC field is “how do chaperone
proteins triage substrate proteins between the pro-folding and pro-degradation pathways?” In my graduate
and postdoctoral training, I have gained experience using in vitro techniques to study both chaperone proteins
and the 26S proteasome. This positions me to explore how chaperone activity and substrate processing
affect downstream degradation by the proteasome. This work will bridge the gap between two major cellular
pathways that, to-date, have been characterized independently.
Our goal over the next five years will be to use a multi-disciplinary approach to study how the chaperone
complex, Hsp70/CHIP/BAG-1, affects proteasomal degradation. Hsp70 is a molecular chaperone and
ATPase that binds and releases substrates throughout an ATP-hydrolysis cycle that is regulated by co-
chaperone proteins. Two such co-chaperones are C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3
ubiquitin ligase, and Bcl-2 associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1), a nucleotide exchange factor. The
Hsp70/CHIP/BAG-1 complex has been shown to target human disease substrates, such as mutant huntingtin
and immature BCR-ABL oncoproteins, to the proteasome for degradation. Therefore, this is an ideal
chaperone complex for developing my research program.
I propose to use in vitro characterization to dissect how chaperones influence each step of proteasomal
degradation, including ubiquitination, substrate binding, and degradation. In addition, we will employ cryo-
electron microscopy to determine first-of-its kind structures that directly observe the substrate handoff
mechanism from chaperones to the 26S proteasome. These techniques will be paired with single molecule
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments that report on the conformational state of
Hsp70 during substrate processing. Tracking the changes in Hsp70 will demonstrate how interactions with
co-chaperones and the proteasome affect the conformational landscape during substrate processing.
Combining these in vitro techniques to rigorously study how chaperones mediate proteasomal
degradation will provide unique insights into the molecular mechanisms that affect substrate
handoff and degradation. Furthermore, I expect that our data will lead to novel strategies for targeting this
process in human disease."
10940953,"ABSTRACT
The incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing, and despite the use of conventional
therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, 5–year survival remains dismal, at ~12%1. Late detection and
therapeutic resistance constitute the two cardinal challenges in PDAC management. However, it is now clear
that, following the initial KRAS mutation, it takes over a decade for overt cancer to develop from premalignant
lesions, called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Recent studies have also identified individuals at a
high risk of PDAC who have a strong family history or harbor pathogenic variants of cancer susceptibility genes.
Imaging further identifies premalignant pathologies, such as intrapapillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN). Both
advances––genetic testing and imaging––together with the exceptionally protracted, >10–year–long, window of
silent PDAC progression underscore the opportunities to intercept progression. Here, we have targeted
mutated KRAS (mKRAS) that drives up to 90% PDACs. We found previously that a KrasG12D vaccine halts PanIN
progression in 40% of KPC mice that harbor a heterozygous KrasG12D mutation. This study provided the premise
for testing our mKRAS vaccine comprising six peptides corresponding to the most common KRAS mutations in
patients with resected PDAC (NCT04117087). We provide evidence for safety, induction of mKRAS–specific
predominantly CD4 T cells, and improved disease–free survival. These data prompted us to initiate a study to
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine in genetically predisposed individuals (NCT05013216, Aim
1). Promising preliminary data establish conceptual and technological feasibility. We hypothesize that the
mKRAS vaccine will (a) trigger mKRAS–specific anti–tumor immunity in individuals with premalignant lesions––
PanINs or IPMN––and (b) slow progression of PanINs to PDAC with a survival benefit in KPC mice when given
prior to the induction of the KrasG12D mutation. Aim 1 (already initiated) and Aim 2 will study the safety and
immunogenicity of mKRAS vaccine in individuals with genetic predisposition and high–risk IPMN, respectively.
We will study mKRAS–specific T cells in terms of memory, exhaustion, and polyfunctionality, as well as clonality
and richness of the T cell repertoire. In Aim 1, we will also identify TCR clones with cytotoxic gene signatures
and validate their function by knocking in the selected TCRs into human T cells. Aim 2 will allow us to examine
the effect of vaccine on premalignant IPMN tissue using image mass cytometry. In the spirit of bidirectional
translation, we will move back, in Aim 3, to the inducible version of the KPC mouse to determine the optimal
timepoints for vaccine interception, characterize longitudinal changes in the immune compartment of PanIN
lesions, and investigate the role of CD4 T cells in preventing PanIN–to–PDAC progression. Establishing vaccine
effects in high–risk cohorts, together with murine studies on changes in the cellular architecture and evolving
immunosuppressive or pro–oncogenic signals, should allow for novel combinatorial strategies in which vaccines
would be co–administered with immune modulators to ensure long–term efficacy in high–risk groups."
10939599,"Proteostasis comprises the processes governing the life cycle of proteins from synthesis to degradation.
Imbalanced proteostasis contributes to numerous pathologies, including those affecting the heart. Proteostasis
in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cardiac myocytes is important since proteins involved in contractile
Ca handling, as well as receptors and secreted proteins, are synthesized on ER-bound ribosomes. We found
that cardiac pathology imbalances ER proteostasis, causing ER stress and misfolded proteins that must be
degraded to avoid toxicity. This proposal concerns one such degradation process, ER associated protein
degradation (ERAD), which is the mechanism responsible for proteasome-mediated degradation of ER
proteins. We found that in mice cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) increases ROS and activates the ER stress
response, which induces several previously uncharacterized antioxidant proteins, including the trans-ER
membrane selenoprotein, Vimp, which has not been studied in the ischemic heart. We found that Vimp
knockdown in mice increased I/R-generated ROS and infarct size in in vivo I/R, consistent with a role for Vimp
as an antioxidant. In addition to its antioxidant activity, Vimp has been shown in model cell lines to be important
for assembly of the ERAD complex, the function of which is not known to require antioxidants or Se. Vimp
overexpression in cultured cardiac myocytes increased ERAD, consistent with Vimp’s function as a key regulator
of ERAD in the heart. Our hypothesis is that Vimp mitigates ROS and misfolded protein accumulation, both of
which protect against I/R damage. Moreover, the unique dual roles of Vimp are mechanistically linked to the
antioxidant function of its Se and the protein degradation function of its ERAD domain. Finally, endogenous
proteins in the heart are degraded by ERAD as part of their life cycle, which is essential for balancing proteostasis
and optimizing heart function. Our specific aims are to: 1- determine the effects of AAV9-sh-RNA-mediated
knockdown of endogenous Vimp, which is very effective in vivo, on cardiac structure and function, infarct size

10919768,"Background. Two million osteoporotic fractures occur each year in the United States, resulting in more than
400,000 hospital admissions and over $20 billion spent annually on osteoporosis care. Osteoporotic fractures
cause loss of independence and excess mortality, and persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are twice as likely
to sustain an osteoporotic fracture than the general population. Frailty occurs prematurely in RA and the
underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not well studied. Furthermore, Veterans are three times as likely
to be frail and have excess mortality after osteoporotic hip fracture compared to the general population,
underscoring the importance of studying the relationship between frailty, bone mineral density (BMD) and
osteoporotic fractures in Veterans Affairs (VA)-based RA cohorts. Inflammation plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of both frailty and osteoporosis, making RA, a disease of chronic inflammation, an ideal disease
state in which to study these processes. While associations between inflammatory biomarkers, frailty and
osteoporosis have been identified in the general population (most notably interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1 (IL-
1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa)), the association between these inflammatory markers and frailty in
RA has not been comprehensively studied. With the aging US population and >10 million Veterans over the age
of 60, it is imperative to improve the management of frailty and osteoporosis especially in high-risk groups, such
as those with RA. Scientific Gap. This proposal addresses two scientific gaps in the high-risk Veteran RA
population: 1) the impact of frailty on BMD loss and osteoporotic fractures and 2) the impact of inflammatory
biomarkers on frailty. Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use a local clinical Veteran RA Cohort to determine if frailty is
independently associated with BMD and longitudinal BMD loss. Frailty will be measured by three unique frailty
indices: (1) a well-established frailty index (Fried Physical Frailty Phenotype), (2) a quick patient-reported scale
(FRAIL scale), and (3) a VA electronic health record-based frailty index (VA-FI). Hypotheses: 1a. Pre-frail and
frail Veterans will have lower baseline total hip BMD than robust Veterans when controlling for traditional
osteoporosis risk factors. 1b. Veterans with worsening frailty will have larger declines in total hip BMD at follow-
up compared to those whose frailty status improves or is unchanged. Aim 2 will use a national RA registry (VARA)
of over 3,000 Veteran enrollees to determine if frailty is a predictor of declines in BMD and incident osteoporotic
fractures. Frailty will be assed using the VA-FI which will be calculated at baseline and at two-year intervals.
Hypotheses: 2a. Worsening frailty is an independent predictor of total hip BMD loss. 2b. Worsening frailty is an
independent predictor of incident osteoporotic fractures. Aim 3 will utilize both cohorts to determine if IL-6, IL-1β
and TNFa associate with baseline frailty status as well as predict the onset of frailty. Hypothesis: Of the three
inflammatory biomarkers measured, IL-6 will have the strongest association with prevalent and incident frailty in
both the local RA cohort and the national VARA registry. Impact. This study will be the first to quantify the
association between frailty, BMD loss and osteoporotic fractures in Veterans with RA, and will do so using three
unique measures of frailty. This study will also determine the extent to which specific inflammatory pathways
underlie the frailty phenotype, observations that may provide insight to novel strategies to prevent its
development. Future Directions. The results of this study will inform future clinical trials aimed at improving
frailty to prevent BMD loss and fractures while also improving the quality of life and independence of high-risk
Veterans with RA. Candidate. Dr. Katherine Wysham is a physician scientist and rheumatologist at the VA Puget
Sound Health Care System. Through this award Dr. Wysham will gain training and research experience to
support her long-term goal of becoming an independent VA researcher focused on the prevention and treatment
of frailty, osteoporosis and fractures in Veterans with rheumatic diseases."
10920439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Invasive bladder cancer is a lethal disease that often requires life-altering surgical removal of the
bladder to prevent or limit metastasis. Recent approvals of five checkpoint inhibitors for advanced or refractory
bladder cancers demonstrate its responsiveness to immunotherapy. However, less than half of advanced
bladder cancer patients benefit from checkpoint immunotherapy and antitumor responses are often transient.
 Our previous preclinical studies in mice demonstrated that intravesical immunotherapy with interleukin-
12 (IL-12) formulated with the mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan (CS), i.e., CS/IL-12, can eliminate nearly all
established orthotopic bladder tumors in a T cell-dependent manner. These studies also demonstrated that
intravesical CS/IL-12 can induce robust abscopal responses with the elimination of distant, untreated bladder
tumors in most mice. Although these data are promising, several limitations of implanted murine bladder tumor
models have hindered clinical translation. Thus, this application proposes to evaluate the safety and activity of
intravesical CS/canine IL-12 (caIL-12) immunotherapy in pet dogs with spontaneous invasive urothelial
carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. There are numerous similarities between canine and human bladder cancers
including mechanisms of tumorigenesis, rates and sites of metastasis, and distinguishable molecular subtypes.
Given these similarities, treatments found to be successful in dogs are more likely to be successful in people.
 The objectives of this project are: 1) to demonstrate that intravesical CS/caIL-12 immunotherapy can
safely induce antitumor immunity against canine invasive UC; and 2) to determine if canine bladder cancer is a
useful model for the evaluation of this and other novel immunotherapies. The first objective will help prepare
intravesical CS/IL-12 for translation into human clinical trials, while the second objective will help bladder
cancer researchers overcome the limitations of rodent models and provide a more faithful representation of
human bladder cancer. To accomplish these objectives, 2 specific aims have been designed.
 Aim 1 is focused on safety, as CS/caIL-12 has never been evaluated in dogs. After synthesizing and
validating recombinant caIL-12 in vitro, we will perform a dose-escalation study of intravesical CS/caIL-12 in
pet dogs with spontaneous invasive UC of the bladder. Aim 1 will establish a recommended dose (RD) based
on safety readouts that utilize a combination of clinical examinations and laboratory tests. Proposed
pharmacokinetic and immunophenotyping studies will investigate the possible systemic uptake and
dissemination of intravesical immunotherapy and the resulting immune impacts. Aim 2 will assess antitumor
and immunological responses to the RD of intravesical CS/caIL-12 in an expanded cohort of dogs with bladder
cancer. Correlative studies will determine if intravesical CS/caIL-12 influences T cell infiltration, the tumor-
immune microenvironment, neoantigen reactivity and/or T cell clonality. The influence of molecular subtype
and tumor mutational burden on antitumor and/or immune responsiveness will be assessed."

Complex motor sequences are fundamental to many highly skilled behaviors, ranging from athletics to musical
and vocal expression. Learning such complex movements requires both motor variability, to facilitate exploration
important to reinforcement learning, and motor flexibility, to enable the adaptive modification of behavior in
response to reinforcement signals. Studies of relatively simple skill learning, such as lever pressing or licking,
emphasize that interactions between the motor cortex and the striatum are central to both exploration and
reinforcement. However, how corticostriatal circuits facilitate motor exploration and reinforcement of complex
behaviors such as speech remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to monitor and manipulate the
activity of corticostriatal circuits dedicated to learning complex vocal behaviors. Integrating these
circuit studies with predictive computational models and novel methods of vocal analysis will allow us
to test the hypothesis that corticostriatal circuits provide a source of directed variability that enables the
systematic exploration of high-dimensional vocal “space.” The Specific Aims are to: 1) Use high-
resolution imaging methods to determine how variability in the vocalization-related activity of cortical and striatal
neurons relates to vocal variability; 2) Use cell-type specific optogenetic perturbations targeted to small neural
ensembles to determine how cortical and striatal neuron activity contributes to vocal variability; and 3) Use
closed-loop methods to determine how reinforcement signals modulate corticostriatal ensemble activity and how
these changes in activity affect vocal performance. Collectively, the proposed experiments will help achieve our
long term goal of causally testing how corticostriatal circuits contribute to motor exploration and reinforcement
needed to learn complex skills."

This application seeks partial support for the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB)
Summer Research Conference (SRC) on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements, to be held July
14-19, 2024 in Tucson, Arizona. This will be the 20th in a series of highly successful biennial conferences de-
voted to these topics. This conference brings together diverse investigators studying broad aspects of genetic
recombination and genome rearrangements in a range of biological systems and using different experimental
approaches. Presentations will describe cutting-edge unpublished work on timely questions in the field and will
foster discussions among participants at all career stages. This conference will provide unique opportunities for
the open exchange of data and technological innovations that can be assimilated and exploited across the entire
field. Genetic recombination covers many areas directly relevant for understanding the biology of aging, cellular
senescence, telomere maintenance, and the etiology of aging-related diseases. Homologous recombination is
essential for maintaining genome stability and limiting genome rearrangements that can promote disease, and
many recombination proteins act as suppressors of cancer and premature aging. Conversely, recombination
mediates processes promoting disease, including complex genome rearrangements leading to cancer and neu-
rological disorders, frequent crossing-over associated with premature aging, and alternative lengthening of telo-
meres (ALT), which allows cells lacking telomerase to escape senescence. Recombination pathways repair dou-
ble-strand DNA breaks and inter-strand crosslinks resulting from exposure to environmental stressors such as
gamma-rays, ionizing irradiation, alkylating agents, and UV light. Hence understanding recombination is para-
mount to understanding the biology of aging and aging-associated human disease, including the role of environ-
mental exposure. The FASEB conference brings together investigators interested in genetic recombination from
diverse disciplines, including biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, genomics, and cell biology. Key topics to be
covered in 2024 include: (i) the molecular mechanisms of recombination, (ii) meiotic recombination, (iii) telomere
dynamics, and the role of ALT in escaping senescence; (iv) complex genome rearrangements and their role in
neurological diseases and cancer, (v) repair of replication-associated DNA lesions, (vi) the influence of chromatin
structure on recombination, and (vii) DNA damage signaling. Special emphasis on these topics is reflected in
our initial speaker invitations. In addition, about one-third of plenary session talks will be selected from abstracts
with an emphasis on late-breaking advances from underrepresented and early-stage scientists. A number of
innovations to the conference plan and program aim to further enhance participation, interaction, exchange and
discussion among a diverse group of participants; and increase the exposure of younger scientists. In sum, the
FASEB SRC on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements remains the most important conference
on a topic of the high interest and importance to research on age-related diseases and the scientific community."

10929639,"Project Summary- Social Determinants of Health Multilevel Intervention
Financial toxicity –hardships caused by the costs of cancer treatment– are common and have substantial
impact on cancer outcomes and patient wellbeing. The signature social determinants of health multilevel
intervention trial of the Washington University Advancing Cancer Control Equity Research through
Transformative Solutions (WashU-ACCERT) Center aims to improve cancer patients’ quality of life throughout
treatment and into survivorship by addressing access to and affordability of cancer care and financial burden
associated with cancer treatment costs. This is directly responsive to community-identified concerns around
access to care and affordability. We will achieve this by: adapting the web-based I-CARE (Insurance and
Cancer Affordability Resources) tool and pairing it with clinician and system training to support financial
services. The patient-focused tool is designed to provide education on insurance, support people with cancer
in making choices about health insurance, accessing resources to offset the financial burden of care, and
building self-efficacy for discussing care costs with clinicians. Outcomes will be assessed at the patient,
provider, and system level. The specific aims of this research project are to:
 Aim 1: Engage end-users to adapt I CAN PIC to I-CARE employing a user-centered approach.
 Aim 2: Prepare for multi-level implementation using the Expert Recommendations for
 Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies
 Aim 3: Implement and evaluate I-CARE in a randomized trial.
This project will adapt, implement, and evaluate I-CARE in urban and rural Missouri, reflecting the WashU-
ACCERT Center theme on intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and geography and addressing access to health
and healthcare as defined by the Center’s conceptual framework: affordability, availability, accessibility,
accommodation, acceptability. Our multidisciplinary research team, including university and community co-
leads, comprises experts in patient centered communication, implementation science, community engagement,
cancer equity, and health economics. This project will advance our understanding around the impact of these
social determinants of health on adverse cancer outcomes. As part of the WashU-ACCERT Community
Responsive Research Program, this adaption, implementation, and evaluation of I-CARE addresses
community-identified concerns around access to care and affordability, and will provide critical insights into
advancing equity by addressing social determinants of health and financial toxicity across diverse races and

10929456,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-gated transcription factors that control important biological processes
including reproduction, development, metabolism, and immunity. NRs are the target of ~16% of drugs used in
the clinic for applications that include birth control, inflammatory disease, and metabolic disorders. NRs are
thought to function by altering the dynamics of chromatin to alter expression levels of genes through the
recruitment of coregulators, chromatin remodelers, and ultimately through the activation of transcriptional
machinery. However, the dynamic nature of NRs and NR complexes has made it challenging to study the
molecular mechanisms by which full length proteins and protein assemblies regulate gene expression using
traditional structural biology techniques. Despite the central role that NRs play in gene expression activation, our
mechanistic understanding of how they regulate target gene programs at the molecular level of chromatin is
largely unknown. This is attributed, in part, to the dearth of structural biology data for full-length receptors and
the near complete absence of biochemical, biophysical, or structural data on NRs in their functionally relevant
chromatin context. Building on established foundations in sponsor’s home laboratory, combined with the
applicant’s prior expertise in biochemical and biophysical methods and an intimate understanding of the NR field,
this project seeks to determine how a model NR named RORγT assembles with coregulatory proteins SRC3
and p300 to alter chromatin dynamics and post-translational modification status of chromatin, a hallmark of NR
target gene activation. The proposed research program has two major goals: (1) to determine how RORγT and
coregulatory protein complexes engage with nucleosomes, and (2) to determine how RORγT and coregulator
protein complexes modify histones and alter nucleosome dynamics. This will be accomplished using a
combination of traditional biochemistry, and state-of-the-art technologies including cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and structural proteomics. By studying how these protein complexes assemble and act
on nucleosomes, we will gain new insight into how RORγT, and more broadly the NR superfamilty, modulates
nucleosome dynamics, modification status, and, ultimately, function in gene regulation. The implications of this
work will help us understand how an important drug target functions and will pave the way for future research
investigating an important class of drug targets."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by age-related
onset and progressive neuronal loss. Neuroinflammation mediated by disease-associated microglia is
increasingly implicated in AD pathogenesis. As the primary immune cells in the brain, abnormally reactive
microglia have been recently found to create a neuroinflammatory environment that results in neuronal death,
yet the mechanisms by which age and genetic factors interact remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations
accumulate in various cell types during the development and aging process of the human body. Clonal
expansion, driven by somatic mutations in genes regulating cell proliferation, is associated with an increased
risk of cancer with age, but has only recently been linked to a growing list of non-cancer neurological diseases.
Notably, somatic BRAF mutation in the microglial lineage has been implicated in histiocytosis-associated
neurodegenerative conditions. Our preliminary results from three AD cohorts and with three sequencing
technologies consistently show an excess of clonal somatic mutations in AD brains, particularly in proliferation-
related genes of microglia.
 This new study aims to examine if the accumulation of somatic mutation contributes to an age-related
increase in AD risk by driving clonal expansion of microglia, which subsequently induces neuroinflammation
and neuronal loss in AD brains. The first Aim of the study is to identify somatic mutations by re-analysis of the
existing bulk RNA-seq datasets from large AD cohorts, and compare the transcriptome-wide burden and
distribution of somatic mutation between different brain regions of AD patients and matched controls. In the
second Aim of the study, molecule-barcoded ultra-deep panel sequencing will be applied to screen for somatic
mutations more sensitively among genes that regulate cell cycle and proliferation in AD and control brains; we
will further use amplicon sequencing to quantify the mutant allele fraction across different cell types sorted from
AD brains, to verify if these somatic mutations are specifically carried by microglia. The third Aim of the study
will focus on the functional impact of proliferation-related somatic mutations in AD microglia, by using both an
in silico method based on AD single-nucleus RNA-seq data and an in vitro method based on a human stem-
cell differentiated microglia model. Our proposed study will shed new light on the contribution of somatic
mutation to increased AD risk, and highlight the clonal expansion of microglia driven by somatic mutations in
proliferation-related genes as a potential mechanism involved in AD pathogenesis."

Bacteria have existed for millions of years and have evolved sophisticated methods of
communication. One primary mechanism is through the glycans on their surface, which facilitate
interactions between bacterial cells and enables their invasion into host cells. Obtaining a
fundamental understanding of these glycan interactions offers an avenue to stop bacterial
invasions and develop new therapeutic interventions. By introducing advanced computational
techniques, we will elucidate the multifaceted world of bacterial surface glycans, bridging the gaps
in our current understanding and advancing new avenues in glycobiology research. These goals
align with our lab’s mission of computationally modeling biological interfaces:
• Constructing In Silico Libraries of Bacterial Surface Glycans: Our goal is to develop a
 searchable and publicly available in silico glycan library. Within the first five years, we will
 focus on amino sugars and essential bacterial surface glycans, including LPS serotypes,
 tailored for docking studies designed for both computational and experimental researchers.
 Beyond five years, we will continuously update and add to this library including peptidoglycans
 and o-linked glycans.
• Elucidating the Foundations of Glycan-Collectin Dynamics: Our goal is to create design rules
 for glycan-collectin dynamics setting the foundation for the ""Collectin Designer"" software tool.
 Within the first five years, we will focus on modeling, analyzing, and assessing the interactions
 of bacterial surface glycans with two human collectins. Beyond five years, we will expand to
 the other four human collectins and continue adding to the design rules which will lead to the
 creation of the Collectin Designer software.
• Developing a Process to Optimize Bacterial Glycan Interactions with Collectins using SP-D
 Interaction with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) Glycans as a Model System: Our goal is to
 develop a process to optimize bacterial glycan interactions with collectins. Within the first five
 years, we will design a theoretical SP-D that binds more effectively to the LPS and pilin
 structures of Pa. We will test the efficacy of binding through in vitro binding assays. Beyond
 five years, we will refine our SP-D model and test in vivo.
The vision of this research program is to bring an integrated approach that synergizes
computational tools and experimental validations, to deepen our foundational knowledge of
glycan-collectin interactions and their broader implications."

Cryptosporidiosis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium, poses a significant global
health threat, particularly affecting young children in developing regions and immunocompromised individuals.
Despite its severity, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapies available, highlighting the urgent
need for innovative solutions.
This research proposal addresses this critical gap by focusing on two key objectives: establishing reliable small
mouse models of cryptosporidiosis and unraveling the intricacies of IFN-γ responses during C. parvum
infection. Our preliminary data underscore the significance of the TLR11/TLR12 complex in detecting
Cryptosporidium and regulating IFN-γ-mediated immune responses. Additionally, we have developed mouse
models with cell-specific deficiencies in IFN-γ production and responsiveness, providing valuable tools to
enhance our understanding of host defense against Cryptosporidium.
The primary objective of this project is to elucidate the fundamental pathways governing the host's ability to
combat C. parvum infections at mucosal sites. To achieve this, our research is structured around specific aims
that explore the roles of TLR and IFN-γ pathways in mucosal immunity. This knowledge will provide insights
into the molecular and cellular responses that ultimately determine the outcome of C. parvum infections at
mucosal sites. Our research endeavors aim to contribute to the development of innovative strategies to combat
this devastating disease."

Healthy individuals have a tremendous intrinsic ability to heal after injury. Wound repair involves complex and
coordinated actions of various cell types acting across three sequential healing phases: Inflammatory,
Proliferative and Resolution. Efficient wound repair requires a timely progression from one phase of healing to
the next, with the ultimate goal of returning the injured tissue to homeostasis. Wounds of the oral cavity heal
faster than skin wounds, and their phases of healing are optimized to result in a more regenerative outcome. In
contrast, the phases of healing become corrupted by chronic diseases, leading to, on one extreme,
pathological tissue under-healing (as in diabetic and chronic wounds) and on the other extreme, pathological
tissue over-healing (as in carcinogenesis). However, studies that directly compare models of reparative skin
healing with optimized oral healing, or with disease models of pathological under- or over-healing, are lacking.
The overall goal of this MIRA research proposal is to understand the progression of healing phases across
differential healing outcomes at the spatio-temporal single cell level. We aim to discover critical junctions along
the healing continuum where healing becomes optimized (as in oral wounds) or pathological (as in chronic
wounds and tumors). Our approaches are innovative because we will use state-of-the-art single cell and spatial
sequencing technologies combined within a new spatio-temporal analytical framework to systematically
compare cell type dynamics, cell-cell interactions and cell-specific gene regulatory networks across mouse
models of successful and pathological healing.
In the first project, we will generate a new spatial single cell dataset of oral wound healing and use our
network-based analytical framework to identify cell-specific spatio-temporal gene signatures that distinguish
optimized oral healing from reparative skin healing. In the second project, we will apply this analytical
framework to identify healing-associated bottlenecks in datasets of pathological under-healing (diabetic skin
injury model) and over-healing (oral and skin carcinogenesis models). We will validate our findings using
existing datasets of human pathology, including those from diabetic chronic wounds and skin/oral cancers, and
then experimentally using orthogonal methods in cell and animal models of wound healing and carcinogenesis.
Overall, this proposal will increase our understanding of the complex cell population dynamics that result in
reparative, optimized or pathological healing outcomes. The projects will result in novel phase-resolved and
cell-specific gene expression signatures that describe healing-related stages of disease progression in
under-healing diabetic wounds and over-healing tumors. These signatures will have diagnostic, prognostic and
therapeutic value for targeting of specific cells and pathways, with the ultimate goal of promoting the healing of
surgical, traumatic and chronic wounds as well as inhibiting cancer progression."
10924679,"Project Summary/Abstract
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV virtually eliminates transmission of HIV from
mothers to their infants. However, adherence to PMTCT (i.e., adherence to antiretroviral therapy, infant
prophylaxis, and exclusive breastfeeding) during pregnancy and the postpartum period is challenging, with
evidence from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) showing suboptimal adherence and persistent viremia among
perinatal women. As a consequence, rates of vertical HIV transmission remain unacceptably high. Perinatal
depression is a major driver of women’s poor adherence to PMTCT. Interventions that involve male partners to
provide social and food/economic support could be a promising approach for addressing perinatal depression
and PMTCT, yet few interventions have intervened with couples to improve systems of support,
communication, and other dyadic processes. We propose to develop and test a couple-based approach to
intervene on the mother’s perinatal depressive symptoms and to strengthen the relationship and support
system for partners to work together around depression to improve PMTCT adherence. The study will take
place in antenatal and HIV care settings in Zomba, Malawi. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a couple-
based intervention to target perinatal depression based on an evidence-based approach using problem-solving
therapy (PST), augmented with content on couple communication and problem-solving skills; and (2) to assess
the feasibility and acceptability (F&A) of the intervention via a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). For Aim
1, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to develop the intervention manual, study procedures, and data
collection instruments and conduct 5 focus group discussions with the target population of couples and key
stakeholders to obtain feedback on the intervention content and materials. For Aim 2, we will recruit 60
pregnant women living with HIV with a positive screen for depressive symptoms and their male partners from
antenatal/HIV clinics. Couples will be randomized to the intervention or a standard of care control (30 couples
per arm) and followed for 3 months postpartum. Primary outcomes will focus on feasibility and acceptability
metrics (e.g., enrollment rates, satisfaction levels, retention, and participation rates). Exploratory analyses will
examine preliminary effects on the mother’s perinatal depression symptoms, adherence to PMTCT, food
insecurity, and mediating variables such as couple communication. We will also examine whether effects on
social support and the mother’s depression are attenuated for couples in which both partners have depression
at baseline. In a subset of 15 couples, we will conduct exit interviews to contextualize F&A data, and will
analyze the mixed-methods data to refine the intervention for a full RCT. Our short-term goal is the produce a
couple-focused PST intervention that can be added to the global health toolkit for treating depression in
perinatal women. Our long-term goal is to produce a high-impact and sustainable intervention leveraging the
couple relationship that can be scaled-up to address depression, PMTCT adherence, and family health."

This proposal addresses NIMH’s call for HIV vaccine preparedness and “HIV vaccine-related” communication
research (Notice of Special Interest NOT-MH-21-105). Though vaccines may be years away, the NOSI
recognizes that the time to conduct rigorous HIV vaccine communication research is now – to advance the
basic science of effective HIV vaccine messaging and get ahead of misinformation.
HIV disproportionately impacts young Black women living in the Southern US. Black women make up 13% of
the female population in the US, yet make up 54% of new HIV infections among women in the US. These
disparities are most extreme in the South, where black women account for 72% of new HIV infections among
women. These data highlight the urgent need to develop and scale-up biomedical HIV prevention strategies
centered on the unique needs of Black women in the South. Herein, we propose to develop and test a multi-
component communications intervention to promote uptake of a future HIV vaccine, as part of a
comprehensive set of strategies for HIV prevention, among Black women ages 18–34 in the South. Our
diverse team of HIV clinicians, behavioral scientists and health communication experts includes faculty from
Texas Southern University, the 2nd largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the US. This
five-year study will take place in Houston, Texas, an epicenter of the HIV epidemic in the US South. We will
use community based participatory research methods (CBPR) and Community Engagement Studios to engage
young Black women in co-creating and testing communication content across multiple components (i.e., words,
graphics, videos). To increase uptake of a future HIV vaccine, we will conduct the following aims: 1) Assess
barriers and facilitators to uptake of a future HIV vaccine within the larger family of biomedical HIV prevention
tools, 2) Co-create theory-based message features (i.e., strategic word choice/ framing), graphics, and short
videos (30-120 seconds) for uptake of a future HIV vaccine. Theory-based features include enhanced active
choice, protective agency assignment, autonomy restoration, anticipated affect. 3) Evaluate the effect of
different theory-based message features, graphics and videos on HIV vaccine and prevention intention. We will
evaluate effects in three separate randomized trials of young Black women. This proposal takes a rigorous
approach to understanding the basic behavioral science of HIV vaccine communication. Communications
research is needed to understand how to develop messages that address distinct barriers to seeking out HIV
prevention (i.e., stigma, discrimination, medical mistrust, low risk perception, lack of awareness or knowledge)
and at the same time, leverage personal and social factors that resonate with Black women (e.g., social
networks, peer structures, and images and narratives that tap into the lived experiences of Black women). If
successful, this model of message design may translate to other long-acting forms of HIV prevention in
development (e.g. once a year implants, injectables, and broadly neutralizing antibody infusions)."

11178288,"To provide support to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC for implementation of a nationally representative health interview survey questions inquiring about taste & smell and communication disorders and disabilities of voice, swallowing, speech, and language in both childhood and adults. Communication disabilities, including voice, swallowing, speech, and language disabilities, can profoundly affect a person’s life and health; impacting the ability to work, interact socially and engage during health care encounters. Adults with communication disabilities are at risk for decreased quality of life, health status, and health care services received. Targeted interventions delivered in a community or medical setting, including speech-language pathology services, and occupational support can potentially mitigate these risks. Few current epidemiological studies have explored the prevalence of communication disorders and their associated etiologies in the United States.

While voice, swallowing, speech, and language disorders are distinct disabilities with different biological mechanisms, they can all cause a person to have difficulty communicating and thus are collectively referred to as communication disorders. Multiple national surveys, including the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey – Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), and the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, collect information on the prevalence of disability in the United States, but these surveys do not specifically identify or distinguish between voice, swallowing, speech, and language disorders.

Persons with voice, swallowing, speech, and language disorders represent about 10 percent of the US population. Adults with communication disorders have about a two-fold increased risk of also having chronic diseases (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, emphysema, asthma, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis). They are also much more likely to report their general health status as “fair/poor” compared to adults without communication disorders. While adults with communication disorders more frequently use healthcare, they have greater difficulty accessing healthcare than those without communication disorders.

Communication disorders are treated by speech-language therapists or pathologists, who are specialists trained and licensed to diagnose and treat communication disorders. Because physical, neurological, or psychological conditions are frequently either responsible for or are related to these disorders, the therapist often works as a member of a health care team. Communication disorders caused by disease, injury, or malformation will normally require the services of a physician or surgeon. After medical problems are treated, the speech-language therapist is responsible for helping the patient improve communications ability. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide screening, assessment, treatment, consultation and education for voice, speech, language, or swallowing problems in adults.

SLPs also treat children who have difficulty understanding or using language, producing speech sounds correctly, feeding/ swallowing, stuttering or voice problems. About 1 in 12 children aged 3 to 17 years in the United States have had voice, speech, and language disorders during the past year. These disorders are often linked to problems with behavior or development. Early evaluation by a speech-language pathologist can help families identify these disorders and get the right treatment for their child.

To function in our society, we must be able to communicate effectively. Despite valuable scientific and technological advances, many aspects of modern life remain profoundly difficult for an individual with a voice, swallowing, speech, or language disorder. These disorders often affect a person's emotional and social life and can compromise educational and job or employment opportunities.

10866503,"Disrupted sleep is a major predictor of disordered cognition and affect, yet many questions regarding sleep's role in
brain function remain unanswered. For example, why is sleep critical for memory consolidation? Why is there
ubiquitous (presumably, evolutionarily conserved) wake-non-rapid eye movement (NREM)-REM sleep state
ordering across species, and what are the differential roles of the two sleep states? How do brain circuit-wide
dynamics change during these states, and how do those transitions affect the process of memory consolidation?
Wake, NREM, and REM states generate distinct patterns of functional connectivity, which may help to reorganize
brain networks in the context of memory storage. However, multiple mechanisms could play a role in this process,
including state-driven structural (synaptic) changes, neuromodulatory processes, spike timing, or input alterations.
This proposal advances the novel hypothesis that sequential in brain networks' acetylcholine (ACh) signaling and
input properties, associated with wake->NREM->REM state transitions, are essential for memory storage In this
framework, each state plays a distinct role, associated with state-specific network excitatory/inhibitory balance and
neurons' input-response properties. Together, this leads to differential circuit activation and dynamic properties
during wake, NREM, and REM. Our preliminary network modeling data suggest that the specific properties of NREM
and REM allow for recruitment of neuronal populations into individual engrams (NREM), and generation of distinct,
segregated engram representations (REM). These features become critical during consolidation of one or multiple
memories, respectively. Here, we propose to apply computational modeling, in vivo experimentation and analytical
tools to identify NREM (low ACh) and REM (high ACh)-associated dynamical states, and the specific contribution of
these states to information storage in neural circuits. Specifically we will: 1) measure state-associated ACh effects
on functional network connectivity and dynamics in highly reduced in silico neural network models, 2) test effects of
state-targeted manipulations to hippocampal ACh inputs and excitatory-inhibitory balance during consolidation of
one, or multiple, sleep-dependent memories, and 3) develop a predictive in silico model of the hippocampal circuit's
reorganization during memory encoding and subsequent wake->NREM->REM transitions. These studies will also
clarify state-specific mechanisms of memory storage in the brain, and how the wake-NREM-REM sequential
ordering of these states (ubiquitous across vertebrate species) contributes to the process of memory consolidation.
These studies will address Objective 1.1. of the NIMH Strategic Plan for Research, by identifying brain
state-dependent neural circuit mechanisms underlying sleep's role in promoting healthy cognition and memory
storage."
10867475,"There is a central problem in biological learning known as the “credit assignment problem”: how does 
information about the outcome of a decision or behavior modify the right synapses in the right neurons 
across multiple brain regions to improve future performance? The standard solution to this problem in 
artificial neural networks is to perform direct gradient descent, which minimizes error in the output of a 
network by precisely adjusting the strengths of every connection in proportion to that error. However, it is 
unlikely that the brain is able to compute the impact of each synapse on performance error and 
“backpropagate” fine-grained error signals across multiple layers of neuronal circuitry to every synapse. 
Recent work identified a new candidate biological mechanism for supervised learning in the brain. In 
addition to “bottom-up” connections that process sensory inputs, neurons also send “top-down” 
connections to the dendrites of neurons in lower layers. This feedback drives special events called 
“dendritic calcium spikes” that induce a potent form of synaptic plasticity and cause neurons to become 
selective for stimulus features in as few as a single trial, a phenomenon called “one-shot learning.” This 
project aims to develop new learning theory inspired by these experimental observations, and to 
experimentally test predictions of this theory in awake, behaving mice to better understand how top-down 
instructive signals in the brain coordinate learning across multiple layers of neuronal circuitry by regulating 
dendritic calcium spiking and associated plasticity. 
The team synergizes expertise in neuronal cellular and synaptic physiology, systems and computational 
neuroscience, and machine learning to better understand an important cognitive function - memory 
formation during goal-directed learning. A major objective is to develop and critically test a new theory of 
learning based on the regulation of dendritic calcium spikes and associated synaptic plasticity. 
Computational modeling will directly inform the proposed experiments, which entail imaging and 
manipulating neuronal population activity in vivo during spatial foraging behavior in mice. Preliminary 
results suggest that incorporation of these insights from biology into artificial neural networks leads to 
enhanced performance compared to standard techniques, highlighting the transformative potential of the 
proposed approach."
10937800,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The interplay between metabolic and inflammatory processes is critical to maintaining overall health where a
delicate balance exists between pathogen clearance and limiting host tissue damage. Severe bacterial infections
upset this equilibrium and lead to a critical condition known as septicemia, where metabolic and immunologic
dysregulation rapidly overwhelms the body’s defenses and poses a life-threatening challenge. Neutrophils are
crucial in establishing innate immunity and undergo an enigmatic cell death process termed neutrophil
extracellular trap (NET) formation (NETosis) that elicits antimicrobial activities but also induces collateral damage
to host tissues during sepsis. We aim to investigate the intricate mechanisms underlying NETosis and how
shifts in metabolic homeostasis during septicemia antagonize NET formation thereby causing aberrant
inflammation. We previously demonstrated that mitochondrial superoxide production promotes downstream
NETosis, and preliminary data indicate a critical role for lactate in this cascade. My research program aims to
determine (i) how excess lactate during bacterial septicemia antagonizes NETosis and the impact this has on
disease outcome. This study reframes mitochondria as ‘sensory organelles’ within neutrophils that respond to
perturbations in the metabolic environment and dictate downstream inflammatory responses rather than acting
as the ‘powerhouse’ of the cell. These metabolic shifts during sepsis may play a direct role in modulating innate
immunity and (ii) we aim to understand how hyperglycemia and increased lactate availability during septicemia
influence lactylation of histones and downstream gene expression in neutrophils. These studies are aided by our
discovery of a biomarker that transiently accumulates on the surface of neutrophils that accurately predicts
neutrophils that will undergo NETosis 2-3 hr later, which will allow us to decipher transcriptional changes related
to NETosis and contrast transcriptomes across different biologically and clinically relevant bacterial inducers of
sepsis in various tissues during septicemia. While much of this proposal focuses on the impacts of glucose and
lactate and inflammation, the complex metabolic environment during sepsis likely has diverse effects on innate
immunity in differing tissues. Therefore, (iii) we will employ chimeric immune cell editing (CHIME) using small
CRISPR-based libraries to target 40-50 metabolic genes so that each neutrophil in a mouse has a single gene
disrupted. This technology will allow us to decipher the metabolic dependencies driving neutrophil recruitment
and inflammatory processes across differing tissues or in response to common bacterial pathogens associated
with sepsis. These studies are significant as they begin to unravel the mechanistic links between metabolic and
transcriptional dysregulation during sepsis and the impact this has in skewing innate immunity of neutrophils to
combat the invading pathogen or in drive tissue damaging inflammation. In addition, the fundamental insights
resolved from this proposal will establish a scientific and technological foundation to expand into novel metabolic
pathways, other innate immune cells, and/or alternative inflammatory processes and diseases."

Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML) is the most devastating and chronic musculoskeletal injury in which a substantial
amount of muscle is lost due to trauma or surgery and can be life-threatening. Sadly, the current standard of
care, which includes surgical transplantation of allografts or synthetic acellular scaffolds followed by physical
therapy, is limited in efficacy. Tissue-engineered cell-laden synthetic scaffolds are promising; however, cell-based
therapies exhibit immune rejections and inflammation chances. On the contrary, extracellular vesicles (EVs)
have been proven to demonstrate a strong potential as a ‘cell-free’ regenerative medicine to promote muscle
regeneration. However, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs depends on their parent cells’ state and can be
engineered to promote myogenesis, leading to functional muscle regeneration. Hence, the long-term objective
of this R03 project is to establish the foundation for developing ‘customized’ therapeutic nEVs as a promising
regenerative medicine for VML treatment. Specifically, the primary research goal of this pilot R03 is to develop
customized therapeutic exosomes (a sub-type of EVs, nEVs) using controlled piezoelectric stimulation of parent
adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) to enhance myogenesis in recipient muscle cells. There are
two primary hypotheses. First, nEV formation and content can be customized, i.e., modulated by controlled
pre-conditioning parent cells, i.e., by influencing the cellular microenvironment. Second, the customized nEV
cargo can influence biological functions in recipient cells, affecting myogenesis. To test the hypotheses, we have
designed two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the impact of piezoelectric stimulation on nEV
formation and content from ADSCs. Briefly, we will utilize controlled piezoelectric stimulation to analyze its
influence on ADSCs-derived nEV formation and content. We will use Small RNA sequencing to identify
modulated micro-RNA (miRNAs) in the piezoelectric stimulation pre-conditioned nEVs (piezo-nEVs). In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the myogenic efficacy of piezo-nEVs. Specifically, we aim to understand how piezo-
nEVs interact with recipient C2C12s muscle cells and influence myogenic differentiation. We will determine the
definite pathways by which piezo-nEVs interact with C2C12s. We will utilize standard immunohistochemistry and
western blotting to study the mechanistic interactions of the piezo-nEVs with recipient C2C12s. Successful
completion of this project will yield the following outcomes: 1) the development of customizable nEVs using
piezoelectric stimulation pre-conditioning of parent ADSCs, 2) an in-depth fundamental analysis of how
piezoelectric stimulation can influence the development of therapeutic nEVs with modulated miRNA, and 3)
determine the therapeutic efficacy of piezo-nEVs in terms of influencing myogenesis. The results from this pilot
R03 project will serve as a proof-of-concept for follow-up R01 studies and set the foundation for developing
customized therapeutic nEVs as a promising medicine for functional muscle regeneration and treating VML."

Nearly 40% of adolescents suffer from an anxiety disorder or major depression. These disorders usually first
emerge during adolescence, and the adverse consequences of them often persist into adulthood. As such,
adolescence is a critical developmental period for understanding the biological pathways related to these
disorders. Poor inter-rater reliability and discriminability of anxiety and depressive disorders has been a major
factor in the NIMH RDoC framework emphasizing the need for studies pairing measures of brain processes
with dimensional approaches to psychiatric symptomatology. In line with this framework, the goal of this
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to provide the applicant with the training necessary to identify
distinct developmental neural features that are related to shared symptoms across anxiety and depression
(distress), as well as neural features that are related to disorder-specific symptoms of anxiety (anxious
apprehension) and depression (low positive affect). Furthermore, the applicant will require genetics training to
succeed in the goal of quantifying the relative contribution of genetic influence vs. unique environmental
influence on the neural features related to anxiety and depression symptomatology. In order to achieve such
goals, the applicant will receive unparalleled mentorship by experts in psychopathology, genetics, and
advanced neuroimaging methodologies (Drs. D. Barch, N. Dosenbach, A. Agrawal, J. Constantino, J. Luby, C.
Sylvester, and D. Greene) and will have access to superb clinical, imaging, and recruitment resources at
Washington University. The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to achieve several short-term
goals necessary to facilitate his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator at a Research-I
University, including new training in psychopathology and genetics (twin designs). These training goals will be
advanced through the proposed research. First, clinical data and functional connectivity (FC) MRI data within
the large Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) sample (n=11,875) will be used to identify and
replicate the neural signatures (biotypes) related to transdiagnostic and disorder-specific symptoms of anxiety
and depression (Aim 1). A subset of this dataset (ABCD twin dataset; n=800 twin pairs) will be leveraged to
assess the heritability of these biotype/symptom relationships (Aim 2.1). Capitalizing on recent advances in FC
MRI data acquisition enabling reliable quantification of individual-level FC (precision functional mapping), the
applicant will quantify the genetic vs. unique environmental influence on biotype/symptom relationships,
pointing towards potential unique causal pathways and unique intervention pathways (Aim 2.2). Notably, the
proposed methods can be extended to other developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for
early individualized treatment intervention. With a research program that employs multiple converging
techniques and analysis methods to interrogate biomarkers of symptoms related to anxiety and depression, the
applicant will continue to address research questions relevant to the NIMH throughout his independent career."

The mission of the Stanford BSSR Pre-Doctoral Training Program at the Intersection of Data Sciences with
Behavioral, Social, and Population Health Research is to develop a cross-campus collaborative training
program to provide talented pre-doctoral students with advanced specialized training at the intersections of
social and behavioral health science, social epidemiology, data science, and population health. We are
building a new team that spans the Stanford campus including faculty from 6 schools and 11 departments. We
will provide a transformative multi-disciplinary predoctoral training environment that draws mentors from
diverse fields (health and social psychology, medical sociology, social epidemiology, communications, health
economics, business, education, law) and quantitative disciplines (computer science, informatics, statistics).
The graduates of our program will have rigorous training in their own scientific disciplines, combined with
extensive expertise working on a broad range of innovative research projects that rely on data of primarily two
types: (1) intensive or voluminous longitudinal data from mHealth, smartphone and sensor technologies or
electronic health records, and/or (2) large and complex data from internet, commercial, health administrative
records, large population databases, internet data and social media platforms, crowd sourcing, and citizen
science data. Predoctoral trainees in their first or second year of graduate studies will be admitted from
programs in health psychology, medical sociology, social/behavioral epidemiology, health economics or
another social science discipline. We are requesting support for 5 pre-doctoral students per year whose
training will last 2 or more years. They will emerge from the program with a thorough understanding of their
own fundamental discipline combined with advanced expertise in cutting-edge statistical and computational
methods for analyzing increasingly complex and multidimensional longitudinal sets. The training program
components will include both department or discipline-specific training in addition to program-wide data
science components including: (1) innovative curriculum, including specialized quantitative curriculum
customized to the experience and background of each trainee; (2) a mentored research experience with a dual
mentor model (one disciplinary mentor, one methodological mentor); (3) exposure to team science approaches
to problem solving, including design thinking, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and team building; (4)
experiential components, including availability of Stanford dry-lab rotations and short-term internships in Silicon
Valley companies; (5) forums for intellectual exchanges; and (6) many opportunities to develop professional
skills in grant writing and collaboration. BSSR graduates will have the capability to conduct cutting edge
research on behavioral and social, and health issues, as well as prevention and treatment interventions that
have the potential to reduce the risks of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and improve outcomes
among patients with these disorders."
10906747,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The invention of new therapeutics is a multidisciplinary endeavor in which chemistry plays a crucial
role. Following the discovery of a target responsible for a disease—generally a protein—chemists are tasked to
provide small-molecule inhibitors or agonists that will selectively bind to the target receptor and induce a
cascade of molecular events responsible for improving the patient’s condition. Identification of a drug candidate
combining potency, efficacy, low toxicity, and desirable pharmacokinetics requires an intense synthetic effort
during which thousands of molecules are created by diversification of a bioactive scaffold. In order to support
these drug discovery campaigns, there is a constant need to invent new methods allowing for selective
modifications of complex molecules including peptides, carbohydrates, and other natural products. Once a
drug candidate is nominated, chemists need to devise a scalable process route that meets cost, safety, and
FDA requirements, which is another opportunity for chemical innovation. Some pharmaceuticals might have
poor physical properties and/or stability, which might necessitate the development of polymeric drug-delivery
systems to fully achieve their potential. These intricate macromolecules represent another type of synthetic
challenge since they are designed to release their cargo upon external stimulation, for example, via a subtle
pH or temperature change. This research program seeks to deliver new methods of widespread interest and to
illustrate their relevance to pharmaceutical research by delineating efficient syntheses of challenging small
molecules and stimuli-responsive polymers.
 The overarching theme of this proposal is the transformation of primary amines—one of the most
ubiquitous groups in natural and synthetic molecules—into a variety of linkages including C–C, C–H, C–F, and
C–B bonds via C–N activation. In the first section, a click reaction will be developed to transform primary
amines into sulfamides. These rather exotic groups will be investigated as hydrogen-bond donors in polymeric
and bioactive molecules, as well as precursors for a C–N activation platform. Furthermore, as a click linker,
sulfamides will serve to selectively functionalize peptides and aminoglycosides. A collaboration will also be
launched to develop this reaction as a tool for peptide macrocyclization. The second section explores the
potential of sulfamides as progenitors of radical pairs, whose subsequent recombination will afford an array of
aliphatic C–C bond formations. The last section hypothesizes that sulfamides can also be transformed via
transition-metal catalysis, which would open the door to (hetero)arylation, fluorination, and borylation reactions,
among others. These mechanistically distinct C–N activation processes will be applied to the functionalization
of bioactive molecules and polymeric architectures for drug delivery."
10906750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurochemical signaling within immune organs, like the lymph node, remains challenging to probe with existing
technology yet knowing the mechanisms and function of this signaling would positively impact our understanding
of immunity. Our long-term goal is to understand neurochemical regulated immunity during inflammation,
autoimmunity, and even depression. To achieve this goal, new analytical tools are needed which can capture rapid
neurochemical signaling in intact immune organs with high spatial resolution. The specific objective of this proposal
is to develop and validate methods using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-based microelectrodes to
detect norepinephrine, ATP, and melatonin in slices of the mesenteric lymph node (mLN). All three neurochemicals
are important for either triggering or suppressing immune responses within the gut-immune system; however, the
dynamics and mechanisms by which they function are not understood. The rationale for this proposal is that the
development of new tools to monitor rapid neurochemical signaling in an intact mLN will provide knowledge of
neuroimmune communication dynamics in the gut which could lead to sophisticated neurochemical-targeted
therapies for gastrointestinal inflammation and an improved understanding of the gut-brain axis. The proposal will
be completed by the following three specific aims: (1) Develop innovative electrochemical methods to detect and
validate neuronal norepinephrine release in live mLN slices, (2) Develop anion-exchange doped carbon-fiber
microelectrodes for sensitive ATP detection in the mLN, and (3) Develop fouling-resistant sensors for multiplexed
detection of melatonin with catecholamines in the mLN. We will pursue these aims with an innovative approach
combining the power of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry’s high temporal resolution and spatial resolution with detection
in live slices of the lymph node. This work is also innovative because new carbon electrodes and surface
chemistries will be developed for targeted-analyte detection. This work is significant because the tools developed
will help shift the paradigm that immunomodulation is slow and will impact our understanding of neuroimmune
communication mechanisms and dynamics, specifically within the gut-immune system. Tools to detect rapid
concentrations fluctuations in norepinephrine, ATP, and melatonin are also significant because they are not only
involved in immunomodulation in the immune system, but are heavily involved in signaling throughout the body.
The tools are translatable to any biological system. The expected outcome is a new toolbox for high temporal
resolution detection of neurochemicals in the lymph node which will lead to an improved understanding of the
mechanism and function of neurochemical signaling in spatially-resolved regions of mLN during conditions of health
and inflammation. This work will have a positive impact on how neuroimmune communication is studied, and will
advance current knowledge of neurotransmitter regulated immunity leading to advancements in targeted
immunotherapies for autoimmunity, cancer, and disease."
10906848,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The treatment of patients with Huntington disease (HD) is quickly entering a new era, with gene-
silencing and disease-modifying therapies now in clinical trials. While current studies include patients with
motor manifest disease, future clinical trials will require interventions in presymptomatic HD gene carriers in the
hope of altering the course of the disease prior to the onset of motor symptoms. However, the critical question
remains how to target potential therapies and measure outcomes in the large and heterogenous population of
youth and young adults at risk for HD. Recent longitudinal studies have shown that cognitive and behavioral
changes emerge decades before motor symptom onset, but the full spectrum of these symptoms has not yet
been well-defined, and precisely which symptoms occur first and how to measure them remain matters of
debate in the field. Furthermore, data on individuals under age 18 are largely lacking.
 Our preliminary data demonstrate that children who are at risk for HD face a multitude of challenges,
including executive dysfunction, chronic stress, impaired coping skills, and significantly elevated
neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and impulsive behaviors. However, the
neurobiological basis of these symptoms, social and environmental contributing factors, and the potential
impacts of mutant huntingtin protein and aberrant neurodevelopment remain unknown.
 The aims of this career development award are (1) to investigate the association between CAG repeat
expansion, adverse childhood experiences, and externalizing risk-taking behavior in youth at risk for HD; (2) to
examine alterations in response inhibition that may underlie impulsive behaviors in this cohort; and (3) to
identify neurophysiological markers of inhibitory control that may represent modifiable treatment targets for
future therapeutic trials.
 This proposal is supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in neuropsychiatric
manifestations of neurodegenerative disorders, child psychology and human development, and
electrophysiology. My overarching goal is to become an independent physician-scientist with unique expertise
in the assessment of prodromal behavioral manifestations as early markers of neurodegenerative conditions.
This proposal will build on my previous experience and will provide a unique training opportunity to develop
new skills in neurophysiology, longitudinal data analysis, and the application of current neurodevelopmental
models of psychological disorders that will allow me to conduct future independent investigations examining
the developmental course of aberrant behaviors and impulse control in a prospective, longitudinal cohort from
youth to adulthood. This work will fill a critical gap in our knowledge regarding the earliest manifestations of HD
and will help to better target potential treatments during the premanifest phase of the disease."
10906849,"All viruses rely on host translational machinery for protein synthesis. As such, translation
control constitutes a universal host defense against viruses. A new understanding on how host
regulates translation in response to viral infection and how viruses evade this host response will
provide fundamental insight into viral pathogenesis and benefit the development of new antiviral
strategies.
 Poxviruses include some dangerous emerging pathogens as well as some promising vaccine
vectors. Unlike many other viruses, poxvirus host range is not affected by the entry step but
restricted by intracellular processes. Particularly, cellular translational control pathways have a
profound impact on poxvirus host range, and poxvirus inhibitors of these pathways could
manifest as critical host-range factors. The best-known example is PKR-mediated control of
translation initiation and its antagonism by two vaccinia virus (VACV) host-range proteins E3
and K3. Much less is understood about a PKR-independent pathway targeted by two critical
VACV host-range proteins, K1 and C7. VACV with deletion in both K1 and C7 fails to replicate
in most mammalian cells due to a shut-off of viral and host protein synthesis. Intriguingly, the
translational shut-off is independent of PKR and RNaseL and appears not to involve any
translation initiation factors. A paralogous pair of interferon-stimulated genes, SAMD9 and
SAMD9L (SAMD9&L), were recently identified by us and others as the specific targets of K1
and C7. However, how they regulate protein synthesis and restrict poxvirus host range is
unknown and is the focus of this proposal.
 We have made sustained contributions to the understanding of K1/C7 and their cellular
targets for over a decade, including the determination of the structures of K1/C7 and the
identification of SAMD9L as a cellular target of K1/C7. In addition, we have obtained compelling
preliminary data that led to our novel hypotheses, which will be addressed separately with the
following specific aims.
Aim 1. To determine how SAMD9 is activated to inhibit protein synthesis.
Aim 2. To determine how activated SAMD9 inhibits protein synthesis.
Aim 3. To determine the molecular basis underlying the host species-specific SAMD9&L
inhibition by OPXV inhibitors."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting >450M people worldwide and
>34M in the US alone; >26% of Americans aged ≥65 years have T2D. T2D incidence and prevalence are
increasing rapidly. In the US, direct medical costs of diabetes in 2017 were estimated at $237 billion, ~15% of
all US health-care costs. The goals of the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION)
study are to identify genetic variants, genes, and mechanisms that influence T2D risk and variability in T2D-
related quantitative traits (QTs), and to foster clinical translation of these findings. Improved understanding of
the genetic bases of T2D and related QTs has the potential to reduce the impact of the T2D epidemic by
supporting identification of novel therapies, enabling better targeting of therapies, providing more accurate risk
prediction, and advising lifestyle changes in at-risk individuals. In this competing renewal, we will
a. discover and fine map genetic loci that influence T2D risk and QT variability using array- and sequence-
 based GWAS in our FUSION, METSIM, and MGI cohorts, and through meta-analysis of Finnish, European,
 and diverse multi-ancestry samples;
b. select individuals with and without high-interest T2D- and QT-associated variants for genotype-based
 callback and targeted phenotyping to test for association and identify physiological mechanisms;
c. use skeletal muscle data (bulk and single-nucleus) to understand how cell-type composition, chromatin
 accessibility, DNA methylation, gene expression, and metabolites vary by sex, T2D, QTs, and genetic
 variants, and to identify cell-type molecular QTLs that colocalize with T2D and QT GWAS;
d. use iPSC-derived beta cells to understand how chromatin accessibility and gene expression vary by
 developmental stage and glucose stimulation, and identify stage-specific, accessible-chromatin enrichment
 for T2D and QT GWAS signals; and
e. accelerate advances in T2D genetics through enhanced data sharing and support for easy exploration and
 visualization of our study results by any investigator.
Successful completion of these aims will improve our understanding of T2D etiology, point the way to novel
methods of prevention and treatment, and help address the public health crisis posed by T2D. The
longstanding, productive collaboration of our FUSION study team makes achievement of these aims feasible.
Methods developed and lessons learned here will be useful in the study of other human diseases and traits."

 A major impediment to adult emergency department (ED)-based HIV/HCV screening success is that often
ED patients at risk for, or later diagnosed with, HIV and HCV decline testing. However, for patients who
decline HIV/HCV screening, there is no evidence-based intervention to persuade them to be tested.
 In response to the deficit of an intervention to increase ED HIV/HCV screening acceptance, we recently
completed an R34 project during which we developed a persuasive health communication intervention (PHCI)
with stakeholder assistance (ED patients, HIV/HCV counselors, and ED medical staff). In two pilot studies, we
examined the efficacy of the PHCI among adult ED patients who initially declined HIV/HCV screening. In one
pilot study, adult ED patients assigned to watch a control condition video were more likely to agree to be tested
than those who received the PHCI in-person from an HIV/HCV counselor (n=56, 27% vs. 10%; ∆17%, ∆95% CI:
6-32%). However, in a separate pilot study, adult ED patients randomly assigned to watch a video of a
physician delivering the PCHI to an ED patient were more likely to agree to be tested than those who watched
the control condition video (n=60, 29% vs. 11%; ∆18%, ∆95% CI: 7-35%). These results suggest that the PHCI
video might increase HIV/HCV screening acceptance more than a PHCI delivered in-person by an HIV/HCV
counselor. If these results are confirmed in a larger study, the PHCI video could enable wider usage of the
PHCI and facilitate greater acceptance of ED HIV/HCV screening. Unfortunately, in our R34 project we did not
develop nor evaluate the PHCI among current and former people who inject drugs (PWIDs). As such, the
current PHCI might be inadequate in persuading current/former PWIDs to be tested, and thus needs
modification with the help of current/former PWIDs to be effective for these very high HIV/HCV-risk patients.
 In this R01 project, we first will modify the PHCI with input from current/former PWIDs. Next, we will
conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to compare the PHCI’s efficacy when delivered by a video vs. an
HIV/HCV counselor. Adult ED patients who declined HIV/HCV screening will be stratified by IDU history: (1)
current/former PWIDs or (2) never/non-PWIDs. Within each of these strata, we will randomly assign
participants to a PHCI delivered by (1) video (2) HIV/HCV counselor. Current/former PWIDs will receive the
PHCI modified for PWIDs, whereas never/non-PWIDs will receive the non-modified, original PHCI version.
 For Aim 1, we will determine which delivery form of the PHCI (video or HIV/HCV counselor) results in more
ED patients accepting HIV/HCV screening, independent of their history of IDU. For Aim 2, we will determine
which delivery form of the PHCI results in more ED patients accepting HIV/HCV screening within each IDU
history cohort (current/former PWIDs, never/non-PWIDs), and if testing acceptance is similar across IDU
history cohorts. For Aim 3, we will further compare the two PHCI delivery forms through a health economics
assessment, both independent of IDU history and within each IDU history cohort."

The Haskell-KU Bridge V Program supports students from Haskell Indian Nations University who seek to
develop careers in biomedical, bioengineering, behavioral and environmental health fields by transferring to
the University of Kansas (KU) to access degree options not available at Haskell. This 20-year old program
has a history of collaboration between institutions, as well as among other NIH- training and workforce
development programs, to ensure a high rate of American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) achieve
Bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields that can lead to biomedical careers. The overarching goal is for AI/AN
trainees to see a place for themselves in bioscience careers, to build the skills and resources they need to
succeed, and to create a compassionate community of mentors invested in the success of trainees. This
vision is accomplished through four objectives, which may be conceptualized as forming a staircase to help
students unlock their chosen bioscience career. First, the applicant pool will be expanded by increasing
program visibility and appeal to the particular needs of AI/AN Haskell students (Objective 1). The program will
produce well-trained AI/AN scientists through an integrated succession of skills training, mentored research,
and professional development activities (Objective 2). Program activities are designed to build a strong cohort
of trainees that develop a sense of science identity, self-efficacy, and connection with the KU and broader
scientific community (Objective 3). KU mentors will be prepared for meeting the unique needs of Haskell
trainees by providing evidence-based mentor orientation and training (Objective 4). This program renewal
puts an increased emphasis on sequential training and meeting the specific needs of AI/AN trainees with a
focus on: 1) developing interest in the program by creating and event with Distinguished Native Scientists
describing how their work contributes to improving Native communities, 2) connecting students to the Kansas
biocareers ecosystem through programming from a public-private partnership, 3) the increased use of career
and professional development tools early in the trainee’s development, by implementing activities from the
Entering Research curriculum, 4) closer interactions with program alumni to better build communities of
practice, which are informal mentoring and learning communities, and 5) technical, operational and
professional skills development through a detailed two-year sequence designed to create close cohorts of
students. Program activities will be integrative with those of other existing diversity-promoting KU programs
such as the newly funded NIH Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) program, expanding the
community accessed by Bridge trainees at KU. The sequential, additive nature of these objectives builds a
program that students engage with in three phases: 1) pre-Bridge, 2) the Basic Skills Year (Year 1), and 3)
the Community Building Year (Year 2). Completing these three phases allows for a higher success rate for
Haskell trainees to transfer to KU and complete their degrees by building both confidence and community."

Despite their small size, bacterial cells precisely synchronize cellular processes in space and time. The cell
envelopes of bacteria are complex and dynamic structures that are coordinately assembled during the cell cycle.
Cell wall anchored surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are major cell envelope components, which are
secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane and covalently attached to cell wall peptidoglycan by sortase A
(SrtA). Strikingly, many surface proteins contain a specific YSIRK/G-S signal peptide that targets proteins to the
cross-wall during cell division. Coordinated with cell division and cell wall synthesis, cross-wall targeting
promotes efficient incorporation of surface proteins to the newly synthesized cross-wall peptidoglycan; however,
the mechanisms remain unknown. It has been proposed that the YSIRK/G-S signal peptide promotes localized
secretion at the division septum. However, by developing a new microscopy method in our model organism of
Staphylococcus aureus, we now provide evidence that in contrast to the prevailing model, the targeting does not
occur during secretion, but rather is SrtA-dependent. We further discovered that cross-wall targeting is regulated
by another important cell envelope component: LtaS-mediated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) synthesis and D-
alanylation of teichoic acids. Intriguingly, LTA synthesis and D-alanylation regulate different biogenesis stages:
LTA regulates SrtA-mediated septal anchoring whereas D-alanylation modulates cross-wall deposition.
Collectively, these recent discoveries from my own lab form the foundation of my independent research program
for this MIRA application. We will elucidate the distinct mechanisms by which the YSIRK/G-S signal peptide, LTA
synthesis and D-alanylation spatially regulate surface protein biogenesis during the cell cycle. Successful
completion of the research projects will not only reveal novel mechanisms underlying surface protein biogenesis
in Gram-positive bacteria, but also uncover novel functions of LTA and D-alanylation in cell envelope assembly,
providing fundamental insight into how bacterial cells precisely coordinate cell envelope assembly during growth
and cell division."

Cell fate engineering, for example the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or
the direct conversion among somatic cell types, holds great promise to improve disease
modeling, drug screening, and to lead to regenerative medicine therapies. However, our
ability to engineering cell fate with fidelity has been impeded by an incomplete
understanding of inter- and intracellular networks that govern differentiation, and by the
lack of adequate computational tools to distill accurate and testable hypothesis from the
mountains of data coming from single cell omics technologies. In the initial period of
funding under the MIRA, we started to address these challenges by developing novel
theoretical and computational methods to define cell type identity from single cell RNA-
Seq (scRNA-Seq) data with an emphasis on developmental cell types that emerge
during mesoderm development and subsequent commitment to lineages of the synovial
joint. As part of this work, we generated scRNA-Seq data of the developing synovial
joint, we adopted a pluripotent stem cell-to-chondrocyte differentiation protocol, and we
invented a generally applicable platform for assessing cell type identity at the single cell
level of resolution. We also developed a computational method to infer dynamic
regulatory networks accurately and to integrate them with signaling pathways. Now, we
propose to address the following unanswered questions and unmet challenges. First,
we will substantially improve and extend our computational methods that assess the
outcomes of cell fate engineering by extending them to more data types, and thus
increasing the comprehensiveness of its results, and by predicting not only cell identity
but function. Second, we will substantially improve and extend our regulatory network
tools so that their predictions are statistically calibrated and so that they can be applied
to chromatin accessibility and expression data simultaneously with the intention of
discovering binding site motifs of orphan transcription factors. Third, we will devise and
experimentally test computational methods to generate reliable cell fate engineering
recipes that account for not only transcriptional networks but also how signaling
pathways inform them, and that account for temporal dynamics. Finally, we will follow
up on observations from applying our dynamic network tool to in vitro gastrulation that
indicates that some signaling pathways influence differentiation more by re-wiring
network topology than by directly impacting expression of effector target genes.
Collectively meeting these goals will help to make cell fate engineering more reliable
and controllable, and it will shed light on how signaling pathways and intracellular
regulatory networks interact during development."
10906817,"The low rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination within rural areas of the United States present a
substantial and disparate missed opportunity to prevent cancer. Florida is a particular concern with the second
highest number of HPV-related cancers, yet a rank among the 50 states of 44th in HPV vaccine initiation
(≥ 1 dose) and 41st for up to date (i.e., 2 doses when starting the series before age 15 years; 3 doses when
starting at 15 years or older). Even greater disparity is present within the 11 rural North Central Florida
counties that are the focus of this proposal. Due to the myriad of factors preventing boys and girls living in rural
areas from receiving the HPV vaccine, a multilevel approach is needed to increase HPV vaccination. Guided
by the Integrated Behavior Model, the overall objective of this proposal is to address the multilevel barriers to
HPV vaccination among 9- to 12-year-olds living in rural areas by using a three-arm cluster randomized trial to
assess the added clinical- and associated cost-effectiveness on HPV vaccination of each additional nested
evidence-based implementation strategy: (1) clinician-targeted recommendation training, (2) parent-targeted
motivational aids via facilitation of clinic staff sending reminder/recall messages and conducting phone-based
motivational interviewing, when needed, to encourage follow through, (3) community-targeted healthcare
access to transportation assistance, mobile vaccination clinics, and navigation to healthcare insurance. Eight
community-focused organizations with experience in rural settings will support implementation: University of
Florida (UF) Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension, UF Clinical and Translational Science
Institute Community Engagement Program, UF Cancer Center Community Advisory Board, UF OneFlorida
Clinical Research Consortium, Suwannee River Area Health Education Center, CommunityHealth IT, a
federally designated Rural Health Network, and the Florida Department of Health. The specific aims are: (1)
Estimate the added clinical- and associated cost-effectiveness of parent-targeted motivational aids
(reminder/recall and phone-based MI) alone and when combined with community-targeted healthcare access
assistance beyond the effects of clinician-targeted training; (2) Estimate the differential effectiveness of the
implementation strategies by patient-level factors (age, race/ethnicity, biologic sex, distance from home to
clinic, social vulnerability); and (3) Measure moderation of implementation strategy effectiveness by clinic-level
factors. The proposed research is significant for its potential to prevent cancer by increasing HPV vaccination
rates among 9- to 12-year-olds living in rural areas. The project is innovative by: (1) Evaluating effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of layered evidence-based strategies; and (2) Addressing social determinants
preventing vaccination in addition to clinician recommendation effectiveness and parent motivation. The
proposed approach of layering nested evidence-based implementation strategies to prevent HPV-related
cancers can be expanded to prevention of other cancers disproportionately affecting rural areas."

Norepinephrine (NE)-containing neuronal cells in the locus coeruleus (LC) are thought to co-release dopamine (DA) from
many of its projections, including into the hippocampus. Through DA and NE release, the LC is thought to play a major
role in modulating hippocampal memory encoding through the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP), an integral
mechanism for memory consolidation. Understanding the mechanisms by which the LC modulates memory is of
fundamental importance to investigations into hippocampal memory circuitry and dynamics. However, because of their
structural similarity, it has been difficult to ascertain the precise roles that DA and NE each have on LTP maintenance. In
vivo microdialysis has been traditionally used in the past to measure tonic extracellular concentrations of molecules in the
brain, but damage to tissue because of the size of the sampling probe and low spatiotemporal resolution make real-time
tracking of tonic neurotransmitter concentrations, and their biological functions, problematic. Our lab has developed state-
of-the-art voltammetric techniques capable of measuring tonic concentrations of neurotransmitters in real-time with very
high spatial resolution. We hypothesize that by altering the voltammetric waveform applied in vivo and by developing a
novel artificial intelligence based post-processing pipeline, very similar analytes such as DA and NE can be reliably
resolved. Through accurate neurotransmitter identification and pharmacologic manipulation, we aim to ascertain the specific
effects NE and DA have on hippocampal LTP. Additionally, we hypothesize that electrical stimulation of the LC will lead
to increased hippocampal DA and NE release and enhanced LTP induction compared to no stimulation. The ability to
resolve individual analytes based on their voltammetric signals has been an unsolved problem in electrochemistry and will
enable tracking of their relative real-time contributions to LTP induction and maintenance in the hippocampus with high
accuracy. A greater understanding of LTP induction and maintenance mechanisms is of vital importance to garnering an
increased understanding of memory circuitry and physiology."

The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai proposes to continue a highly successful Training Program in
Cancer Biology for 5 predoctoral students and 5 postdoctoral fellows. The planned duration is up to 2 years
for each predoctoral slot and up to 3 years for each postdoctoral slot. The projected number of individuals to
be trained over the proposed project period is 15 predoctoral and 10 postdoctoral fellows. Its leadership has
extensive experience in cancer research mentoring and a well-documented commitment to both graduate
education and postdoctoral training. This institutional program encompasses training faculty from 6 basic
and 4 clinical departments as well as 12 matrix institutes and involves laboratory and computational
research. The dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of the Program is evidenced by co- authored papers
and multi-investigator grants. All faculty members have peer-reviewed R01 or R01-equivalent support
from funding agencies for cancer-related studies. The Program attracts and develops a cadre of outstanding
Ph.D. and M.D., Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows, with our earliest trainees having established
cancer-focused research careers at prestigious institutions. The curriculum for predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees involves common elements including several new advanced didactic and multi-modal
cancer biology courses and advanced electives, which impart state-of-the-art training in emerging
technologies critical to basic and translational cancer investigations. All trainees also participate in
regular conferences, which further expose them to clinical aspects of cancer. There are important specific
training elements for each component as well. There is a rigorous evaluation and selection process, and
the program is both cognizant of and actively involved in diversity recruitment. New components of the
program also include additional training venues to specifically aid postdoctoral trainees in seeking
academic positions and a formal training faculty track in which promising junior faculty members may
apply with a training faculty member to co-mentor a highly qualified trainee, an approach providing
mentorship by the training faculty member both of the trainee and the faculty co-mentor. The program has
contributed importantly to the remarkable increase in cancer research and NCI funding over the past
decade. Mount Sinai has also made enormous commitments in resources and facilities benefitting the
Program including support for specific elements by the Tisch Cancer Institute an NCI designated Cancer
Center and the Department of Oncological Sciences. Trainees work closely with faculty drawn from
throughout Mount Sinai ensuring that their training is both rigorous and sufficiently broad in scope to
take into account practical issues faced by physicians in preventing and treating cancer."

Disability results when the demands of a task, in the environment where a task is performed, exceed the ability
of the individual. However, little is known about the environmental features which might best allow persons with
visual impairment, particularly those with irreversible conditions such as glaucoma or age-related macular
degeneration, to perform important tasks enabling independence (i.e. instrumental activities of daily living), and
to remain safe within their homes (i.e. by avoiding falls). In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will investigate the
importance of visual impairment to home functionality, as judged by objectively-evaluated in-home task
performance. During in-home task performance, we will look for specific environmental impediments (lighting,
contrast, text size, clutter, need for fine motor manipulation) associated with performance, allowing us to
directly link environmental impediments to functionality. In Aim 2 of this proposal, we will investigate the
importance of visual impairment to rates of falls at home. Also, we will identify specific home hazard types
which increase the risk of falls in a novel approach which matches the in-home location of falls, how much
physical activity (steps) occurs in each region of the home (defined through integration of accelerometer and
IPS data), and the number and type of hazards in each in-home region (defined through a home assessment).
Unlike prior research, the current proposal will assign risk to home hazards only with regards to falls occurring
near the hazard, and only proportional to the number of steps taken in the vicinity of the hazard (judged by
integrated IPS and accelerometer data), an approach which is hypothesized to successfully identify hazards
relevant to in-home falls in persons with visual impairment. By identifying home features associated with
greater home functionality and safety, the proposal will further the National Eye Institute’s commitment to
research which “improves quality of life for people of all ages”."

Cellular senescence, the irreversible cessation of the cell cycle, has emerged as an important regulator of
age- associated pathologies. Senescence is linked to compromised genome organization, loss of coordinated
gene expression, and activation of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), an inflammatory
cascade that can affect neighboring cells. Aspects of senescence are likely beneficial to tissue homeostasis
through immune-mediated clearance of damaged cells, while other aspects and the SASP are likely deleterious
and have been linked to chronic inflammation and age-related pathologies. Thus, dissecting the molecular
mechanisms that direct the emergence of senescence remains of interest to a wide variety of scientists,
including those studying aging, age-linked disease, and cellular identity. Nuclear architecture is a powerful
mechanism underlying coordinated gene expression. While senescence is associated with a loss of peripheral
chromatin organization, it is unclear if these changes to genome organization result in loss of spatial LAD
positioning; if so, do these positioning changes precede senescence or are they a byproduct of senescence?
Moreover, because of the population-based approach of genomics assays used to probe senescence, it
remains unknown if there is heterogeneity of genome organization as cells senesce or if synchronous changes
occur in all cells. The importance of this question is highlighted by studies using state-of-the-art imaging
technologies, similar to the ones we propose, demonstrating remarkable heterogeneity in genome organization
across single cells that have been masked by bulk assays. In the proposed studies, we seek to test the
hypothesis that compromised transcriptional mechanisms that maintain the spatial positioning of loci relative
to the nuclear lamina underlie senescence phenotypes. We will use a combination of Oligopaints and super-
resolution microscopy to identify and dissect the molecular players that guide spatial positioning and their
relationship to chromatin structure and senescence at single-cell resolution. Our interdisciplinary team will
reveal how locus positioning changes are linked to senescence and will manipulate regulators of genome
spatial positioning that we have started to identify to determine if senescence phenotypes are accelerated by
their alteration. Given the emerging importance of nuclear architecture in several human diseases, our studies
will provide critical insights into the molecular rationale for targeting genome organization changes in
senescence, knowledge that can be applied to other diseases including aging-associated conditions and
cancer."

Skeletal muscle (SkM) function and strength, and intrinsic muscle quality are closely linked to the pathogenesis
and pathophysiology of metabolic disease. However, the regulatory molecular mechanisms in SkM performance
remain elusive. The current proposal will focus on identifying novel molecular pathways regulating muscle
function and insulin signaling via the muscle-specific role of Fat Specific Protein 27 (FSP27). While the adipocyte
actions of FSP27 have been well-recognized in the metabolic field, we unexpectedly discovered high FSP27 protein
expression in SkM. Our preliminary data in humans identified a positive correlation of SkM FSP27 expression with
indices of muscle performance such as aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and responsivity to exercise training. Also,
our study in whole-body Fsp27-/- mice displayed severely impaired muscle endurance, muscle strength, and loss of
fat in the SkM. Intramyocellular fat is a crucial source to meet the energy demand in the SkM for its function.
Therefore, we hypothesized that FSP27 plays a major role in muscle performance and insulin sensitivity primarily via
its role in regulating fat handling in the SkM. As a first step in understanding the clinical relevance of FSP27 in
SkM insulin signaling and muscle function, we have generated an innovative gain-of-function transgenic mouse
model expressing the human-FSP27 transgene, (M-FSP27tg), specifically in SkM without altering the expression
of endogenous mouse Fsp27. Also, we have generated a loss-of-function muscle model through muscle-specific
ablation of FSP27 (M-Fsp27-/-). Our preliminary studies in these mouse models are in-line with our hypothesis and
suggest a critical role of SkM-specific FSP27 in muscle performance. We will utilize a three-pronged approach to
identify the physiological and molecular mechanism of FSP27-mediated SkM function. In Aim 1, we will study the
physiological action of FSP27 in SkM performance, and its role in protection against obesity-induced whole-body
insulin resistance. In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that FSP27 handles intramyocellular fat fuel via its action
on the motor activity of the cytoskeletal proteins along the FSP27-Rab18-p150-Dyenin axis in the SkM. In aim
3, we will test our hypothesis that in addition to its effect on cytoskeleton motor activity, FSP27 regulates exercise
endurance and insulin sensitivity via the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R)-AMPK pathway. A strength
of this proposal is an interdisciplinary collaboration formed between Dr. Puri (expert in basic and translational
research in lipid metabolism and signaling), Dr. Consitt (expert in SkM metabolism), Dr. Baumann (expert in SkM
physiology), and Dr. Lee (expert in tissue insulin signaling), which will utilize their complementary expertise and
build upon their collaborative work in this project. Successful completion of the proposed studies will identify a
novel regulatory player in SkM performance and muscle biology."

The proposed conference series, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in
Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held annually in the fall
(2024-2028). The locations of the 2024-2028 conferences remain to be selected but will be
chosen based on several factors in including proximity to minority-serving institutions and
communities impacted by cancer disparities as well as the future needs and growth of the
conference series. This proposed conference series will be the 17th-21st in an AACR series
focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The
Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved
was held in 2007, then annually from 2009-present.
While many conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues or
one specific underserved group, the goal of this conference is to feature the full spectrum of
research in the field and incorporate presentations on a wide range of medically underserved
populations while including perspectives from basic, population, behavioral, computational,
translational, and clinical researchers in conjunction with those from patient advocates,
government, public health experts, and others. Transdisciplinary interactions and collaborations
will be pivotal to advancing the field, stimulating new research, and making progress in reducing
and ultimately eradicating cancer health disparities.
Additionally, this conference series serves as a platform to facilitate the development of a
diverse cancer workforce and to provide educational opportunities to clinicians treating
medically underserved patients. Professional development opportunities for early career
investigators are available at all levels of the conference from experience as session chairs and
program committee members to poster presentations and mentored roundtable discussions.
CME credits are available for clinicians seeking to increase their knowledge and skills in
providing treatment to ethnic/racial minorities and medically underserved patients."

DNA methylation is important for gene regulation, transcriptional silencing of repetitive DNA and establishing
genomic imprinting. While DNA methylation is a dynamic modification, which is added and removed by writer
and eraser enzymes, it is faithfully inherited over many millions of cell divisions, and even evolutionary
timescales. How these writers and erasers combine to ensure such accurate epigenetic inheritance is a critical
question, as failure to accurately maintain DNA methylation patterns is associated with aging as well as
numerous diseases, including cancers. Despite the importance of DNA methylation writers and erasers, the
mechanisms that regulate and coordinate their genes to maintain epigenetic homeostasis remain poorly
understood. A major goal of the Williams lab is to eliminate this gap in knowledge. Using the epigenetic model
system Arabidopsis, which can tolerate loss-of-function mutations to all methylation writers and erasers, my lab
will perform a comprehensive study of the gene regulatory mechanisms that regulate the expression of writer
and eraser genes to ensure epigenetic homeostasis. This will include performing a mechanistic dissection of
the cell-cycle regulation of genes encoding writer and eraser enzymes and their targeting by anciently
conserved cell cycle transcription factors. Additionally, my lab seeks to identify new trans-acting factors
involved in the regulation of epigenetic homeostasis by studying a naturally occurring strain of Arabidopsis with
drastically different regulation of epigenetic modifiers. Lastly, my lab will precisely define how epigenetic
homeostasis is lost within some cells during aging, identifying mechanisms that contribute to age-dependent
DNA methylation losses, and determining how “epigenetic age” is influenced by organ regeneration and the
environment. Together, these approaches will generate multiple insights into how DNA methylation dynamics
are established at a cellular scale and coordinated to achieve epigenetic homeostasis. We anticipate that these
findings will provide new insights into the laws of epigenetic stability and inheritance, which are crucial for
understanding many aspects of the health of human cells."
10939861,"Project Summary
The genetic landscape of patient samples has illustrated a vast array of potential diagnostic and clinical
biomarkers through profiling of chromosomal rearrangements and examining subsequent alterations in RNA
abundance. However, genome-wide analyses have also discovered that there are discrepancies between
transcript expression levels and corresponding protein abundance, highlighting the limited predictive power of
bulk RNA-based prognostic strategies to assist in therapy. Moreover, there are an increasing number of studies
depicting thousands of missed and unannotated peptides. These discoveries underscore the importance of
understanding RNA regulation in the context of disease to showcase the complete landscape of genetic
expression and target the phenotype of malignant cells. Our findings have noted that select mRNAs are
translationally increased, independent of their transcriptional regulation, in response to disease progression,
and can be studied to create novel therapeutic avenues unique per disease type. Mapping post-transcriptional
regulation and the un-annotated proteome, including RNA localization and modifications to assist in
translational regulation, however, remains poorly understood. As cells rely on the dynamic response of protein
synthesis to quickly respond to environmental cues, this leaves an unexplored area for discovery that is
required for cell survival and is promising for innovative therapies.
 We have identified essential signaling advantages activated to rewire RNA translation during initiation
and for the maintenance of aggressive disease states. During these processes, ribosome initiation is altered
and increased at non-canonical start sites, which can alter protein variants and produce micropeptides. Our
research focuses on mechanistically determining how growth and adaptive signaling cascades interact by: 1)
mapping the post-transcriptional aspects of gene expression missing from our current annotated genomes,
focusing on alternative ribosome initiation, and 2) investigating the RNA-modification and binding proteins
influencing selection and spatial interactions of RNA. This regulatory control rapidly reprograms the cellular
phenotype at the level of RNA translation, increasing genetic diversity, and we will be able to characterize the
global utilization of nonconventional initiation to study cell state changes modeled during cancer progression.
Our multidisciplinary approach is designed to connect unbiased ribosome sequencing with proteomic profiles
to identify the complete oncogenic proteome and the features that impose RNA selection. We will identify the
trans- factors, cis- domains, and RNA modifications utilized by adaptive signaling to commandeer the
translational response between cell states. Our studies will provide unprecedented insight into RNA regulation
through focusing on localization and modifications alongside ribosome initiation, and how their interplay alters
gene expression. This will lay the foundation for mapping genetic diversity through noncanonical translation."
10928385,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core proposed represents a continuation of this effective Core that has helped lead to the
many successes of the Center through the current cycle of CCCR funding. The overall objective of this
Administrative Core is to provide oversight and management of the CCCR to ensure that the Center
accomplishes its goals, which are to conduct and disseminate high level clinical research informed both by state-
of-the-art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries. The Core will consist of
an internal administrative organization under the leadership of the Center Director, Associate Director, Director
of the Methodology Core and Director of Program Evaluation. All individuals involved in administration of Center
affairs have experience in their areas of responsibility. There will be two administrative committees, Executive
and External Advisory Committees, which will have defined oversight roles. The Executive Committee will also
meet with a Patient Advisory Group. The Administrative Core will oversee and coordinate all Center activities,
including the weekly inter-disciplinary research meeting (Research Accelerator), monthly journal clubs, other
educational programming, and Committee meetings. We will have an independent evaluation of the program to
assess the quality and success of the interactions and services provided by our CCCR to the broader research
community, and will review act upon the findings in an ongoing, iterative manner. Among the aims of this Core
are to ensure allocation of appropriate resources to ensure CCCR progress, to carry out an outreach program,
to administer a Pilot & Feasibility grant program, to ensure that data sharing agreements are in place and utilized,
to formally evaluate whether the CCCR is meetings its goals and objectives, and to leverage university and
medical campus resources to enhance the functioning and impact of the CCCR."
10928386,"METHODOLOGY CORE
ABSTRACT
The Methodology Core is central to our CCCR's goal of acting as a hub and resource for conducting and
disseminating high quality clinical research in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD). This Core brings
together investigators from diverse scientific backgrounds whose clinical research expertise will serve the
broader RMD research community in the following ways: 1) Provide support in advanced epidemiologic methods,
statistical approaches, and machine learning approaches; 2) Utilize and make available our CCCR's cohort
studies and large administrative claims and electronic health records databases; 3) Advise on outcome
measures and provide training in specialized study protocols (e.g., quantitative sensory testing, imaging,
wearable sensors); 4) Provide input regarding conditions for which we have unique expertise, including
osteoarthritis, crystal-related arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and musculoskeletal pain mechanisms, though the
methods expertise and resources allow for broad application to the study of other RMDs. In this renewal, we will
expand our use of, and guidance related to, advanced causal inference, machine learning and deep learning,
and digital health applications (including wearable sensors). A new area we will add in the renewal is
implementation science to enhance our capabilities to narrow the knowledge-practice gap and health inequities
in key RMDs. A key feature of this Core is a weekly clinical research meeting, known as the Research
Accelerator, in which a diverse group of researchers provide interdisciplinary input into all facets of clinical
research projects. By having rheumatology, rehabilitation, epidemiology, biostatistics, and other specialized
investigators meet once a week together, the Methodology Core creates interdisciplinary conversations and
makes available methodologic expertise to clinician researchers that would otherwise not be part of their grants
or scientific projects. Our Boston University CCCR group is well known for training early-stage investigators,
many of whom are prominent clinical researchers in RMD research domestically and globally. The Methodology
Core will continue to emphasize training. In this renewal, we will expand our educational programming, including
a new Visiting Professor program, an expanded monthly journal club with virtual attendance options for the
broader research community, an Advanced Methodology Seminar to act as a continuing education opportunity
for our analysts and methodologists, and will leverage social media to provide summary “threads” from our
various educational sessions and to showcase our CCCR work. Through these endeavors, the Core will expand
and enrich the scope of research questions addressed and methods used to address them, ultimately benefiting
the health and quality of life of individuals living with RMDs."

The Texas Experimental Cancer Therapeutic Network (TEX-CTN) is comprised of the University 
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC; Lead Academic Organization, LAO), the UT 
Health San Antonio Cancer Center (UT Health SA; Affiliate Organization, AO), the UT at Austin 
(UTA); Affiliate Organization, AO) and the UT Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB; Affiliate 
Organization, AO). We propose to advance the development of novel therapeutics using precision 
oncology approaches and rationally designed clinical trials. The long-term objective is to provide 
the ETCTN with the joint expertise of the faculty from the four member institutions, expediting 
translating preclinical discoveries to the clinic, and to provide significant scientific and 
administrative leadership to the ETCTN. Our hypothesis for the optimal development of novel 
targeted agents includes testing within a molecularly profiled population, integrating 
pharmacodynamics markers in early clinical trials and programmatic assessment of predictors of 
intrinsic sensitivity/resistance and mechanisms of acquired resistance. We are proposing to 
achieve these goals through the following five specific aims: 1) To study, in an efficient, systematic 
and collaborative manner, the safety and clinical activity of new agents or hypothesis-driven novel 
combinations. 2) To molecularly profile tumors and patients (host tissues), to optimize selection 
of potentially relevant therapies based on the molecular aberrations identified in the tumor and 
immune environment, where appropriate. 3) To develop and validate clinically relevant of 
predictors and pharmacodynamic markers of response. 4) To mentor early career faculty, trainees 
and research personnel in the leadership, conduct, analysis, and reporting of ETCTN trials. 5) To 
provide scientific and administrative leadership within ETCTN. The TEX-CTN will unite four 
University of Texas institutions to facilitate access to novel therapies and biomarker-driven trials 
across the network, for patients with rare as well as common tumors, as well as patients from 
underserved minority populations. Our team consists of internationally recognized leaders of 
Phase I and II trials, multidisciplinary disease experts, interventional radiologists, translational 
pathologists, and diagnostic radiologists. TEX-CTN is well poised to attain a new paradigm for 
early experimental therapeutic clinical trials."
10839898,"This UM1 renewal application is designated the North American Star Consortium (NASC), which includes 
Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) as the Lead Academic Organization (LAO) with Daniel Sullivan, MD as the 
contact PI. MCC is joined by four highly productive Academic Organizations (AO) including Princess Margaret 
Cancer Center (PMCC; Philippe Bedard, MD, multi-PI), Virginia Commonwealth University-Massey Cancer 
Center (VCU-Massey; Steven Grant, MD, multi-PI), University of Texas Southwestern Simmons Cancer Center 
(UTSW; Muhammad Beg, MD, multi-PI), and Northwestern Lurie Cancer Center (NWU; Jeffrey Sosman, MD, 
multi-PI). The NASC evolved from the Princess Margaret Phase 1 Consortium (PMP1C), where PMCC was the 
LAO and MCC and VCU-Massey AOs. The two new sites (UTSW and NWU) bring additional depth in 
basic/translational science and biomarker (BM) development, have active early phase clinical trial programs, 
prioritize the accrual of minority patients, have active mentorship programs for Early Career Clinical 
Investigators (ECIs), and expand the NASC expertise in investigational imaging. The PMP1C has existed from 
April 2014 to the present and during this time 14 ETCTN trials have been activated and 4 are pending 
activation. The average yearly accrual during this time was 52 patients/year (yearly goal was 50 patients/year), 
with 97 patients enrolled March 2018 – February 2019. The 5 NASC institutions have enrolled a total of 1703 
patients on their “top 50 trials” (ETCTN + non-ETCTN) with appropriate minority patient accrual, exceptionally 
strong mentoring of ECIs, and significant correlative molecular analyses for integrated and exploratory BM. 
 This productivity of the PMP1C and UTSW/NWU will now go forward with MCC as the LAO to address the 
following specific aims. 1. To plan, develop, and activate novel phase 1 and phase 2 ETCTN trials through 
participation in the Project Team Member Application mechanism or as investigator-initiated trials (IITs) that 
emerge from NASC investigators. The NASC goal is to activate a minimum of six trials/year. 2. To enroll 
patients on ETCTN trials from the NASC or other sites that require the acquisition of high-quality tumor tissue 
for biomarker and pharmacodynamic analyses, include pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints, and closely follow 
Good Clinical Practice and Human Subject Protection guidelines. The NASC annual accrual goal on ETCTN 
trials is a minimum of 100 patients/year (30 at MCC, 20 each at PMCC and VCU-Massey, and 15 each at 
UTSW and NWU). 3. To focus on the career development of ECIs within the NASC by providing educational 
opportunities regarding clinical research and its regulation at the 5 institutions, by having the ECI serve as the 
PI of ETCTN studies and pairing them with senior investigator mentors, and by focusing on ECI exposure and 
education regarding biomarkers, correlative molecular analyses, PK studies and precision cancer medicine. 4.
To ensure that ETCTN trials performed at NASC sites have appropriate accrual of minority patients, other 
underserved populations, adolescent and young adults, the elderly, and rural populations."
10851936,"The new era in cancer drug development represents a paradigm shift in how early phase studies are conducted
relative to the “conventional” approach of treating without consideration to underlying tumor genomics, biology 
and immunology. Translational endpoints, including levels of target expression, engagement, and modulation 
of downstream effectors are being assessed as early as possible, and increasing emphasis is being placed on 
early patient selection, utilizing novel biomarker assays and molecular characterization to identify patients most 
likely to respond. The ultimate purpose of the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) 
is to develop new therapeutic options while also defining better approaches for the development of novel 
anticancer agents that capitalize on the ability to characterize tumors molecularly and by also finding appropriate 
biomarkers to select patients most likely to respond. As biomarker-driven trials become the cornerstone of early 
phase investigation, allowing for the study of potential mechanisms of response and resistance, incorporation 
of these biomarkers is lending itself to novel trial designs which incorporate fewer, and often rarer patient 
subsets, defining greater patient outcomes with smaller recruited populations. As a result, a unique network 
such as the ETCTN, consisting of multiple scientifically-driven sites and investigators with a vast array of 
expertise, is needed. The ETCTN allows investigators to test relevant bench-to-bedside findings, and through 
integrated analysis and the development of interdisciplinary teams, incorporates reverse translation to bring the 
bedside back to the bench. This application is a re-competition of our previous ETCTN UM1 award 
(1UM1CA186689), demonstrating both our progress over the past funding period as well as our capabilities to 
conduct early phase clinical trials. We have slightly amended our original partnerships which now include 
Vanderbilt-Ingram, University of California San Diego, Karmanos Cancer Institute, University of Oklahoma 
Stephenson Cancer Center (new) and the Yale Cancer Center (VICKtOrY). Our team aims to 1) leverage novel 
scientific discoveries for translation into early phase trials, using the CTEP pharmacopeia, in rare cancers, 
common cancers, and uncommon variants of common cancers; 2) incorporate serum, tissue and imaging 
biomarkers to better understand the effects of novel agents either alone or in combination; 3) train early career 
investigators to be knowledgeable and proficient in conducting early phase clinical trials by providing clinical 
research leadership opportunities and mentoring; and 4) include as a component of our early phase clinical trial 
recruitment, no less than 10% underserved/special populations. The members of our team have a unique set 
of complementary expertise and a similar philosophy regarding collaborative research and mentorship of the 
next generation of cancer investigators. VICKtOrY is committed to utilizing our areas of expertise, integrating 
the science at our institutions, and maximizing our collaborative relationships to conduct cutting-edge early

The Cancer Registry Shared Resource Core (CRSRC) will serve a key role in identifying and characterizing
cancer disparities in the multiethnic populations of Guam and Hawai‘i. The overall objective of the CRSR is to
provide key infrastructure support for cancer research and outreach activities of the Pacific Island Partnership
for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE). The CRSRC meets the requirements of PIPCHE shared resources to
enhance the ability to conduct cancer disparities research.
The CRSRC represents a partnership between the Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) and the Hawai‘i Tumor
Registry (HTR), the central cancer registries of the Territory of Guam and the State of Hawai‘i, respectively.
This partnership has been critical to the development of the GCR as a fully functioning registry through
technical support and training provided by the HTR and through the establishment of statutory authority for
cancer reporting and securing territorial funding. The CRSRC subsequently played a critical role in the
development of the Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry covering the US Affiliated Pacific Islands.
The CRSRC serves as a critical resource for PIPCHE research and outreach. The CRSRC generates high-
quality cancer surveillance data through which cancer disparities can be identified and characterized. This
information is key to establishing PIPCHE research and outreach priorities. The CRSR also provides key
support for research and outreach activities.
The CRSRC will continue to serve as an important Core of the PIPCHE.
Specific Aim 1. Provide cancer data and related support for PIPCHE research projects (full and
pilot) and outreach activities.
Specific Aim 2. Build capacity for cancer surveillance and health disparities research at the
University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC). This alignment will
allow for a synergy and sharing of data that would not be possible otherwise."
10905238,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Evidence-based medicine (EBM) requires collecting and ranking relevant evidence according to its
epistemological strength, aiming to identify the most suitable evidence to inform guidelines and policies. This
process generally prioritizes strong evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), cohort studies, systematic
reviews, and meta-analyses. However, the volume of scientific literature being published in peer-reviewed
journals is increasing exponentially. This makes it extraordinarily financial and societal costly for scientists to
obtain a reasonably precise, cumulative overview of the conceptual structure of the literature about a certain
scientific topic, and to identify potential new research opportunities. It also presents a challenge for practitioners
and policymakers in assimilating and understanding the prevailing findings, further slowing down the translation
from biomedical discoveries to improved health outcomes. It is imperative to develop scalable methods for
efficient clinical evidence extraction and summarization. Responding to PA-23-034, this project will develop and
validate a novel informatics framework to extract computable Population, Intervention, Comparison, and
Outcome (PICO) elements and summarize them from publications of interventionaland observational studies.
While the framework can be applied to any type of condition, the focus will be on 23 clinical domains, such as
neurological, respiratory, digestive system, cardiovascular, and mental health conditions, because they are
extremely common and affect people of all ages, races, and socioeconomic statuses. Our extensive preliminary
data show that we can effectively employ deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) methods
to extract PICO elements from the clinical trial registries and RCT publications in PubMed. We can also perform
zero-shot clinical evidence summarization across six clinical domains. These studies lend further support to the
feasibility of the proposed research. Based on our preliminary data and our experience with an interdisciplinary
team, our specific aims are: (1) Systematically design and data-driven evaluate a computable PICO ontology;
(2) Extract multi-granular PICO elements from study publications; (3) Generate rational-based evidence
summaries; and (4) Develop and validate the EBM toolkit via a user-centered design. The research proposed in
this project is novel and innovative because it will produce and rigorously test new solutions to improve
computable EBM. Successful completion of these aims will empower the general public, stakeholders in EBM,
and public health policymakers to efficiently discover and summarize pertinent medical evidence, thereby
facilitating well-informed healthcare decision-making."

career scientists, in addition to daily poster sessions and networking opportunities for trainees. The upcoming
Stress Neurobiology Workshop will take place June 4-7, 2024 in Boston, MA. We have developed a rigorous
scientific program that reflects the diversity within our field, with session topics ranging from the critical window
of adolescence to state-of-the-art dissections of neural circuits and ensembles that mediate the stress
response. One session will be dedicated to the scientific legacy of Dr. Bruce McEwen, a titan in the field of
stress neurobiology. To shine a direct spotlight on the unique stressors experienced by people in minoritized
communities, one session will focus on research that has identified discrete markers of stress in racial, gender,

Like many psychiatric disorders, the research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to date has been
overwhelmingly performed on participants of European Ancestry. For example, the latest genome-wide
association study on OCD is about to be published, but unfortunately >95% of the OCD cases studied are entirely
European. Thankfully, NIMH has recently funded a study that will begin to increase diversity in OCD research,
the Latin American Trans-ancestry INitiative for OCD genomics (LATINO). In addition, OCD researchers
themselves have had a strong Eurocentric bias. One way to promote the inclusion of under-represented minority
(URM) trainees in OCD research is to help them network with other Latin American investigators studying OCD
as well as established investigators from outside Latin America. The LATINO project represents an opportunity
to facilitate this networking. To this end, the LATINO project has teamed up with the non-profit organization
Asociación Latinoamericana de Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo (ALTOC) to host an annual meeting on OCD in
Latin America. The first two meetings in 2022 and 2023 were transformative for many attendees, but
unfortunately, no funds existed for URM trainees to attend the meeting. This R13 proposal is designed to provide
travel awards for URM students, postdocs, and junior faculty to attend this annual meeting. Specifically, we
request funding for 10 travel awards per year over the next 4 years. We also request funds for professional, on-
site translation services to facilitate knowledge exchange. Each conference will also feature formal career
development and mentoring sessions to help travel awardees reach their full potential. Ultimately, our goal is to
foster the next generation of Latinx OCD researchers. We will follow the NIH Interest in Diversity statement and
consider all underrepresented populations in the U.S. biomedical research enterprise. We will use the categories
listed in the NIH Interest in Diversity statement to define underrepresented populations. In addition to applicants
of Latin American ancestry, this will extend the opportunity to, for example, Black, American Indian, individuals
with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds."

implementing novel data collection, data analysis methodologies and study designs to facilitate TJA research
in large-linked databases and clinical research networks.
The Specific Aims of the Resource Core are: (1) To work collaboratively with the AJRR-C Methodology Core in
design, protocol development, statistical analysis and conduct of TJA studies, (2) To test the transportability
and external validity of TJA-specific validation and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms (developed by the
Methodology Core) in hospitals within the AJRR network in an effort to improve the depth and completeness of
the registry data, and (3) To participate in pilot & feasibility studies within the AJRR-C network and to develop
analytical standards for use of AJRR data in partnership with academic and community-based institutions. We
will focus on high-priority areas such as risk adjustment when comparing implants and classes of implants, and
use state-of-the-art and novel statistical methods to evaluate new TJA technologies. The availability of implant-
specific data from the AJRR, enriched with linked databases and EHR data sources offer tremendous research
opportunities and will exert a sustained, powerful influence on TJA clinical research landscape and device
surveillance."

Our organs respond dynamically to changes in the body’s demands by adapting both their size and activity
levels. In these processes, mechanisms governing cell fate decisions, which influence the equilibrium between
cell death and cell proliferation, assume crucial roles. Although decades of research have revealed the
involvement of cell cycle regulators, epigenetic modulators, metabolic pathways and ionic homeostasis in this
complex decision process, we still have major gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that govern cell
fate. These gaps need to be addressed in order to better understand the pathophysiology of many life threatening
conditions stemming from the errors of cell fate decision, such as uncontrolled cell death seen in degenerative
diseases or uncontrolled cell proliferation in neoplasms and autoimmunity. Our recent work showed that B cell
fate is regulated through two spatiotemporally distinct signals, 1- by antigen binding to the B cell receptor (BCR),
and 2- via T cell help or pathogen-driven activation of the toll-like receptors (TLRs). While signal-1 primes the
cell for activation and proliferation, it also initiates a short countdown to death that can be halted by a “signal-2”.
The presence of signal-2 promotes cell survival and proliferation by validating the accuracy of the signal-1, while
its absence causes a gradual increase in intracellular calcium leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.
We called this process the ‘metabolic clock’. Because mitochondria and calcium homeostasis have been shown
to play roles in determining the fate outcomes of many different cell types; our metabolic clock model provides
an excellent platform to dissect the mechanisms that govern life and death decisions throughout the body. The
overarching goal of our proposal is to unveil the interplay between signals -1 and -2 at the molecular level, with
a view towards identifying how metabolic clocks regulate cell fates. Our first project will define how signal-1
induces calcium increase, the main driver of mitochondrial dysfunction, and how this can be prevented by signal-
2 to promote survival and proliferation. Our second project will delineate whether mitochondrial remodeling,
under the influence of signals -1 and -2, can modulate the metabolic clock by altering the sensitivity of
mitochondria to rising cytoplasmic calcium. Lastly, we will reveal whether the metabolic clock may lead to cell
fates other than death or proliferation, such as the induction of an hypofunctional anergic state. We will use
transgenic mouse models, novel bone marrow chimeras and human samples to perform integrated sets of
biochemical and cellular assays, unraveling how the two signals independently or in combination impact
activation of signaling molecules, mitochondrial remodeling, calcium dynamics, and energy production pathways.
Altogether, this proposal, bridging basic mechanistic research with in vivo models, will provide a novel
perspective of cell fate decision mechanisms, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches to disorders
caused by the errors in this process."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United
States (U.S.). Although several effective prevention and early detection screening methods are available,
screening remains underutilized. The most feasible CRC screening modality for average-risk individuals in low
resource settings, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), is the stool-based fecal
immunochemical test (FIT). One challenge of using FIT, however, is that follow-up colonoscopy is required
after an abnormal (i.e., positive) result to check the colon and rectum for polyps or cancer. The benefit of FIT
screening on CRC risk and mortality is realized only if timely colonoscopy is achieved. FQHCs are an
integral component of the safety-net health system and represent a strong infrastructure for health service
delivery research. Prior research suggests that only 18-57% of FQHC patients with abnormal stool-based
screening results receive colonoscopy. There is limited research that focuses on identifying effective strategies
to improve follow-up after an abnormal FIT result. In addition, much of the prior research has been conducted
in integrated healthcare settings, although most care for underserved populations is delivered through a
patchwork of public and private primary care providers, specialty providers and hospital settings. Therefore, it
is paramount to understand how to increase follow-up of abnormal FIT results in these complex and real-world
settings, which can yield findings with more relevance for the most vulnerable patient subgroups.
 In the proposed application, we will utilize a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial design within one of the
largest FQHCs in the nation to test the effectiveness of a multilevel and multicomponent intervention
(patient, provider, health system) that targets several barriers to follow-up in both the FQHC (primary care) and
GI specialty care settings. The intervention is informed by prior research and is innovative in that it addresses
barriers to follow-up colonoscopy in non-integrated primary care settings and within GI specialty care settings
and strengthens care coordination between FQHCs and GI providers. The study will be conducted in 6 clinics
within the same FQHC system. Three sites will be randomized to usual care and three to the intervention
condition. The specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the multilevel intervention to the usual care
condition on receipt of a colonoscopy within 6 months of an abnormal FIT result (primary outcome); 2)
systematically assess the quality of and challenges to intervention implementation to understand the feasibility
and relative importance of intervention elements; and 3) measure the cost of intervention implementation to
inform potential for dissemination and spread. The proposed study addresses important gaps in CRC
prevention and control research by focusing on completion of the CRC screening process in a medically
underserved population. Findings have the potential to change clinical practice and can be adapted for other
FQHCs and clinical settings that face similar challenges in managing patients with abnormal FIT results."
11041809,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new long-acting 􀁸ormulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to
develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill,"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a
POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).
The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, and safety of this new contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2"

This application is in response to NOT-OD-23-166, PAR-21-358, and aligns with NIMHD's key areas of interest
including family health and well-being for SGM adolescents.
Family acceptance and support are critical factors that promote resilience and reduce mental health burden
among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents. The existing knowledge base on family relationships
among SGM adolescents is limited in generalizability beyond predominately non-Latinx, White samples, and is
often based on perspectives of one family member (either SGM adolescents or their parents). Yet, cultural
strengths and stressors influence family relationships and resultant health of multiple family members. Framed
by the SGM Health Disparities Research Framework and the Family Health Development Integrative Model, this
study, through a multistage and multimethod design, seeks to understand intersectional family relationships and
how they contribute to mental health among Latinx SGM adolescents and their parents. Culturally-informed
qualities of family relationships are examined as direct contributors to family health and as potential targets for
future intervention development to mitigate the harmful contributions of structural and social determinants of
health for Latinx SGM adolescents and their parents. In Aim 1, Latinx SGM adolescents and academic and
community experts who work with Latinx SGM adolescents and their families will help adapt, test, and validate
the existing parent-report measure of acceptance for Latinx SGM adolescents in order to establish an
adolescent-report version of this measure (the Parental Acceptance for Latinx SGM Adolescents [PALSA]
measure). This measure will allow for dyadic, multireporter and culturally-responsive understandings of family
relationships among Latinx SGM adolescents and their parents. Aim 2 examines how family relationships from
multiple reporters within families converge/diverge and how they predict Latinx SGM adolescent and parent
mental health. SGM adolescents and a primary parent (N = 249 dyads) will be purposively recruited to ensure
representation of SGM identities (i.e., cisgender sexual minority; trans/nonbinary gender minority) in two
established immigrant destinations (i.e., Arizona and Florida). Aim 3 of the proposal extends Aim 2 findings to
understand how family relationships moderate the associations between structural and social determinants of
health and key mental health outcomes. Aims 2 and 3 collectively will reveal unique strengths and barriers in
Latinx families with SGM adolescents to inform targets to ameliorate SGM adolescent and parent mental health
burden. The dyadic measures optimized in the study can be used to help facilitate resilience in Latinx families
with SGM adolescents by community and clinical providers."
10939903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Directional sensing of force plays a critical role in a wide variety of physiologic processes including migration,
angiogenesis, morphogenesis, and mechanical homeostasis. An important aspect of this force sensing is that
many of these forces are dynamic in nature, requiring that cells constantly probe, sense, and respond to force
in both time and space using force sensitive proteins. While these forces exist at the tissue scale, they are
sensed through molecular deformations at the protein scale that drive changes in binding, reinforcement, and
downstream signaling. Despite the critical importance of directional force sensing, the molecular mechanisms
that allow for this behavior are unclear. While many tools now exist for measuring biophysical forces and different
length scales, there are several unresolved questions with respect to the scale at which this directional force
sensing occurs. Recent work has indicated that mechanosensitive molecules in the cytoskeleton display direction
dependent reinforcement of bond lifetimes at the molecular scale. While this behavior has the potential to drive
directional force sensing at the cellular and tissue scales, tools for measuring the orientation of molecular forces
in living cells are limited. One established method for measuring orientation, polarized fluorescence microscopy,
is limited by its lack of intracellular force and dynamics information. The goal of this work is to develop methods
for simultaneous measurement of these dynamic forces and material systems for interrogation of cellular
responses to directional mechanical cues. To accomplish this, this research program will consist of three
research themes. Theme 1: Do molecular level forces and force orientations drive emergent directional
mechanosensing behaviors at the cellular scale? We will develop imaging and analysis methods for
simultaneous measurement of multiple biophysical variables in living cells that allow for cross-correlation of
molecular measurements with emergent behaviors. Theme 2: Can we engineer environments to manipulate and
study directional mechanosensing behaviors at the molecular and cellular scale? By engineering cellular
microenvironments with independently controllable directional cues that drive durotaxis and contact guidance,
we will investigate the molecular basis of these phenomena. Theme 3: Are environmental deformations
directionally sensed through individual proteins with directionally reinforced domains? By developing systems
for high resolution analysis of cellular deformation mechanosensing using engineered laminates with
independently controllable stiffness and Poisson’s ratio, we will assess biophysical changes at the molecular
and cellular scales in response to directional deformation fields. The combined imaging modalities and material
systems developed in this proposal will allow for detailed dissection of directional force sensing at the molecular
level, providing an important new toolset for interrogating and manipulating molecular mechanisms of directional
force sensing."
10941134,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Hematopoietic aging is associated with a decline in the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs), leading to the development of blood disorders and loss of immune function. We have previously
demonstrated that aging leads to sympathetic neuropathy of the BM and that premature loss of nerves or
adrenergic receptor β3 (Adrβ3) accelerated the appearance of intrinsic aging-like phenotypes in HSC. In
contrast, supplementation of β3-adrenergic agonists to boost signaling in aged mice rejuvenated niche and
HSC function. However, mechanisms downstream of the SNS that drive the phenotypic features of aging niche
and HSCs remain unclear. In the healthy BM, perivascular stromal cells containing all mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) activity are regulated by oscillatory signals from the SNS that control the mobilization of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells into peripheral blood. BM MSCs comprise two distinct subpopulations: peri-arteriolar
MSCs (periMSC), directly innervated by the SNS, and peri-sinusoidal reticular MSCs (reticMSCs) denuded from
innervation. Although reticMSCs are found away from sympathetic nerves, they are targeted by the SNS to
mediate HSC maintenance and trafficking. Preliminary data supporting this application provide evidence that
aged reticMSCs exhibit significant alterations in redox signaling and glucose metabolism pathways that are
controlled by the SNS. Furthermore, we have identified a potential mechanism of neural signal transmission in
the niche that depends on connexin gap junctions and peri-arteriolar NADPH Oxidase (NOX). We show that
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NOX complex in MSCs depends on signals from the
SNS and that targeting NOX, specifically in periMSCs, induced aging-like phenotypes in reticMSCs and HSCs.
Based on our findings, we hypothesize that NOX-derived ROS transduce β-adrenergic signals via connexin gap
junctions and that loss of ROS transmission deregulates reticMSC homeostasis, leading to expansion of
metabolically dysfunctional subsets that are unable to maintain HSCs. This hypothesis will be tested in two aims.
In Specific Aim 1, we propose to define the mechanism of neural signal transduction by using a novel MSC
culture system and assess the role of connexins and ROS in stromal cell-to-cell communication using
pharmacologic and genetic means. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate how SNS-enabled stromal ROS
homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism alter MSC and niche function to regulate HSC aging. Our proposed
studies will identify new mechanisms of HSC aging and help devise therapeutic rejuvenation strategies to
improve or prevent the course of age-associated hematopoietic diseases."

This is an application for the NIAMS K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development award for Dr. Stephan
Bodkin, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and Athletic Training in the College of
Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Bodkin is establishing himself as an emerging leader in sports medicine
research, specifically in advancing clinical decision making in returning patients to activity following traumatic
joint injuries. This K01 award will provide Dr. Bodkin the support necessary to accomplish the following career
development goals: 1) Obtain training in molecular techniques of skeletal muscle cellular remodeling, especially
relating to the quantification of intramyocellular lipids and fibrosis, 2) Expand my knowledge in age-related
changes to skeletal muscle and cartilage degradation within the lifespan of osteoarthritis diagnosis, 3) Develop
expertise needed for clinical interpretation of MRI as it relates to skeletal muscle and cartilage, and 4) Strengthen
leadership and research skills required to conduct clinical trials successfully. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bodkin
has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a Scientific Mentor, Dr. Micah Drummond, a translational
researcher experienced in biological mechanisms of aging skeletal muscle atrophy and regrowth, a Career
Mentor, Dr. Jennifer Majersik, a clinical neurologist with a proven track record of mentoring junior faculty
members, and 5 advisors with expertise in aging medicine (Dr. Mark Supiano), biostatistical design and analysis
(Mr. Greg Stoddard), clinical imaging (Dr. Glenn Morrell), orthopedic surgery (Dr. Travis Maak), and skeletal
muscle function following joint injury (Dr. Lindsey Lepley).
Dr. Bodkin’s work has well documented skeletal muscle weakness following anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction (ACLR) and the inability to restore strength despite undergoing traditional post-operative
rehabilitation. This work and others suggest potential physiological contributors to skeletal muscle weakness
following ACLR. Based on recent evidence, Dr. Bodkin’s central hypothesis is that ACL injury and reconstruction
promotes the infiltration and development of muscle adiposity which thus impairs muscle strength. He will test
this hypothesis by serially quantifying intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) in
patients undergoing ACLR and relating measures of muscle adiposity to strength. These outcomes will be
collected in young and middle-aged adults, exploring potential interactions of age and traumatic injury on skeletal
muscle remodeling. By pursuing the following specific aims, the applicant will test his hypothesis and gather data
for a subsequent R01 application to investigate rehabilitation interventions on skeletal muscle biology following
traumatic joint injuries. Specific Aim 1 will determine the influence of ACLR on quadriceps adiposity by
quantifying IMAT and IMCL pre-ACLR, 2 weeks post-ACLR, and 3 months post-ACLR. Specific Aim 2 will
determine the relationships between IMAT and IMCL to quadriceps muscle strength 3 months post-ACLR.
Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the difference in age related changes in muscle adiposity following knee surgery
by comparing serial changes in IMAT and IMCL post-ACLR between young and middle-aged adults.
The proposed research is significant because traditional strength training may fail to overcome the skeletal
muscle weakness that presents following ACLR. Investigations into physiologic contributors to skeletal muscle
weakness are a priority research area to personalize healthcare and aligns with the NIAMS strategic plan, “to
turn discovery into health”. My proposed study will determine acute changes in skeletal muscle remodeling
following ACLR and establish relationships between cellular changes and muscle strength."

James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center (JJPVAMC). He is also the Saunders Family Chair of
Neurology and an Endowed Professor in the Departments of Neurology, Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and
Geriatrics and Adult Development at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Brain Institute and the
Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Center for Molecular Integrative Neuroresilience.
He has continued to successfully forge new collaborations with Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA clinician
scientists, both locally and nationally, since my RCS renewal in 2016. Significant progress has been made in
his research endeavors, reflected by 111 peer-reviewed manuscripts of his over 300 coming in the last
10 years (2013-2023) in high impact journals (H-index: 84; citations > 22,700 according to Google
Scholar) and strong grant support from VA, NIH, Department of Defense (DoD), and other organizations. In the
last decade, Dr. Pasinetti has continued this line of research to further understand the biological mechanisms
related to the aging process and how exposure to environmental toxins and psychological stress can exacerbate
and accelerate the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The overall goal of Dr.
Pasinetti's research is to identify therapeutic targets and develop novel preventative and therapeutic approaches
for neurological disorders with neuropathological features of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression,
anxiety, and the complex Gulf War Illness (GWI), while accounting for their risk factors in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. With the support from several VA, DoD, and NIH grants, he has
focused on the development and characterization of certain “natural drugs”, as well as clarifying the role of the
gut microbiome at the genomic level in the promotion of cognitive and psychological resilience against stressful
events. Dr. Pasinetti's BX004583 Merit Review Award study aimed to elucidate the role of microglia in the onset
and progression of GWI and could provide significant evidence to test therapeutic approaches that causally
inhibit microglia activity to both prevent and limit progression of the disorder. His DoD study, W81XWH-18-
GWIRP-IIFRA, was designed to address this possibility and to discern whether turning off pro-inflammatory
microglia in a mouse model that recapitulates exposure to GWI neurotoxins and psychological stress can prevent
the onset of GWI-like symptoms. Building on evidence from BX004583 preclinical studies and infrastructure
established through the P50 AT008661 and U19 AT010835 NIH Center grants, he conducted a Phase I trial
through the support of the DoD W81XWH-14-1-0599 to explore dose compliance, safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics of a Flavonoid-Rich Preparation to treat cognitive deficits and chronic fatigue in Veterans with
GWI, with findings clearly supporting safety and tolerability of concord grape juice at certain dosages. Dr.
Pasinetti's U19 AT010835 Center grant consists of validation studies of bioactive polyphenolic compounds
to provide insights about molecular mechanisms associated with resilience against innate immune
responses in the brain. This study will provide direction for translational studies aimed to conduct
pharmacokinetics and steady-state profile of polyphenol metabolites with inflammatory markers of
biological resilience in response to stress models tested in humans. Leveraging on his decennial experience
and funding in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, and the growing evidence of immune-
inflammatory responses in certain forms of dementia, he recently obtained a new VA Merit Award BX005907
funding to further characterize the neuronal-pro-inflammatory microglial crosstalk mechanism observed in a
mouse model of ALS/FTD in vivo."

Enzymes, proteins which perform chemical reactions, are required for all of life. These proteins are amazing and
specific catalysts that are tightly regulated to ensure proper cellular function. Dysregulation of enzymes is
associated with many diseases, and inhibitors, which bind to and turn off enzymes, are often used as drugs to
modulate an enzyme’s activity and cure or manage diseases. Much has been learned about enzyme function
and mechanism via structural biology, which informs researchers of the structure of the enzyme, and kinetics
experiments, which yield information about how well the enzyme binds its substrate and how fast the reaction
proceeds. However, these experiments do not capture the structure of the enzyme as it performs its catalysis or
give information about the changes in enzyme structure under different conditions. Such information would
improve our understanding of how enzymes function, improving rational enzyme design outcomes that design
enzymes with new activities or other beneficial properties like improved stability or temperature adaptations, and
improving inhibitor and drug design outcomes which would benefit from knowledge of the enzyme in different
states. One of the goals of the proposed research is to combine enzyme structure and enzyme kinetics into one
experiment using time-resolved structural biology, which collects atomic resolution enzyme structure along the
biochemical reaction pathway, uncovering reaction intermediates and structural fluctuations with millisecond time
resolution. This work builds upon our previous work and method development by applying milli-second mix-and-
quench crystallography (MMQX) to new enzyme systems which are active drug targets due to their importance
in metabolism. Specifically, we are applying our methods to amino acid catabolism enzymes, which break down
amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, into other components to drive growth in the living cell. In addition,
we are also developing methods and studying these and other enzymes via multi-temperature crystallography,
which perturbs the energy landscape of these enzymes and causes their structures to fluctuate as they find their
equilibria at the new temperature. These multi-temperature experiments have previously been demonstrated to
observe loop opening and closing, cryptic and allosteric binding sites, and differential inhibitor binding to standard
cryo-crystallography experiments. These research programs seek to better understand enzyme dynamics and
catalysis, which will improve human health by increasing the success rate of future enzyme engineering and
inhibitor design studies."
10938326,"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are DNA viruses that target to and translocate into the host nucleus to cause infection. However, how these steps are accomplished remain largely enigmatic. Included in the PyV family is the human BK PyV responsible for nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis, JC PyV that triggers a fatal demyelinating disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell PyV that causes an aggressive skin tumor known as Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Because entry of the prototype PyV – simian virus 40 (SV40) – is similar to human PyVs, a coherent understanding of SV40 cell entry will likely identify new strategies to combat PyV-induced human diseases. Accordingly, this proposal seeks to elucidate the nuclear entry mechanism of SV40, focusing on the roles of two distinct nuclear membrane protein complexes that likely participate in this event."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic disease of the esophagus partially mediated by epithelial barrier
breach, resulting in harmless antigens penetrating the underlying tissues, encountering immune cells, and
triggering allergic responses. The surge in allergy prevalence is often attributed to shifts in environmental
conditions and western life style. The molecular mechanisms involved in how the environment elicits allergic
diseases is an area of active research that is yet to be fully understood. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is
an intracellular receptor responsive to various external stimuli, including dietary compounds, air toxicants,
pharmacologic agents, microbiota metabolites and tryptophan metabolites. Our research has uncovered that
AHR acts as a sensor molecule, capable of either maintaining epithelial homeostasis and barrier integrity, or
initiating an innate immune response when exposed to diverse AHR ligands from different environmental
sources. As a result, AHR can play a dual role in EoE, both protecting against and exacerbating EoE. We have
shown that select AHR ligands induced protective transcriptional responses in esophageal epithelial cells. These
responses counteract pathways involved in the development of type 2 immunity, including restoring barrier
function and the deficiency of SPINK7, a crucial endogenous protease inhibitor, normally essential for averting
EoE. These anti-inflammatory reactions rely on the activation of the transcription factor Ovo Like Zinc (OVOL1).
Conversely, environmental factors such as enriched tryptophan diets can stimulate AHR, exacerbating
esophageal inflammation in mice.
In this study we aim to elucidate the mechanism through which AHR mediates its protective and detrimental
reactions in response to divergent AHR ligands. We have established experimental platforms including the
generation of AHR and OVOL1 deficient esophageal epithelial cell lines, mice with conditional depletion of Ahr
and Ovol1 in the esophageal epithelium, experimental EoE murine models and three-dimensional human
organotypic esophageal raft cultures to test the hypothesis that AHR drives differential esophageal epithelial
responses, and the nature of the AHR ligands dictates the AHR dependent protective (barrier function)
and detrimental (innate inflammation) outcomes. Successful completion of this study holds immediate
translational significance, as it could pave the way for dietary adjustments, probiotics, and newly-approved AHR
agonists which will offer potential avenues for interventions against EoE."

of URM graduate students entering and earning doctoral degrees in biomedical sciences. The program will
recruit five graduate students each year with potential interests in pursuing research as a career and provide
individually designed academic and research training plans to each. The major aims include: Refine
professional skill sets through multiple opportunities to practice their oral and written skills and to network with
other peers; actively participate and present at national/international research conferences to improve
identification as a researcher and increase self-efficacy and science identity; Develop an understanding of and

research at research-intensive labs at UC Davis for the B2D students to integrate research experience that
mirrors what they will experience in graduate school. The short- and long-range objectives are: To ensure
that 90% of the B2D Scholars submit a graduate school application, with half the students being accepted into
graduate Ph.D. programs in biomedical sciences in the first five years of the grant (short-range); Over the next
decade we expect to maximize (80%) our B2D Scholars to join a Ph.D. program and pursue a career in
biomedical research (long-range); and Over the next ten years, create a culture to expand and enhance the
biomedical science curriculum developed by the B2D-Scholars program by the institutionalization of these
practices (long-range). The Fresno-Davis B2D program will support the Scholars and lay the essential
groundwork required to face the rigors of graduate school education in a highly competitive atmosphere. The
Program Directors from both campuses have gathered a team of Faculty Mentors, an Advisory Committee and

10907622,"The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance presents a significant challenge for treatment of bacterial infections. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are of particular concern. We are clearly in need of several new Gram-negative agents that are unique in terms of liabilities and antimicrobial class and which can diversify our antimicrobial development portfolio. This multi-PI proposal investigates natural products called streptothricins, which contain three moieties: streptolidine, a gulosamine sugar, and a single β-lysine or poly-β-lysine chain of varying length. Streptothricins were identified over 70 years ago and inhibit protein translation with extensive protein miscoding. In preliminary experiments, we determined that streptothricins (the natural product mixture is also called nourseothricin) are broadly active against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. In particular, for streptothricin-F, which has a single β-lysine moiety, we identified compelling activity in vitro and in vivo. However, several streptothricin acetyl transferases, found in low frequency in Gram-negative pathogens, confer streptothricin resistance by acetylation of the β-amine of the β-lysine residue. These observations led to our hypothesis that antibacterial activity can be separated from toxicities and at the same time these antibiotic resistance elements blocked through derivatization/replacement of the β-lysine moiety and other constituents. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to use an efficient, diversity- oriented, medicinal chemistry synthesis of streptothricin analogues to perform hypothesis-driven structure- activity relationship studies to optimize therapeutic properties of this scaffold. In particular, we propose to functionally profile each streptothricin analogue to determine potency against problematic Gram-negative pathogens, selectivity for prokaryotic ribosomes, toxicity, and metabolic stability. Prioritized analogues will be tested in a mouse model for toxicity, drug clearance, and therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, prioritized analogues will be investigated in cryo-EM based-structural and auto-docking studies to understand how these molecular variants differentially bind to the A. baumannii 70S ribosome. Structural insights from these studies will be used to provide iterative feedback to optimize design of analogues during the course of the proposed work. Taken together, the experiments in the aims of the proposal will address the lack of systematic exploration in the streptothricin literature and identify molecular constituents that are amenable to productive modification to enhance properties of this scaffold as a future therapeutic."
10905440,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Rotation of the hair bundles (HB) of the inner hair cells (IHC) of the cochlea open the mechano-electric transducer
(MET) channels of the IHCs. The resulting current depolarizes the cell body inducing neurotransmitter release
and, ultimately, auditory nerve stimulation. The active machinery of the cochlea, driven by motility of outer hair
cells (OHC), both tunes the excitation of the IHC HBs and provides for nonlinear compression. The first specific
aim of the grant involves the quantification of cochlear vibrations when no sound is presented, to characterize
noise floor and test the theory of the cochlear amplifier. The second aim is to predict the cochlear response to
simple and complex acoustic signals and to determine the effect of attachment of IHC mechanically to the
tectorial membrane. Particular emphasis is placed on testing rate-dependent effects in MET models (including
adaptation) and in OHC electromechanics. The specific aims of this grant are to develop mathematical models
of these phenomenon, to rigorously test these hypotheses via comparison to existing experiments, and to work
with our collaborators to devise feasible new experiments to test our predictions.
The overarching goal of this research is to develop a complete fluid-mechanical-electrical model that describes
the response of the cochlea to both external acoustic stimulation. If successful, this model will enhance our
understanding of failure mechanisms in the cochlea, answering important questions as to the morphological
elements of the cochlea that fail and why. Such understanding will improve noninvasive diagnosis of hearing as
abnormalities in the response can be linked to specific pathologies. Finally, having an understanding of how the
cochlea process sound over the entire spectrum will help us to understand how important classes of signals are
processed in the cochlea (such as speech and music) and such understanding can lead to better speech
processing algorithms or cochlear implant electrical stimulation approaches."

The cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides assembled in a ring configuration containing lipophilic
central cavities and hydrophilic outer surfaces. These molecules are traditionally used as excipients and
absorption enhancers of hydrophobic molecules. During in vivo experiments to characterize therapeutic small
molecules as therapy for globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD), or Krabbe disease, we serendipitously observed
that the Twitcher galctwi/twi (Twi, the C57BL6/J murine GLD model), receiving hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin
(HPbCD)-only (vehicle-control) showed significantly longer lifespan. To solubilize highly hydrophobic
candidates for murine experiments, HPbCD was used as a dissolvent, as previously described. Ultrastructural
and morphometric studies showed significant preservation of myelinated axons in the Twi galctwi/twi mice
receiving HPbCD-only. In GLD, the deficiency of the lysosomal galactocerebrosidase results in progressive
elevations of sphingolipids, including psychosine, which, at non-physiological high levels, becomes remarkably
cytotoxic to myelin-forming cells in the nervous systems. The CDs have been shown to cross the blood-brain
barrier at a slow rate by a non-saturable mechanism consistent with transcellular diffusion. Based on initial
studies, we hypothesize that CD ‘sequesters’ the psychosine into its conical-shaped oligosaccharide cavity,
displacing water and rending a coated ‘shield’ that prevents harmful interactions with other molecules. Our
preliminary studies indicate that one of the CD analogs, the aCD, prevented the cytotoxicity of the psychosine
in cultured GLD patient fibroblasts, and matured oligodendrocytes showed significant interactions with
psychosine. The project goals are as follows: (1) synthesize novel aCD analogs to improve the aCD
psychosine-sequestering and ‘shielding’ properties, neutralizing the cytotoxicity effects of psychosine; (2)
further characterize and optimize the PK/PD properties of the aCD and their analogs as CNS therapeutic
agents; (3) evaluate the efficacy of aCDs and its lead analogs to prevent or treat the neurological phenotype of
GLD murine model. The molecular encapsulation of harmful chemical compounds by several types of CDs has
drawn much attention in recent years. Thus, PK and PD profile improvements will potentiate their biological
effects. In human studies, αCD is safe and well tolerated and reduces small LDL-particle numbers and fasting
glucose. Herein, we propose to explore an innovative therapeutic approach to molecularly neutralize the
effects of the accumulated cytotoxic psychosine and, eventually, alter the pathogenic course of GLD. The
project's success will be a proof-of-principle of the novel approach, targeting a specific sphingolipid found at
cytotoxic high levels secondary to a lysosomal enzymatic deficiency. Of utmost importance, over ten states'
newborn screening (NBS) programs currently include GLD, as children with the infantile form benefit from early
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Therefore, the characterization and validation of aCD and its analogs
become highly important as adjunctive therapy for improving outcomes in this devastating disorder."

Natural peptide macrocycles are promising next-generation therapeutics, due to their abilities to bind to
challenging protein targets, such as protein interfaces and transcription factors. The goal of our lab is to use
insights and chemistries from natural product biosynthesis to facilitate the discovery and development of new
natural product-like peptide macrocycles. We will use a combined chemical and enzymatic approach for
synthesis and efficient benchtop evolution of highly constrained peptide macrocycles similar to those used in
nature. Over the next five years, these efforts will be divided between two main project areas. In the first project
area, we will use enzymes take from ribosomal peptide natural product biosynthetic pathways to modify mRNA
display libraries of peptides. Essential to this work will be the continued development of display-coupled assays
for enzyme modification that will be used to elucidate enzyme promiscuity. In the second project area, these
libraries will be used to select novel macrocyclic peptide inhibitors against a focused set of therapeutic targets
and complexes. Structural characterization of target-ligand complexes will uncover principles of macrocycle
engagement and elucidate new strategies for targeting these otherwise challenging interfaces. This work is
expected to yield new avenues and technologies for development of peptide macrocycle-based therapeutics."

The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes,
inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders.
We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools
could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia
of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel
therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems:
First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome
bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct
an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal
transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely,
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target
microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of
microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on
classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking
assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening
will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect
sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to
interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be
carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell
metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions.
An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically
sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome
composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This
work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the
foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions
of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology,
computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational-
experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public
health mission and goals."
10939501,"Abstract
It has long been known that that astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other motivation-regulatory
brain regions express dopamine receptors, but the cellular and behavioral function of astrocytic dopamine-
signaling remains underexplored. Experiments designed in this application aim at elucidating the synaptic role
of astrocytic dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) in the NAc in the context of cue-conditioned motivational behaviors
and cue-induced cocaine relapse. When animals search for reward, previously neutral environmental cues that
are paired with reward taking acquire motivational value that drives subsequent reward seeking. Such cue-
reward conditioning is essential for survival, but it is also usurped by drugs of abuse to establish the cue-drug
association that promotes drug seeking and relapse. The NAc is a key brain region where conditioned cues are
tagged with motivational value. When animals search and take reward, cue-encoding inputs from the ventral
hippocampus (vH) are simultaneously activated with reward-encoding inputs from the basolateral amygdala
(BLA), resulting in synced activation of vH and BLA synapses that are heterosynaptically aligned on the
dendrites of principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc. In brain slices, previous and preliminary
results from the PI’s lab demonstrate that synced activation of vH and BLA synapses selectively induces long-
term potentiation (LTP) in vH-to-NAc glutamatergic transmission. This novel form of heterosynaptic LTP,
termed hLTP, can increase the likelihood of vH-to-NAc transmission that encodes reward-contingent cues to
excite NAc MSNs for operant responding. Additional results from the PI’s lab show that either a general
inhibition of D1R or selective disruption of astrocyte function prevents the induction of hLTP. These and other
results lead to the overarching hypothesis that D1R-coupled astrocytic signaling is essential for hLTP at vH-to-
BLA synapses and cue-conditioned motivated behaviors. Guided by this hypothesis, proposed experiments will
characterize the role of NAc astrocytic D1R and its downstream signaling in the induction and expression of
hLTP as well as in the acquisition and performance of cue-induced nondrug versus drug seeking. Synaptic
plasticity has long been thought to be primarily mediated by neuronal signaling within the pre- and postsynaptic
terminals. The proposed research is conceptually innovative in that it will generate novel results demonstrating
the essential role of astrocytic signaling in sophisticated forms of synaptic plasticity that involve extracellular
signaling. Furthermore, characterizing behavioral roles of astrocytic D1R-signaling may reveal new cellular
targets through which cue-conditioned drug seeking and relapse can be manipulated. As such, the proposed
research is also clinically important and consistent with the mission of NIH in identifying and characterizing
novel therapeutic targets to treat substance use disorders."
10939883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During normal cell metabolism, exogenous and endogenous factors cause double-strand DNA breaks
(DSBs) that result in genome instability. DSB repair is critical for cell viability, but some DSB repair
processes exacerbate genome instability. Break-induced replication (BIR) is a unique DSB repair
mechanism associated with telomerase-independent telomere maintenance and genome instability.
Although BIR is evolutionarily conserved from phages to mammals, BIR in mammals has only recently
gained attention. Because BIR involves non-reciprocal copying of the template through conservative
DNA synthesis, errors in this process occur and can lead to catastrophic genome instability in the form
of genomic duplications, translocations, and rearrangements. BIR, which is less frequent than other
DNA repair mechanisms, is context-specific. Because its role in mammalian cells was only recently
discovered, and BIR has often been overlooked in favor of more common DNA repair mechanisms,
here we argue that an in-depth study of BIR mechanisms is needed.
 My long-term goal is to understand the role of BIR in promoting genome instability and
maintaining telomere lengths. To understand the mechanisms and genetic consequences of BIR, I
will take a multidisciplinary approach that combines cell biology, biochemistry, and genomics. My goals
for the next 5 years are (1) to determine the mechanisms by which BIR is regulated at telomeres
and transcriptionally active loci in the genome and (2) to develop new experimental tools and
techniques for studying BIR. Collectively, the proposed projects will elucidate the connection
between BIR, genome instability, and telomere elongation. Further, we will identify the upstream
regulatory mechanisms that initiate BIR coupled with transcription. Ultimately, these studies will
advance our understanding of the relationship between transcription and genome instability."

Despite recent advancements in treatment options for cancer, a majority of cancer types continue to lack fully
characterized and effective targeted therapies. This insufficiency has resulted in the demand for alternative,
previously unconsidered treatment approaches to improve disease diagnostics, prognoses, and patient
survival outcomes. Recently, we performed integrative analysis for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs) in a large
number of patient samples and identified 46 snoRNAs that exhibit broad-spectrum clinical significance with 12
or more types of cancer. We developed a data portal, snoRNA in cancers (SNORic), which allows researchers
to explore the significance of individual snoRNAs in cancer. SNORic has been accessed >100,000 times since
its release in 2017, suggesting its broad impact in the biomedical research community. We provided initial
genetic evidence indicating that elevated expression of snoRNAs facilitated the tumorigenesis of mammary
gland malignancies. Mechanistically we demonstrated that SNORD46 plays important roles in promoting the
initiation, growth, invasion and progression of TNBC. Therefore, elucidation of the roles of snoRNAs in
promoting tumorigenesis serves as the first step in the development of a novel class of snoRNA-based
biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 Our central hypothesis is that snoRNAs serve as essential RNA targets in promoting cancer initiation,
progression, and drug resistance, which could be attenuated in vivo by an antisense oligonucleotide-based
targeted therapy. In specific aim 1, we will delineate the diagnostic and prognostic values of these snoRNAs in
triple-negative breast cancer (Aim 1.1). We will demonstrate the molecular mechanism that these snoRNAs
promote TNBC cell proliferation, mobility and invasion (Aim 1.2). We will demonstrate that antisense
oligonucleotide-based snoRNA targeted therapy effectively inhibits TNBC growth in vivo (Aim 1.3). We will
evaluate and interpret causal effects through molQTL analysis (Aim 1.4). In specific aim 2, we will determine
the role of three snoRNAs in breast cancer drug resistance (Aim 2.1). We will understand the molecular
mechanisms for drug resistance through multi-omics data (Aim 2.2). To expand our perspective on drug
resistance, we will predict the drug response from individual snoRNA expression with the augmentation of
deep learning (Aim 2.3). We will study the drug responses effects among snoRNA-based subtypes (Aim 2.4).
We will build a user-friendly data portal for releasing the date generated through integrative analysis (Aim 2.5).
This study will significantly advance the prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic potential of snoRNAs; the
absence of this research work will greatly hinder the realization of snoRNA-based therapeutic considerations
for cancer patients."

This IPERT R25 application will formalize and expand upon a series of unique Biomedical Data Science
Innovation Lab online and in-person workshops whose immersive and hands-on approach will accelerate the
ability of early-career biomedical and quantitative investigators to form new collaborations around biomedical
science projects. Each year a distinct biomedical topic will be specifically identified which would benefit from a
fresh or divergent data science perspective. During the Biomedical Data Science Innovation Lab events,
professional facilitators and senior scientist mentors (with relevant expertise and exposure to the topic area)
assist the participants - guiding the development of innovative research project proposals. The primary purpose
of the facilitators is to build the community, strengthen the bonds between the participants, and help the teams
to form. Program directorship will provide leadership, continuity, and logistical support, while other stakeholders
provide vision, expertise, and ongoing program feedback. Senior faculty mentors will contribute topic background
and data science applications while also providing oversight and feedback on the development of new projects.
Early-career investigators (at the post-doc, assistant to newly associate professor level, research and tenure
track) from quantitative (including but not limited to applied and/or theoretical mathematics, statistics, computer
science, physics, and engineering) and biomedical fields (including but not limited to biological, biophysical,
epidemiological, and clinical disciplines) will be welcomed to submit applications. A broad diversity of
backgrounds is desired with women and members of underrepresented communities encouraged to apply.
Throughout the year-long program, participants will benefit directly from explicit skills training in data science
methods, reproducibility, Team Science, responsible conduct in research, and will learn about research funding
mechanisms directly through interaction with NIH and NSF program officers. Participants will form
multidisciplinary teams during the in-person workshop to develop biomedical topic domain projects involving
mathematical modeling, statistical analytics, and other quantitative methods. Upon completion of the workshops,
follow-up virtual activities will solidify teams and their research proposals as grant applications suitable for
submission to federal and private funding agencies. Rigorous assessment and characterization of skills training
activities as well as team effectiveness using emerging Science of Team Science-based approaches will strictly
pursued. A rich program for dissemination of workshop activities includes broad-based outreach, a detailed
website, and the development of professional-grade visual media and materials. With a well-suited team and a
track record of prior success, this is a novel program for research community building, fully aligned with the goals
of the IPERT R25 program.

10919755,"Bacterial infections are the second leading cause of death in ESRD. The incidence of pneumonia amongst
dialysis patients is increasing and leads to a mortality rate that is 14-16-fold greater than pneumonia in the
general population. Little is known regarding the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with
CKD and ESRD. Preliminary data suggests that antibody production and duration in response to pneumococcal
vaccines is reduced in CKD and ESRD. The cause of decreased antibody production and duration in response
to pneumococcal vaccines is unknown.
 CKD and ESRD may impair B cells directly and reduce the ability of T follicular helper (TFH) cells to
support effective B cell selection and differentiation. Production of antibodies of high specificity, affinity, and,
thus, function is derived from the frequency and pattern of mutation in immunoglobulin genes that encode the
antibody’s antigen-binding variable region (VH) in response to infection or vaccine. Development of effective
antibodies requires serial mutations in VH genes by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and changes in the effector
constant region from IgM to IgG or IgA by class switch recombination. Both processes require the DNA editing
enzyme AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) in B cells in lymphoid germinal centers (GC). The effect
of CKD on B cell maturation, SHM, class switch recombination and AID is unknown.
We will characterize mucosal (nasopharyngeal) and systemic B cell and antibody responses to PCV-13 among
adults with CKD and determine:
a) Whether CKD impairs levels of PPS-specific IgA and IgG in nasal mucosa and in blood with PCV-13, and
 differential expression of specific IgG1/2 and IgA1/2;
b) Whether the quality (avidity) and function (opsonophagocytosis) of PPS-specific mucosal (nasopharyngeal)
 and systemic IgA and IgG are compromised by CKD.
c) If PPS-specific IgG1/2 (and IgA1/2) show differential i) production with PCV-13 with CKD in blood and
 nasopharyngeal mucosa. ii) killing of S. pneumoniae.
We will determine whether CKD impacts the mutation frequency of VH genes in PPS-specific B cells in
association with impaired TFH and AID responses after PCV-13 vaccination.
a) Characterize the frequency, diversity, clustering and VH gene mutation frequency in pneumococcal capsule-
 specific IgG antibody-secreting cells in each group on day 7 after PCV-13;
b) Determine TFH cell recruitment and activity, expression of AID in B cell subsets pre- and post-stimulation by i)
 mRNA for AID and ii) intracellular AID protein expression.
c) Determine the contribution of chronic inflammation (eg., IL-6, TNF-α) in CKD on TFH and AID responses and
 capsule-specific antibody levels, avidity, function after PCV-13."

10928914,"Alcohol misuse is strongly associated with suicide crises (i.e., acute suicidal ideation or attempts) and death.
The standard care for a suicide crisis, including for persons who misuse alcohol, is acute psychiatric
hospitalization. Acute psychiatric hospitalization focuses on stabilization and crisis resolution prior to quickly
discharging at-risk patients back into their stressful environments with a referral for outpatient care. Outpatient-
based interventions focused on emotion regulation training have been shown to simultaneously reduce alcohol
misuse and suicidal behavior. Yet, less than 50% of psychiatric inpatients follow through with outpatient
treatment, which creates a dangerous gap in care; risk for suicide is the highest among recently discharging
patients who misuse alcohol. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23)
involves the development of a novel adjunctive intervention to (1) enhance standard care for at-risk psychiatric
inpatients who misuse alcohol, and (2) create an opportunity for sustained recovery and reduced risk for a
subsequent suicide crisis during the post-discharge period. This intervention, entitled mHealth-supported Skills
Training for Alcohol and Related Suicidality (mSTARS), combines emotion regulation skills training
implemented in the acute setting with a mHealth app designed to encourage utilization of these skills during
the risky post-discharge period. The research plan for this K23 has two phases: development (Phase 1: AIMS
1 and 2) and evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of mSTARS (Phase 2: AIM 3). To inform mHealth app
development, we will conduct a 6-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study on suicidal psychiatric
inpatients who misuse alcohol (N = 35) to elucidate time-varying predictors for alcohol consumption and
suicidal ideation, and examine the role of specific emotion regulation deficits. Analyses will facilitate
adjustments to the app to make empirically-based recommendations for emotion regulation skills in real time
(AIM 1). mSTARS, including the inpatient skills training component and mHealth app, will be iteratively refined
per patient-driven modifications over two successive cohorts (n = 5 in each) of suicidal psychiatric inpatients
who misuse alcohol (AIM 2). The finalized version of mSTARS, while incorporating AIM 1 findings, will be
evaluated in AIM 3 in a three-arm feasibility/acceptability randomized control trial comparing mSTARS (n = 15)
to inpatient skills training (n = 10) and treatment as usual (TAU) only (n = 10). The research plan for this K23 is
closely tied to the PI’s training goals, which are to gain experience with (1) advanced longitudinal modeling of
EMA data, (2) mHealth-supported treatment development, and (3) clinical trials design and management. Over
the 5-year K23 award period, these training goals will facilitate the PI’s overarching career goal of becoming an
independent clinical researcher. Beginning with this K23, the broader aim of the PI’s research program is to
develop integrated, scalable, and cost-effective mHealth-supported interventions to treat concurrent alcohol
misuse and suicidal behavior across treatment settings, reducing risk for this underserved population."

10905347,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most deadly of the common cancers, with limited treatment
options. Chemotherapy is marginally effective, while targeted or immunologic agents have little benefit. We
recently showed that wild-type IDH1 (wtIDH1) is required for PDAC cells to survive their harsh and nutrient-
limited microenvironment (TME). The cytosolic enzyme, IDH1, converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), using
NADP+ as a cofactor. In the setting of nutrient scarcity, the reaction products (NADPH and αKG) help neutralize
free radicals and boost mitochondrial function, respectively. Under TME-associated conditions, we discovered
that allosteric IDH1 inhibitors, designed and approved to selectively treat mutant-IDH1 tumors, actually target
the wtIDH1 enzyme. Tumors have very low Mg2+ levels, which permits drugs like FDA-approved ivosidenib to
outcompete the cation in the allosteric pocket, leading to increased efficacy against wtIDH1 PDAC across tumor
models (see Nature Cancer, 2022). While anti-wtIDH1 therapy is promising, especially in combination with
chemotherapy, in this proposal we identify practical, safe, and chemo-sparing treatments that optimize anti-
wtIDH1 therapy based on our recently acquired insights. Specifically, strategies (pharmacologic or dietary) that
further enhance PDAC reliance on antioxidant defense and mitochondrial metabolism for survival are particularly
effective. Relevant to this work, olaparib is the only FDA-approved targeted treatment of PDAC. The drug inhibits
PARP1-mediated DNA repair and is indicated for BRCA-mutant PDAC (<10% of cases), which all exhibit
homologous recombination (HR) deficiency. PARP blockade shifts metabolism towards oxidative
phosphorylation. A ketogenic diet also reprograms metabolism in this direction by reducing glucose availability.
In Aim 1, we pair wild-type IDH1 (ivosidenib) and PARP1inhibitors (olaparib) in both HR deficient and proficient
PDAC using GEMM and PDX models. We will show for the first time that wtIDH1 blockade directly inhibits PARP
(through increased NADP+) and induces a BRCA-like phenotype (through decreased αKG and histone
hypermethylation), resulting in strong synergy between drugs, even in HR proficient PDAC. The intent of this
combination is to expand the indications for olaparib to the majority of PDAC. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that
anti-wtIDH1 therapy is potentiated when combined with a ketogenic diet. The two treatments synergize
mechanistically, as a ketogenic diet drives the production of free radicals and shifts metabolism towards oxidative
phosphorylation, which magnifies PDAC’s need for wtIDH1. We also show that both therapies reduce histone
acetylation: low glucose from a ketogenic diet depletes a carbon source, while reduced TCA cycle activity after
wtIDH1 inhibition also affects acetyl CoA pools. In Aim 3, we will analyze PDAC patient samples from an ongoing
clinical trial (NCT05209074) for ivosidenib activity against wtIDH1, compared to control samples. Metabolic and
DNA repair changes will be assessed. We will also compare tumoral Mg2+ levels to serum. These aims will inform
future studies and trials seeking to optimize anti-IDH1-based therapies in patients."

Health Delivery Systems (HDS) to support Research Training, Infrastructure and Career
Development in response to PA-22-238. ASTARISQ will be convened each year in an
innovative, collaborative, and structured approach to achieve three aims: (1) Identify, prioritize,
and co-design with impacted community members trainings on anti-racist strategies, policies,
and practices to address structural racism in HDS to improve patient safety, quality of care, and
trustworthiness in HDS; (2) Convene an interactive series of roundtables to train and prepare
diverse stakeholder groups to address structural racism in HDS and health services research
(HSR); and (3) Produce and disseminate guidance documents to equip participants and broader
audiences with resources and skills in evidence-based, anti-racism-informed strategies to
strengthen anti-racist policies and practices.
We co-developed and delivered the 2023 Summer Roundtable Series with health systems
administrators and stakeholders on five key topics, including race and racism in digital health
and information technology, achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion through decentralized
clinical trials, overcoming systemic racism and bias in providing quality care, addressing equity
in health care access and affordability, and health literacy as liberation and suppression. This
proposal uses three innovative methodologies to support the Cycle of Change theoretical
framework: (1) addressing racism through individual and organizational change in parallel and in
real time to improve safety, quality, and trustworthiness in HDS; (2) engaging and including
persons from priority populations in the roundtable planning, presenting, disseminating, and
evaluation; and (3) mutual learning to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms.
We plan to amplify the impact of each roundtable and to distribute conference evidence and
materials broadly, with an emphasis on reaching out to stakeholders identified in AHRQ’s
Priority Populations. The roundtable series will present opportunities for all stakeholders to
disseminate evidence, implement anti-racist strategies and resources, and establish
relationships and improve awareness and implementation of anti-racist approaches to address
structural racism and provide examples of best practices, which have the potential to change
concepts, methods, and technologies among health delivery systems and stakeholders."

The Cancer Registry Shared Resource Core (CRSRC) will serve a key role in identifying and characterizing
cancer disparities in the multiethnic populations of Guam and Hawai‘i. The overall objective of the CRSR is to
provide key infrastructure support for cancer research and outreach activities of the Pacific Island Partnership
for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE). The CRSRC meets the requirements of PIPCHE shared resources to
enhance the ability to conduct cancer disparities research.
The CRSRC represents a partnership between the Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) and the Hawai‘i Tumor
Registry (HTR), the central cancer registries of the Territory of Guam and the State of Hawai‘i, respectively.
This partnership has been critical to the development of the GCR as a fully functioning registry through
technical support and training provided by the HTR and through the establishment of statutory authority for
cancer reporting and securing territorial funding. The CRSRC subsequently played a critical role in the
development of the Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry covering the US Affiliated Pacific Islands.
The CRSRC serves as a critical resource for PIPCHE research and outreach. The CRSRC generates high-
quality cancer surveillance data through which cancer disparities can be identified and characterized. This
information is key to establishing PIPCHE research and outreach priorities. The CRSR also provides key
support for research and outreach activities.
The CRSRC will continue to serve as an important Core of the PIPCHE.
Specific Aim 1. Provide cancer data and related support for PIPCHE research projects (full and
pilot) and outreach activities.
Specific Aim 2. Build capacity for cancer surveillance and health disparities research at the
University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC). This alignment will
allow for a synergy and sharing of data that would not be possible otherwise."

Obesity and Type 2 diabetes represent states of chronic inflammation. While we have learned
much about how the soluble mediators and signaling intermediates of immunity disrupt normal
metabolic function, we do not yet understand the transcriptional mechanisms by which these
responses occur. Our laboratory has discovered that interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), a family
of immune-related transcription factors, are active in tissues of metabolic relevance. We showed
that IRF3 in particular becomes induced during obesity, and mediates many of the adverse effects
of overnutrition, including weight gain, suppression of brown fat function, insulin resistance, and
hepatic steatosis. We have gone on to show that IRF3 exerts distinct functions in adipocytes and
hepatocytes, with differential effects on metabolic parameters. We also identify a key downstream
IRF3 target, ISG15, as a mediator of the actions of IRF3 in fat. In the current proposal, we will
advance our knowledge of IRF3 and metabolic function by focusing on its actions in
macrophages, specifically in adipose tissue macrophages and Kupffer cells of the liver.
Furthermore, we will determine the mechanisms by which ISG15 represses adipose browning
and thermogenesis. Finally, we will pursue an unbiased analysis of IRF3 target genes in fat, liver,
and macrophages, to determine new pathways at the nexus of metabolism and inflammation that
may be amenable to therapeutic intervention."

 The purpose of this K23 is to provide the training, mentorship, and research experiences needed for the
applicant to become a successful independent clinical scientist with a research program focused on
understanding mechanisms linking sensory anomalies, brain dysmaturation, and speech and language
impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders. The training plan focuses on developing skills required to
measure and understand the behavioral, auditory, and neurophysiological indices of early speech and hearing
development in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), with three specific areas of emphasis: 1) statistical methods and
signal processing techniques required for cutting edge analysis of functional neurophysiology (fNIRS/EEG), 2)
development of the auditory system and speech/hearing in infancy and 3) research methods and ethics for
studying infants and very young children with FXS. Dr. Craig Erickson along with co-mentors Dr. John
Sweeney and Dr. Lisa Hunter will provide the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to achieve the
training objectives. This research program is relevant to several objectives listed in the NIH Research Plan on
FXS and Associated Disorders, including but not limited to objectives 3.1 (Develop a standard battery of
functional, objective measures to better characterize the emergence of the FXS phenotype across the life span
and provide precise indicators of treatment effectiveness) and 3.4 (Conduct longitudinal studies of both
humans and animal models to characterize the dynamic nature of the FXS phenotype across the life span and
to identify moderators and mediators of the phenotype).
 FXS can be diagnosed in the infant and toddler years given its genetic/heritable etiology. However,
current understanding of atypical maturation of brain function in FXS and its clinical manifestations is entirely
based on studies of older children (5+), adolescents, and adults, at which point impairments associated with
the disorder, including delays in speech and language, have been present for several years. Thus,
understanding of neural mechanisms and timing of the early brain dysmaturation that lead to early delays in
FXS remains limited, which in turn limits development of interventions. The proposed career development plan
provides the PI with the skills to address this gap in brain-based markers of impairment in early FXS. The
research plan uses EEG/fNIRS, auditory evaluations, and speech and language assessment to investigate
auditory hypersensitivity and its relation to emergence of speech and language delays in FXS. This study
occurs in two phases, with the first focusing on preschoolers (2-4 years) and the second, longitudinal phase
focused on the infant years (0-2 years).Thus, the aim of this early career development program is to prepare
the investigator to establish an independent research program focused on determining the timing and nature of
brain dysmaturation that leads to early speech and communication impairment in FXS."
10941755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pregnancy loss is estimated to affect approximately 30% of clinically defined pregnancies in the United
States, however the actual number is likely much higher due to spontaneous abortions prior to a woman
learning she is pregnant. Similarly, in cattle, almost 50% of pregnancies are estimated to end prematurely. In
both species, the majority of pregnancies are lost early in embryonic development and the underlying reason is
often unknown or unexplained. One potential mechanism underlying pregnancy loss are alterations to the
paternal epigenome. Mammalian spermatozoa exhibit a unique, highly compacted and condensed DNA
structure that is strongly dependent on epigenetic mechanisms, including histone hyperacetylation followed by
nucleosome eviction. Specifically, 85-99% of sperm nucleosomes are evicted and replaced with protamines,
allowing for this remarkable degree of compaction. Human sperm exhibiting abnormal chromatin composition,
including excess histone retention or post-translational modifications, are associated with infertility, altered
embryogenesis following IVF/ICSI, and pregnancy loss. However, the exact cause of altered embryogenesis
as a result of an abnormal paternal epigenome, and ultimately, potential regulatory functions and mechanisms
by which paternally contributed histones affect early development, remain largely unknown. In this proposal,
sperm from bulls of low fertility that have previously been linked to pregnancy loss will be utilized to understand
how sperm chromatin regulates mammalian fertility, embryogenesis, and establishment of a healthy
pregnancy. This proposal will test if the paternal contribution of epigenetic information, specifically
histones, associated post-translational modifications, and genomic placement, are a critical factor in
normal embryo development, placentation, and ultimately successful pregnancy.
 These studies will utilize previously characterized bulls of high and low fertility to study the paternal
histone epigenome and subsequent regulation of the embryo though the following Specific Aims: (1) Establish
the baseline paternal histone epigenome in fertile bulls (2) Determine if the paternal histone epigenome is
altered in low-fertility bulls and (3) Investigate changes to preimplantation embryos generated from low-fertility
bulls. Together, the proposed research will provide important insight into the mechanisms governing early
embryonic development, including the effects of an abnormal paternal epigenome on chromatin dynamics and
embryonic genome activation. It will additionally provide evidence as to why paternal chromatin results in
infertility and altered embryogenesis in cattle and humans. The results of these studies have the potential to
ultimately impact reproductive efficiency and help clinical management of patients diagnosed with infertility,
poor embryogenesis, and pregnancy loss."

pediatric BMT group served as PI of the core site until 2022 when Dr. Horwitz from Duke’s adult BMT group
assumed the role. In an attempt to improve accrual to the network trials, the blood and marrow transplant
program at the University of Virginia, under the direction of Dr. Karen Ballen, was added in 2017 to form the
Duke Consortium. With successful renewal of this application, the Duke Consortium will add the Novant
Health Transplantation and Cellular Therapy program. With FACT accredited treatment centers in both
Charlotte and Winston Salem, North Carolina, the Novant Health program has the potential to add
considerably to the accrual and scientific contributions of the Duke Consortium. Each site lead will make
decisions as to which network studies are to be opened for accrual at their respective sites. Funds provided by
the award will be distributed shared with consortium sites.
The study proposed in this application is entitled A Phase III, randomized, double blinded placebo-controlled
study of galactooligosaccaraide (GOS) in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. Justification for the trial is based on published pre-clinical and clinical data linking the
composition of the intestinal microbiome with survival following allogeneic HCT. GOS is commercially available
dietary supplement that has been shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and abdominal
pain. Outcomes may also be mediated by the effect of GOS on commensal genera and butyrate producers such
as Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria. In addition, GOS consumption has been shown to positively modulate
immune function by improving NK cell activity, increasing production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and
decreasing production of IL-1β.
The trial is ideal for the BMTCTN in that: (1) it is a phase III trial that can only be accomplished in the multi-site,
collaborative fashion, (2) has the potential to improve the outcome of allogeneic HCT by preventing GVHD,
improving immune reconstitution and thus reducing relapse, all with a simple, inexpensive intervention, (3) the
study drug will be provided by the manufacturer thereby mitigating the expense of the study, and (4) has the
potential to enroll a racial and ethnically diverse population that includes children age > 4years.
The study will leverage the expertise of Dr. Anthony Sung at Duke and Dr. Indumurthy Varadarajan at UVa, who
have both established a basic and clinical research portfolio in the field of intestinal microbiome. If approved,
Dr. Sung will serve as the protocol PI."
10940466,"Project Summary
Proliferative retinopathies, characterized by the growth of pathological blood vessels (neovessels), are the
leading causes of blindness in all age groups. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is of particular significance in
the pediatric population. In this condition, widespread ischemia drives retinal neovascularization that can lead
to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss. The underlying signaling mechanisms that orchestrate the
growth of neovessels remain incompletely understood. Defining the molecular basis that governs
neovascularization (NV) is necessary for the development of new or improved therapeutic strategies. Our goal
is to delineate the regulatory mechanisms that facilitate neovascular growth and regression.
Normal retinal vascular development is tightly regulated by multicellular-derived cues. At early phases of
physiological vascular growth, sprouting endothelial tip cells closely interact and migrate over the astrocytes
template to form the primary retinal vascular layer. During this process, microglia facilitate the spatial
establishment of the astrocyte and vascular networks. On the other hand, the cellular guidance mechanism(s)
involved in pathological vascular growth are not clearly known. Our preliminary data shows that the ischemia-
induced pathological vascular growth in the retina is guided by peripheral immune cells, and not by astrocytes
or microglia. Further preliminary studies demonstrate that localized chemokine signaling aids the recruitment of
peripheral immune cells that subsequently promotes neovascular growth. Although the microglial-neovessel
interactions are absent at early phases of NV, microglial recruitment and wrapping of neovascular tufts are
increased at peak phases of NV. Microglia are known to phagocytose and eliminate dying or immature cells
through complement activation. Our preliminary data shows that the loss of complement receptors reduced
neovascular regression. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that neovascular progression is related to
distinct endothelial/myeloid cell-derived chemokine signaling, while neovascular regression is related to
microglial activation of the complement pathway. We will substantiate or refute our hypothesis in the following
two specific aims. Aim 1: To determine the role of chemokine signaling in facilitating non-resident immune cell
recruitment and neovascular growth. Aim 2: To define the role of microglial complement receptors in regulating
neovascular regression. We will utilize innovative multiplex in-situ hybridization, cell type-specific mRNA
sequencing, multimodal single cell sequencing, unique reporter mice, and Cre-lox animals for cell-specific
deletion. We anticipate that the successful completion of the proposed studies will significantly advance our
understanding of spatiotemporal innate immune regulation of neovascularization and help identify novel or
enhanced treatment strategies for related vaso-proliferative retinopathies."
11196043,"The Contraceptive Development Program (CDP) supports research in the synthesis and testing of a broad spectrum of male and female contraceptive agents. Successful development of new contraceptive methods for men and women has been a goal for many decades. From the inception of this program, the CDP has had a continuing need for a Chemical Synthesis Facility (CSF) capable of synthesizing potential anti-fertility agents on a laboratory milligram to gram scale to a relatively larger kilogram scale. The kilogram scale chemical agents are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for comprehensive contraceptive evaluation, including toxicology studies and preclinical safety studies before entering human clinical studies.
The CSF provides the Government with chemicals, chemical intermediates, steroids, drug candidates, and drugs, which are either a new chemical entity (NCE) commercially unavailable or unduly expensive to obtain commercially. The areas of chemical synthesis for CSF consist of small molecule antagonists or agonists of protein targets, including but not limited to active natural products, natural product analogues, active steroids estrogens, progestins, androgens, and their analogues. In addition, CSF has an important role in support of providing intermediates for the synthesis of many unnatural amino acids that may be incorporated into the preparation of unnatural peptide agonists or antagonists by another CDP's contractor."
10939905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) present profound global
challenges, particularly for rapidly aging populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). An
important approach to mitigating dementia risk is strategies to promote cognitive function throughout life.
Research suggests that beyond formal education in childhood and early adulthood, labor force participation
and stimulating activities could provide stimulation in the middle and later years and reduce cognitive decline
and AD/ADRD. However, these findings are mostly from Western high-income countries (HICs) and may not
apply to LMICs, where prospects for older people, especially older women, are largely lacking, with few
opportunities to remain active and intellectually stimulated throughout life. Comparable data from LMICs and
HICs are needed to provide the necessary variability to observe different experiences in labor engagement and
opportunities for stimulating activities and to examine their effects on cognitive aging processes in racially,
ethnically, educationally, and culturally diverse populations. Such data could offer insights that cannot be
observed in more homogenous populations and could inform tailored policies to prevent cognitive decline and
AD/ADRD worldwide. This proposed project will address critical gaps in global cognitive aging research by
investigating the impact of labor force participation and key stimulating activities in middle and later life on
cognitive aging outcomes by gender and across sociocultural contexts. We will use data from three LMICs—
China, India, and Mexico—that represent a significant portion of the global aging population with variable
gender norms and roles and opportunities in education, work, and stimulating activities. We will contrast these
data with two developed countries, England and the US. We will leverage novel comprehensive
neuropsychological batteries in >20,000 participants from the global Harmonized Cognitive Assessment
Protocol (HCAP) studies and longitudinal data from their parent studies from diverse sociocultural contexts. We
will pursue three specific aims: 1) evaluate cross-country differences in both labor force participation and
engagement in stimulating activities and their relationships with cognitive functioning and cognitive decline by
gender; 2) evaluate cross-country differences in the relationships between labor force participation and
stimulating activities with subsequent dementia by gender; and 3) investigate within-country gender differences
in types of work and stimulating activities and their impact on cognitive decline and dementia. Results from the
proposed project will provide critical insights to inform global prevention of AD/ADRD risk—especially in LMIC
populations that are growing rapidly but most vulnerable to the challenges posed by AD/ADRD—by informing
tailored interventions and policies in the US and globally to improve population health."
10940893,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the significant clinical success of AR-targeted therapies in the management of prostate cancer (PCa),
resistance to these treatments remains a significant challenge. This resistance often manifests as persistent or
even elevated levels of AR and AR signaling. Emerging evidence indicates that the dysregulation of the
ubiquitination-based protein degradation process is pivotal in the accumulation of oncogenic proteins like AR,
contributing to therapeutic resistance. While the role of various E3 ligases in the degradation of AR and the
tumorigenesis of PCa has been extensively studied, there is a crucial yet unaddressed gap in our understanding
regarding the specific E2 enzyme responsible for AR degradation. Our research identifies UBE2J1 as the
authentic E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme accountable for AR ubiquitination in PCa. Preliminary results reveal
that the frequent loss of UBE2J1 in 10-15% of PCa patients leads to dysregulated AR ubiquitination and
degradation, contributing to its accumulation and resistance to AR-targeted therapy. By utilizing ubiquitination-
based AR degraders, we have successfully reinstated AR degradation and impeded the growth of therapy-
resistant PCa tumors. In light of these compelling findings, we propose three aims to validate the central
hypothesis that UBE2J1 serves as the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in regulating AR degradation and
resistance to AR-targeted therapies. The overarching goal of this study is to unravel the molecular functions
of UBE2J1 in governing AR ubiquitination, degradation, and various facets of PCa tumorigenesis and therapy
resistance. In Aim 1, we will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the role of UBE2J1 in regulating AR functions
across multiple stages of PCa, employing both in vitro and in vivo models. We will utilize single-cell RNA
sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to assess the effect of UBE2J1-loss on tumor heterogeneity and
resistance at single-cell resolution. In Aim 2, we will comprehensively dissect the molecular mechanisms through
which UBE2J1 regulates AR degradation. We will identify the critical domains of UBE2J1, pinpoint the specific
interaction and ubiquitination sites on AR, and reveal the E3 ligase responsible for UBE2J1-mediated AR
degradation. We will also explore alterations in the AR cistrome and transcriptome landscape in the context of
UBE2J1-loss. In Aim 3, we will initially evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of restoring AR degradation
using PROTAC-based AR degraders AC67 and AC176 in various UBE2J1-KO PCa models. We will
subsequently assess the predictive value of UBE2J1 expression as a biomarker for responses to both AR
antagonists and AR degraders. Completion of this project will not only substantially refine our comprehension of
the molecular mechanisms governing AR degradation and therapy resistance in advanced PCa but pave the
way for the development of an impactful predictive biomarker, as well as a new therapeutic approach to combat
this lethal complication of modern targeted therapies, thereby improving the clinical outcomes for patients."

Our research is focused on the mechanisms that control the cell cycle of growth and division. The
identification of proteins and pathways that regulate the decision to divide has led to inhibitors to treat
cancer. However, the shortcomings of these inhibitors make it clear that there are still many molecular
aspects of cell-cycle control that we do not understand, and further research is needed to innovate
improved therapies. The cell cycle consists of two waves of gene expression to replicate DNA and
undergo mitosis. We will study the structure, function, and regulation of proteins that control this cell-
cycle dependent gene expression. These proteins include the transcription factors or TFs (e.g. E2F, B-
Myb, FoxM1) whose activity stimulates transcription, proteins that negatively regulate the TFs (e.g. Rb,
CycF, and the MuvB complex), and the kinases (e.g. Cdk, Aurora A, and Plk1) that phosphorylate and
modulate TF activity. We will use an integrated approach that combines structural biology with cell-
based assays to determine how these proteins interact with each other and chromatin to control
transcription. These studies will provide new mechanistic insights regarding how the cell cycle is
controlled and how transcription factors directly modulate gene expression through influencing
chromatin structure."

10925846,"Cellular immunotherapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T) extend the lives of
cancer patients who are otherwise out of options. These therapies represent a leap forward in
cancer treatment but suffer from severe limitations because 1) the tumor microenvironment
excludes and exhausts T cells including CAR-T cells, 2) some tumor cells escape by
downregulating the target antigen, 3) the therapy incites cytokine storms and autoimmune
reactions, and 4) cellular therapies are currently complex, time-consuming, and exorbitantly
expensive. Here we propose to overcome these limitations and thereby revolutionize,
generalize, and democratize cellular immunotherapies. A promising new cellular immunotherapy
approach is CAR-M (macrophage). Two Phase 1 clinical trials are in progress and it is clear that
the approach is safe though there is substantial room for improvement in efficacy. While CAR-M
has many advantages over CAR-T, it is clear that it would be of great value to enhance the
capacity of CAR macrophages to attack and kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. Based
on fundamental cell and developmental biology we have been doing in fruit flies, we discovered
how to greatly increase the ability of human macrophages to attack and kill specific whole target
cells of our choosing. Inspired by our discovery in fruit flies, we have been able to engineer
mouse and human macrophages to avidly and specifically engulf and kill cancer cells. Here we
propose to test this approach against the most prevalent solid tumors like breast, lung, and
colon, and against hard-to-treat cancers like ovarian, pancreatic, and glioblastoma. Another
huge limitation of cellular immunotherapies is their cost and complexity. We propose to
overcome this problem by greatly simplifying the production and delivery of CAR-M. We
propose to transform CAR-M into an affordable, off-the-shelf therapy. This will enable
generalization of the approach to hard-to-treat diseases beyond cancer, such as multidrug
resistant bacteria, viral and fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and more."
10920448,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults worldwide. Upper-limb paresis is the most common 
impairment post-stroke. The ultimate goal of stroke rehabilitation is to improve patients’ motor 
performance in their home and community settings (i.e., what patients actually do). However, current 
clinical standards to monitor patients’ recovery process are limited to assessing patients’ motor capacity 
observed in the clinic (i.e., what patients are capable of doing). Wrist-worn accelerometers have been 
considered as a potential solution but criticized for providing a limited view of upper-limb performance. 
Therefor, the research and clinical communities have emphasized the need for a technological solution to 
support a more comprehensive understanding of stroke survivors’ motor performance. 
In this work, we propose to develop a novel multi-modal sensing platform to monitor important elements of 
upper-limb motor performance: the amount, type, and quality of movements. To that end, we introduce a 
new kind of sensing technology, namely Body Channel Identification (BCID), that can accurately and 
reliably track human interactions with the environment and, thus, human behaviors. In our setting, 
everyday objects are instrumented with small, inexpensive, batteryless BCID tags that can be powered by 
and communicate with wrist-worn devices (so-called readers) by exploiting the human body as the signal 
transfer channel during tactile interactions. The system provides multi-modal data, including the object ID, 
binary time-series of interaction patterns (contact vs. no contact), kinetic data from an optional pressure 
sensor embedded in the tag, and kinematic data from the inertial measurement unit on the wrist-worn 
readers. Leveraging data obtained from 50 stroke survivors and ten healthy subjects, we propose to 
develop a unique set of machine learning algorithms to process these data to taxonomically identify 
important types of upper-limb movements relevant to stroke rehabilitation, which are further processed to 
assess the quality and amount of movements performed. Finally, we investigate the relationship between 
the motor capacity observed in the clinic vs. motor performance outside the clinic, a topic that has been 
deemed critical in stroke rehabilitation but infeasible due to technical limitations. We believe the proposed 
research will lay the technological groundwork to open up new research and clinical opportunities, leading 
to key scientific discoveries to transform current practices of stroke rehabilitation."
10927453,"Understanding how learning occurs in early childhood has the potential to transform our understanding of 
human learning and our approach to building intelligent machines, yet critical windows in early childhood 
remain under-sampled and consequently provide little insight concerning learning. One fundamental and 
long-standing question in human learning is the process by which neural specialization for visual letter 
and digit processing emerges in the first grade. This knowledge is critical for addressing public health 
concerns related to reading and math literacy because first-grade letter and digit knowledge are the 
strongest predictors of future reading and math abilities, and children who fall behind in reading and math 
in elementary school will likely experience medical and financial instability as adults. This project employs 
a multi-level approach to understanding learning in childhood that will support critical advancements in 
several disciplines, including human and artificial learning, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, 
educational neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, computer vision, and learning sciences broadly. The 
first aim is to create and distribute a large corpus of images from Sesame Street episodes annotated for 
educational content, such as letters and digits, as well as for other common object categories. The image 
corpus will be the first to capture the visual statistics of child learners and can be used to train different 
artificial learning architectures to better understand human learning. The second aim is to collect, 
preprocess, and distribute a dense longitudinal MRI dataset of brain structure and function sampled at 
multiple time points throughout the first grade year. The dense longitudinal MRI dataset will provide 
experimentally measured brain responses to images from the Sesame Street corpus that will be of benefit 
for understanding human learning and of appropriate scale for constraining artificial learning architectures. 
The third aim is to evaluate the emergence of selective neural processing for letters and digits as learning 
occurs throughout the first year of schooling. This aim will address an open question in human learning 
concerning the process by which neural specialization for letters and digits emerges, namely the role of 
the motor system in emerging specialization. Understanding the time course of changes in brain function 
and structure during early learning is critical for developing accurate predictors of long-term life outcomes 
and for identifying sensitive windows of great plasticity to optimize intervention timelines."

ABSTRACT
This grant application was submitted in response to RFA-NS-24-011, “Center without Walls for PET
Ligand Development for ADRDs”. It describes a request for continued support for the Center without
Walls for Imaging Proteinopathies with PET (U19 NS110456), a project that was funded through RFA-
NS-19-014. The competing renewal describes our continued development of Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) ligands for imaging two proteinopathies: 1) alpha synuclein (Asyn) for imaging the
synucleinopathies Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy; and 2) 4R tau for imaging the 4R
tauopathies frontotemporal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. The Proteinopathy
Imaging Center (short title) consists of a synergistic, collaborative effort between the University of
Pennsylvania (Penn), Washington University-St. Louis (WUSTL), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt),
University of California-San Francisco (UCSF), and Yale University. The organization of the
Proteinopathy Imaging Center is both innovative and unique for the following reasons: 1) it partners
faculty members with an international reputation in the neurobiology (V. Lee, K. Luk, P Kotzbauer) and
structural biology (E.J. Petersson) of the proteinopathies with experts in radiotracer development at Penn
(RH Mach), Pitt (C. Mathis), and WUSTL (Z. Tu) in developing radiotracers for Asyn and 4R tau; 2) it
involves the multi-site collaboration of clinical investigators who are experts in the use of PET to study
CNS disorders (J. Perlmutter, WUSTL; R. Carson, Yale; G. Rabinovici, UCSF; A. Siderowf and I.
Nasrallah, Penn; V. Villemagne;Pitt); and 3) it involves the utilization of state-of-the-art PET imaging
devices for whole body distribution (PennPET Explorer) and high resolution brain studies (NeuroeXplorer,
Yale) of our Asyn and 4R tau radiotracers. The Proteinopathy Imaging Center also consists of a series
of cross-validation studies at both the basic science (i.e., radiotracer characterization) and clinical
research (i.e., consensus diagnosis) levels that can only be accomplished through the U19 funding
mechanism. The PI of the Center is Robert H. Mach, the Britton Chance Professor of Radiology at Penn.
The Center consists of three Cores (Administrative, Medicinal Chemistry and Radiochemistry, Clinical)
and two projects (Asyn, 4R tau). The cores are organized so that there is an overall Core Director or Co-
Director, and a site Director at each site participating in the Core activities. The radiotracers developed
by the Center without Walls for Imaging Proteinopathies with PET are expected to lead to generation
of imaging strategies that are of interest to the scientific mission of the NINDS. They are also expected
to provide novel imaging strategies to advance our knowledge on the role of Asyn and 4R tau in
neurodegenerative disorders."
10937794,"Title: Low Energy Availability (LEA), Nutrient Deficiencies, and Hypertension in Black Division I Athletes
SPECIFIC AIMS: The International Olympic Committee on Sports Nutrition (IOCSN) recognized low energy
availability (LEA), defined as inadequate calorie intake relative to energy expenditure. LEA may be particularly
important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among minority athlete populations, especially those exposed to
poor Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). This includes Black NCAA Division I collegiate athletes (BD1As),
who make up 21% of the Division I population and have a 5x higher risk of sudden cardiac death compared
to white athletes. Many of the SDOH indicators are alleviated as a Division I athlete (food is available, education
support staff, economic stability, etc.). However, many BD1As come from areas described above and have limited
awareness of nutritional factors that impact their health. Our pilot data indicate that BD1As with LEA, were over
seven times (OR = 7.2) more likely to have hypertension. Further work is required to identify the mechanisms
linking LEA to CVD. However, unraveling the mechanism’s two gaps in the literature should be addressed: (i)
establish whether the association between LEA and CVD risk is measurable; and (ii) determine whether the
association between LEA and CVD is modifiable. Filling these gaps will make it possible to identify at-risk athletes
and to prescribe strategies to restore energy balance (LEA) and/or directly decrease CVD risk.
Our long-term goal is to develop a practical, scalable, and effective non-pharmacological intervention to
decrease LEA as a way to mitigate CVD risk in BD1As. To support this goal, the overall objective of this
proposal is to robustly measure the strength of the association between LEA and HBP risk (in a larger cohort)
and determine whether SDOH moderates this association. We hypothesize that those identified as LEA will
significantly increase CVD risk and therefore propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that LEA
is positively associated with cardio-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), a measure of aortic arterial stiffness
and the gold-standard biomarker of vascular aging. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that LEA and cfPWV is
moderated by SDOH. While SDOH research among BD1As does not exist, AAs are more likely to be deficient in
fruits, vegetables while southern regions consume larger quantities of added fats, fried foods, processed meats,
and sugar-sweetened beverages known to negatively impact cardiovascular health.
Completion of this work will help mitigate the empirical understanding that BD1As are >7x more likely to
experience HBP and 5x more likely to experience sudden cardiac death.
The proposed longitudinal observational study will recruit a cohort of >120 BD1As aged 18-25 years recruited
from various sports that include an equitable male/female population from a large HBCU. Participants will be
assessed twice, ~4 months apart contingent on the beginning and end of their respective competitive season.
For each assessment, traditional (nutrition) and novel (pulse wave velocity) CVD risk biomarkers will be
measured, then questionnaires will collect information on SDOH: (i) built environment/food security (e.g.
accessibility to food); (ii) health literacy (e.g.: ability to find/understand, use health related information); (iii) sport
nutrition knowledge (e.g. knowledge of energy and nutrients); (iv) discrimination (e.g.: social/community context).
Aim 1. Determine the strength of the association between LEA and increased cfPWV. The strength of the
association using a general linear model we hypothesize that LEA will be strongly associated with cfPWV
increase across the competitive season. Measuring cfPWV evaluates the velocity of the pulse wave or forward
pressure transmitted between the carotid and femoral arteries. Decreased compliance of the aortic artery
increases the velocity of the pulse wave and is known as arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is significantly
associated with CVD risk and all cause death. cfPWV is known as the gold standard to evaluate arterial stiffness.
We predict that LEA will increase cfPWV by >1 m/s increasing CVD risk by 14%.
Aim 2. Determine if the association between LEA and cfPWV is moderated by SDOH. The 4 SDOH
variables will be added as covariates to the Aim 1 model independently and then in a multivariable model to test
the strength of association between variables. Questionnaires will evaluate information related to: (i) built
environment/food security by accessing published public demographic information/geomapping; (ii) health
literacy skills instrument short form; (iii) sport nutrition knowledge using the athlete diet index; (iv) discrimination
with the everyday discrimination scale. Three of the domains are shown to significantly affect health outcomes
in AAs while poor sport nutrition knowledge is highly related to eating disorders and physiological dysfunction.
We predict that each SDOH will be a significant effect moderator to the LEA/cfPWV association.
Impact. PWV is a highly sensitive and continuous measure of vascular aging and the gold-stand non-invasive
biomarker of CVD risk that has never been applied to BD1As. The final product will be an evidence-based

Chemotherapy treatment frequently results in taste alterations that significantly impact patients' quality of life
and recovery. While transient loss of taste receptor cells (TRCs) has been observed in mice after
chemotherapy, this does not fully explain the prolonged taste disruptions reported by human patients. My
preliminary data indicates that gustatory fiber innervation in taste buds is reduced shortly after chemotherapy,
but the recovery of these connections and their effects on taste response remain unclear. This study aims to
investigate the timeline of gustatory fiber recovery after cyclophosphamide (CYP) treatment and assess the
strength and specificity changes in taste signaling. To determine the time course of gustatory fiber
reinnervation within taste buds after CYP treatment, I will use immunohistochemistry and intravital imaging to
monitor the recovery of gustatory fibers and taste synapses over 20+ days post-treatment. To assess the
degree to which cyclophosphamide alters the strength and specificity of taste signaling in mice, I will use
whole-nerve recording and in-vivo calcium imaging. This proposal is designed to unravel the recovery process
of gustatory fiber innervation after chemotherapy and explore strength and specificity changes in taste
signaling. In addition, activities planned for this proposal will strengthen my career development and training to
achieve my goal of becoming a leader in investigating neuro-immune interactions."

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are revolutionizing scientific discovery and clinical application by helping
biomedical researchers interpret complex, black-box machine learning (ML) models. Given input features (e.g.,
dermatological image pixels) and an ML model-generated prediction (e.g., a diagnosis), the most widely used
form of XAI computes feature attributions, which represent the importance of each feature to the prediction, that
drive predictions even in complex models, such as deep neural networks. Biomedical research has successfully
applied deep learning using medical images (e.g., chest X-ray images) as input features; feature attributions
identify parts of the images that are important for the model, such as the existence of genuine pathologies (e.g.,
clear lung fields) or artifacts (e.g., medical devices and laterality marks).
 However, key limitations of current XAI techniques, which provide only attributions for pre-specified input
features (here, individual pixels), preclude a clear understanding of the reasoning process of ML models and
limit actionable responses by medical providers. First, even the most interpretable model types, such as linear
models, can defy understanding if they use uninterpretable features. Second, computing theoretically principled
feature attributions involves exponential computational complexity; this challenge is exacerbated when using
modern deep models, such as transformers. Finally, the adoption of XAI techniques by multiple stakeholders,
such as regulators, developers, scientists, and physicians, requires real-world demonstration of their utility.
 In this proposal, we introduce the following techniques and principles to fundamentally advance XAI.
Aim 1. Generate medically informed explanations. To bridge the gap between pixel-level features and medically
meaningful concepts, we propose a self-supervised approach to retrieve semantically meaningful concepts from
medical images and edit the images to systematically edit concepts of interest in images and examine the model
output changes. We will also develop a new attribution method to make self-supervised learning interpretable.
Aim 2. Develop XAI principles and techniques to compute and evaluate feature attributions. We propose
theoretically grounded techniques to: rigorously compute SHAP values for transformers; handle multimodality and
feature correlations; and evaluate feature attribution methods to help investigators discern the most effective
techniques for their applications.
Aim 3. Enable real-world application of XAI techniques to benefit multiple stakeholders. Using the improved
model explanations, we will develop an actionable XAI framework to audit third party AI devices, improve
clinical AI devices, and derive scientific insights.
Successful completion of this project will yield new theoretically grounded and principled XAI techniques to provide
medically informed explanations, compute accurate feature attributions, and detect and resolve model pitfalls."

Since its inception in 1999, the primary objective of the T32 Urologic Oncology Research Training
Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has been to train select urologists for
productive careers in translational research in urologic oncology. Dedicated research training in urologic
oncology is essential to the mission of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to reduce morbidity and
mortality from genitourinary cancers, which cause about 10% of all cancer-related deaths in the United
States and which are expected to rise steadily in incidence as the population ages. For the proposed
funding period, we seek to continue our interactive, multidisciplinary research training strategy that
integrates the following: (1) a multidisciplinary faculty of basic, clinical, and translational researchers
spanning the disciplines of surgery, medicine, cancer biology and therapeutics, molecular pathology and
genetics, immunotherapy, molecular radiology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and laboratory medicine,
(2) an intensive mentored research practicum tailored to the T32 trainee’s research interests and goals,
(3) a core curriculum of required didactic and discussion-based courses to enhance the quality of the
hands-on research training, (4) structured career development workshops in grant writing and career
development awards, and (5) elective activities that will allow T32 trainees to further immerse themselves
in the world of cancer research and to network with peers and established leaders. Each year, 2 highly
committed postdoctoral trainees from the Urologic Oncology Fellowship Program at MSK are selected for
the T32 Urologic Oncology Research Training Program. They must have an MD, must have completed
residency training in urology, and must be board-eligible urologists. These 2 trainees are supported by
this T32 training grant during 2 years dedicated to urologic oncology research training, with appointment
to the 2nd year contingent on suitable progress. At the completion of their training, graduates of theT32
Urologic Oncology Research Training Program are expected to be attractive candidates for junior faculty
appointments at research-focused academic organizations. In the past 10 years, 90% of T32 trainee
graduates have matriculated to faculty positions at academic institutions and are engaged in laboratory
and/or clinical research aimed at understanding and overcoming genitourinary cancers."

 The mechanism by which cells recognize and complete replicated regions at their precise
doubling point must be remarkably efficient, occurring thousands of times per cell division along
the chromosomes of humans, and is a fundamental step required for genomic stability in all cells.
Yet until recently, the question of how this process occurs had not been characterized, in any cell
type. We recently demonstrated that the completion of DNA replication in E. coli involves an
enzymatic system that effectively limits cellular replication when it reaches its `doubling point'
by allowing converging replication forks to transiently pass each other before the excess, over-
replicated regions are incised, resected, and joined. The completion reaction requires RecBCD
and involves several proteins associated with repairing double-strand breaks including, SbcC-
SbcD-ExoI. However, unlike double-strand break repair, completion occurs independently of
homologous recombination and RecA.
 Many of bacterial proteins required to complete DNA replication have clear homologs in
eukaryotes. Bacterial SbcC-SbcD and ExoI are highly conserved with Mre11-Rad50 and CtIP, a
poorly characterized nuclease complex essential for genome stability, normal development, and
viability in mammals. Here, we propose to extend these important findings to eukaryotic cells,
and to determine the enzymatic pathway that catalyzes the completion of replication in the model
eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We employ a novel approach that enables us to identify,
map, and characterize sites where replication completes directly on eukaryotic chromosomes.
We will use this approach to establish the essential role of Mre11-Rad50-CtIP during cellular
replication, determine the enzymes required for the eukaryotic completion reaction, and identify
synthetic lethal genes in completion mutants, that can be targeted for potential therapeutics. The
results of these studies will identify a fundamental, yet heretofore unstudied, aspect of cellular
replication that is central to genome stability."

This proposal describes a training plan to develop my academic and scientific career focusing on the experi-
mental evolution of pancreatic cancer. The award's purpose is to advance my scientific independence with a
research program seeking to quantify multiple facets of pancreatic cancer evolution. During the K99 award pe-
riod, my mentor will be Dr. Iacobuzio-Donahue, a world-expert in pancreatic cancer genetics, evolution and
pathology. Dr. Iacobuzio-Donahue has a well-established interest in cancer genetics and experimental strate-
gies to define evolutionary patterns. My co-mentors will be Drs. Sohrab Shah and Dana Pe'er. Each has a long
track record of mentorship – many of the scientists and clinicians they have mentored have advanced to fruitful
academic careers. In addition, Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) will provide support and resources for conduct-
ing the research outlined in this proposal, including my training plan and successful transition to academic in-
dependence.
The research strategy of this proposal seeks to 1) enhance my scientific knowledge and technical skills related
to tumor evolution, and 2) develop a novel approach to isolate and quantify multiple facets of pancreatic can-
cer. This work will also extend my scientific background from the phylogenetics of human tumors to experi-
mental strategies and novel evolutionary patterns of cancer evolution. Specific Aim 1 seeks to quantify tem-
poral dynamics of nutrient deprived pancreatic metastatic cells with real-time sampling and single cell sequenc-
ing, and Specific Aim 2 will define spatial diversity and migration of pancreatic cancer subclones using autopsy
tissues, patient derived xenografts, single cell sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. During the two-year K99
period of this award experiments and sample collection for Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be completed. In the 3-
year R00 award period, validation experiments and sequencing analysis will be subsequently completed to de-
termine the evolutionary dynamics of pancreatic cancer cells.
The long-term objective of this proposed research is to better define various influences of pancreatic cancer
evolution. The proposed experimental strategy has the potential to 1) quantify tumor evolution one aspect at a
time and 2) replay evolutionary events to delineate reproducibility. Given the aggressiveness of pancreatic
cancer, new strategies like the proposed approach are urgently needed to quantify and thwart the evolutionary
influences driving this disease, ultimately to improve patient treatment and outcomes."
10906846,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Plasticity occurs in the primary visual cortex (V1) in response to visual associative learning, where one
stimulus is paired with reward (CS+) and another is not (CS-). However, learning is not a unitary process, and
distinct stages of learning might drive contrasting plastic changes in V1. Indeed, previous work has found
dynamic changes in V1 pyramidal neuron activity and inputs at different times throughout learning. Experiments
separating distinct learning phases behaviorally are lacking, making it difficult to fully dissect V1 plasticity
changes throughout learning. To address this, we have designed a 3-phase associative learning task that
separates early, stimulus non-specific learning from late, stimulus-specific learning and reversal learning. We
will also manipulate stimulus value in two ways: devaluation and spout removal. Using this behavioral paradigm
along with 1- and 2-photon calcium imaging of the mouse dorsal cortex, we will test the following hypotheses: 1)
that visual associative learning differentially recruits V1 activity during distinct learning stages, 2) activity in V1 is
rapidly plastic in response to changes in stimulus value, 3) individual V1 neurons exhibit bidirectional plasticity
across learning, 4) visual associative learning changes cortico-cortical functional connectivity, and 5) V1 activity
is required to maintain these cortico-cortical functional connectivity changes. Our results will provide an
unprecedented level of insight into V1 plasticity throughout learning and stimulus value manipulation. We will,
for the first time, address how plasticity in V1 is mirrored across the dorsal cortex, or required for cortico-cortical
plasticity."

Substance use disorder (SUD) affects over 20 million Americans, causing personal strife and cost. A major
SUD risk factor is hazardous use (HU) of substances during high school (HUSH), when the brain continues to
develop, rendering it especially sensitive to environmental factors. Identifying the effects of and risk for HUSH
generally focuses on selected interactions between fixed (i.e., trauma, demographics) and modifiable (i.e.,
mental health, emotion, environment, behavior, sleep) factors, and occasionally brain development features
differentiating substance using and non-using cohorts. Results have yielded limited improvements to risk
assessment. Thus, we propose a paradigm shift in the study of HUSH, replacing measurement selection and
population splitting with mapping individuals to comprehensive multi-dimensional measures. The objective of
our novel data-driven process is to identify constellations of fixed and modifiable factors forecasting HUSH in
individuals. As our analysis is based on public data sets that include brain imaging, we will document
interactions of those constellations with neural circuits to determine neuromechanistic underpinnings of HUSH.
Myriad factors influence hazardous substance use, such as the fixed contributors of sex and family history of
SUD; the modifiable factors of unhealthy sleep habits, peer pressure, and risk-taking propensity; and brain
development characterized by an atypical imbalance between emotion and control network. We will model
this heterogeneity via machine (deep) learning technology identifying constellations of measurements in line
with our hypotheses regarding prevention, i.e., modifiable behaviors interacting with anomalies in
neuroadaptation forecasting HUSH initiation. Aim 1 will forecast initiation of HUSH in the last years of high
school based on the closest visit before turning age 16 years for no/low substance users in National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA, N =350) and confirm findings on
the larger Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmental cohort (ABCD, N>11K). HUSH will be defined by
substance use criteria recorded through annual self-reports and refined by weekly surveys administered via
cell phones. Aim 2 will create a self-supervised learning model explicitly tracking over time interactions across
modifiable behaviors, fixed factors, and brain circuits important for hypothesis testing. We will cross-validate
the model by identifying HUSH for each high school year and forecast based on data collected prior to high
school. We will explore dynamically updating the model as data are acquired to predict resilience, i.e., youth
who abstain from hazardous substance use during high school, despite having risk factors such as traumatic
and untoward COVID pandemic experiences. Each aim is linked to hypothesis testing concerning factors that
can be altered to mitigate the risk of HUSH.
This project will be the first to provide patterns accurately forecasting the risk of HUSH on an individual level.
Accurately computing this risk would be foundational for enhancing prevention efforts."

Our R13 application aims to obtain partial funding for the “B-vitamins and One-Carbon Metabolism in Health and
Disease” conference set to convene August 11-16, 2024, in Niagara Falls, NY. The meeting is part of the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Science Research Conference (SRC) series
and convened every 2 years since its inception in 1986, celebrating its 40-th anniversary/20th meeting in 2024.
The idea under it is to assemble basic scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health experts to present
and discuss the latest research in B-vitamins and one-carbon metabolism (OCM). It brings together the most
prominent experts in the field from all-over the world and the promising young scientists, both students and
postdocs. Specific Aims of the conference are: 1) Assemble the world experts and trainees working in areas of
B-vitamins and OCM, to present, analyze and discuss the most recent, cutting-edge research, with special focus
on unpublished studies; 2) Provide opportunities for students, trainees and investigators that are new to this
meeting to present and discuss their work, interact and receive feedback from experts, establish collaborations
and professional connections; 3) Promote participation in the conference by providing travel awards to students
and trainees for outstanding oral and poster presentations and travel funding assistance for invited speakers.
Scientific objectives of the 2024 meeting include: 1) Update the epidemiological landscape of the Vitamins B
deficiencies and their links to malabsorption, infectious and chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. 2)
Evaluate evidence of the transgenerational impact of maternal/paternal OCM and B-vitamins status in peri- and
post-natal health: obesity, diabetes, neurological/psychiatric/developmental disorders. 3) Revise the science and
clinical practice in inherited metabolic disorders of B-vitamins and OCM for diagnosis, pathophysiology, and
treatment aspects. 4) Evaluate experimental- and population-based evidence of the crosstalk between Vitamins
B/OCM status and genomics/epigenomics in health and disease. 5) Discuss/compare utility of cell and animal
models in experimental studies of OCM/B-vitamins in health and diseases. 6) Update our knowledge on the B-
vitamins and OCM in cancer prevention, pathophysiology, and treatment. 7) Analyze the experimental- and
population-based evidence on the “two sides of the coin” issue with B-vitamins supplementation/fortification.
The above aims will be accomplished over 10 sessions including the invited speakers’ presentations and short
talks from select abstracts submitted by young scientists, two poster sessions (2 hours each), “meet the experts”
metabolomics workshop for trainees/young investigators, and a career-oriented workshop with young scientists
discussing research and professional development with session chairs in small groups. Opportunities for informal
interactions among attendees are frequent during the meals, breaks, poster sessions and outdoor recreational
activities. These direct personal interactions ensue new ideas, research directions/collaborations, promote
professional development of young investigators, and energize the future of the field."
10905938,"This proposal is for R13 support for the Biomedical Training Program Directors’ Conference. This biennial Program Directors’ meeting would provide ~500 program directors, administrators, and NIGMS program staff with 2.5 days of formal and informal sessions designed to promote and advance best practice in developing a diverse biomedical workforce and to catalyze research training interchange. The overarching goal is to build upon and extend the past success of the former conference for NIGMS TWD-funded institutional training program directors and administrators. That conference was last organized by FASEB and NIGMS staff in 2019, and there is popular demand from the TWD Program Directors Organization (PDO) to revive this opportunity to gather in person. The proposed meeting is primarily intended for program directors and associate deans (or the equivalent) at institutions with NIGMS TWD institutional training programs including: Bridges to the Baccalaureate, Bridges to the Doctorate, G-RISE, IMSD, IRACDA, MARC, MSTP, PREP, U-RISE, and T32 preand postdoctoral programs. High-quality interactive presentations of evidence-based research training practices and interventions would be combined with informal activities to encourage networking and exchange of ideas. The conference would provide interactive opportunities for in-depth discussions and training, with a minimum of platform lectures. The 4 major themes of the conference are interconnected, and designed to drive institutional change to improve training of the biomedical and biobehavioral workforce. The themes are: 1) trainee and faculty wellness; 2) advancing research mentoring; 3) inclusive excellence including recruiting and admissions; and 4) promoting positive research laboratory culture. Representation of newer investigators, women, individuals from underrepresented groups, and aspiring program directors are key factors for conference admission. The meeting would be organized by the TWD PDO Steering Committee with the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). The proposed MPI plan provides continuity for future conferences, and allows for distribution of efforts; one MPI would be responsible for the programming for each of the 4 major themes. NIGMS leaders would be invited to address the conferees, to participate in all sessions, and to meet program directors one-on-one. There would also be breakout sessions for program directors from each of the various
TWD training programs to meet and exchange best practices with each other. Poster sessions would provide opportunities for informal discussions, networking and exchange of information pertaining to the major themes. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop a meeting program that informs and engages the thought leaders in the NIGMS TWD biomedical research training and workforce development community; 2) Promote collegial interactions, increase collaborations and networking among diverse groups of program directors and administrators; 3) Provide opportunities for exchange between attendees and NIGMS TWD program staff."
10907544,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Excessive alcohol use is the 5th-leading risk factor for premature death and disability. The health and
economic burden associated with alcohol use is concentrated in ~14 million adults with alcohol use disorder.
Pharmacological and behavioral interventions, especially when combined, reduce alcohol use and related
harms and assist long-term recovery. However, only ~5% adults with alcohol use disorder receive formal
treatment in health care settings. Recent societal phenomena, namely the rapid rise of high-deductible health
plans and the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), might contribute to delayed alcohol use disorder
diagnosis and treatment. Deferred care might especially affect disadvantaged populations such as low-income
and rural residents. In the last decade, high-deductible plans requiring potentially prohibitive out-of-pocket
payments for alcohol use disorder services have expanded rapidly, now covering 57% of workers. The COVID-
19 pandemic led to stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses, dramatically reducing
healthcare use.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine major societal factors affecting alcohol use disorder
treatment access and disparities, including modifiable high-deductible health plans and the COVID-19
pandemic. The study will assess alcohol use disorder-related measures before and after 2 key change dates of
interest: the date that employers mandate a switch to high-deductible health plans (using a rolling cohort
accrual period), and March 2020 when COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions began. More specifically, the
project seeks to: (1) determine the effect of high-deductible health plans on alcohol use disorder diagnosis,
treatment, and adverse outcomes; (2) assess whether high-deductible health plans increase disparities in
alcohol use disorder diagnosis, treatment, and adverse outcomes; and (3) examine the 4-year impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on disparities in alcohol use disorder diagnosis, treatment, and adverse outcomes
 The study will draw from an 18-year rolling sample (2007-2024) of ~50 million members aged 18-64
enrolled through a national health insurer. The study will apply rigorous, quasi-experimental interrupted time
series designs with segmented regression and segmented survival analyses. We expect that findings will
demonstrate the health insurance benefit designs that optimize access to AUD treatment, informing potential
modifications to Internal Revenue Service regulations that exempt certain services from high out-of-pocket
costs under high-deductible plans. Findings could also help inform post-pandemic policymaking by identifying
subgroups at risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment."
10907546,"With ageing populations world-wide, neurodegenerative diseases are placing an ever increasing 
burden on long- term well-being, healthcare costs and family life. Despite decades of research and 
enormous investment, no disease-modifying treatment is available for the most common of these 
diseases: Alzheimer’s (AD). The majority of these, to-date unsuccessful, efforts have focused 
 on one potential cause of AD: amyloid-β aggregation. Combining population-scale data 
collection, human genetics and machine learning provides a way forward to uncover and characterize 
new causal cellular processes involved in AD. This would provide an array of potential therapeutic 
targets, increasing the chance that one will be more easily modulated than the amyloid-β pathway. 
AD-specific genomic datasets of unprecedented scale are being actively collected: whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) from ~20k individuals, gene expression (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-seq, 
histone ChIP-seq) from
>1000 post-mortem AD brains, single-cell transcriptomes and similar modalities in peripheral and 
brain-resident innate immune cells (which we and others have shown to be AD-relevant). Effectively 
integrating these diverse data to better understand AD represents a substantial computational 
challenge, both in terms of data scale and analysis complexity. This proposal leverages 
state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), combined with human genetic 
analyses, to address this challenge. We will train DL models to predict epigenomic signals and 
RNA splicing from genomic sequence, enabling in silico mutagenesis to estimate the 
functional impact (a “delta score”) of any genetic variant. The delta scores will be used in 
genetic analyses that distinguish causal associations: cellular changes that drive AD 
pathogenesis rather than downstream/side effects of disease. Delta scores will aid in 
associating both rare and common variants to AD. To achieve sufficient power, rare variants must be 
aggregated (e.g. for a gene): delta scores will allow filtering out many likely non-functional 
(particularly non-coding) variants. Most common variants from AD Genome Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS) are simply correlated with the causal variant due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Delta 
scores, combined with trans-ethnic GWAS, will enable estimation of the likely causal variant(s). 
These analyses will highlight variants and genes involved in AD. However, genes do not operate in a 
vacuum so robust probabilistic ML will be used to learn cell-type and disease-specific gene 
regulatory networks from sorted bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. The detected networks will be 
integrated with our genetic findings to discover network neighborhoods/pathways especially 
enriched in AD variants. Such pathways will be prime candidates for future functional and 
therapeutic studies of AD."
10907687,"Recent reports suggest that falls increase by 25%-50% in cancer patients and are linked to treatment-related
side effects, such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), that alter mobility (gait and balance).
Falls and functional impairments in cancer patients remain largely unrecognized and under-treated, in part
because it is not yet known what level of symptoms impact mobility, the specific mobility deficits that increase
fall and disability risk, or which patients are most at risk. Our long-term objective is to prevent falls and disability
associated with cancer treatment by informing clinicians about which and when patients show increased risk for
falls and functional decline and informing rehabilitation providers about which mobility deficits to target. A critical
first step toward this objective is to characterize the natural trajectories of symptoms, functioning, and falls across
the in-treatment and recovery phases of cancer care. To achieve this goal, we will use detailed symptom tracking,
simple clinical tests, passive continuous monitoring of daily mobility and physical activity, and self-report falls
and disability collected before, during, and one year after treatment in 200 patients prescribed neurotoxic
chemotherapy for cancer. The Specific Aims of this study are: 1) to characterize trajectories of neuropathy
symptoms and functioning (objective mobility, physical activity, self-report functioning and disability) across
treatment and one year of recovery among persons receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy for cancer and 2)
Determine the simplest predictors of symptom and functioning trajectories to identify patients in whom different
treatment options should be considered and/or who would benefit from early and targeted rehabilitation
interventions. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to 1) reveal how cancer treatment could
lead to increased risk of falls and disability in survivorship, 2) measure changes in symptoms, mobility and falls
across a course of chemotherapy and into recovery, 3) employ continuous passive monitoring technologies as
sensitive and specific measures of mobility and activity changes during daily life; and, 4) apply a novel analytic
approach - growth mixture modeling (GMM) - to identify the distinct trajectories of changes in symptoms,
functioning and falls associated with neurotoxic chemotherapy. Collectively the knowledge gained from this study
can be used to identify which patients might benefit from early intervention via alterations in treatment plans
and/or referral to rehabilitation. Findings from this study could provide new information for oncology teams to
improve patient safety and enhance survivorship care plans for those receiving neurotoxic chemotherapies.
Currently, clinical practice guidelines focus on pharmacologic management of pain associated with CIPN, which
remains suboptimal, with little attention to prevention of falls and functional decline. This study could have a
significant impact by defining the natural trajectories of functional declines related to CIPN so that early detection
efforts can be integrated into the clinical pathway of patients receiving neurotoxic treatment and targeted care
provided for at-risk patients."
10905412,"Inflammatory diseases limit healthspan, defined as the length of one’s life spent in good health. We propose an
ancillary study to an NIA-funded trial U01AG076941 (EVERLAST) that we call Impacting inflammation through
mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (imTOR). The EVERLAST parent trial will test the ability of low/intermittent
doses of the rapamycin analogue everolimus to selectively inhibit mTORC1 but not mTORC2, and thus
improve multiple indicators of healthspan, while avoiding the undesirable side-effects of rapamycin. Analysis of
immune cells as major sources of mTOR-regulated inflammation, coupled with analysis in the context of parent
trial outcomes, would significantly enhance the value of EVERLAST without changing subject burden. imTOR
thus responds to NOT-AG-23-020 “Maximizing the Scientific Value of Secondary Analysis of Existing Cohorts
and Datasets in Order to Address Research Gaps and Foster Additional Opportunities in Aging Research”.
EVERLAST is enrolling middle-aged to older adults who are generally healthy but are overweight/obese and
insulin resistant to take placebo or everolimus daily (0.5mg), or everolimus once weekly (5mg) for 24 wks.
EVERLAST will determine the impact of this intervention on fundamental hallmarks of aging including changes
in metabolism, muscle function, brain health, senescence, and frailty. imTOR will expand the scope of
EVERLAST beyond flu vaccine-generated immune responses by quantitating the impact of everolimus on
chronic inflammation, a key cause of age-related health declines generated mainly by immune cells. imTOR
will focus mainly on CD4+ T cells based on our data showing these cells are dominant sources of inflammation
in healthy and obesity-associated aging. imTOR is designed to test the overall hypothesis that everolimus
lowers the risk of age-related health problems by reducing chronic inflammation through mechanisms that
include improved bioenergetics and redox balance in immune cells. We will complement primary focus on T
cells with analyses of myeloid cells, the latter a secondary source of systemic inflammation. Mechanistic
insights into everolimus action on immune cells will be analyzed relative to changes in hallmarks of aging
collected for EVERLAST. We will compare mitochondrial outcomes between immune cells and skeletal muscle
to challenge the assumption of similar everolimus impacts on distinct tissue types. Parallel ex vivo
manipulations will establish cause/effect relationships amongst everolimus, mTORC1/2 function, cell
physiology, cytokine profiles, and the frequency of polyfunctional T cells, a newly appreciated modulator of
inflammatory disease. Success with the proposed project coupled with EVERLAST outcomes will determine
safety and efficacy of everolimus for promoting healthspan in our ever-aging population."
10905535,"Abstract
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia especially in the aging population. It is associated with
increased risk of mortality and morbidity. At the present time, management of AF has focused on risk factor
modification, rate or rhythm control and anticoagulation. Evolution of clinical trials in the management of AF have
revealed that ablation seems superior in reducing the burden of AF and controlling the symptoms compared to
pharmaceutical agents. However, the benefit of ablation decreases over time and patients frequently require
more than one ablation. Earlier ablation in the course of the disease is more beneficial as failure of therapy is
related to duration of AF and size of left atrium. After two decades of investigations with varying methods of
ablation, we have only marginally improved the clinical outcome. The ablation procedure is time consuming and
only a fraction of patients are undergoing this procedure. A robust criterion of prediction of successful ablation
will be beneficial for patient selection and maximize the utilization of invasive therapies.
With this highly collaborative and multiscale study, our long-term goal is to develop effective models and discover
factors that indicate severity of AF that can be helpful as therapeutic targets and to predict prognosis. Our
objective is to identify patients who have increased risk of recurrence after ablation for AF by taking advantage
of the intracardiac electrograms from left atrial map and inflammatory biomarkers from blood samples obtained
pre-procedure. The central hypothesis is that domain-specific machine learning/ artificial intelligence algorithms
derived from multimodal data can predict the type of AF, severity of AF as indicated by abnormal areas in the
left atrium and clinical outcomes of AF ablation. To directly test the hypothesis, we will enroll prospective
consecutive consenting patients who present for AF ablation therapy. Pre-and post-ablation left atrial map and
blood samples drawn for biomarker analyses will be used for study purposes."
10909229,"Roadmap for America’s Cancer Explorers for the 21st Century (RACE21) is an interdisciplinary
program to develop a pipeline to a diverse 21st century cancer research workforce. Cancer is a
primary cause of adult mortalities in the US, despite excellent advances in understanding cancer
biology and innovative treatments. In Alabama, cancer is the 2nd highest cause of mortality, and
cancer death rates are almost double in Alabama’s African-American (compared to White) males.
One of the underlying causes of this anomaly is the lack of communication about cancer among
Africa-Americans, especially within families. Also, relatively few African-American youth are
seeking careers in cancer research, largely due to very little exposure to cancer biology in most
of their secondary schools and their teachers’ lack of cancer biology training. Further, few informal
programs excite students about careers in cancer biology. RACE21 will build an innovative and
effective pipeline to cancer research careers, especially for students underrepresented in cancer
research (URM) by building on 5-basic foundations: 1) The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s
(UAB) outstanding O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, 2) Over 200 cancer researchers,
eager to mentor high school and college students to become the next generation of cancer
researchers, 3) development of an innovative Undergraduate Cancer Biology Major, 4) the Center
for Community OutReach Development (CORD), which will train high school biology teachers in
cancer research and introduce advanced high school students to cancer research in both formal
and informal settings and 5) training in communication about cancer. RACE21 employs successful
methods developed at UAB, and uses them to advance cancer biology education. The pipeline
starts with high school students being introduced to cancer biology through state-of-the-art

10909232,"This A1 resubmission is for continuation of a multi-disciplinary postdoctoral research training program in
cardiovascular sciences that annually supports six (MD, DDS, DVM, PhD) research fellows. The program has a
rich and sustained record of success training young scientists and future leaders over the past 40 years. Of
trainees in the past ten years, 95% (37/39) are currently in science/medicine; 38% are from an underrepresented
population in science, 64% are women, 8% are physician scientists, 45% received independent funding while
supported by the program, 55% assumed faculty postions upon graduation, and trainees average two peer-
reviewed publications per year while in the program. Here we provide plans to sustain and enrich this robust
cardiovascular research training program with postdoctoral training in the well-funded, interactive laboratories of
41 internationally recognized leaders and cardiovascular scientists from the Departments of Biochemistry &
Structural Biology, Cell Systems & Anatomy, Endodontics, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, Neurology,
Neurosurgery, Pathology, Pharmacology, Physiology, Population Health Sciences, and Surgery at the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. In brief, principal components of the training program include:
(1) active participation with graded responsibility in the research laboratory of experienced investigators; (2) a
commitment to collaboration and the use of multidisciplinary research approaches; (3) continuing research-in-
progress seminars, and dissemination of findings at national/international meetings and in print; (4) integrated
journal club series on topics in cardiovascular science; (5) didactic courses and seminars in the responsible
conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility, scientific communication, and grantsmanship/peer
review; (6) a group mentoring environment with rigorous mentorship plans; (7) preparation of an individual
development plan (IDP) and the comprehensive, routine evaluation of trainee progress; (8) submission of an
independent grant; (9) development of scientific networks and continuing training in career stewardship; (10) the
continued evaluation and teaching of mentoring skills to faculty preceptors and trainees; and (11) the active
recruitment of meritorious trainees and faculty that well reflect workforce diversity. Program research and training
focus on eight overlapping investigative themes: (1) Cardiac Arrhythmias, Fibrosis and Failure; (2) Coronary
Artery Disease and Atherosclerosis; (3) Cerebrovascular Disease and Stroke; (4) Diabetes, Metabolism and
Obesity; (5) Renovascular and Neurogenic Hypertension; (6) Neural Cardiovascular Reflexes; (7) Cardiorenal
Dysregulation; and (8) Bacterial and Viral Heart Disease. Integration of these themes is essential to
understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. Given the complexities, and mortality associated with
cardiovascular disease, the goal of this training program is to continue to provide scientists with the necessary
competencies and breadth of expertise required for future biomedical research."
10909233,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is recognized
as the prodromal stage of DLB (MCI-LB). Patients with MCI-LB frequently progress to DLB, but a subset may
have a range of additional AD pathology. Rapid advances in the development of protein-specific disease-
modifying therapies highlight a critical need for biomarkers in MCI-LB, because clinical trials will need to be
sufficiently powered to detect changes in disease progression during the prodromal phase, when the disease-
modifying therapies would be most effective. During the initial cycle of this project, we determined the cross-
sectional and longitudinal imaging biomarkers of DLB with pathologic confirmation. The current cycle of the
U01 project is designed to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-modal biomarkers of prodromal DLB in
MCI-LB, and prepare for protein-specific disease-modifying clinical trials that will need these biomarkers for
selection of participants and to track outcomes in MCI-LB. The rationale for a multi-modal biomarker approach
stems from the multi-factorial and co-existing LBD and AD pathology in DLB and similarly in MCI-LB. We will
determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal PET, SPECT, MRI, and polysomnogram (PSG) biomarkers of
MCI-LB compared to cognitively unimpaired controls. We will also determine whether age, sex as a biological
variable, APOE ε4 status, and cerebrovascular disease lesions on MRI modulate these differences. In a pilot
analysis, we will compare protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and real-time quaking-induced
conversion (RT-QuIC) assays for α-synuclein in CSF for differentiating MCI-LB from controls. Finally, we will
correlate our findings with pathologic outcomes. Inclusion of MCI-LB patients in the current cycle will be based
on the presence of one or more core clinical features of DLB and not on biomarker findings. This will provide
the opportunity to validate the use of proposed and novel biomarkers in the diagnosis of MCI-LB and to
determine which biomarkers predict progression from MCI-LB to DLB. All samples, clinical, imaging, and
autopsy data from MCI-LB cases and controls will be collected and shared according to the Parkinson's
Disease Biomarkers Program guidelines."

The 2024 Gordon research Conference (GRC) on the Biology of Host-Parasite Interactions will focus on the
most recent molecular and translational advances in parasitic disease research. A wide range of human and
veterinary pathogens that cause disease will be emphasized, with the aim of bringing together scientists from all
over the globe to share and synthesize knowledge. The ultimate goal will be to improve the fundamental
understanding of these parasites and contribute to the design of future control and elimination efforts. A wide
range of topics will be covered at the conference, including: parasite metabolism and drug targets; immune
response to infection and parasite countermeasures; parasite genomics and epigenetics; differentiation and
developmental biology; biophysical/mechanical aspects of host-parasite interaction; and parasite manipulation
of host behavior. The breadth of this biennial meeting is unique in the field, and it is the only recurring meeting
that provides an opportunity for investigators working on a variety of protozoan and worm pathogens to interact
with immunologists and medicinal chemists. The meeting also provides academic scientists the opportunity to
compare approaches with investigators working within the pharmaceutical industry. The program has been
designed to cover this broad range of topics and we have commitments from top scientists in the field to attend
and speak. In addition, we will select short talks from the submitted abstracts, which will broaden diversity. There
will also be preceding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which offers a unique opportunity for postdocs and
graduate students to organize their own conference, to present their work through talks and posters, and to
exchange ideas at the forefront of research in a serene but stimulating atmosphere at the Salve Regina University
Campus, Newport RI. Speakers for the GRS will be selected from submitted abstracts reporting latest ground-
breaking findings. Students, post-docs and early career scientists are strongly encouraged to apply to both the
GRC and GRS. Special efforts are also being made to raise funds to provide support to individuals from endemic
countries."

The global burden of sepsis is overwhelmingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where nearly 40% of
all sepsis cases occur and up to 65% of all deaths are sepsis-related. While sepsis outcomes have improved
over time in high-income countries (HICs), outcomes remain poor in SSA, with short-term mortality between 20-
50%. Further, sepsis treatment protocols developed in HICs have repeatedly shown harm when implemented in
SSA. We argue that an imprecise understanding of sepsis pathobiology in SSA is a fundamental barrier to the
development of effective treatment strategies. In contrast with HICs, sepsis in SSA occurs primarily in younger
adults, inciting pathogens are diverse, and HIV/AIDS is a major driver of poor outcomes. Despite this distinctive
landscape, locally relevant models of sepsis pathobiology are scarce. Our overarching hypothesis is that unique
demographic and pathogen profiles inherent to sepsis in SSA, including a high burden of comorbidities such as
HIV/AIDS, underlies heterogenous sepsis pathobiology and treatment responses. In this project, we will apply
and improve upon precision medicine strategies used in HICs to establish pathobiologically-driven and
therapeutically relevant sepsis subtypes (“endotypes”) in SSA. Using RNAseq and machine learning in a pilot
cohort, our Uganda-based team has demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of two sepsis endotypes in
SSA that are reflective of host-pathogen features unique to the region and differentiated by targetable
pathobiological mechanisms and risks of multiorgan dysfunction and death. In a multicenter prospective cohort
study in Uganda, we will validate these findings and infer relevant biological pathways to pinpoint mechanisms
driving sepsis outcomes in Aim 1. Leveraging this cohort in Aim 2, we will apply high-dimensional proteomics to
define longitudinal immune response trajectories underlying sepsis outcomes beyond hospital mortality,
including functional disability in sepsis survivors. Our preliminary data from Uganda also suggests there are
unique aspects of sepsis pathobiology in persons living with HIV (PLWH), including exaggerated production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins, expansion of T-reg and aberrant NK cells, and upregulation of immune
checkpoint T-cell exhaustion pathways. In Aim 3, we will perform in-depth immunophenotyping to develop a
working mechanistic understanding of sepsis in PLWH. In all three Aims, we will leverage established sepsis
research infrastructure in Uganda and multidisciplinary collaborations between critical care and infectious
disease physician-scientists, immunologists, and bioinformaticians/biostatisticians at Columbia University and
Uganda Virus Research Institute. Results from this project will (i) illuminate crucial domains of sepsis
pathobiology in the global hotspot of SSA and (ii) translate these insights to classify individual sepsis patients
into pathobiologically-driven and therapeutically relevant subgroups. Ultimately, our data will inform design of
the first clinical trial of precision, host-directed treatment for sepsis in SSA, results of which will enhance delivery
of effective sepsis therapeutics worldwide."

The health care delivery system is undergoing tremendous changes, with increasing consolidation from
mergers and acquisitions, as well as openings and closings of hundreds of emergency departments and
hospitals. These changes are typically driven more by the market and financial motivations rather than by
identification of need or gaps in access to care. The impact of these changes on access and receipt of high-
quality care are largely unknown.
These changes may be particularly impactful for acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular (CV) care. Acute CV
events are leading causes of death and disability and patients with acute CV events require timely access to
reperfusion interventions for improved outcomes. The geographic distribution of hospitals, and interactions
between them through patient transfers, are key to ensuring patients’ receipt of high-quality acute CV care.
Mergers and acquisitions of hospitals have potential to improve CV care if they lead to increased investment
and improved specialty care at acquired hospitals or to enhanced transfer protocols with improved access to
tertiary care. Alternatively, they may lead to harm if they result in reduced access to necessary technology in
some communities or inappropriate transfers. The degree of investment versus divestment may vary
depending on the characteristics of the acquired hospital and the community it serves.
Hospital and emergency department openings and closures may also improve or harm CV care. Closures may
reduce access to CV care near where patients live and lead to fatal or disabling delays. Alternatively, closure of
lower quality sites may improve outcomes if patients increasingly receive care at higher volume, higher-quality
tertiary sites without substantially increasing time to treatment. Openings of new sites may also mitigate the
impact of closures if they occur in the same market. However, if openings occur in already well-resourced
markets they may widen existing disparities.
We aim is to quantify the effects of these market changes on CV patient outcomes, understand the underlying
mechanisms, and determine whether they have disproportionate impact on particular patient groups or
communities. In Aim 1, we will focus on mergers and acquisitions, and use a quasi-experimental design in
national Medicare and Medicaid data to examine their impact on receipt of advanced acute care and outcomes
among CV patients, to investigate the mechanisms through which changes occur, and to assess whether there is
differential effect by characteristics of the patient or the acquiring site’s parent organizations. In Aim 2, we will
use similar methods to examine the impact of openings and closings. Understanding the impact of these two
shifts in the health care market on acute CV care and the pathways by which they occur will be key to
identifying interventions and strategies to reduce disparities in CV access and outcomes and to inform policy
related to regulation of health system changes."

Background: Gap closure is a critical step in wound healing and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis during
embryogenesis. Current studies of gap closure focus on epithelial cells with strong adhesion strength and
junctional actin cytoskeletons and have identified lamellipodia-mediated cell crawling and “purse-string”-like
contractile actin rings as two major mechanisms for gap closure. At the molecular level, ERK and p53 activations
are known to regulate the migration and proliferation of tissues. Recent new findings, including our own data,
suggest that tissue fluidity, the tissue mechanical property that reflects the frequency of cell intercalations, plays
a major role in gap closure. It is still unclear how tissue fluidity is patterned spatiotemporally during gap closure,
how it is regulated within the cells and by the microenvironment, and what are its molecular regulators. We have
discovered that by introducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to epithelial cells and generating a meso-
scale gap in the order of magnitude of millimeter, tissues with partial EMT status demonstrate a coordinated
collective migration pattern that is distinct from both random cell crawling and purse-string-like contraction. This
coordinated gap closure will serve as a novel model system to study the fundamental mechanisms for gap
closure from biophysics, cell and molecular biology perspectives.
Recent Progress by the PI: In the past 7 years, the PI has established his lab and built a productive research
team at UMass Amherst. Since joining UMass, the PI’s group has published 26 journal articles and engaged 8
graduate students, 2 postdoctoral fellows, and more than 20 undergraduate researchers with diverse
backgrounds, including bioengineering, molecular and cell biology, neuroscience, and biophysics. With strong
collaborations with cell biologists, biophysicists, and bioinformatic experts, the PI’s lab has developed several
bioengineering tools to define cell microenvironment, including micropatterning, traction force microscopy, DNA-
based fluorescence sensors for intercellular force measuring, mechanical strain gradient generation device, and
single cell RNA sequencing expertise. Leveraging those tools, the PI’s lab has investigated how mechanical
cues such as geometrical confinement, substrate mechanics, and external mechanical strains regulate cell
rearrangement and migration.
Overview of Future Research Plans: To fully understand the mechanism of this novel gap closure process,
our first goal is to track and rigorously characterize cell kinematics, proliferation/growth pattern, force distribution,
and tissue fluidity during the gap closure of tissues undergoing EMT. We will study how force and tissue fluidity
patterns are regulated by environmental factors such as gap geometry, 3D curvature, extracellular matrix
properties, and external mechanical strains. Further, we aim to combine spatial transcriptomics and molecular
biology techniques to identify the molecular mechanisms for coordinated gap closure and molecular regulators
of tissue fluidity. Together, those fundamental studies will deepen our understanding of the wound healing
process and guide the design of novel medical devices to accelerate the wound healing process."

 Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) provide growth and differentiation signals that are indispensable for the
development of T cells with a diverse, yet self-tolerant TCR repertoire. The number of TECs increases
exponentially in newborns as the thymus grows to support increased production of naïve T cells that are exported
to colonize peripheral lymphoid organs. The perinatal period is a time of dynamic changes in TEC subset
composition, differentiation, organization and function. Although the conversion of perinatal thymus growth to
juvenile thymus homeostasis is well established, the specific changes that occur in the composition of
transcriptionally distinct TEC subsets and identification of signaling pathways that initially promote and
subsequently limit expansion and remodeling of the TEC compartment are poorly understood. Furthermore, the
TEC progenitors in which such molecular re-programming events occur have not been defined. Our preliminary
data suggest that the Cyclin D1-retinoblastoma (RB)-E2F pathway is a key molecular switch that modulates TEC
proliferation during the perinatal to adult transition. We have shown that expansion of the perinatal TEC
compartment can be maintained into adulthood by deleting Rb family members or by expressing a keratin 5
driven Cyclin D1 (K5.D1) transgene to inactivate RB function. Our overall hypothesis is that perinatal and
juvenile TECs express distinct transcriptional profiles that coordinate TEC proliferation and differentiation, and
that the Cyclin D1-RB-E2F pathway regulates both processes. We propose a series of experiments that will test
this hypothesis and provide new insights into currently unresolved questions regarding the perinatal TEC
compartment. These questions include: 1) what changes occur in the composition of TEC subsets during the
perinatal to juvenile transition; 2) how do the transcriptional signatures of TEC subsets change across the
transition; 3) what molecular mechanisms and pathways regulate these changes; 4) what are the identities and
lineage hierarchies of TEC progenitors during the transition; and 5) do comparable cellular and molecular
changes occur in human TECs. The overall goal of RP1 is to resolve these knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will
use scRNA-seq to determine changes in the transcriptional profiles and advanced imaging to map localization
of transcriptionally distinct TEC subsets during the perinatal to juvenile transition. Parallel scRNA-seq and
imaging analyses will be performed on human TECs and thymus tissue. In Aim 2 we will perform in vitro and in
vivo assays to directly test the differentiation potential of candidate TEC progenitors identified in Aim 1. In Aim
3 we will determine whether molecular pathways that regulate TEC proliferation and differentiation are
coordinately linked by performing proteomic screens coupled with ChIP- seq analyses."
10907501,"Abstract
There is growing evidence that thymic epithelial cells (TEC) are the key cell type responsible for orchestrating
the fetal development and postnatal function. A single transcription factor, FOXN1, is known to be a critical
regulator of multiple aspects of TEC proliferation and function throughout the lifespan. The TEC compartment
switches from a fetal/neonatal expansion program to a juvenile homeostasis program, with a key transition point
occurring at about 7 days postnatal in mice (P07), and about 4 months of age in humans. Data in mice show that
this switch is controlled by the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway, acting at least in part by suppression of Foxn1 gene
expression by E2F transcription factors. Mice deficient for multiple RB family members fail to make this switch
and continue to expand. The K5.D1 transgenic line, in which CyclinD1 is specifically overexpressed in TEC,
mimics this RB loss of function phenotype by activating cyclin-dependent kinases that inhibit RB function. In both
RB mutants and K5.D1 transgenics Foxn1 gene expression is elevated, and suppressing Foxn1 expression
using a postnatal-specific hypomorphic allele (Foxn1Z/Z) restores the fetal to juvenile switch, normalizing thymus
size. We have also shown that Foxn1 regulation of TEC proliferation occurs primarily in MHCIIlo TEC, consistent
with preliminary data from the Richie lab that a Sca1-MHCIIlo TEC subset may contain a key proliferating
progenitor population during the switch from fetal expansion to juvenile homeostasis. These data suggest that
during the perinatal to juvenile transition, RB proteins modulate Foxn1 transcription via E2F transcription factors
differentially in specific TEC subsets to ‘put the brakes on’ TEC proliferation, and thus regulate organ size. There
is also growing evidence that the neonatal and adult thymi have stage-specific functions that generate distinct T
cell populations. As FOXN1 is also known to be a key regulator of TEC differentiation, the changes in how Foxn1
expression is regulated to control TEC proliferation should also have significant impacts on TEC function in the
neonatal and adult thymus. We propose three specific aims to test the hypothesis that the RB-dependent
changes in Foxn1 gene expression levels during the neonatal period that are essential for establishing organ
homeostasis are also required to generate specific microenvironments that are necessary for neonatal-specific
organ functions. The goals of this project are to determine: how changes in Foxn1 expression across this
transition impact stromal composition changes in mouse, and compare to stromal changes in human thymus;
how Foxn1 expression is regulated by the RB pathway during this transition; and how these Foxn1-dependent
processes impact immune function."

 The perinatal thymus plays a unique role in promoting central tolerance. Central tolerance results from
negative selection of autoreactive conventional T cells (Tconv) and differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg).
Notably, Tregs selected during the perinatal period are more autoreactive and are uniquely required for life-
long protection against autoimmunity. Perinatal Tconv cells are also more autoreactive and have unique
molecular and functional properties compared with their juvenile/adult counterparts. Both negative selection
and Treg induction occur when thymocytes encounter auto-antigens presented by medullary thymic epithelial
cells (mTECs) or hematopoietic antigen presenting cells (HAPCs), including dendritic cells (DCs). TECs and
thymic HAPCs undergo profound changes during the perinatal to juvenile transition. The rationale for RP3 is
that thymic HAPCs are distinct in cellular composition and molecular profiles in the perinatal period, when
thymic selection is critical for differentiation of the first wave of Tconv cells and establishment of self-tolerance.
We will test the hypothesis that unique properties of mTECs and HAPCs in the perinatal period create an
altered environment for central tolerance induction and are responsible for selection of Tconv and Treg cells
with increased self-reactivity and age-specific functional properties. In Aim 1, we will use single cell
transcriptional profiling (scRNA-seq) and multiplex imaging to identify the cellular, transcriptional, and
organizational changes that occur in mouse and human HAPCs over the perinatal to juvenile transition which
could impact central tolerance. In Aim 2, we will use phenotypic analyses, transcriptional profiling, genetic
models, and functional assays to identify the APCs responsible for selecting tissue-protective Treg in the
perinatal period. We will also determine whether CCR7-mediated cross-talk with TECs alters the DC
compartment in perinatal mice, with downstream consequences for Treg selection. In Aim 3, we will determine
if negative selection is impaired in perinates in response to antigens across a range of affinities. Live-cell 2-
photon microscopy will be used to determine if distinct APCs induce negative selection in the perinatal period.
 RP3 has multiple points of intersection with all Projects and Cores. We will use scRNA-seq to identify
altered molecular signatures of HAPCs in mice and humans (with Cores B and C) during the perinatal to
juvenile transition that could impact central tolerance. Parallel data from RP1 and RP2 will provide a
comprehensive map of changes in TECs and thymic stromal cells over the perinatal to juvenile transtition that
could to alter central tolerance. We will also collaborate with the Manley lab (RP2) for MiCasa analysis to
reveal organizational changes in the thymic environment during the perinatal to juvenile transition. Results
generated in RP3 are integral to achieving the overall Program goals of elucidating mechanisms by which
thymic stromal properties alter Treg and Tconv cell differentiation and selection in the perinatal period, with
implications for devising rational therapeutic strategies to safely enhance T cell output."

human 2D and 3D model systems as well as mouse models. The Center will test the overall hypothesis that
FMRP regulates human brain development and circuit functions via translational regulation of novel mRNA

that need to be analyzed and integrated over research projects at multiple sites, requires a focused and
dedicated effort to ensure success. The Administrative Core will assume primary responsibility for leading the
effort to maintain transparency, organization, and communication. The Administrative Core will be responsible
for facilitating the sharing of resources and data among investigators, ensuring timely progression towards
milestones, sharing results with the scientific community and the general public, and conducting financial and

collaborative effort to reach our overarching goal. Using an array of collaborative organization products, we will
be able to ensure open communication channels, secure sites for data deposition, and transparent operation of
the Center. In summary, the Administrative Core is the foundation for a successful collaborative effort through
centralized coordination of the proposed Projects and leverages existing resources within the partner institutions.
Emory University, the host institution, offers a vast array of resources and expertise that we can access to
facilitate the effective administration of this Center. We believe that our coordinated effort will create scientific
synergy and significantly advance our understanding of FMRP-mediated gene regulation in human brain
development and enable novel therapeutic development for fragile X syndrome."

have increased protein synthesis rates, increased proliferation and altered migration, resulting in delayed

have consequences on neuronal development and function. Aim 2 is to identify FMRP targets and translationally
dysregulated mRNAs during brain development in multiple human FXS iPSC neural models. Using CLIP-seq we
have identified FMRP target mRNAs in both human cortical organoids and mouse embryonic cortex at similar
developmental stages. Our comparative analyses have revealed three groups of FMRP mRNA targets, human
only, mouse only and shared ones. We have also recently used ribosome profiling to identify translationally
dysregulated mRNAs, some of which are FMRP targets, in whole cortex in the adult mouse brain. Thus, ribosome
profiling will be applied to characterize the translatomes of FXS patients and controls using both isogenic
i3Neurons and i3Neurons from multiple patients, as well as from isogenic 3D cortical organoids. For comparison
between FXS models, we also will conduct ribosome profiling of FXS mouse embryonic cortex. In Aim 3, we will
devise targeted strategies to rescue cellular and synaptic phenotypes in human FXS iPSC neural models. We
will manipulate expression of dysregulated FMRP targets using lentivirus-based approaches to rescue FXS-
associated cellular and synaptic phenotypes. The outcome of the experiments in this Project, coupled with

Our research focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms and investigating the functional impact of a form
of non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity, namely homeostatic synaptic plasticity. In contrast to the self-reinforcing
nature of Hebbian plasticity, homeostatic plasticity operates under different rules as a “corrective” mechanism to
prevent run-away Hebbian plasticity. Compared to Hebbian plasticity, the contribution of defective homeostatic
synaptic plasticity to neuronal and behavioral phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders is virtually
unexplored. Work from our labs in the past years show that retinoic acid (RA) signaling, a major signaling
pathway mediating homeostatic synaptic plasticity, is severely impaired in the absence of FMRP expression,
resulting in a lack of homeostatic plasticity in both mouse and human FXS neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate
that under a more natural, enriched environment, compromised homeostatic synaptic plasticity in adult mice
induces run-away Hebbian plasticity as manifested by greatly enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and
diminished long-term depression (LTD). As a behavioral consequence, animals with defective homeostatic
plasticity exhibit enhanced learning but reduced behavioral flexibility when raised in an enriched environment.
Together, our work establishes a link between synaptic RA signaling, homeostatic plasticity and cognitive
function, and suggests that impaired homeostatic plasticity may contribute to cognitive deficits in FXS. The goal
of the proposed research project is to build upon this knowledge base, and establish a disease research platform
from which translationally relevant FXS phenotypes at cellular and synaptic levels can be identified and their
functional implication in cognitive function at behavioral level can be further explored in model organisms. To
achieve this, we will use both a mouse FXS model and human cerebral organoids generated from human FXS
patient cells, run parallel experiments at molecular and cellular levels, and identify shared phenotypes between
the two model systems. We will then explore the impact of these shared phenotypes on learning and memory
formation in behaving FXS mice, thus gaining further insight into how altered homeostatic synaptic plasticity may
compromise cognitive function in human patients. Establishing such a platform for disease research will facilitate
animal model-based drug discovery by focusing on treatment of phenotypes that are pertinent to human patients."

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and a leading genetic
cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). FXS is caused by the loss of functional fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP). Previous works have focused on the role of FMRP as a translational regulator, and many mRNA
targets of FMRP have been shown to be ASD-linked genes. Despite major progress to characterize underlying
disease mechanisms in animal models that has led to several clinical trials, including phase 3 clinical trials of
drugs modulating metabotropic glutamate and GABA receptors, improvements of behavioral and cognitive
outcomes in patients have unfortunately been largely unsuccessful. We believe that a major gap in the preclinical
phase of drug development for FXS can be addressed by the development of human FXS induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC) derived models, which will enable us to identify human specific therapeutic targets and evaluate
novel therapeutic approaches. Human iPSCs are pluripotent and are able to generate many different cell types.
Three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture of iPSCs has evolved from embryoid body culture, quite faithfully
following human organogenesis, and provides a new platform to investigate human brain development in a dish,
otherwise inaccessible to experimentation. We have developed FXS iPSC models, including 2D neural
progenitor cells (NPCs)/cortical neurons and 3D cortical organoids, and identified a number of FMRP target
mRNAs in the human context. Furthermore, we have observed abnormalities associated with the loss of FMRP
at molecular, cellular and electrophysiological levels in FXS iPSC models. Intriguingly, our preliminary data
suggest that PI3K inhibitors, but not mGluR5 antagonists, could rescue cellular phenotypes in human FXS iPSC
derived model systems, potentially validating the failure of positive preclinical mouse studies with negative
human trials. In this proposed study, we aim to use human specific iPSC models as translational tools to develop
novel therapeutic approaches for FXS. First, we will determine the therapeutic effects of compounds targeting
candidate pathways in FXS organoids (Aim 1). Second, we will develop CRISPR-based genomic and epigenomic
editing therapeutic approaches to reactivate FMR1 expression in FXS organoids (Aim 2). Third, we will conduct
molecular phenotype and FMR1-reactivation-based small molecule screens (Aim 3). Our proposed works will
lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of new treatment strategies for FXS."

Core B. Genomics Bioinformatics
A Genomics and Bioinformatics Core is proposed to enable the application of massively parallel sequencing-
based approaches to advance the understanding of pathological programs of gene expression that contribute to
the development of atherosclerosis and NASH. An essential aspect of all four Projects of this PPG will be to
define the consequences of genetic, dietary and pharmacologic perturbations on global programs of gene
expression in relevant tissues and cell types. The PPG Genomics and Bioinformatics Core will provide two
complementary services to advance these efforts; 1) technical support and resources for preparation and
sequencing of libraries enabling bulk RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq assays and 2)
corresponding bioinformatics and computational support to allow effective analysis of the resulting data."

Project 4. Role of liver fat and fibrosis in human CVD risk phenotypes
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver
(NAFLD). NAFLD afflicts 80 million persons in the United States and is projected to become the main cause of
end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation within the next 10 years. NAFLD, and especially its progressive
form NASH, is associated with an increase in CVD risk, independent of common CVD risk factors. The
pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the clinical association between NAFLD and CVD remain only
partially understood. There are limited data regarding the potential role of liver fat or liver fibrosis content in their
association with CVD risk in NAFLD. The central objective of Project 4 is to fill this gap in knowledge by
prospectively assessing the cardiovascular risk (CVR) phenotype (low risk versus high risk) by non-invasively
quantifying liver fat and fibrosis content in participants with and without NAFLD. CVR phenotypes will be
assessed using a well-accepted and validated CVD risk score: Framingham Risk Score and Coronary Artery
Calcium score. Our group has developed and clinically validated two advanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) modalities for non-invasive assessment of liver fat and fibrosis: MRI Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-
PDFF) and MR Elastography (MRE). To validate findings in the UCSD cohort, we will collaborate with
investigators of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (Drs Ramachandran and Long) using Controlled Attenuation
Parameter (CAP) and Vibration Controlled Elastography (VCTE) assessments for liver phenotyping. Project 4
will also explore several pathogenic mechanisms that may be shared by CVD and NASH. It will also serve as
the central hub for translational human validation of mechanistic studies conducted in Projects 1, 2, and 3 and
provide access to a prospectively collected biospecimens from patients enrolled at UCSD. To achieve our goal,
our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Development and validation of imaging biomarkers for CVD risk in the NAFLD population. Test
the hypotheses that liver fat content and fibrosis, as assessed by MRI-PDFF and MRE, respectively, each are
independently associated with increased CVD risk phenotypes in NAFLD in the UCSD cohort. Validate these
associations in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).
Aim 2: Investigation of common mechanisms underlying CVD and NAFLD. Test hypotheses that NAFLD
and CVD share increased de novo lipogenesis, hepatic fibrogenesis, or abnormal hepatic cholesterol metabolism
as common underlying mechanisms.
Aim 3: Test hypothesis that OSE biomarkers can differentiate NAFLD and CVD risk in a population of
NAFLD patients. In collaboration with Project 3, we will test the hypothesis that OSE biomarkers associate with
liver fat, fibrosis, and/or CVD risk phenotypes in a population of NAFLD patients."

10908552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and contribute to morbidity and mortality in model systems. SnCs
also play a role in normal physiology, e.g., wound healing. Currently it is unclear when and where SnCs arise in
tissues with age, how heterogenous SnCs are in vivo, and how to best identify them and their role in physiology
vs. pathology, especially in humans. The goal of the Midwest Murine-Tissue Mapping Center (MM-TMC)
Biological Analysis Core (BAC) is to leverage the utility of the mouse as a model organism to map SnCs, which
will help inform the human SnC atlases under development by SenNet. We propose to validate, optimize, and
apply state-of-the-art methodologies for bulk and single cell characterization and spatiotemporal analysis of
SnCs in healthy mouse tissues over a range of ages in two genetic backgrounds. The MM-TMC BAC will focus
on adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, brain, and lung tissues from inbred C57BL/6J and f1 hybrid (C57BL/6J:FVB/n)
mice. The data generated by the BAC will be delivered to the Data Analysis Core (DAC) for integration to develop
SnC atlases for the five tissues. The BAC will be led by Nathan LeBrasseur, an expert in the identification and
characterization of SnCs in skeletal muscle and lung in mice and humans, and in biomarker discovery; Paul
Robbins, an expert in senolytic development; and Laura Niedernhofer, an expert in the study of SnCs in
transgenic mice. The three MPIs are part of a P01 led by Overall PI Sundeep Khosla, which develops,
characterizes, and utilizes innovative transgenic mice that permit the induction of SnCs in a particular organ or
cell type, report expression of the SnC-driving genes p16Ink4a or p21Cip1, or specifically kill cells expressing those
genes. These mice will be important tools in SenNet for mapping efforts and validating probes to detect SnCs.
The BAC analytical workflow will be based within existing cores at Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota
(UMN) to guarantee a stable infrastructure and high quality control standards: the UMN Imaging Centers, the
UMN Genomics Center, Mayo CyTOF Core, the UMN Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics (CMSP),
the UMN Cytokine Reference Laboratory, and Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. These cores contain state-
of-the-art instrumentation available for mapping SnCs: Ionpath Multiplexed Ion Beam Mass Imaging, Visium
Spatial Gene Expression, and NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling. In addition, the CMSP will use a
proteogenomic approach to identify novel SnC-specific protein sequences as biomarkers. These unique
resources, together with the MPIs’ expertise, will be valuable for building the 4D tissue atlases. Broadly, the BAC
proposes to: 1) Establish a pipeline of reproducible, validated, and quantitative assays to detect and characterize
SnCs in whole tissues and single cell preparations; 2) Use primary mouse cells as a controlled model for
validating analytical tools, studying the evolution of SnCs over time, and identifying novel SnC biomarkers; 3)
Scale-up the data generation pipeline and incorporate emerging technologies; and 4) Perform spatiotemporal
analysis of SnCs in the five tissues to enable the DAC to generate 4D SnC atlases."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Medical and public health research has shown how economic and social structures negatively
shape health outcomes in minority populations. This research has foregrounded culture and
access to healthcare as the dominant determinants of health outcomes. However, an improved
understanding of the ways larger social processes, including structural racism, impact minority
health and health disparities would enhance health services to minority populations and reduce
health disparities. Most health care practitioners are not trained in social science frameworks,
and most social scientists who do related research do not know how to translate their research
to make it accessible and actionable by clinicians. This project contributes to reducing health
disparities by organizing an interdisciplinary conference to bridge social science and clinical
knowledge of health in minority populations - especially immigrant populations. The conference
will be attended by social scientists, clinicians, policy makers and the general public. The
conference will include panels and keynotes delivered by expert clinicians and social scientists
to thematically orient the conference and disseminate cutting-edge research on minority health
and health disparities. Presenters come from diverse backgrounds and have specialized
knowledge of the key health issues facing minority populations in the United States, including
such topics as sexual gender minorities, rural residents, and immigrant communities. In addition
to the keynotes and panels, clinicians will present real case studies of minority patients for
rigorous co-analysis with social scientists in small groups. Cases will include maternal
mortality/morbidity and infant mortality and infectious diseases. These workshop sessions will
be designed to use diverse disciplinary knowledge, methods, and theories to understand cases
previously considered intractable in new ways, sensitive to the unique structural and
socioeconomic contexts of each case. Group discussions will maintain a translational focus so
as to produce actionable interventions, health systems innovations, and original programs for
equitable health policy and practice, with a focus on patient-clinician communication in primary
care. Findings from this conference will have a wide-spread, lasting influence through its
dissemination in the “Case Studies in Social Medicine for Health Equity,” which has already
been accepted for publication in The Lancet. By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to
reduce health disparities, this project will cultivate cross-sector partnerships, produce original
knowledge on health equity, and promote the dissemination and translation of this knowledge
into novel interventions suited to ameliorate health injustices in the long-term."

The International Copper Meeting has been held biennially for the past 24 years. Unlike organic
nutrients and metabolites, such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleotides, that can be
synthesized de novo or mobilized from intracellular stores in response to deprivation, transition metals
are unique micronutrients that can neither be created nor destroyed. Therefore, proper dietary intake
and strict homeostatic mechanisms to monitor metal abundance are vital. Traditionally, the redox-active
transition metal copper functions as a high affinity catalytic cofactor within the active site of copper-
dependent enzymes necessary for a diverse array of biological processes.The essentiality of intact
mechanisms of Cu homeostasis to cellular physiology was firmly established when human disorders
associated with aberrant copper metabolism were identified including the well-studied genetic
disorders, Wilson and Menkes, along with MEDNIK syndrome, ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy,
and Huppke-Brendel syndrome. Beyond hereditary disorders, fluctuations in copper levels have been
linked to neurological disorders, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and associated metabolic syndromes,
cancer initiation and progression, and host immunity against infection. infection, and immunity. There
are three specific objectives of the 13th International Copper Meeting. The first objective is to
disseminate and synthesize the most up-to-date knowledge and newest technologies surrounding
mechanisms of copper acquisition, distribution, utilization, and elimination and therapeutic targeting of
misbalances in copper homeostasis that contribute to human disease. To accomplish this goal, we
have planned a series of keynote and plenary speakers from many of the leading experts in the field,
multiple short talks selected from the poster abstracts, poster sessions, several focused workshops,
and informal discussions. Since the challenges in this field are daunting and will require collaborative
efforts to solve them, the second objective is to enhance interactions between academia, industry,
and clinical science. To this end, we have specifically invited speakers representing each of these
topics, and are planning a workshop to discuss career trajectories in different disciplines and navigating
productive collaborations. The third objective is to invest intellectually and financially in the future by
supporting promising young trainees. The goal is to encourage trainees to be successful and stay in
the field by providing intellectual support through discussions with senior scientists, poster sessions,
opportunities to speak, awards that recognize their achievements, and by providing financial support
with competitive travel awards. The expected outcomes are increased collaborations, promotion, and
training of young scientists in the field, identification of new approaches for identifying and developing
therapeutic targets and strategies to combat failures in copper homeostasis."
10909005,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with chronic life-limiting illness who develop acute respiratory failure are at high risk of death and
disability. Because some such patients would choose to forego life-sustaining treatments in certain conditions,
it is important that ICU clinicians assess patients’ values, goals, and treatment preferences, and incorporate
these findings into shared decision-making to provide goal-concordant care. Unfortunately, my preliminary data
as well as qualitative studies of other hospitalized populations suggest that ICU clinicians often miss
opportunities to assess or incorporate patients’ goals of care into decision-making. This may lead to the
delivery of unwanted intensive care and life-sustaining treatments, which is harmful to both patients and
families, and results in the delivery of high-cost, low-value care.
The proposed research in this application will use multimethod and mixed-methods approaches to: (1) examine
current implementation of goals-of-care discussions for patients with acute respiratory failure and chronic life-
limiting illness; (2) identify potentially modifiable clinician behavioral determinants that underlie deficiencies in
goals-of-care communication, and iteratively redesign an existing outpatient communication-priming
intervention toward the goal of promoting high-quality goals-of-care discussions in the ICU; and, (3) conduct a
pilot randomized trial of the redesigned communication-priming intervention to improve the occurrence and
quality of documented goals-of-care discussions for patients with acute respiratory failure and chronic life-
limiting illness.
Through a combination of mentored research activities and formal research training, I will receive valuable
research training in analytical methods to enhance the validity of studies that use “real-world” data, application
of mixed-methods research to inform health intervention design, and clinical trials. The proposed research and
training activities will prepare me for a career as an independent clinical investigator, and will form the
foundation for a body of research designed to improve outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure.
These research and training activities will be facilitated by the academically rich research environments of the
University of Washington Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health, as well as the Cambia Palliative
Care Center of Excellence at UW Medicine."

The skeleton is a preferred organ for cancer dissemination from various tumors malignancies. The main
objective of this research proposal is to understand the function of the Bone Marrow microenvironment, and
specifically of its perivascular components, in the establishment of skeletal metastasis.
The studies that are proposed aim to test the innovative hypothesis that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs),
as perivascular cells (pMSCs), function as gatekeepers controlling tumor cell invasion to the bone. This
new hypothesis provides clinically relevant information for therapeutic strategies that innovately aim at
reducing the engraftment of circulating cancer cells by closing the gate through which the metastatic cell transit
into the normal bone. We propose that the inhibition of one or combination of tumor cells and pMSCs
specific genes would prevent or attenuate the metastatic process in vivo.
To experimentally dissect the various cellular and extracellular matrix components controlling extravasation,
we have designed and validated a unique in vivo extraskeletal humanized bone marrow niche-mimicking
platform (humanized Ossicle). This platform is centered around the use of a porous, calcium phosphate
ceramic into which human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSC) are loaded and then implanted into the
back of immune deficient mice. Bone is fabricated onto the walls of the ceramic by hBM-MSCs anchored at
these locations and, at the centers; the host-derived blood vessels have pMSCs within the marrow space.
We have documented that when melanoma is injected into the blood stream of the mouse, the bones become
black (melanin), as is the bone in habitat. If we manipulate the expression of molecules are we propose
involved in the process, such as CXCL12 or MCAM in the pMSCs, the mouse bone is black and the habitat is
white. This black-and-white result sets the stage for Specific Aim 1 where we dissect the participation of
pMSCs and the perivascular basement membrane in driving Skeletal Metastasis. In Specific Aim 2, we
propose to determine the participation of HSC-niche ligand molecules expressed on cancer cells in
driving SM.
We have established a baseline using melanoma, which has the highest rate of lethality once it metastasizes
into bone. This proposal will also be focused on the study of molecular mechanisms using breast cancer cell
lines. A logical extension of this platform is to provide a predictive diagnostic for the patients' control over
metastasis for different osteotropic cancers.
In addition to the significant direct clinical impact, this proposed work is expected also to provide the platform
for future projects addressing the roles of pMSCs that may influence other skeletal metastasis, such as
regulation of local antitumor immune response, cancer cells dormancy and tumor angiogenesis, and to serve
as template for the study of other osteotropic malignancies (prostate and lung cancer), thus broadening the
significance of the findings and conclusions."

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with 50,000-60,000 diagnoses annually
and over 1 million Americans afflicted in total. PD-associated motor symptoms arise from the selective loss of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Because SNpc neurons send long-
projecting axons to the striatum, this stereotypical neurodegeneration robs the striatum of crucial dopaminergic
inputs and thereby renders an important motor feedback pathway ineffective. Alpha synuclein protein is known
as the pathological hallmark of PD pathology. The function of alpha synuclein in the healthy brain is not
completely understood, however it is transported down axons in abundance, is highly enriched in presynaptic
terminals, and is believed to be responsible for the transmission and progression of PD pathology across
different regions of the nervous system. Although researchers have learned a great deal about PD
pathophysiology through cellular and animal models, the findings have had limited translational impact due to
challenges in recapitulating the most disease-relevant attributes of human brain structure and function. In
particular, there are limitations of current in vitro and in vivo models to recapitulate essential features of human
disease related to axon pathophysiology and synuclein transmission. For instance, a key feature related to
early SNpc vulnerability is that each dopaminergic neuron features a long-projecting axon with complex
arborization that can total 15 feet in length within the striatum, incurring unique transport and metabolic needs
of these neurons. This feature of long axonal projections from human derived dopaminergic neurons – the
human source ensuring a genetic endowment capable of developing and responding to synucleinopathy –
projecting to a striatal neuronal source has been absent in preclinical models of PD thereby underrepresenting
the role of axonopathy and metabolic susceptibility in PD pathogenesis. To address this need, we have
developed the first tissue engineered nigrostriatal pathway (TE-NSP) recapitulating key elements of the native
pathway: discrete human stem cell derived, phenotypically-controlled neuronal populations connected by long-
projecting axonal tracts. This project will validate TE-NSPs as the first PD model featuring anatomically
inspired microtissue, and then apply this novel platform for the study of PD axonopathy, mechanisms of
synuclein transmission, and pharmacological interventions to block axon-mediated spread of pathological
alpha-synuclein across discrete brain structures. We will first demonstrate that TE-NSPs appropriately
recapitulate the relevant systems-level architecture by identifying all source and target cell types,
characterizing synaptic formation with presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, and demonstrating input-output
based on evoked dopamine release (AIM 1). We will then model PD via the addition of exogenous alpha
synuclein fibrils and characterize acute axonal pathophysiological changes to axon length and density, tyrosine
hydroxylase expression, alpha synuclein transfer from dopaminergic to medium spiny neurons, and affects on
dopamine release (AIM 2). Finally, we will utilize TE-NSPs as a testbed for evaluating therapeutic strategies
aimed at inhibiting alpha synuclein spread through MTOR inhibition (AIM 3). We have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team of researchers consisting of stem cell specialists, neurobiologists, tissue engineers, and
clinicians to validate and apply this novel in vitro platform. Successful demonstration of this platform will
significantly advance a translational approach to ultimately build personalized TE-NSPs using dopaminergic
neurons derived from PD patients to evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of pharmacological therapies
targeted at preventing alpha synuclein transmission to delay and/or prevent axonal/neuronal degeneration in a
patient-specific manner."
10909184,"Immune mechanisms of Influenza-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis
Influenza A infection is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is estimated that 3-4 million
cases of severe illness and 300,000 deaths due to influenza infection occur annually. During influenza
pandemics, the focus is on lung disease, which is the most common cause of death. However, recent
epidemiological studies reported significant mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) during
influenza infection. Atherosclerosis is a common cause of coronary artery disease (CAD), including MI, stroke,
and heart failure. The innate and adaptive immune response to modified lipids and vascular endothelial cells
causes a series of events that result in plaque formation in medium to large-sized arteries. If inflammatory stimuli
continue, plaques become vulnerable to rupture and can cause MI. However, the mechanism involved in the
influenza-induced increase in MI incidence is not clear.
Our long-term research goal is to understand the impact of lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. The
objective of this application is to determine how influenza infection directly or indirectly impacts the outcome of
atherosclerosis. In Aim 1, we will characterize myeloid and lymphoid cellular subsets from lung, aorta, and spleen
at various time points (early, peak, recovery phase) after fluorescent-labeled (Color-flu) influenza infection to
track influenza virus along with the cellular recruitment to the vessel. We will then examine whether antigen
presentation is impacted by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) using bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) and T cell re-
stimulation in vitro. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of type III IFNs (IFNλ) systemically (intraperitoneal) or
locally in the lung (oropharyngeal) in influenza-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Further, we will
determine the effect of IFNλ on foam cell formation in macrophages. Finally, we will determine the effect of
conditioned media from influenza or type I (IFNβ), type II (IFNγ), and type III (IFNλ)-treated human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBE) on human primary aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) to identify the mechanism involved in
the lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of IL-17 neutralization
systemically (intraperitoneal) or locally in the lung (oropharyngeal) in influenza induced-exacerbation of
atherosclerosis. Further, we will determine the effect of lung epithelial IL-17RC signaling during influenza
infection in atherosclerotic Apoe-/- mice. Finally, we will determine the effect of conditioned media from influenza-
infected or IL-17-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) on vascular endothelial cells (HAEC) to identify
the mechanism involved in the lung-vascular interactions in atherosclerosis. At the completion of these studies,
we expect to have made mechanistic insights into the cellular trafficking, viral trafficking, systemic and local
effects of IFNs and IL-17, and pulmonary epithelial IL-17 signaling in influenza-induced exacerbation of
atherosclerosis that may help to identify immune-based therapeutic targets."
10909189,"This R35 application describes our continuing and expanding program to develop and apply computational
methods to study how protein dynamics on many timescales contributes to enzymatic catalysis, and how some
enzymes are crafted by evolution to make use of protein dynamics on multiple timescales. This knowledge will
eventually inform approaches to design artificial enzymes – a grand challenge, as yet unmet.
 Our studies of enzymatic catalysis began years ago with the first application of Transition Path Sampling
to chemical reaction in enzymes. The generation of reactive trajectory ensembles along with reaction
coordinate identification allowed us to postulate the concept of the protein promoting vibration: rapid protein
dynamics at or near the active site that are directly coupled to passage over the transition state barrier to
reaction. Such motions were found in multiple enzyme systems (but not all,) and their importance was verified
by experimental collaborators. More recently, application of these methods to artificial enzymes that are
subjected to optimization by laboratory evolution has shown the evolutionary process introduces such motion
into a static design and we have identified protein structural changes that allows the creation and coupling of
the dynamics. “Theozymes” created by de novo static structural methods have had limited success, while
laboratory evolution has allowed these proteins to develop significant catalytic power,
 We will continue and significantly expand our program on this challenging topic through extensions of both
methodologies employed and with application to both natural and laboratory evolved enzyme families. In
addition to understanding how protein evolution leads to the coupling of rapid dynamics to barrier passage, we
will extend our approaches to be able to map how motions far more remote in time from the passage over the
chemical barrier can also be central to function. We will also develop methods that demonstrate how rapid
motions can prime the system for millisecond conformational change. Our goals for the program are to
understand how protein dynamics ranging from sub picosecond promoting vibrations to microsecond domain
motions to millisecond conformational motion are potentially inter-related and help form enzyme function, and
how such motions are orchestrated by the structure crafted by evolution.
 The development of such tools coupled with studies of both laboratory and naturally evolved enzyme
families will allow the isolation of a “dynamics toolbox” employed by selection. We have already found how in
one laboratory evolved enzyme the introduction and loss of hydrogen bonds in strategic locations results in the
creation of a promoting vibration; successful completion of the proposed program will expand such
investigation to the full range of protein motion timescales appropriate to catalytic turnover, along with the
architectural changes needed to create such dynamics in the protein catalyst."

Anti-PD-1 therapy reinvigorates exhausted CD8 T cells, which can lead to complete tumor eradication as early
as 3 weeks. Yet, despite robust T cell reinvigoration in >78% of patients, less than 40% are cured. The goal of
this proposal is to understand why robust reinvigoration of exhausted CD8 T cells by αPD-1 therapy does not
necessarily translate to clinical efficacy.
Exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX) are a major cell type responding to PD-1 blockade. We and others have shown
that αPD-1 therapy (αPD-1) reinvigorates exhausted CD8 T cells, as defined by enhanced proliferation and
cytokine production. TEX are heterogeneous with progenitor and terminally differentiated TEX that have different
roles in anti-tumor immune responses. Progenitor TEX (ProgEX) replenish terminally differentiated TEX (TermEX),
which in turn provide anti-tumor activity. Thus, similar to stem cells, ProgEX represent a reservoir for CD8 T cell
responses against the tumor. Importantly, it is the ProgEX, rather than TermEX, that respond to αPD-1 and
almost exclusively contribute to the early burst of CD8 T cell reinvigoration. Reinvigoration of TEX results in
accelerated differentiation of ProgEX to TermEX, resulting in a numerically greater pool of TermEX and improved
tumor control. However, at the same time, the accelerated differentiation induced by αPD-1 places increased
stress on ProgEX homeostasis. This raises the possibility that a ProgEX niche is key for providing the cells and
signals necessary to prevent the depletion of ProgEX, and may prove crucial for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.
Our central hypothesis is that depletion of ProgEX after αPD-1 impairs clinical efficacy and that a tumor-
associated niche is important in maintaining the pool of ProgEX. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
αPD-1 results in enhanced differentiation of ProgEX and that that depletion of ProgEX is associated with clinical
progression. We will use combinatorial tetramers and single cell RNA+TCR sequencing to understand how
αPD-1 alters the pool of melanoma-specific ProgEX, and how the size of ProgEX pool in turn, impacts the clinical
efficacy of αPD-1. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that tertiary lymphoid structures serve as a tumor-
associated niche for ProgEX, and that increased number or size of ProgEX niches after αPD-1 is associated with
the preservation of ProgEX and clinical efficacy. We will use multiparameter immunofluorescence and spatial
transcriptomics to define the cellular composition of the ProgEX niche, the transcriptional circuits utilized by
ProgEX in the niche, and the importance of the ProgEX niche in preserving the pool of ProgEX."
10909710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Although World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines now recommend once‐daily tenofovir‐lamivudine‐
dolutegravir (TLD) for antiretroviral therapy (ART), adherence challenges in taking daily oral ART persist. The
rates of virologic suppression (VS) worldwide for those on ART are around 70%, with a lower rate (65%)
approximately three years after starting ART. Pharmacologic adherence metrics, where ART levels are directly
measured in a biomatrix ‐ such as plasma, urine, dried blood spots (DBS), or hair‐ reflect actual pill‐taking and
predict virologic suppression more accurately than self‐reported adherence. Our UCSF research group has
helped pioneer the use of small hair samples to measure adherence to ART, but most methods to analyze ART
drugs in any matrix involve liquid chromatography/tandem‐mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) which is
expensive and cannot be performed in real‐time. Point‐of‐care (POC) adherence monitoring requires the
development of a highly selective antibody and subsequent development of an immunoassay to ART.
 Evidence from other disease states show that real‐time monitoring of drug levels to the needed
medication, followed by supportive feedback to the patient, increases adherence and improves outcomes.
Our UCSF group has now developed one of the first immunoassays (antibody‐based assay) to detect
tenofovir (TFV) in urine, a matrix easily‐accessible for point‐of‐care testing. Work by our team among people
with HIV (PWH) in Namibia assessed the effect of the urine assay on VS rates among persistently virally non‐
suppressed adults on ART, despite the application of WHO‐recommended enhanced adherence counseling
(EAC). In a pre‐post analysis, we found that VS rates increased from 0% to 92% after urine testing and
counseling at monthly ART refills over six months. Now is the time to perform a large, randomized trial to
explore the ability of counseling informed by results from the urine TFV assay to increase VS versus
standard‐of‐care EAC to provide evidence for incorporating the urine POC test into clinical practice.
 Aim 1 of this renewal R01 application proposes a large randomized trial (n=500) comparing use of the
POC urine test for TFV with tailored counseling versus standard‐of‐care EAC among participants with
documented virologic failure on TLD at clinics in South Africa. The primary outcome is VS at six months;
secondary outcomes include assessing the sustainability of the 6‐month intervention on VS out to 24 months;
development of viral resistance in each arm; and positive urine tests by arm. Aim 2 examines implementation
outcomes including acceptability and feasibility, with Aim 3 assessing cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. If
the trial is successful, we will have demonstrated that an easy‐to‐use inexpensive POC urine adherence test
will increase VS among populations with virologic failure on TLD, which will benefit patients, decrease the
development of viral resistance, and prevent forward transmission. The aspiration of this grant is to move the
low‐cost urine assay into clinical care and inform WHO ART guidelines (WHO letter of support included)."
10911992,"Children with moderate to severe bilateral CP have poor upper extremity abilities and
segmental trunk control deficits. Their independent functional sitting is impaired with decreased
participation in leisure activities, education involvement. Therefore, promoting independent sitting
and improving postural and upper extremity abilities are critical to the health and functional
independence of children with moderate-to-severe bilateral CP (GMFCS III-IV). Despite
significant strides in upper extremity treatments of children with milder (unilateral) CP, there is
limited evidence supporting efficacy of treatments targeting seated postural control in bilateral
CP. Recent robotic equipment allows clinicians to address engagement, repetition, and intensity
to practice task-oriented movements in CP. In this vein, we postulate that robotics can offer a
unique platform to provide efficient motor learning-based training in children with bilateral CP by
implementing postural skill progression. Our team has developed a unique motorized Trunk-
Support-Trainer (TruST) to engage children in play-oriented practice with skill progression. TruST
creates a customized donut-like force field at the region of the torso where balance is lost to
provide active assistance beyond the sitting stability limits through a belt. The training is based
on principles of motor learning, including skill progression.
 The overall goal of this work is to develop an evidence-based strategy to promote functional
independent sitting, maximize seated postural and upper extremity abilities, and improve sitting-
related ADLs. Our central hypothesis is that sitting and reaching benefits can be achieved when
a motor learning-based postural intervention is combined with postural-skill progression delivered
via TruST in comparison to a static trunk support. The innovation of this proposal, (RFA-HD-20-
005, ‘Pediatric Rehabilitation’) lies in the fusion of evidence-based clinical practice and novel
robotics with TruST. The result is a training paradigm where children with bilateral CP can receive
motor learning-based postural training in addition to postural skill progression that is tailored to
the child’s postural stability in sitting. If our hypotheses are supported, the TruST-intervention will
be a unique therapeutic solution for children with CP GMFCS III-IV to acquire and improve
independent functional sitting."
10911996,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background. The purpose of the proposed research is to test the feasibility and safety of inhaled hydrogen gas
(H2) administration as a rescue therapy during cardiac arrest requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (ECPR). Among patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) receiving ECPR, 52% either die or
suffer severe neurologic impairment. Diatomic hydrogen (H2) chemically reduces toxic oxygen mediators that
directly damage cellular structures, and has been shown to improve neurologic and renal function in a number
of preclinical ischemic injury models. Recently, we have demonstrated that inhalation of 2.4% H2 for up to 72
hours is safe in healthy adults. However, H2 has never been applied to the ECPR population.
Study design. We propose an early-phase, two-site, randomized trial of H2 in ECPR patients entitled the
‘Hydrogen FAST Trial’ (Hydrogen’s Feasibility And Safety as a Therapeutic agent). Key Inclusion criteria are
(1) patients with CHD (broadly defined, including myocarditis, channelopathies, transplant rejection), (2)
experiencing a cardiac arrest >5 minutes and receiving ongoing CPR, and (3) a decision made to resuscitate
using ECPR. The trial will be led by MPIs John Kheir, MD and Lynn Sleeper, ScD, who have a strong
collaborative history in this area and complementary expertise in critical care, translational research, and clinical
trials. Furthermore, the trial design has received favorable feedback from the FDA.
During the R61 Phase: (1) Regulatory (IRB and FDA) approvals will be obtained, including exception from
informed consent (EFIC) requirements. This is necessary because the emergent nature of ECPR and time-
sensitivity of H2 preclude traditional informed consent. Instead, non-opt-out patients will be randomized and
enrolled emergently, with subsequent traditional informed consent. (2) Investigational product (IP)
manufacturing, storage, and administration logistics will be established. (3) Endpoint adjudication processes
and DSMB infrastructure will be established. (4) Study roll-out and clinical staff education will be completed,
followed by a 3-patient vanguard phase (Phase 0) trial.
During the R33 Phase, 53 patients with CHD will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 (32/21) ratio to either usual care
plus 2.4% H2 gas following ECPR for 72 hours or to usual care from two sites. Primary endpoints include
measures of feasibility and safety (rate of treatment-associated severe adverse events, adjudicated by an
independent committee blinded to treatment group). Secondary endpoints will include functional status, brain
biomarkers and cranial images obtained using a new point-of-care MRI device.
Impact. The experienced team and infrastructure in place for this trial will ensure the successful completion of
R31 and R466 milestones. If H2 therapy is shown to be feasible and safe, this work will provide a foundation for
H2 administration in the critical care environment, and subsequent testing in cardiac arrest, stroke, myocardial
infarction, and other disorders in which ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a role."
10911997,"ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects ~1 million American adults and increases the risk of mortality attributable to
cardiovascular disease by 800%. Current evidence-based T1D self-management interventions target glycemic
control but ignore other modifiable health concerns prevalent in T1D such as hypertension and obesity. Exercise
interventions could provide a novel solution if they could innovatively address the diabetes management and
psychosocial challenges around exercise posed by T1D. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) allows patients
and providers to comprehensively track the short- and long-term outcomes of exercise. Evidence-based
interventions to translate CGM technology into sustainable adherence to exercise-related behaviors are lacking.
Our human-delivered pilot intervention provided previously sedentary adults with T1D access to exercise videos
and monthly client-centered discussions of their CGM and exercise data with an exercise coach. Participants
said these improved exercise management behavioral skills and motivation, but only transiently. They stated a
need for more frequent and sustained contact, requiring automated mobile tools that this proposal will develop.
These tools include just-in-time adaptive text messages to overcome exercise barriers at times of vulnerability,
weekly personalized reviews of short-term exercise safety hazards with tips to avoid them, and monthly
personalized evaluation of long-term impact of exercise on blood glucose levels via Bayesian modeling. The
program represents stage 1 of the NIH intervention development model: intervention generation, refinement,
modification, adaptation. These steps will be accomplished by a feasibility study evaluating user satisfaction and
mathematical robustness of an alpha version, using these results to modify the alpha version into a beta version,
and then testing the beta version in a nonrandomized crossover clinical trial. Lastly, the databank of
biobehavioral metrics generated by this trial (exercise, CGM, mood and sleep diaries for ~ 7,000 person-days)
will be subjected to dimensionality reduction to identify biobehavioral subtypes of baseline and early intervention
data. We will test whether these subtypes help predict longer-term intervention response and/or flag specific
biobehavioral feature combinations that drive intervention responsiveness. These findings will lay a foundation
for Dr. Ash’s future work developing precision medicine approaches. Alongside this research Dr. Ash will
complete training in the domains of 1) diabetes management and technology; 2) mobile health (mHealth)
intervention development; and 3) dimensionality reduction analytics. The training plan includes a strategic
combination of mentor-led trainings, coursework, grant writing, and attendance at relevant conferences and
workshops. Dr. Ash has assembled a mentoring team in T1D self-management and technology, multiple health
behavior change intervention development, mHealth development, and informatics. FitscriptLLC and PiLR Health
will provide customized intervention tools and data capture software. Dr. Gerstein’s laboratory will support data
storage, processing, and analytics."
10929291,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among military Veterans, and affects over 30% of older,
Vietnam-era Veterans. These servicemembers have endured nearly 40 years with these symptoms, and as a
result, have significantly poorer health, higher rates of chronic disease and obesity, and an excess mortality
rate 3 times higher than the general population. Clearly PTSD is more than just a psychological disorder. There
is evidence to suggest that the pathway from PTSD to poor health is mediated by behavioral risk factors, such
as exercise. Structured exercise is a highly effective, pluripotent strategy for the prevention, treatment, and
management of chronic physical and psychological health conditions in older adults. To date, only a few pilot
studies of exercise and PTSD have been published, and all suffer a major limitation: a singular focus on
outcomes “above the neck.” These studies do not report the impact of exercise on physical health- and
mobility-related outcomes that contribute to long-term impairment and disability in Veterans with PTSD. There
have been no studies of exercise and PTSD done in older adults, representing a significant research gap. This
research examines a wellness-based approach to promoting health in older Veterans with PTSD, targeting
exercise, a major modifiable risk factor. The objective of this study is to compare the impact of a supervised
exercise program on PTSD symptoms and related health outcomes versus a healthy aging attention control
group (HA-ATC).
This study will be a randomized controlled trial of a 6-month, supervised exercise program among 188
Veterans ≥60 years of age with PTSD at the Durham VAHCS. Participants will be randomly assigned to
Supervised Exercise or HA-ATC. The exercise arm will include 3 weekly exercise sessions, each one lasting
approximately 60 minutes, led by an exercise specialist. The HA-ATC will receive a health education program
and materials modeled on the 10 KeysTM to Healthy Aging curriculum and the National Council on Aging’s
“Aging Mastery Program.” The HA-ATC will include an 8-week face-to-face group program followed by 4
monthly sessions, the latter of which will be further supplemented with mailed informational packets, email
newsletters, webinars, and group video telehealth sessions. Participants in the Exercise intervention arm will
receive an individualized exercise prescription based on the individual’s exercise history, current exercise
capacity, personal preferences, and current health status. This will be a multicomponent program that includes
a selection of 8 to 12 strengthening, balance, and flexibility exercises targeting the major muscle groups as
well as primary joints. Participants will also be instructed in endurance exercise, including treadmill walking or
recumbent bicycle. The exercise protocol will consist of a 5-10 minute warm-up, followed by a series of
progressive aerobic and strengthening exercises, and will end with a 5 minute cool-down. The primary
outcome for this study will be PTSD symptoms assessed with the CAPS-5. Physical function, another outcome
of primary interest will be measured objectively with a Physical Performance Battery. This test battery
assesses aspects of daily function including balance (single leg stance), gait speed (4 meter walk), and chair
stands (# in 30 seconds). Aerobic endurance, the investigators’ primary functional outcome, will be assessed
with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes include depression, sleep, and cognitive function.
Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Assessments will be repeated 12 weeks
post-intervention (9 months) to examine whether any observed exercise intervention effects are maintained.
Mixed linear models will be used to compare outcomes for the two study arms."
10932401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this combined UH2/UH3 application is to develop a non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective
saliva-based test for early detection of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) recurrence.
SCCHN includes squamous cell carcinomas derived from oral cavity, tongue, pharynx and larynx. It is the 7th
most common cancer in US and worldwide by incidence, and the 3rd in US and 4th worldwide by 5-year
prevalence. SCCHN is a biologically aggressive cancer in which high rates of recurrence (local, locoregional or
distant) contribute significantly to poor patient survival. Current clinical practice methods for detection of
SCCHN recurrence are either subjective, invasive, hard to access, not able to detect recurrence in a timely
manner or expensive. There is an unmet medical need for an objective, non-invasive, easy to access test that
is able to detect SCCHN recurrence in a timely and a cost-effective way. Our solution is “HNKlear”, a non-
invasive, saliva-based candidate test for early detection of SCCHN recurrence. HNKlear incorporates a 7-
methylated microRNA biomarker panel. The real-time nature of our test will provide more timely and precise
detection of SCCHN recurrence. In our published proof of concept studies, HNKlear demonstrated 92%
sensitivity and 98% specificity in ~300 SCCHN and control tissue samples and 85% sensitivity and 95% in
~200 SCCHN and control saliva samples using continuous variables, which supports the clinical translation of
the test. We propose a combined UH2/UH3 application for the clinical translation of HNKlear. In the UH2
phase, we will analytically validate the test and algorithm in a pre-clinical study and in a new patient cohort.
Success of this phase will let us lock down the test and cut-off when the milestone is met. We will then conduct
a clinical study in the UH3 phase to demonstrate the clinical validity of HNKlear for SCCHN recurrence in an
observational clinical follow-up study incorporating HNKlear into current clinical practice. Success of this phase
will generate robust evidence of the clinical validity of HNKlear for early detection of SCCHN recurrence, and
will further enable clinical application of HNKlear as a Laboratory Developed Test."

Clinician-delivered relapse prevention interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are effective when delivered
but the vast majority of adults with an active AUD do not receive them due to well-known barriers to
clinician-delivered treatment. Digital therapeutics (smartphone “apps” that are used to prevent, treat, or manage
a medical or psychiatric disorder) can address these barriers. Unfortunately, the benefits from digital
therapeutics may be constrained because engagement with them is often not sustained or matched to patients’
needs. The next wave of “smart” digital therapeutics that include embedded machine learning lapse prediction
models powered by personal sensing can address these constraints by guiding patients to sustain engagement
with the specific interventions and supports that are most personally risk-relevant and therefore most effective.
Personal sensing has been possible within digital therapeutics for AUD for several or more years. Machine
learning lapse prediction models are emerging now, and the models developed by our team meet or exceed
performance thresholds necessary for useful clinical applications. We are well-positioned to develop a smart
version of our Center’s A-CHESS digital therapeutic by embedding our lapse prediction model into an existing
version of our digital therapeutic that already has sensing capabilities. However, we must first determine how
best to provide model feedback to patients so that they use this information and follow its recommendations. In
this application, we propose to optimize feedback from our lapse prediction model (via daily engagement
messages) both to increase risk-relevant engagement with Smart A-CHESS and to improve clinical outcomes
over six months among 416 participants with moderate to severe AUD. Following the Multiphase Optimization
Strategy, we factorially manipulate four candidate components of these daily engagement messages that
convey transparent, individualized, risk-relevant information from our machine learning lapse prediction model to
participants. These message components include: 1) lapse probability, 2) lapse probability change, 3) important
model features, and 4) a risk-relevant module recommendation. These components use output that would be
available from any machine learning lapse prediction model such that conclusions about the impact of these
components on engagement can generalize beyond our specific machine learning model. Similarly,
engagement messages including these message components could be used in any smart digital therapeutic for
AUD, allowing conclusions to generalize to current and future variants of smart digital therapeutics for AUD. At
the conclusion of the grant period, we will also deliver this optimized smart digital therapeutic as a tangible
product and model for how to embed sensing and machine learning into other existing digital therapeutics."

Glycogen is the largest soluble macromolecule in the cell and serves as a critical energy store in tissues. Co-
ordinated actions by multiple enzymes control regular branching, radial spherical growth of the molecule
ensuring the solubility, which is critical for tissue homeostasis. Regulatory enzymes of the glycogenesis
process includes at least three E3 ubiquitin ligases, dedicated to securing glycogen’s spherical architecture.
Absence of any of them leads to a glycogen structure akin to the insoluble starch amylopectin (now called
polyglucosans). This process of forming polyglucosans is called amylopectinosis. Polyglucosans tend to
aggregate producing insoluble deposits called polyglucosan bodies (PB). At the tissue level, precipitated PBs
lead to untreatable pathologies such as fatal cardiomyopathy (in heart), disabling skeletal-myopathy (muscle),
motor neuron loss (central nervous system) and neurodegeneration (brain). How deficiencies of each of these
ubiquitin ligases (or their interacting proteins) and through what substrates and pathways, result in the
derangement of glycogen structure is not known. In the current proposal, the PI proposes to work with Linear
Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC) to identify its role in glycogen solubility control. LUBAC is a multi-
protein complex composed of two E3 ubiquitin ligases – RBCK1, HOIP and an adaptor protein SHARPIN.
LUBAC-deficient patients exhibit PBs in different organs, especially skeletal and cardiac muscle resulting in
myopathy and cardiomyopathy with heart failure. This emphasizes LUBAC’s important role in glycogen
metabolism. To date, glycogen metabolism related LUBAC substrate(s) and associated molecular mechanisms
are not known. Utilizing newly created mouse models, cell lines and novel approaches, the proposed work
tests the central hypothesis that LUBAC downregulates the activity of glycogen synthase (GS) and
ubiquitinates longer less-branched glycogen chains to keep the glycogen soluble. Aim 1 of the research uses
two newly created mouse models of LUBAC deficiency to understand Rbck1’s glycogen association.
Furthermore, to understand the mechanisms of amylopectinosis, the PI investigates the influence of glycogen
phosphate, and muscle/brain cell specificity for PB accumulation. In Aim 2, utilizing newly created
overexpression cell lines and mouse models, a detailed mechanistic pathway by which Rbck1 deficiency
results in high GS activity is tested. Additionally, aim 2 by using a novel in-vivo approach, tests the possibility of
Rbck1 directly ubiquitinating long, precipitation-prone glycogen chains. Finally, in aim 3, using novel cell
models and quantitative proteomics, the proposal identifies additional pathways/substrates for GS activation.
Taken together, the proposed aims comprehensively study LUBAC’s function in glycogen solubility with novel
understandings of its role in amylopectinosis. Deeper understandings of LUBAC mediated control of glycogen
metabolism will not only provide new insights towards developing a treatment for a fatal rare condition, but also
have implications in other common disease research such as cancers and Alzheimer’s disease where both
glycogen metabolism and LUBAC are often dysregulated."
10933516,"This proposal entitled “Development of EEG/MEG Source Reconstruction with Fast Multipole Method” will
address the currently unmet need for significantly more accurate, near real-time EEG/MEG source

10941284,"There is a critical need for new protein crystallization methods that are more successful and require less labor,
time, and resources. Lack of straightforward methods to successfully crystallize any protein of interest signifi-
cantly hinders study of molecular disease mechanisms and the development of effective treatments. This lack
of effective treatments for many diseases forces them to be addressed instead with costly symptom management
programs. Over the past four years, we have investigated TELSAM, a novel polymer-forming protein crystalliza-
tion chaperone. TELSAM carrier proteins can be genetically fused to disease proteins, drug targets, and bioen-
gineered proteins. In low pH crystallization conditions, TELSAM-target protein fusions polymerize, and the re-
sulting polymers zipper up to form crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction and atomic resolution structure determi-
nation. TELSAM fusion readily forms crystals of 90% of proteins of interest (a stark improvement over the 30%
crystallization rate of traditional methods) and routinely at protein concentrations of 1 mg/mL (promising to enable
the structure determination of proteins that can only be produced in minute quantities). TELSAM fusion crystal-
lography thus has the potential to revolutionize the small molecule and biologic therapeutic industries by accel-
erating structure determination steps, currently a bottleneck. For TELSAM to realize this potential, academic and
industrial structure biologists need 1) experimentally validated guiding principles for the use of TELSAM, 2) a
sufficient number of successful use cases to demonstrate general efficacy, and 3) demonstration of the applica-
tions and limits of TELSAM fusion crystallization. Thus far we have rigorously investigated the guiding principles
for TELSAM’s use and begun to demonstrate its usefulness with proteins relevant in human disease. Our goals
for the next five years are to rigorously address the above three needs and broadly disseminate our findings to
the structural biology community. The overall vision of our research program is focused on pushing the limits of
protein engineering and structure determination fields while at the same time developing undergraduate and
graduate students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, into excellent biochemists. We do this
by putting them at the front lines of groundbreaking research. Both undergraduate and graduate students in our
group participate in all parts of scientific inquiry, including reagent preparation, experiment design and execution,
data collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation and presentation at national and international meetings.
The proposed research is significant because it will accelerate the successful structure determination of a greater
number and variety of biotechnology and disease-relevant proteins, drugs, and biologics, ultimately leading to
new biotechnology tools, more effective disease treatments, and reduced healthcare costs."
10938142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shigella is a leading cause of diarrhea and associated mortality among children under 5 years of age in low-
and middle-income countries. Targeted antibiotic treatment of Shigella diarrhea may effectively improve
outcomes across diverse settings, but current syndromic treatment guidelines and an inability to diagnose
Shigella at the point-of-care result in underuse of active antibiotics for most cases. At the same time,
overtreatment of viral and parasitic diarrhea episodes contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The goal of this
project is to increase appropriate treatment of Shigella while limiting antimicrobial resistance by characterizing
the contributions of inappropriately treated Shigella to poor diarrhea outcomes in a high mortality setting,
evaluating novel biomarker-based strategies to identify Shigella, and designing population-level interventions
to target antibiotic treatment to Shigella and decrease total antibiotic use. The hypothesis of this study is that
appropriate identification and treatment of Shigella could prevent poor diarrhea outcomes and reduce antibiotic
use for diarrhea among children in low-resource settings. We will enroll a prospective cohort of children
hospitalized with diarrhea in Haydom, Tanzania and estimate the impact of Shigella on death and
rehospitalization, diarrhea duration, and child growth. We will further evaluate whether those impacts are
mitigated by treatment with antibiotics expected to be active for Shigella. Next, we will evaluate the
performance of fecal inflammatory biomarkers to identify shigellosis cases in the cohort, incorporating the
biomarkers into clinical prediction algorithms for Shigella diarrhea. We will further characterize biomarker
dynamics and assess their generalizability in an existing cohort of children enriched for shigellosis in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. Finally, we will model the impact of population-level interventions to target antibiotic treatment to
Shigella on diarrhea outcomes and antibiotic use to determine which strategies would be most effective to
prevent the poor outcomes of Shigella and reduce antibiotic use for diarrhea overall. The hypothetical
interventions will target Shigella based on etiology, clinical syndrome, fecal inflammatory biomarkers, and/or
season, and will be pre-specified or optimized using machine learning. The research team includes leading
epidemiologists in enteric infectious diseases with expertise in molecular diagnostics, large field studies in
Haydom and Dhaka, and epidemiologic methods in causal inference and machine learning. This study will
address key knowledge gaps around antibiotic treatment decisions for diarrhea in low-resource settings,
specifically by characterizing outcomes that could be prevented by the targeted treatment of Shigella and by
evaluating resource-efficient strategies to identify shigellosis at the point-of-care. This work will build an
evidence-base for precision public health interventions that could reduce global diarrhea morbidity and
mortality while limiting antimicrobial resistance."
10925058,"SUMMARY The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope (COH) is a world-class cancer research institution
and cancer hospital with a mission of turning science into practical benefit through exquisite care, innovative
research, and vital education focused on eliminating cancer and diabetes. Increases in cancer incidence and
rising treatment costs highlight a need to advance cancer research through the growth of a diverse, well-trained
workforce. We propose an institution-wide, 10-week research experience for undergraduates focused on cancer,
aging, and metabolism, called the Cancer Aging and Metabolism research experience Program (CAMP). The
CAMP R25 is committed to training future scientific leaders who have the skills to develop novel technologies
and translate them into the clinic. CAMP will provide a focused, mentored research experience by matching
undergraduate trainees (CAMPers) with mentor-researchers from three thematic areas: Cancer Aging, Cancer
Metabolism, and Clinical Research. Each summer, CAMP will enable 20 CAMPers, selected via local and
nationwide searches, to participate in research that spans the arc of cancer research, from basic to bedside.
CAMPers will select from among 30 experienced COH Mentors who have a track record of mentoring students
with diverse interests and backgrounds. Principles of responsible conduct of research and rigor and
reproducibility will be taught by faculty. Hands-on laboratory research and auxiliary activities will be enhanced
by journal clubs, distinguished speaker seminars, and weekly CAMPer research presentations, as well as an
end-of-summer poster session. In addition, to address local community needs, and to bolster the pipeline for
undergraduates to thrive as future cancer researchers, we will also pilot a school-year program in which five
spots will be reserved yearly for motivated STEM students from a nearby, regional comprehensive public
university: California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH), a minority-serving institution. Faculty from
COH and CSUDH have collaborated to design this program to extend the summer CAMP experience into the
academic year. The CAMP administrative structure includes highly qualified Directors and an Associate Director,
Internal and External Advisory Committees, and Recruitment/Admission, Curriculum Development, and
Assessment/Tracking Committees. This request for funding is justified by our long record of hosting successful
and creative summer programs that include local students from disadvantaged groups, the relevance of our
training experience to cancer research, the experience of our Mentors, the outstanding commitment of COH to
training, an authentic partnership between regional institutions, and the presence of a specific gap in federal
funding for undergraduates in the training continuum that spans elementary school to postgraduate education."
10928434,"RESOURCE CORE ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the UNC CCCR is to enhance the design and conduct of clinical studies in Rheumatic and
Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMDs) with a focus on osteoarthritis (OA), a particular strength of our research
community. Unfortunately, RMDs remain a major burden to patients and society. Many RMDs are rare, and
even those that are common, such as OA, are so heterogeneous that no effective therapies have yet been
identified. Improved understanding of subgroups within RMDs, and individualized management targeted to
these groups, is needed to improve the health of our patents. The proposed Resource Core will provide
critical services around advanced phenotyping and precision medicine in RMDs, as well as a new, high
value dataset, to our research community. The aims for this new proposal are directly informed by
experience in our current, highly successful CCCR, the needs of the field, and a needs assessment of our
research community. Aim 1 will allow development and characterization of a high value, real-world dataset for
advanced, large scale phenotyping and precision medicine research in collaboration with two partner CCCRs.
In Aim 2, we will continue to provide consultative services for phenotyping and precision medicine analyses for
our research community in OA and other RMDs as we have successfully done in the current CCCR.
Recognizing the need for additional training and education in these areas for early and established
investigators, we will work to enhance educational opportunities around real-world big data in RMDs in Aim 3,
with a focus on inter-disciplinary collaboration. A key aspect of the success of our CCCR to date has been
interaction and collaboration among methodologists learning RMD science and among RMD clinical
researchers learning from methodologists, leading to overall better science. The proposed Resource Core will
meet the needs of our research community and provide services that are both unique and necessary to
enhance and stimulate research in phenotyping and precision medicine for OA and other RMDs. We have
engaged in a collaborative process to develop this proposal and will continue to engage across our community
and other CCCRs. We will leverage existing data and classification pipelines, adding value to these while
building on this foundation with our group’s sophisticated methodologies and extensive content area expertise.
The renewed UNC CCCR Resource Core will utilize innovative strategies to leverage data science and
novel statistical tools to move the field of OA and other RMD phenotyping and precision medicine

10927080,"Project Summary/Abstract
In military culture, high standards are revered, yet negative aspects of overcontrol are often overlooked.
Overcontrol manifests as rigid behavior, cognitive inflexibility, and a strong need for perfection. It is
predominantly seen in obsessive-compulsive (OC) spectrum disorders, especially OC Personality Disorder
(OCPD). On the surface, overcontrolled individuals seem composed, but internally they are emotionally
turbulent. Their inclination to set high expectations for others often causes interpersonal tension straining
social bonds. When grappling with mental health challenges, overcontrolled individuals, often endure with
limited social support, resulting in more dire consequences. For example, Veterans exhibiting OC spectrum
traits are particularly susceptible to trauma-induced anger and have a heightened risk of suicide.
Treatments enhancements are urgently needed to improve interpersonal functioning, quality of life and mitigate
suicide risk these vulnerable Veterans. Neuromodulation adjunctive to psychotherapy is a promising option.
Key obstacles, however, impede the development of circuit-based treatments tailored to this phenotype: 1)
limited validation of existing associations between interpersonal functioning and OCPD in a broader,
overcontrolled sample, 2) the absence of a unified, transdiagnostic circuit model of overcontrol, and 3) robust
methods for tracking gradual changes in individuals’ functioning throughout the course of treatment.
This pilot project will develop methods to address these knowledge gaps. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the
feasibility of our recruitment strategy and evaluate interpersonal functioning in a cohort of trauma-exposed
Veterans exhibiting overcontrolled traits; 2) Test the feasibility and acceptability of a three-session, weekly fMRI
protocol focused on the circuitry of overcontrol, while evaluating within-subject reliability of observed neural
correlates; 3) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a three-week protocol for remote monitoring of weekly
variance in socio-occupational functioning and emotional regulation.
This pilot initiates a multi-year research endeavor to reduce suicide risk by enhancing care for Veterans with
OCPD-like overcontrol. Our venture aims to position VHA Rehabilitation R&D as a leader in precision medicine
for those at risk of suicide due to cognitive overcontrol, perfectionism, and OC-spectrum disorders comorbid
with PTSD, anger, or depression. Our proposal aligns with the RFA's call for innovative suicide interventions,
including transformative neuromodulation strategies."
10937607,"Proteoglycans harboring heparan sulfate (HS) chains are widely found on cell surfaces and in extracellular
matrices where they interact with growth factors, receptors, morphogens, and extracellular matrix components
and play critical roles in processes such as cell survival, division, migration, differentiation, pathogen binding,
and cancer development. HS biosynthesis is a complex process involving initial formation of a linker glycan on
proteoglycan core proteins, priming and extension of the HS chains’ polymer backbone, and subsequent
modification by epimerization, and N- and O-sulfation. The extension of the polymer backbone is a crucial step
in HS synthesis, facilitated by the EXT1-EXT2 heterodimeric co-polymerase complex. Homozygous defects in
either of these proteins cause embryonic lethality, and heterozygous loss of function results in hereditary multiple
exostoses (HME) characterized by clinical features in bone, cartilage, ligaments, and subepithelial layers,
including the formation of benign cartilage-capped tumors. We recently solved the structure of the human EXT1-
2 heterodimeric co-polymerase in complex with substrate analogs and performed complementary enzymatic
studies on both wild type and mutant enzymes to gain insights into HS chain synthesis. EXT1 and EXT2 form
an obligate heterocomplex of the two homologous proteins. Each protein contains two separate predicted
catalytic domains, yet only one of the two domains are active in each protein suggesting that the monomers
share catalytic functions. We also discovered an interaction between EXT1-2 and the HS priming enzyme
EXTL3. These studies raise important new questions about how HS synthesis is achieved in vivo and the nature
and pathology of HME mutations. The prior accomplishments set the stage for our present aims. Aim 1 will test
hypotheses regarding EXT1-2 active site residues by probing their roles in substrate recognition and catalysis
and the roles of divergent residues in the inactive homologous domains that restrict catalysis. Aim 2 will test
hypotheses on how HME mutations lead to EXT1-2 loss of function and how haploinsufficiency leads to HS loss
and pathology. Aim 3 will test hypotheses that interactions with proteoglycan core proteins and upstream
biosynthetic enzymes contribute to efficient HS synthesis. Thus, this research will advance our understanding of
HS biology and its roles in health and disease. Unraveling the mechanisms governing HS backbone synthesis
will shed light on the molecular basis of HS-mediated cellular processes and pave the way for future development
of targeted interventions."
10937869,"Project Abstract: Pediatric HGGs comprise glioblastoma [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)],
anaplastic astrocytoma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and collectively are the most
common malignant brain tumors in children. Patients with HGGs have a very dismal prognosis,
with <5% 5-year survival for GBM patients and a median survival of <1 year for patients with
DIPG, pointing to an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Chimeric antigen
receptors (CARs) are engineered cell surface molecules that combine the specificity of
antibodies with the downstream signaling of effector cells such as T cells. The expression of
CARs on T cells has shown enormous promise by effectively treating malignancies by directly
killing them. However, CAR-T cell therapy is often hampered by the inability of T cells to
penetrate solid tumors and the inhibitory tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently there has
been great interest in developing CAR-macrophages against solid tumors to improve phagocytic
activity and antigen presentation of macrophages against tumors. Here we hypothesize that this
distinctive proficiency of macrophages and microglia to infiltrate malignant brain tumors provides
a unique opportunity to exploit their phagocytic properties by engineering the activation of these
professional phagocytes using exogenous expression of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CARs)
targeted towards a brain tumor-specific antigen. In Aim 1 we will engineer the most effective
CAR-expressing phagocyte for efficient targeting of pHGG and demonstrate the superior
efficacy of B7H3 CAR phagocyte therapy in combination with blockage of phagocytosis
checkpoint (anti-CD47) immunotherapy in humanized xenograft models of pHGG. In Aim 2 we
will Identify the most efficient cell type that can function as a CAR-expressing phagocyte that
can most efficiently traffic to the brain and target pHGG tumors in combination with blockage of
phagocytosis checkpoint (anti-CD47) immunotherapy and finally in Aim 3 we will study the in
vivo biology of CAR-macrophages and its effect on the TME in syngeneic mouse models of
high-grade pediatric glioma."
10940545,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In response to NOT-AG-23-031, we propose to use the same approach/technique as in the technology-driven
parental application to analyze postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from the spectrum of
Alzheimer’s (AD) subjects. Classical single-cell Omics (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Cut&Tag) provide information at
individual gene/locus level, but the sparse coverage of each cell (particularly for histone modifications profiling
using Cut&Tag) limits the predictive power. The imaging approach proposed here, while not resolving
individual loci, captures the integral cellular state and the dominant changes in chromatin and epigenetic
topography (e.g. ImAge captures the dominant aging changes). Although the importance of cellular
heterogeneity in AD has been recognized, most efforts are focused on single cell RNA-sequencing. We
propose to focus on the single cell epigenetic topography, taking advantage of a powerful imaging-based
chromatin and epigenetic analysis technique recently pioneered by the PI laboratory. Preserving the original
framework focused on applying novel imaging-based technology, we will quantitate single cell heterogeneity in
AD spectrum brains and associate trajectories of epigenetic changes in major brain cell types with gene
expression and cognitive decline of AD. Further, we will determine the connection between aging trajectories
during normal brain aging and the pathological progression of AD. We propose to map epigenetic changes
across 150 brain samples of AD spectrum with corresponding gene expression and functional readouts to
reveal the correlations of epigenetic and expression changes with cognitive decline and AD progression. First,
this will enable an accurate assessment of single cell chromatin and epigenetic heterogeneity in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from the spectrum of AD and normal young adult brains. Second, we
will interrogate unbiased emergence trajectories and examine their correlation with 80 functional readouts
available for each brain sample. Third, we will explore the relationship between the normal aging process and
AD progression. We will deliver the proof of feasibility and a unique single cell level epigenetic dataset that will
advance AD/ADRD research. The available matching skeletal muscle samples and associated omics datasets
could be integrated into the analysis to compare and contrast the trajectories of normal aging and AD
progression. Although this proposal employs bulk RNA-seq data, a powerful single cell RNA-seq approach
becomes increasingly available and will be integrated in future studies. The availability of PBMC from a subset
of the AD cohort enables us in the future to connect the above dependencies to epigenetic signatures in
PBMC, which could be assayed longitudinally and used for early diagnosis of AD."
10938127,"Project Summary/Abstract
Overview: The methylation of DNA and histone tail residues tunes chromatin structure to control gene
expression programs. Methionine supplies one-carbon (1C) units for this S-adenosyl-methionine
(SAM)-mediated methylation. These 1C units can come 1) directly from dietary methionine or 2)
indirectly from serine, glycine or another 1C donor to regenerate methionine. Both 1C metabolism and
this epigenetic landscape are critical in the development of and for healthy maintenance of
differentiated tissues. Importantly, a common hallmark of aging, cancer and other diseases is altered
levels of these amino acids that provide 1C units and/or DNA and histone methylation.
Goals: Critically, what is not understood is how homeostasis of SAM metabolism is achieved across
mammalian tissue types and in proliferating cells through the dynamic interplay between production
from available nutrients versus consumption by methylation reactions. Further, it is not known how
much SAM consumption is required to support epigenetic regulation. Our objective is to apply modern
quantitative methods to understand the nutrient sources of the 1C units used for SAM synthesis and
the contribution of SAM consumption to global DNA and histone methylation. This will be accomplished
by addressing the following questions: 1) What are SAM production and consumption rates? We will
use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) paired with stable isotope tracing to measure
SAM turnover fluxes to understand how SAM levels are sustained in each major tissue types in vivo
and in proliferating cells in vitro. 2) What are the nutrient sources of the 1C units used for SAM synthesis
upon altered methionine and 1C unit availability? Using tracing, we will quantify contribution of the 1C
unit for SAM synthesis from exogenous methionine versus endogenous production from other nutrients.
3) How much SAM consumption supports DNA and histone methylation? We will adapt established
approaches in quantitative metabolic analysis to measure rates of global SAM-consuming methylation
of DNA and histones. 4) How does SAM availability alter DNA and histone methylation dynamics? We
will measure the influence of altered SAM production on DNA and histone methylation fluxes.
Vision: Through the studies proposed in this R35 MIRA grant, our team will advance quantitative tools
to interrogate novel roles for 1C metabolism in controlling SAM homeostasis and its influence on the
epigenetic landscape across tissue types and in proliferating cells. This comprehensive knowledge will
provide fundamental insights into how metabolic homeostasis integrates supply of available nutrients
to support epigenetic-driven gene expression. Such knowledge is critical for developing therapeutic
strategies to manipulate SAM metabolism in diseases with aberrant changes in epigenetic methylation."

CANDIDATE: I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Ross Levine in the Human Oncology and
Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. My previous PhD research offered me the
opportunity to develop the experimental and computational skills necessary to assess cellular crosstalk in the
tumor microenvironment. My current research extends these skills to the study of mutation order, and
oncogene-dependency in subpopulations of leukemic cells. To gain insights into these processes I developed
novel, multi-recombinase mouse models of oncogene-activation and dependency as well as new lineage tracing
tools that allow for functional interrogation of clonal evolution. My proposed research will provide a strong
foundation for independent research following the K99 phase of this grant. My long-term career goal is to
identify molecular mechanisms driving leukemogenesis, including interactions between AML subclones in vivo
and the role of sequential mutational acquisition. To achieve these goals I have developed a career plan that
will 1) bolster my technical skills and scientific scope, 2) improve my presentation and communication skills, 3)
cultivate professional relationships and networking, and 4) prepare me for mentoring future trainees.
RESEARCH: The receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3, is the most commonly mutated gene in acute myeloid
leukemia. Mutations in FLT3 are often found with low variant allele frequency, suggesting these mutations
occur as late, subclonal events. Despite their presence as a minor clone, FLT3 mutations are poor prognostic
markers and the target of several recently approved clinical compounds. These inhibitors lead to some
transient clinical success, yet patients invariably relapse and develop resistant, calling into question the
necessity of FLT3 mutation in disease progression. I aim to determine the dependency of FLT3 mutations in
disease, and propose methods to assess the functional contributions of subclonal mutations to disease
progression. The specific aims are: 1) determining the genomic context for FLT3 oncogene-dependency in
AML, 2) identifying novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in FLT3-driven AML, and 3) investigating the role of
mutation order and clonal crosstalk in leukemic disease.
ENVIRONMENT: The Levine laboratory is a part of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program
(HOPP) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a state of the art cancer research institute. The Levine lab
is also a member of the Center for Epigenetic Research, and the primary mentor Dr. Levine, is the head of the
Center for Hematologic Malignancies. These affiliations provide a rich set of collaborative, technical and

10906943,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite the more than decades long downward trend in HIV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID),
there is cause for alarm due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the instability the response will likely cause,
particularly among vulnerable populations. COVID-19 will disrupt access to the very interventions that led to
declining HIV incidence among PWID, including harm reduction services and antiretroviral therapy (ART). As a
result, COVID-19 threatens to undo efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US. Several recent HIV outbreaks in
the US that resulted from increasing use and exposure to synthetic opioids highlights how the COVID-19
pandemic is being layered onto an existing public health emergency in the US that is disproportionately
affecting PWID populations. It is unknown how the intersection of the opioid crisis and COVID-19 pandemic will
interact to impact the health of PWID in the short term and whether it will create conditions sufficient to
destabilize PWID populations enough to support the resurgence of HIV. Research is therefore urgently needed
to examine the immediate impact and downstream consequences of COVID-19 on PWID. The objective of this
proposal is therefore to determine the potential of HIV resurgence among PWID due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on individual and network factors. Our central hypothesis is that COVID-19 will increase
individual and social network instability sufficiently to promote HIV outbreaks among PWID populations. We
propose the following three specific aims: 1) To examine threats to psychosocial, economic and behavioral
stability and HIV control among an existing cohort of PWID during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) To understand
social and drug-use network stability during and following the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) To estimate the
potential for HIV resurgence among PWID as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve these aims, we
will leverage ongoing behavioral, laboratory and clinical data collection within the AIDS Linked to the
IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort and collect new longitudinal social network data and qualitative data to
characterize the disruption due to COVID-19. Importantly, we will advance our understanding of how individual
substance use, HIV-related risk behaviors, and social network characteristics have changed as a result of
COVID-19, relationships that are entirely uncharacterized. The evidence generated from this proposed
research will inform the ongoing design of interventions targeted to PWID, not only to prevent emerging HIV
outbreaks, but to support efforts to improve the health of PWID in the context of disruptions to care and
services. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have prolonged impacts on PWID due to continued
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in urban areas and continual cycling of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
until more effective prevention and treatment strategies are available, the research proposed here will have
immediate and substantial impact on practice."

CAREER GOAL: My long-term career goal is to lead an independent program of research that will leverage
advancements in neuroimaging, discoveries from translational animal models, and robust clinical assessments
to identify early pathology in brain development during critical periods in infancy when intervention can make the
greatest impact. Ultimately, I aim to improve outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs),
with a focus on Down Syndrome (DS), by contributing to work that will expand our understanding of early brain
development and inform personalized, targeted interventions and non-invasive markers for treatment efficacy.
RESEARCH PROJECT: Recent discoveries of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic drainage have
highlighted that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is critically important for maintaining brain health by clearing
neuroinflammatory proteins (e.g., amyloid-beta, Aβ), whereas impaired CSF flow slows the clearance of Aβ and
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Approximately 50% of children with DS will
develop early-onset Alzheimer’s, occurring decades earlier than the general population. However, our
understanding of CSF dynamics has been limited to studies in aging adults, whereas clinical studies in infants
with NDDs (such as DS) are lacking. During infancy, the brain undergoes rapid growth and may be particularly
vulnerable to CSF abnormalities, but there is a critical gap in understanding CSF physiology during this sensitive
period and how it relates to the early brain development of NDDs. Given that children with DS are at a
substantially greater risk for Alzheimer’s, there is an urgent need to study CSF dynamics in infants with DS to
identify early, non-invasive biomarkers of disorder severity and progression and to guide personalized, targeted
treatments. We aim to utilize non-invasive MRI methods in infants to evaluate three measures of CSF physiology
(extra-axial CSF volume, perivascular space size, and CSF flow); their relationships to clinical manifestations of
DS; and compared to related NDDs (autism and Fragile X syndrome). Specific Aims: (1) Elucidate trajectories
of CSF dynamics in infants with DS and contrast with other NDDs to determine specificity; and (2) determine the
relationships between CSF dynamics and (2a) neural and (2b) clinical features of DS and related NDDs.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT: This K01 award will provide me with the necessary cross-disciplinary training in CSF
imaging, CSF pathophysiology, and early neural and behavioral features of DS and NDDs to launch my
independent career. Mentorship team includes clinical and preclinical experts in CSF abnormalities in NDDs,
glymphatic system, and CSF and brain imaging in infants: Co-mentors: Drs. Mark Shen (Dept. of Psychiatry and

10906751,"Project Summary. Compulsive behaviors, or unwanted, repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing distress, are a core feature
of obsessive-compulsive (OC) spectrum disorders, but appear across a very broad spectrum of psychological conditions.
Compulsions suggest a failure of goal-directed behavior to override habitual behaviors “stamped in” through repeated
practice and short-term distress reduction. In OC patients, this “habit hypothesis” is supported by behavioral data
suggesting OC patients struggle to override habits even after their functional value has been negated and show deficits in
markers of flexible goal-directed cognition. Convergent neuroimaging evidence suggests abnormalities in a cortico-
striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit. However, human studies linking CSTC function and neurocognitive disruptions
to compulsive behaviors have been limited by a correlational design (e.g., cross-sectional group comparisons), leaving
critical unresolved questions regarding the causal mechanisms of compulsive behaviors in humans. By contrast, recent
advances in animal models of OC behavior have allowed unprecedented experimental manipulation of targeted brain
circuits and provide compelling evidence for a causal role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in compulsive behavior.
Optogenetic studies have established that activating an orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pathway induces compulsive grooming
behavior in mice, while disrupting activity in a similar region blocked habit formation and expression in rats.
Convergently, our preliminary findings from an R21-funded translational study suggest that de-potentiating the OFC in
human patients (via continuous Theta Burst Stimulation; cTBS) may lead to improved capacity to resist idiographic
compulsions, both immediately and at 1-week follow-up. However, critical questions remain regarding the translation of
causal mechanisms in animal work to humans, and specifically, whether synergistic behavioral training in `habit
override', delivered in a post-TBS window-of-opportunity, might provide a critical contextual manipulation that tips the
balance towards a capacity for habit override in the service of goals.
 In this experiment, 200 individuals with chronic compulsive behaviors will be randomized to complete a single visit
involving two serially spaced blocks of cTBS, which creates up to a 2-hour window18-20 of OFC depotentiation, or sham
TBS. In a fully crossed (2x2) design, during a post-TBS window of opportunity, participants will complete our previously
developed computer-based `habit override' task or a sham variant of the training task. We aim to: 1) Verify acute effects
of cTBS on OFC function by examining acute markers of OFC activity and CSTC connectivity during the acute window
of brain modulation; 2) Test whether the efficacy of cTBS on behavior is amplified by simultaneous `habit override'
training by examining interacting effects of TBS and habit override training on markers of habit and compulsion
vulnerability and flexible goal-directed cognition—measured both immediately and 1-week post-TBS. Exploratory tests
will focus on relationships between neural and behavioral outcomes across individuals. As a precursor to mechanistic
intervention development, we will clarify the contextual neurocognitive conditions that moderate the OFC's role in
compulsion vulnerability, informing integrative theoretical models and the development of novel treatments."

The cornea is highly susceptible to injury from chemotoxic vapors. Long-term prognosis after severe corneal
injury is poor, involving impaired vision, progressive corneal decompensation and neovascularization. In
particular, ocular injuries caused by the formation of chemical adducts between biological molecules and highly
reactive organic toxic industrial materials (TIMs) remain poorly characterized. The ocular threat caused by
organic TIMs was illustrated in Bhopal, India in 1984, when the accidental release of methyl isocyanate resulted
in over 3,700 deaths and 500,000 casualties, with 4,000 survivors suffering permanently disabling ocular
pathophysiologies such as corneal scars, opacities and cataracts. In this proposal we will characterize the dose-
dependent, acute and long-term effects of diverse, highly reactive organic TIMs on corneal injury and recovery.
The approach integrates in vivo methods developed to study corneal toxicities elicited by the archetypal vesicant
sulfur mustard with ex vivo approaches pioneered to study the corneal effects of exposure to diverse chemotoxic
agents. We will focus on TIMs that are widely availability in large quantities and thus pose a large-scale
chemotoxic threat following accidental or purposeful release. In the first aim, we will integrate the ex vivo depth-
of-injury exposure model with our well-described vapor cap exposure system to determine TIM vapor doses that
produce mild and severe corneal lesions in isolated rabbit eyes. In the second aim, we will translate dose
estimates to in vivo eyes in rabbits and study molecular, clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms of corneal
injury over 8 weeks. In the final aim, we will compare and contrast (a) acute changes in gene expression in
human and rabbit eyes exposed to superficial and penetrating doses of three TIMs and (b) study longitudinal
changes in gene expression in vivo following exposure to penetrating doses of 3 TIMs. By studying the toxic
effects of diverse reactive TIMs, we will develop a threat profile based on dose, tissue-specific cytotoxicities,
pathophysiological progression and efficacy of available therapeutics. In addition to identifying toxicological
mechanisms and expanding our understanding of chemotoxic injury in the cornea, these studies will inform risk
assessments and exposure management plans for these highly toxic organic TIMs and related chemicals."
10906756,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Delays and missed opportunities for timely treatment contribute significantly to disparities in cervical cancer mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs). Cervical cancer is one of the most common female cancers globally, with approximately 90% of cases and deaths occurring in LMICs, particularly those with high rates of HIV. This global disparity is partly driven by successful efforts in HICs to implement evidence-based practices focused on early detection and timeliness of care. In Botswana, a LMIC with an extremely high prevalence of HIV and cervical cancer, we identified substantial delays in cancer care from diagnosis to treatment, driven by a myriad of individual- and system-level barriers. To date, most of the implementation and cancer control research in Botswana and other LMICs has focused on prevention and screening, with limited focus on treatment following diagnosis of HIV-associated malignancies. As such, there is a critical need to identify effective strategies to ensure timely care, and to understand contextual factors that shape the response to strategies. Without this fundamental knowledge, cervical cancer will remain a public health crisis in Botswana and other LMICs. To help fill this critical gap, this study will test the effectiveness of adaptive strategies on timely treatment adoption using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design and evaluate contextual mechanisms contributing to the success or failure of each adaptive strategy using qualitative comparative analysis. The adaptive strategies are designed to target individual- and system-level determinants identified in our preliminary data, including delayed communication of results, individual and structural barriers to accessing treatment, and suboptimal care coordination between referring and cancer treatment clinics, and are supported by systematic evidence of the effectiveness of nudge strategies in clinical care. The primary implementation outcome will be adoption, defined as the initiation of treatment within 90 days. Secondary implementation outcomes include fidelity (i.e., completion of recommended treatment), reach, acceptability, implementation costs, and cancer and HIV-related clinical outcomes. The rationale for the study is that enhancing coordination, communication, and navigation through centralized outreach will both increase timely treatment adoption and be scalable and sustainable after the project is completed. This innovative study responds directly to the call by the National Cancer Institute to develop and test implementation strategies in cancer control in LMICs. Furthermore, the highly efficient design enables the comparison of different adaptive strategies within one study, helping to advance an understanding of the minimum level of intervention needed to improve and sustain cancer control in lower resource settings. If successful, these strategies can be easily translated to address other areas of cancer control. The long-term goal of this project is to decrease cervical cancer mortality in LMICs by developing and implementing effective and sustainable strategies."
10906852,"Title: De-Implementing Fall Prevention Alarms in Hospitals
Inpatient falls result in significant physical and economic burdens to patients (increased injury
and mortality rates and decreased quality of life) as well as to medical organizations (increased
lengths of stay, medical care costs, and litigation). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) considers falls with injury a “never event”— an error in medical care that
indicates a real problem in the safety and credibility of a health care institution. Hospitals are no
longer reimbursed for extra costs incurred in the diagnosis and management of inpatient fall-
related injuries. Thus, because patient falls are common, costly and interpreted as poor care
quality, hospitals are highly incentivized to prevent them.
Alarm systems are designed to reduce falls by alerting staff when patients attempt to leave a
bed or chair without assistance. There is now strong evidence from our group and others that
alarms are ineffective as a fall prevention maneuver in hospitals. Despite this, our group has
recently shown that more than one-third of hospital patients are undergoing fall prevention alarm
monitoring. In nursing homes, CMS regulates the use of fall prevention alarms as it does
physical restraints. Instructions to nursing home surveyors state these devices should be used
only when medically necessary and continuously reevaluated.
Guided by the Choosing Wisely De-implementation Framework, this project will generate a
generalizable approach using coaching and tailored de-implementation strategies to reduce use
of fall prevention alarms in hospitals. We will conduct a hybrid II implementation study in 30
medical or medical-surgical units from US non-federal hospitals participating in the National
Database of Nursing Quality Indicators. Findings from this study could also support future trials
aimed at de-implementing low-quality alarm use in other care settings with known high fall rates
(e.g., stroke care, cancer care). Evaluation of high versus low intensity coaching addresses an
urgent need to evaluate use of tailored strategies and to establish effective thresholds for
coaching within health service settings that have varying resources to support de-
implementation efforts"

 Advancing age is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which is exacerbated by the high
prevalence of obesity in the aged. These disorders are risk factors for age-related diseases associated with
significant morbidity and mortality, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. New
approaches to maintain glucose homeostasis in the aged are therefore urgently needed.
 The objective of the proposed study is to test the ability of diets with reduced levels of isoleucine, valine,
or histidine to reverse diet induced obesity and insulin resistance. We have shown that specifically reducing
levels of either isoleucine, valine, or histidine can rapidly reduce adiposity in diet-induced obese mice, restoring
normal body composition and enhancing insulin sensitivity. Further, we have shown that diets with lower levels
of isoleucine or histidine are associated with reduced body mass index in humans.
 Here, we will determine the degree of restriction of these three amino acids that optimally promotes
metabolic health in diet-induced obese mice and test an optimized amino acid restricted diet for the ability to
reduce adiposity and restore glycemic control in a non-human primate. We will also gain insight into the molecular
mechanisms induced by reduced levels of these dietary amino acids through integrative transcriptomic and
metabolomic analyses of blood, adipose, and skeletal muscle samples from nonhuman primates and from young
and aged mice. Additionally, we will collect samples for future analysis of the role of the epigenome and
microbiome in the response to dietary amino acids. These studies are urgently needed to understand if
manipulation of specific dietary amino acids is a translatable intervention to promote metabolic health and
increase healthspan."

In the US, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to microvascular and
macrovascular complications. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is another common co-morbidity but its
burden in patients with T2D is poorly studied. Although NAFLD affects 50-70% of T2D patients, there is neither
a screening guideline nor established treatment for NAFLD. Besides weight loss, pioglitazone – an old
diabetes drug – is the only drug recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases for
treating NASH, the more progressive form of NAFLD, in patients with T2D. In addition, liraglutide (in phase 2
trials) and obeticholic acid (with phase 3 interim data) appear effective for improving NASH and advanced
fibrosis. At least 4 other drugs (making a total of 5) are undergoing phase 3 trials and up to 50 drugs are in
phase 2 trials. As new drugs become available in the near future, physicians and patients will face difficult
tradeoffs among long-term benefits, risks, and costs. Given the widespread nature of NAFLD in patients with
T2D, screening to identify those with NASH, who are at high-risk of advance liver disease, for early intervention
may help patients live longer with a better quality life. Yet, the lack of comparative effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness analyses of screening for NAFLD has resulted in conflicting clinical guidelines. Choosing the best
treatment and screening strategy for NAFLD is complicated and can be aided by the use of computer-based
models. Unfortunately, existing diabetes models do not include NAFLD, and NAFLD models do not account for
diabetes and its complications. The objective of this study is to develop a computer simulation model of NAFLD
in T2D to estimate its burden, and evaluate treatment and screening options for NASH. Specific aims are: 1)
Develop and validate a microsimulation model of the natural history of NAFLD, including NASH; 2) Estimate
and project the burden of NAFLD-associated liver complications in patients with T2D until 2030; 3) Assess the
cost-effectiveness of treatments for NASH in patients with T2D; and 4) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
screening for NASH in patients with T2D. This proposal builds upon our inter-disciplinary team’s strong
foundation of constructing decision models to assist clinical decision making and studying the epidemiology of
diabetes and NAFLD. Our model will provide a better understanding of a prevalent, important, yet
underappreciated diabetes complication, using an innovative approach to diabetes and liver disease modeling.
The study also establishes the groundwork for future evaluation of new treatment regimens and screening
modalities for patients with T2D and NAFLD, which will advance the prevention and treatment of both diseases
for millions of patients each year."

in academic, governmental, and private sectors; 2) promote scientific opportunities for trainees and early
career investigators to present and discuss their work in a collegial, yet scientifically rigorous environment; and
3) promote and highlight diversity, equity, and inclusivity in the field of Rickettsiology. The 33rd and 34th
meetings will feature a balance of oral presentations from established/junior investigators and trainees,
intermingled with posters from submitted abstracts. To increase cross-disciplinary research, oral sessions will
feature a Plenary Lecture from an accomplished investigator outside the field of rickettsia. Members of the
ASR Scientific Committee and Ambassadors for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will select oral (short)
presentations based on: (i) the quality and originality of the research; and (ii) speakers in universities and
states that have been previously underrepresented at ASR meetings. In all activities, we will emphasize
visibility and inclusion of women, minorities, non-binary, and persons with disabilities, and provide networking
opportunities and promote the visibility of students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty. Mailings, e-
posters, and social media advertisement will highlight the availability of travel awards for attendees from
traditionally underrepresented groups and first-generation students. A website will feature the schedule,
information and registration materials for the meeting, and the ASR will make childcare/family financial support
available to participants. Williamsburg Resort offers summer camps for children, family support services and
disability access to hotel guests. Approximately two hundred attendees representing early career investigators,
mid-career scientists, established researchers, and clinicians from academia, government, and private-sector
laboratories are anticipated to attend. There is no equivalent meeting that focuses exclusively on rickettsial
diseases in the United States of America."

Project Summary
 The ""CeNeuro2024 C. elegans Topic Meeting: Neuronal Development, Aging, Synaptic Function, and
Behavior"" serves as a unique platform for researchers that use C. elegans to address fundamental questions
in neuroscience and neural diseases. C. elegans research has provided critical insights into fundamental and
highly conserved aspects of biology, including neurotransmission, sensory processing, circuit dynamics and
disease. Set to occur biennially at the University of Madison, Wisconsin, this event stands as a cornerstone in
the worm neuroscience community, attracting established leaders, emerging faculty, postdoctoral researchers,
and students from across the globe. Significantly, this conference offers a distinctive arena to (1) Present
leading-edge, unpublished breakthroughs in worm neuroscience; (2) Facilitate verbal and poster presentations
for postdoctoral and graduate scholars, with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented groups; (3)
enable mentorship prospects for new investigators, particularly women and individuals of underrepresented
backgrounds.
Three pivotal themes shape the conference's focus:
Addressing Diversity: The event acknowledges the prevalent scarcity of diversity, particularly gender and
underrepresented groups, within the academic and C. elegans domains. Travel funding will be channeled to
promote the engagement of underrepresented scholars, featuring them as speakers or session chairs, and
fostering diversity and inclusion dialogues with a focus on trainees and junior faculty.
Inclusivity for LMICs: The conference will extend financial support to exceptional trainees and junior faculty
from low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). This initiative seeks to amplify global participation, diversifying
the research realm and nurturing novel cross-cultural collaborations.
Bridging Research Spheres: To bridge the aging and neuroscience research disciplines, the
""CeNeuro2024"" conference will synergize the C. elegans Aging & Metabolism and Neuroscience meetings.
Participants of the former will receive stipends, enabling their attendance at a collaborative session on the
inaugural day of the neurobiology meeting, spotlighting aging, metabolism, and neurodegeneration. Beyond
professional ties, joint activities will encourage personal interactions, fostering a holistic integration of aging
and neuroscience research.
 In conclusion, funding for this conference endeavors to catalyze gender diversity and involve
underrepresented groups, thereby enriching the research community. It also seeks to embrace trainees and
faculty from LMICs to enhance international collaboration. Lastly, the conference strives to seamlessly merge
the realms of aging and neuroscience research for comprehensive advancements. This initiative holds
potential to redefine the contours of knowledge and propel collective efforts towards innovative scientific
achievements."
10938702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The United States faces an unprecedented mental health crisis among children and adolescents. In 2021, 29%
of high school students reported experiencing poor mental health. Almost 60% of female students experienced
persistent feelings of sadness during the past year, and nearly 25% made a suicide plan – an increase of 60%
since 2011. Emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions among children and adolescents
have also risen sharply. Individuals aged 14-18 have rates of ED visits for suicidal ideation that are higher than
any other group and more than twice the national average. In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics,
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Children's Hospital Association jointly declared a
national emergency in child and adolescent mental health.
The Medicaid program can play a critical role in addressing this mental health crisis. Medicaid is the largest
national payer for mental health services and, in 2022, covered 50% of all children and adolescents in the U.S.
Most of these children and adolescents receive care through Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs),
making MCOs a powerful mechanism for addressing the pediatric mental health crisis. However, little is known
about how MCOs and state programs influence mental health care and outcomes for children and adolescents.
The proposed mixed-methods study addresses this gap using the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information
System Analytic Files (TAF), a national Medicaid claims data set that includes comprehensive enrollment and
service utilization claims and detailed information on MCO and providers. These quantitative analyses will be
integrated with qualitative interviews with MCOs, Medicaid administrators, and other stakeholders. Our aims to
seek (1) to characterize MCO structures using latent class analysis; (2) to assess associations between MCO
structures and mental health access and utilization for adolescents with anxiety, depression, and suicide-
related behaviors; (3) to test the implications of MCO exit on mental health access and utilization for
adolescents; and (4) to test the impacts of acute adolescent mental health events on adult caregivers.
The study will also be informed by close coordination with a deployment-focused advisory committee, which
will assist in identifying feasible and scalable policies and processes that can improve access and outcomes
related to child and adolescent mental health. In response to PAR-23-095, our proposed study will identify
policies and factors that affect access, utilization, and outcomes, using large Medicaid claims datasets and
leveraging an existing data management approach to advance our research."
10939992,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cellular communication is a complex interplay of biochemical, biophysical, and bioelectrical signaling. Beyond
well-known neuronal action potentials, various mechanisms of bioelectricity play a pivotal role in most host
processes. Its significance extends to microbial realms, facilitating communication within and between bacterial
species in environmental biofilms. Our preliminary studies, along with others, indicate the potential for
interkingdom bioelectric interactions, particularly between gut microbes and their mammalian hosts. Yet, the
bioelectrical aspect of this interface remains largely unexplored, necessitating innovative tools and dedicated
research. While traditional gut microbiota research has identified correlations between microbial shifts and
diseases, our laboratory aims to delve deeper, uncovering the precise mechanisms of gut-host communication
at the cellular and molecular levels. We plan to harness cutting-edge advancements in gut microbial research,
unique bacterial filament characterization, and pioneering bioelectrical tools to modulate bacterial and host
signals. Intriguingly, certain soil bacteria can thrive on and release electrons directly, bypassing conventional
energy sources. They utilize extracellular electron transfer mechanisms, such as conductive nanowires, to move
electrons into or out of their cells. The role of this mechanism in the competitive landscape of the intestinal
environment remains uncharted. We postulate that bacteria in the mouse gut utilize these conductive nanowires
for successful colonization and to exchange electrical signals with the intestinal barrier, which in turn influences
broader bioelectric signaling in the host. We anticipate that bacteria with nanowires will have a competitive edge
over nanowire-deficient mutants. Our proposal's primary objectives are to characterize the production and
functional implications of these conductive nanowires in human gut microbes. We aim to explore the intricate,
bidirectional interactions between the gut microbe and its host. We believe these interactions have far-reaching
implications, influencing not just the gut but also the immune, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Deciphering
these interactions could pave the way for innovative bioelectrical therapeutic strategies for both intestinal and
systemic conditions."
10940608,"Neurons lack substantial energy stores and thus their function is critically dependent on the timely delivery of
energy substrates in the blood. Precise control of brain blood flow is therefore essential for brain health. However,
the exact mechanisms through which cerebral hemodynamics are regulated remain unclear. Furthering our
understanding of this control is critical, as it is increasingly appreciated that disruption of brain blood flow is one
of the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders and may be a key contributory
factor to disease progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of
brain blood flow control may reveal novel and much needed targets for therapeutic interventions.
Thin-strand pericytes are mural cells that reside on brain capillaries deep within the vascular network, interposed
between capillary endothelial cells and astrocytic endfeet. It is thought that thin-strand pericytes contribute to the
control of brain blood flow but a detailed mechanistic understanding of this process is lacking. Based on the
compelling preliminary data in this proposal, we suggest a novel dimension to thin-strand pericyte control of
electrical signaling throughout the vascular network—from capillaries to arterioles—which plays a central role in
blood flow control. Specifically, we identify for the first time a “pericyte chloride clamp” mechanism that
counterbalances hyperpolarizing electrical signaling to precisely control local blood flow. The activity of thin-
strand pericyte calcium-activated chloride channels is central to this mechanism, and these are controlled by
calcium signals generated by membrane voltage-dependent calcium channels and endoplasmic reticulum
calcium release channels. This signaling module is tethered to neuronal activity through the activity of thin-strand
pericyte metabotropic glutamate receptors, activation of which shuts off the pericyte chloride clamp to augment
hyperpolarizing electrical signaling and increase blood flow to the active network.
Using these exciting findings as a springboard, we propose to define the precise mechanisms through which
calcium-activated chloride channels are controlled in thin-strand pericytes, how these channels contribute to the
control of capillary blood flow by shaping electrical signals, and how neuronal activity toggles the pericyte chloride
clamp on and off to regulate local blood flow on a moment-to-moment basis to satisfy fluctuating neuronal energy
needs. Completion of this work may thus identify novel therapeutic targets in thin-strand pericytes and could lay
the groundwork for much needed treatments aimed at protecting or rescuing blood flow in brain disorders with a
vascular component."

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal, treatment-refractory malignancy characterized by
fibroblast-rich stroma. While external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a staple in the current treatment of PDAC,
its therapeutic efficacy is limited by normal tissue toxicities and its inability to target metastatic disease. Targeted
radionuclide therapeutics (TRTs), particularly low-molecular-weight carriers, offer an avenue to improve the
deliverable radiation dose and therapeutic efficacy compared to EBRT by selectively targeting tumors (both
primary and metastatic) and substantially reduce non-target toxicities. The fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP)
is selectively expressed on tumor-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC (~75%)
and other malignancies. Several clinical imaging studies have validated the potential of small molecule, FAP-
targeted constructs (e.g., 68Ga-FAPI-46). However, the therapeutic translation of FAP-TRTs has failed mainly
due to their low tumor-residualization, which diminishes deliverable therapeutic doses, therapeutic efficacy, and
clinical potential. Recently, we have developed an endolysosomal trapping approach reliant on adduct formation
with cysteine protease to increase tumor residualization of TRTs substantially. Using this adduct formation
approach, the goals of this proposal are to optimize 177Lu- and 225Ac-FAP-targeted TRT constructs, obtain a
greater understanding of how PDAC biology impacts adduct formation, demonstrate our construct's therapeutic
efficacy and safety in PDAC models, understand the impact of FAP-TRTs on the PDAC tumor microenvironment
and compare and contrast the biological effect of 177Lu (β-) vs. 225Ac (α) based FAP-TRTs. Another challenge for
FAP-targeted therapies emerges from its heterogeneous expression and the inadequacy of preclinical models
to recapitulate variabilities in FAP expression. We have generated a panel of human immortalized patient-derived
pancreatic fibroblasts (iPDPFs) that recapitulate CAF heterogeneity and variable FAP expression. We have also
developed unique CAF-tumor cell co-implantation models that result in FAP high or FAP low tumors. We
hypothesize that incorporating cysteine protease trapping agents (CPTAs) into the structure of FAP-targeted
agents (FAPTAs) will allow the formation of intracellular adducts capable of delivering higher therapeutic efficacy
through enhanced PDAC-specific retention. To test this hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1
focuses on optimizing 177Lu/225Ac-CPTA-FAPTAs and examining adduct formation and distribution in PDAC
models. Studies in Aim 2 are designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu/225Ac-CPTA-FAPTAs and
investigate the impact of FAP-TRT therapy on CAF heterogeneity. We propose to employ cutting-edge
approaches and models to study the biodistribution, cellular uptake and trafficking, adduct formation, dosimetry,
and therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu/225Ac-CPTA-FAPTAs. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
provide the critical data required to progress the novel FAP-TRTs toward regulatory approval and initiation of
clinical trials in the future."
10909044,"Abstract
 The goal of this project is to develop a mouse model that acquires human-like telomere
homeostasis for the study of human aging, cancer, and other age-related diseases. In humans,
most somatic cells lack telomerase expression and cannot replenish their telomeres. Telomeres
progressively shorten upon successive cell divisions, functioning as an aging clock.
Consequently, telomere attrition is a critical factor of human aging and telomere stabilization,
predominantly via telomerase activation, is an essential event in the development of most
human cancers. On the other hand, many other organisms, including laboratory mice, do not
exhibit telomere-mediated replicative aging. Mice possess long telomeres and ubiquitous
telomerase activity in adult tissues. This interspecies difference has become a bottleneck for
addressing many fundamental questions in human aging and cancer biology using mouse
models. To tackle this challenge, we have started to create a mouse strain with humanized
telomere homeostasis. We have engineered a humanized mouse Tert allele (hmTert) by using
regulatory sequences from the human TERT gene (hTERT) to replace their mouse
counterparts. We found that the hmTert gene regulation recapitulated that of the hTERT gene
during mouse development and in mouse adult tissues. Remarkably, the hmTert allele imposed
a much shorter telomere length setpoint than the wildtype mTert gene in mice. In this application,
we propose three specific aims: 1) Create a mouse strain with hmTert alleles and human-like
short telomeres; 2) Study replicative aging in mice with humanized telomere homeostasis; and 3)
Determine lifespan and health-span of mice with humanized telomeres."
10909046,"ABSTRACT
Signaling networks that control cellular behavior are highly dynamic and precisely coordinated in space and
time. Rho family GTPases regulate diverse biological processes such as cell migration, proliferation and
immune activation. The activity of these molecules is tightly controlled at the subcellular level and is observed
with precise timing only in discrete regions of the cell. The Dbl family of guanine exchange factors (GEFs) are
the main activators of RhoA GTPases. There are typically multiple GEFs present in a cell that can act on the
same GTPase, and certain GEFs can interact with different GTPases. Recently, it has been shown that the
activity of Dbl GEFs is also distributed at discrete regions in the cell and regulated with precise kinetics.
Therefore, GEFs and GTPases form complex signaling networks that are tightly controlled in space and time.
Traditional GEF studies typically rely on depletion, by knock down or knock out, or augmentation, by
overexpression, of specific GEF activities. While informative, these approaches lack spatiotemporal resolution
and could introduce biological artifacts due to possible compensatory effects in connected GEF/GTPase
signaling networks. Therefore, to fully understand the biological roles of GEFs, new molecular tools are needed
that allow the rapid and precise control of their activity in living cells. The goal of this proposal is to develop a
high throughput platform that can be readily applied to engineer light-controlled inhibitors against the Dbl family
of GEFs. These inhibitors will make possible the reversible inhibition of endogenous GEFs with second-level
kinetics and at micron resolution in living cells. In Aim 1, three different approaches, that rely on computational
modeling and high throughput library screening, will be tested to engineer molecules that bind with high affinity
and specificity to Dbl GEFs and prevent their GTPase association. In Aim 2, engineered inhibitors will be fused
to known optogenetic modules in order to allow the precise control of their activity by irradiation. In Aim 3, the
optogenetic inhibitors will be studied by live cell microscopy to determine the experimental parameters that
need to be fine-tuned in order to achieve efficient GEF inhibition in vivo. The utility of this platform will be
demonstrated by engineering optogenetic inhibitors against three different Dbl GEFs that target the three major
RhoA GTPases, Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42. The platform developed here is general and could be readily applied
to develop molecular tools for the study of other Dbl GEFs. This proposal will thus facilitate the study of Dbl
GEFs at unprecedent spatial and temporal resolution across diverse biological systems."

This mentored research proposal seeks to aims establish a laboratory of an engineer and nanoscientist in
biomedical research. The scientific focus of this proposal is on tissue nanotransfection (TNT), an electromotive
gene transfer technology that delivers plasmids, RNA and oligonucleotides to the live tissue in vivo. This
technology was the first to achieve non-viral in vivo reprograming of the skin to functional blood vessels (iV,
induced vasculogenesis) or to electrophysiologically active neural cells (iN, induced neuritogenesis) under
immune survillence using a nanoelectroporation approach that does not pose the risk of genomic integration or
transformation. TNT facilitates packaging of reprogramming cargo into biological nano carrier called exosome.
Although the feasibility of this approach has been tested in murine skin, its application in pre-clinical setting is
yet to be tested. The proposed work focuses on a new design of TNT chip that can be leveraged for release of
endogenous engineered exosomes in vivo for therapeutic purposes in both diabetic mice and humans. Such
approach was adopted to ensure high clinical significance. The project includes the following three aims. ?Aim
1: Nanoelectroporation induces release of exosome from cells. ?1.1: Nanoelectroporation increases cellular
cytoskeletal reorganization and recruitment of Rab-GTPase at the microtubules for transfer of multivesicular
bodies to the actin-rich cortex for release of exosome. ?1.2: Nanoelectroporation can be used as a method to
package endogenous mRNA and miRNA for release via exosome. ?Aim 2: Test the efficacy of tissue
nanotransfection induced engineered exosome in accelerating diabetic wound closure. ?2.1: Design of plasmids
for cell-specific packaging of mRNA in vivo. ?2.2: In vivo cell specific mRNA packaging within exosome via TNT
accelerates diabetic wound healing. ?Aim 3: Develop human scale TNT2.1 chip for preliminary preclinical testing."
10909404,"Project Summary:
The majority of patients with advanced stage cancers experience moderate to severe pain, and more than half
of all cancer patients report insufficient pain relief by the currently available therapeutics. Head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) involving the oral cavity and/or oropharynx are regarded as a particularly
painful cancer type which produces coincident functional impairments that lead to difficulties in feeding,
swallowing, and communication. These functional impairments substantially reduce quality of life for cancer
patients and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for novel
therapeutics that are capable of providing safe and effective pain relief. Moreover, any newly emerging pain
therapeutic must be compatible with existing and emerging standard of care cancer treatments, such as cancer
immunotherapy, which has emerged as the gold-standard treatment for many cancer subtypes over the last
decade. We recently discovered that pain-sensing peripheral sensory neurons (nociceptors) express the innate
immune regulator STING. Strikingly, activation of STING can produce antinociception in mice and non-human
primates, both in steady-state conditions and in pathological pain states. This is noteworthy, as small molecule
STING agonists have shown remarkable efficacy in promoting antitumor immunity and are currently being
explored as cancer therapeutics in clinical trials. The objective of this proposal is to identify the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which STING regulates nociception, both in steady-state conditions and in HNSCC
pain models. We hypothesize that STING dynamically regulates nociception in steady-state and disease
conditions through a mechanism dependent on nociceptor-immune cell signaling and its subcellular
localization. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine how STING signaling in peripheral sensory neurons, TRPV1+
nociceptors, and classical type-1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) each contribute to STING-mediated antinociception in
health and disease, using syngeneic cancer pain models, conditional genetics, behavioral phenotyping,
immune profiling, and biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine
how the subcellular localization of STING influences its molecular and physiological properties to influence
nociception and antitumor immunity. Overall, completion of these experiments will substantiate STING as a
unique “neuro-immunotherapy” target capable of conferring combinatorial analgesia and antitumor properties,
a finding of immediate translational relevance given the paucity of options available to patients suffering from
cancer pain."

This project is in response to NIMH RFA-MH-19-120 calling for the development and validation of new screening
methods for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can be used in infancy (0-12 months of age). We will deploy a
cost-effective, high-throughput methodology utilizing performance-based, objective, and highly quantitative eye-
tracking assays of social visual engagement—the way in which infants visually explore, engage, and ultimately
learn from and adapt to their surrounding world—collected on a standalone, mobile eye-tracking data collection
device, created in our lab (the Marcus Autism Center Investigational Device, MAC-ID). We will collect eye-
tracking data from a population-based sample of N=2,000 9-month-old infants recruited consecutively in primary
care practices at the time of their 9-month well-child visits. These infants will be followed longitudinally from 9
until 26 months for completion of a series of sequential screening and clinical ascertainment procedures
designed to maximize sensitivity and achieve clinician-best-estimate diagnostic assignments of ASD vs. non-
ASD and Affected [including ASD and non-ASD developmental delays] vs. Unaffected. We will measure the
accuracy of eye-tracking-based screening at the age of 9 months relative to clinician best estimate diagnosis at
24 months (primary analysis), and we will measure dimensional agreement between eye-tracking assays at 9
months relative to outcome levels of social disability, verbal ability, and nonverbal cognitive ability (secondary
analyses). Our overarching goal is to develop high-quality, objective, performance-based tools that can function
as an effective and community-viable means of screening for ASD and other actionable developmental delays
in infancy, to ultimately facilitate improved access to and benefit from early intervention."

Prevention of perinatal depression represents an opportunity to optimize maternal and child health outcomes.
However, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based prevention interventions, such as Reach Out,
Stand Strong, Essentials for New Mothers (ROSE), are challenged by the complexity of multidisciplinary
engagement. The collaborative care model (CCM) is an evidence-based health services intervention designed
to integrate mental health care into somatic healthcare contexts and bridge care across medical disciplines.
Accordingly, the CCM represents an ideal and pragmatic infrastructure to support the delivery of ROSE within
obstetric clinics.
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are physical, sexual, and emotional abuses incurred in childhood. A
striking 16% of adults in the United States were exposed to at least 4 ACEs, and the burden of ACEs is
disproportionately borne by historically and socioeconomically excluded populations. Exposure to ACEs is
perniciously associated with somatic and mental health outcomes in adulthood, including perinatal depression.
Perinatal depression, in turn, is associated with adverse outcomes in birthing people and their offspring.
Mitigation of the intergenerational adverse effects of ACEs, via prevention of perinatal depression, is an essential
component of a reproductive justice-focused public health strategy.
Built on the foundations of interpersonal therapy (IPT), ROSE is a pertinent evidence-based approach for low-
income birthing people with a history of ACEs. ROSE's emphasis on the enhancement of support structures may
protect against the impact of ACEs on mental health via overcoming pathogenic beliefs that interfere with healthy
interpersonal functioning. This mechanism is particularly salient during the transition to new parenthood as social
support can decrease the risk of perinatal depression. The infusion of trauma-informed care into the ROSE
intervention, including focused attention on obstetric triggers of trauma and communication of these risks across
the multi-disciplinary health care team, alongside implementation of this intervention within the CCM defines
Trauma-informed ROSE InterventiOn (TRIO).
This project, “Prevention of Perinatal Depression in Birthing People with a History of Adverse Childhood
Experiences: A Type 2 Effectiveness Implementation Trial”, aims, via a hybrid type 2 randomized trial, to evaluate
TRIO, compared to enhanced treatment as usual. Aim 1 will evaluate wither TRIO improves perinatal depression
(both symptom trajectories and dichotomized perinatal depression) among low-income pregnant people with a
history of ACEs. Aim 2 will evaluate mechanisms by which TRIO may improve perinatal depression. Aim 3 will
examine the acceptability, appropriateness, cost, feasibility, and fidelity of TRIO. This proposal will generate key
data to inform the conduct of a full-scale cluster randomized trial of TRIO that will answer the key questions of
how to effectively and equitably prevent perinatal depression."
10940755,"Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and disabling joint disorder affecting more than 30 million Americans.
Current treatments for OA are primarily to relieve pain and maintain mobility, and none of them are clinically
demonstrated to reverse OA progression. Developing novel disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) is
challenging because there are no demonstrated molecular targets. The heterogeneous clinical presentations of
OA add additional barriers to developing DMOADs. While global efforts are being channeled into
understanding each OA endotype and discovering novel compounds, repurposing FDA-approved drugs
represents a cost-efficient and time-saving solution to develop DMOADs, given that their safety in humans has
been previously validated. In particular, three primary OA endotypes have been identified, which include 1)
cartilage-driven endotype, 2) bone-driven endotype, 3) inflammation-driven endotype. Selectively targeting
these three endotypes represents a practical and generic strategy to discover DMOADs from the FDA-
approved drugs. Importantly, repurposing thousands of FDA-approved drugs needs to be performed on a
platform possessing high-throughput screening capacity. The current OA animal models are not compatible
with such a large-scale study. In addition, the preclinical efficacy of novel therapeutics defined in animal
models is poorly translated in clinical trials, raising concern about their predictive utility. Therefore, for drug
repurposing, using human cell-derived in vitro models that can selectively stimulate OA endotype(s) represents
a feasible and efficient strategy. Recently, we developed an OA cartilage model by chondroinducing in vitro-
aged human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), which simulated many key changes observed in OA
chondrocytes. In addition, we have mixed hMSC-derived fibroblasts and human monocyte-derived
macrophages to simulate the two key cell types in synovial membranes: fibroblast- and macrophage-like
synoviocytes. To overcome the limitation of these single-tissue models in simulating tissue crosstalk in disease
progression and drug treatment, our team has also generated an in vitro microphysiological joint chip (miniJoint)
that integrates the osteochondral, synovial, and adipose analogs. In this application, we propose to use the
three in vitro models to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for OA treatment by defining their capacity to reverse
cartilage and/or inflammation-driven endotypes. The drug library (~2,400) will be first screened with cartilage
and synovial models, and the most promising compounds and their combinations will be further examined in
the miniJoint model. To overcome the limitations of using primary cells, such as finite cell number and donor-to-
donor variation, all three models will be created by human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). The
successful completion of this study will generate a potential DMOAD pool that is ready for study in animal and
human clinical trials. Testing different combinations of these drugs at varying doses in the human cell-derived
miniJoint model will also facilitate a personalized approach to the treatment of OA."

 Distal (or small) airways including the terminal and respiratory bronchioles (TRB) are the sites of damage
in several lung diseases. Pathologies of small airway lesions are poorly understood as the cellular composition
and properties of TRB regions are yet to be fully characterized. Respiratory bronchioles (RB) are extremely small
airways, about 200 µm in diameter. Importantly, the anatomy of mice – the most commonly used model
organisms – is significantly different in these regions. Murine lungs lack RBs, and their terminal bronchioles open
directly into alveoli at the bronchio-alveolar duct junction (BADJ). These challenges have resulted in RBs
remaining as a black box of human lungs. We optimized microdissection protocols to enrich RBs from human
lungs and generated single-cell transcriptomic maps. We identified seven novel cell populations in the TRB
regions. Importantly, we show that these cells have no equivalent cell types in mice. All these data point towards
the need to develop new models to effectively understand small airways in health and disease. We show here
in our preliminary data that primary human stem cell cultures well capture the small airway biology. Further, we
find that small airways of ferrets have similar cellular composition to those of humans suggesting that they can
serve as a model to study small airways. Utilizing these two models coupled with single-cell transcriptomics we
propose to address the following specific aims. 1) Delineate the terminal and respiratory bronchiolar epithelial
lineage trajectories. 2) Study the cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks that maintain distal basal cell identity. At
the conclusion of this study, we would have significantly advanced our understanding of human terminal and
respiratory bronchioles. We will develop the first TRB-specific lineage tracing model in ferrets. Our study will
determine the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that determine TRB stem cell identity and progeny. These results will
assist in developing effective therapies for diseases involving small airways."

Severe burn trauma triggers profound muscle atrophy and weakness which persists for years post- injury. To
date, research efforts have predominantly explored hypermetabolic and catabolic signaling within muscle cells
resulting from burn injuries, with limited attention to other contributing factors.. The intricate processes of
muscle regeneration and remodeling involve multiple cell types within the muscle niche, including fibroblasts
and immune cells. We propose that burn injuries disrupt crucial cell-to-cell signaling pathways, resulting in
muscle dysfunction that cannot be solely attributed to hypermetabolism. We are uniquely positioned to pursue
our long-term goal of unveiling cellular and molecular drivers of burn-induced myopathy with the aim of
identifying innovative therapeutic targets that preserve muscle size and function. Over the next five years, we
will pursue four interconnected yet distinct projects. Project 1 will identify cellular determinants of muscle
fibrosis after severe burn injury. Recent findings indicate significant collagen deposition post-murine burn
injury, indicative of unresolved fibrosis which may increase tissue stiffness and reduce strength. We will
employ a comprehensive multi-omic (transcriptomic and proteomic) approach to unveil cellular and molecular
determinants of burn-induced fibrosis. Identified pathological mediators will be studied through transgenic and
pharmacological interventions. Various techniques will assess collagen dynamics, including architecture,
orientation, and cross-linking, to comprehend ECM remodeling potential post-burn injury. Project 2 will
determine the impact of burn injury on immune cell function and its consequence on muscle wasting
and weakness. We will assess immune cell abundance and phenotype in muscle in the days to months
following burn injury. Additionally, we will investigate how burn injury epigenetically, metabolically, and
functionally reprograms immune cells. Upon identification of cellular perpetuators of muscle dysfunction after
burn, we may pursue cell depletion strategies to directly examine their role. Project 3 will elucidate effect of
immunomodulation on muscle physiology after burn injury. We will explore whether modifying
macrophage phenotype using Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can promote healthy ECM turnover and
improves muscle mechanics and strength. Project 4 will fill the knowledge gap regarding the role of muscle
MyD88 in burn-induced cachexia and muscle regeneration. MyD88, a TLR adaptor molecule expressed in
muscle, has been implicated in cancer cachexia, yet it is also required for myofiber regeneration. We will
employ a skeletal muscle MyD88 knockout transgenic animal to determine whether MyD88 exerts a pro-
restorative or pro-wasting effect following burn injury. These projects collectively support our overarching aim:
to enhance our understanding of burn-induced cellular and molecular dysfunction which will identify novel
therapeutic targets for improving muscle function in patients after severe burn injury."

endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with limited efficacy. While anti-VEGF drugs are widely used as the first-line
therapy for nAMD, more than half of treated patients develop subretinal fibrosis (SRF) or scar that disrupts retinal
function and hinders visual acuity improvement with unknown causes. Anti-VEGF therapy has a paradoxical role
in fibrosis of other diseases with poorly defined mechanisms. Likewise, the causal link between anti-VEGF
therapy and SRF remains elusive but is of profound importance to mitigate the new epidemic and save the vision
for nAMD patients. The objective of this project is to investigate mechanisms of Janus-faced anti-VEGF therapy
in SRF of CNV and develop novel dual anti-angiogenesis and anti-fibrosis therapy. The central hypothesis is
that inhibition of angiogenesis by anti-VEGF drugs during early stages of CNV alleviates SRF, whereas anti-
VEGF therapy at late stages of the disease exacerbates SRF. In Aim 1, we will investigate anti-VEGF therapy
at early and late stages of CNV in different animal models to test the central hypothesis. In Aim 2, we will
investigate whether two novel VEGF-independent anti-angiogenic therapies possess dual anti-CNV and anti-
fibrosis activity at any stage of the disease. In Aim 3, we will characterize combination therapy of anti-VEGF drug
with novel VEGF-independent anti-angiogenic inhibitors to synergistically alleviate CNV and SRF via different
receptor signaling pathways. The successful implementation of this project will confirm the causal link between
anti-VEGF therapy and SRF and provide a clinical strategy to mitigate the emerging epidemic by limiting anti-
VEGF therapy to early stages of the disease. This may help reduce SRF in nAMD patients and improve visual
acuity. Furthermore, this study will also develop first-in-class dual anti-angiogenesis and anti-fibrosis therapies
to circumvent the emerging epidemic of anti-VEGF-induced SRF."

Cardiovascular disease has declined dramatically in all US adults except young women, whose rates remain
stagnant. Young women who are Black or low-income carry the highest burden. Professional groups agree that
the period around pregnancy is an ideal target for primordial and primary prevention efforts. Diet is a
cornerstone in cardiovascular disease prevention, but this research is based on older adults, and is unlikely to
generalize to the childbearing years, when changes to lifestyle and physiology alter diet and nutrient needs,
and social determinants of health pose additional barriers. There are major gaps in our understanding of the
dietary patterns that optimize short- and long-term postpartum cardiovascular health. Further, we do not know
whether postpartum dietary patterns can mitigate the excess risk related to having a prior adverse pregnancy
outcome, and more broadly, the groups that most benefit from dietary modification.
We will fill these knowledge gaps by establishing the role of longitudinal dietary patterns in the development of
cardiovascular disease and risk factors from periconception to 10 years postpartum. We propose a cost-
efficient secondary analysis of existing data from 4048 racially- and socioeconomically-diverse participants in
the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study who had in-person study visits at 6‒13 weeks’ gestation as well as 3 and 10
years postpartum. First, we will estimate the effect of longitudinal dietary patterns on 3- and 10-year
postpartum risk of incident hypertension, incident metabolic syndrome, and their risk factors, and explore how
social determinants of health interact with dietary patterns to influence these risks. Then, we will estimate the
extent to which postpartum dietary patterns can reduce the excess 3- and 10-year postpartum cardiovascular
risks among individuals with an adverse pregnancy outcome (gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes,
and preterm birth). Finally, we will identify optimal dietary patterns for groups of childbearing individuals based
on factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, community deprivation, adverse pregnancy outcomes,
preexisting conditions, BMI, early-pregnancy and postpartum cardiometabolic markers, and postpartum weight.
This work will deliver timely, high-quality evidence to providers and policymakers on the ideal dietary patterns
for primordial and primary prevention of postpartum cardiovascular disease for vulnerable populations. Our
work will improve medical practice and public health by identifying a specific, clinically actionable set of dietary
guidelines that will target limited resources in critical time periods to individuals who will have the greatest
benefit. Our innovative and significant project will inform strategies to alter dietary patterns for improving future
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduce its long-standing disparities."

Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading infectious killers worldwide with over 10 million new cases and 1.5 million
deaths each year. Pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease, is associated with lung injury that can
persist beyond treatment completion. Post-TB lung disease (PTLD) is an important contributor to excess
disability and mortality that can affect an estimated 155 million TB survivors globally. Yet there are no known
interventions to prevent TB-associated lung injury and the likelihood of subsequent PTLD. The goal of this R01
proposal is to characterize the burden, severity, and phenotypic presentation of PTLD, and its association with
interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathways, in TB patients with and without HIV. We will leverage the ongoing NIH
and Indian Government funded RePORT-India TB Research Consortium, a multi-site study that is prospectively
evaluating HIV-uninfected adults with drug-sensitive TB for lung injury during and after TB treatment, by enrolling
a comparison cohort of HIV-positive drug-sensitive TB patients matched on age, sex, and smoking exposure
who will follow identical study protocols. Through Aim-1, we will extensively characterize and compare the
phenotypic differences in lung injury at TB treatment initiation, its resolution during treatment, and subsequent
PTLD between TB patients with versus without HIV using a multi-dimensional approach of pulmonary function
testing, respiratory health and functional status assessments, and novel lung imaging approaches. Through Aim-
2, we will use induced sputum samples to comprehensively investigate the role of different IL-6 signaling
pathways in determining the extent of lung injury, and its resolution during TB treatment, by measuring key
immune, cellular, and gene expression markers, along with downstream inflammatory pathways linked to acute
lung injury and fibrotic remodeling. This R01 application will expand upon our prior and ongoing research in India
and generate evidence to support the design of clinical trials of host-directed therapies for selectively modulating
IL-6 signaling pathways to improve pulmonary outcomes in TB patients with and without HIV."
10924633,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, adolescents are the age group least likely to be aware of their HIV infection and linked to
care in a timely manner, contributing to disproportionately low rates of viral suppression and increased risk of
transmitting HIV to others. HIV testing is a cornerstone to HIV prevention, but uptake among adolescents is
lagging. Adolescents who receive confidential care (i.e., have time alone with a health care provider during visits,
the ability to self-consent to services, and the privacy of their health information maintained) are significantly
more likely to engage in important discussions about sexual health issues, disclose sensitive sexual health
information, receive appropriate sexual health services (e.g., HIV testing), and return for care. However, despite
guidelines from professional medical organizations recommending universal access to confidential sexual health
services, it is estimated that less than half of adolescents – the majority of whom are served in pediatric primary
care settings – receive confidential care. Structural interventions targeting aspects of the environment that serve
as barriers to HIV prevention offer an opportunity to increase adolescent HIV testing uptake by addressing the
shortcomings of the systems in which sexual health services are delivered. This research will consider the
perspectives of pediatric primary care patients, providers, and clinic leadership to develop a multicomponent
structural intervention to increase adolescent HIV testing uptake by improving the implementation of confidential
care as standard practice in pediatric primary care settings. This study will draw from the principles of community-
based participatory research (CBPR) and utilize a multiphase optimization strategy to achieve the following
specific aims: (1) explore patient preferences about how confidential care is provided in pediatric primary care;
(2) examine provider- and organizational-level barriers and facilitators to implementing confidential care as
standard practice in pediatric primary care; and (3) pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of structural
intervention components to increase adolescent HIV testing uptake by improving the implementation of
confidential care as standard practice in pediatric primary care. Consistent with the NIMH strategic plan goal to
“strive for prevention and cures” by “optimizing the effectiveness of interventions for delivery in practice settings,”
this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will lay the groundwork for addressing health
inequities among adolescents through structural interventions with high capacity for real-world implementation
and dissemination. Through a combination of mentorship from a multidisciplinary team of experts at Yale
University, coursework/workshops, experiential learning through the proposed research, and professional
development activities, this K01 will provide Dr. Aivadyan with essential training in: (1) CBPR; (2) structural
intervention development; (3) implementation science; and (4) the responsible conduct of research with children.
This advanced training will position Dr. Aivadyan for a successful career as an independent investigator
committed to promoting health equity by improving access to high-quality sexual health services for adolescents."
10898851,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major health problem and can lead to or increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, metabolic disease, daytime sleepiness, workplace errors, traffic accidents and death, if it is left undetected. Worldwide it is estimated one billion people, one in seven adults, have OSA. As sleep occurs primarily in the bedroom, monitoring sleep quality at home, instead of in sleep labs, would significantly advance the self-management, and potentially the clinical management, of OSA and other sleep disorders. Thereafter, an approach that noninvasively monitors sleep quality at home would have significant societal and health benefits. This project brings together leading researchers from informatics and health disciplines to create a contactless sensor system for OSA monitoring and characterization, which integrates advanced Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Data Science (OS) into smart sensors and home care. The key research challenges are to convert the information-rich sensor signals to clinically meaningful vital signs and behavioral patterns that are linked with OSA. This project addresses three primary themes of the SCH solicitation: Automating Health, Transformative Data Science, and Effective Usability. The proposed research makes fundamental contributions to computer, data and biomedical science and engineering and will create the first contactless Internet of Things (loT) system for real-time and engagement-free sleep apnea monitoring and characterization. The main technological innovation is a set of novel stream data Al/OS for sleep events and vitals monitoring: a robust signal quality control and segmentation process based on a moving-sum statistic and recursive binary segmentation; a novel factor auto-regressive recurrent neural network framework to characterize key sleep events; a new approach of monitoring vital signs and their variations based on an innovative panel data model and the structural changes in regression coefficients; and a flexible and distributional robust feature assessment method to enable out-of-distribution (000) generalization. The proposed interdisciplinary research takes a coordinated approach that balances theory with evidence-based analysis and systematic advances. The project will conduct empirical validation of new concepts through research prototypes, ranging from specific components to entire systems, and lead to new fundamental insights and effective usability."
10924039,"Many patients take surgical interventions to fight the battle against heart disease. Surgical successes are
critical to the patients’ health and their family well-being. For e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most
common arrhythmia in elder population. Catheter ablation is an established treatment for AF, which
sequentially creates incision lines to block faulty electrical pathways. However, there are large variations
in surgical outcomes. Modern healthcare systems are investing heavily in sensing and computing
technology to increase information visibility and cope with disease complexity. Massive data are readily
available in the surgical environment. Realizing the full data potential for optimal decision support
depends on the advancement of information processing and computational modeling methodologies.
Our long-term goal is to advance the frontier of precision cardiology by developing new sensor-based
modeling and simulation optimization methodologies. The objective of this project is to optimize AF
ablation by integrating simulation-enabled planning with physics-augmented machine learning of sensor
signals from patients who underwent AF ablation. This objective will be accomplished by pursuing 3
specific aims: 1) Physics-augmented artificial intelligence (AI) for cardiac modeling – This approach will
assimilate heterogeneous sensing data and incorporate electrophysiology prior knowledge into deep
learning to increase the robustness of decision making under uncertainty, thereby driving computer
simulation into clinical applications; 2) Optimal sensing and sequential learning of space-time AF
dynamics – This approach will provide quantitative knowledge of disease mechanisms instead of
subjective knowledge that is difficult to translate (or transfer), thereby reducing healthcare disparity due to
the availability of human experts in rural areas; 3) Integrating sensor-based learning and simulation
optimization for surgical planning - This approach will integrate physics-augmented modeling (Aim 1) and
sensor-based learning (Aim 2) with simulation optimization to improve the clinical practice towards
data-driven & simulation-guided surgical planning. This project will make a major breakthrough towards
precision cardiology by (i) going beyond the current practice of largely expert-based or ad hoc decisions,
(ii) capturing underlying complexities in space-time cardiac dynamics, and (iii) integrating physics-based
modeling, sensor-based learning, and simulation-based planning for surgical decision support."
10934341,"Virus infections remain major threats to human health worldwide as demonstrated by COVID-19 
pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. All enveloped viruses must fuse with host membranes 
to initiate the infection process. Membrane fusion is a critical, but poorly understood biological process 
that is driven by protein conformational changes. Membrane fusion is a highly complex, multistage and 
multiscale process, which is difficult to investigate through scale-specific techniques (both experimentally 
and numerically). In this project, we propose to investigate the structural changes of fusion proteins and 
virus fusion through a combination of multiscale modeling, machine learning, and complementary 
experimentation. Because of our decades long experience in working with the herpes simplex virus 
(HSV), we will utilize the herpesvirus fusogen, gB, a class Ill fusion protein, as a model protein, to 
elucidate protein conformational changes during virus fusion. The specific research aims are: (1) To 
delineate the conformational changes of viral fusion proteins, through development of the machine 
learning facilitated enhanced sampling scheme for fusion proteins and delineation of the sequential 
conformation changes of gB protein for HSV fusion by a combination of machine learning and 
experiments; (2) To elucidate membrane fusion driven by viral fusion protein conformational changes, 
through development of a multiscale model for membrane fusion, assessment of the role of membrane 
fluidity in fusion and elucidation of the importance of the gB membrane proximal region on gB 
conformational changes and membrane fusion through combined simulations and experiments. 
This research will establish experimentally validated, powerful modeling platforms for exploration of the 
protein conformational changes and will bridge the multiple spatial and temporal scales involved in the 
fusion process. The machine learning method for enhanced sampling is highly innovative and crucial to 
capture the large-scale structural (conformational) changes and associated energy profiles of fusion 
proteins, and to identify the appropriate pathways during the fusion process. The integration of the 
gradient-based optimization method to the machine learning algorithm is novel to identify the most 
appropriate reaction coordinates."
10932403,"The spatiotemporal distribution of morphogens contributes to the organized development of tissues and organs. 
One model of morphogen distribution is active transport, which includes cell based mechanisms like signaling 
filopodia. Signaling filopodia facilitate contact between distant cells in order to allow signaling to occur, and support 
several cell signaling paradigms during development. The proposed project will use multi-scale modeling and 
biological experiments to test the hypothesis that Notch signaling occurs via filopodia-filopodia mediated cell-cell 
contacts in vivo. This hypothesis will be tested in three objectives. (1) Investigate the mechanism of Notch activation 
on filopodia. A mechanical model of distinct modes of filopodia interactions will be used to quantify the forces 
generated during filopodia mediated signaling to identify the most likely mechanism for Notch activation. (2) 
Determine how Notch signal is relayed to the cell body. A mathematical model of filopodia in the presence of 
diffusion and active transport of signals will be developed to quantify the relative importance of each mechanism. 
We will support our model with genetic approaches and quantitative live imaging. (3) Create a multi-scale vertex 
model of Notch signaling during bristle cell patterning. We will combine the above molecular and cellular submodels of Notch signaling to create a truly multi-scale vertex model of the patterning thorax. This framework will 
support an in silico, real-time investigation of patterning dynamics via signaling filopodia to identify potential 
molecular regulators of this process. The success of this proposal will result in a foundational understanding of the 
mechanisms that drive long-range lateral inhibition during tissue patterning. We will introduce the first multi-scale 
mechanical model of the fly thorax that allows for cell-driven dynamics of filopodia and real-time activation of 
Notch. The experimental work proposed here addresses a major gap in our understanding of tissue development 
and homeostasis: how active cell processes contribute to the distribution and activation of signals."
10918258,"Broad Objective: Maintaining anatomical symmetry in vertebrates is essential for proper physiological 
function, and loss of symmetry in ribs and vertebrae can lead to serious conditions such as scoliosis and
impairments of appropriate breathing and posture. This project will explore the developmental emergence 
of left-right symmetry, combining biological experiments on wild-type mice and a model of early loss of
symmetry with mathematical models of gene expression and molecule distributions. Through these studies, 
the project will provide new important insight into the determinants of body (a)symmetry. 
Specific Aims and Research Design: The somites are the embryonic structures giving rise to the 
vertebrae and rib cage. They are formed at early phases of embryonic development and emerge 
progressively in pairs of paraxial mesoderm blocks on both sides of the midline in a highly symmetric 
manner. The symmetry of the somites is actively maintained through mechanisms controlled by retinoic 
acid (RA) signaling. Indeed, animals deficient in RA exhibit an asymmetric somite formation. This proposal 
will investigate this RA-mediated symmetry maintenance mechanisms by combining experiments on RA-deficient mice with mathematical models of somitogenesis. 
In Aim 1, to investigate the dynamical mechanism of somite formation in wild-type and RA-deficient 
embryos, we will characterize finely the somite formation timing, period, and positions in mouse embryos 
through live imaging techniques coupled with and topological data analysis. In Aim 2, to study the genetic 
mechanism involved in the segmentation clock, which controls the spatio-temporal formation of somites, 
the same live-imaging setup will be leveraged to extract the dynamics of the segmentation clock in mouse 
embryos. This data will be used to develop and specify a theoretical model of somitogenesis which will in 
turn allow exploring the determinants of symmetry maintenance and its breakdown. To explore how 
asymmetry may arise and be buffered by RA, Aim 3 proposes to study the origin of asymmetry in RA-deficient mouse. It will rely on the development of computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyze the 
global distribution of key signaling molecules as they are transported in fluids driven by cilia movements.
This will be coupled to reaction-diffusion systems and their dynamics will be explored to investigate how 
RA-mediated mechanism can buffer any initial asymmetry in molecular concentrations."
10919839,"Advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology allows the characterization of the microbiome via
either marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene) amplicon sequencing or metagenomics shotgun sequencing.
Consequently, the scientific community is increasingly appreciative of the important role that the
microbiome community plays in many human health and disease conditions. Despite its popularity, the
field of microbiome and metagenomics studies, however, has not yet reached the maturity attained in
other established molecular epidemiology fields, such as cancer biomarker discovery and genome-wide
association studies for making the leap from omics survey to rational microbiome-based therapeutics.
One of the primary limitations to leveraging this large body of microbiome and metagenomics data is
computational and statistical challenges. Among these is the technical nature of the data, including high
dimensionality, sparse count or compositional data structure, relatively small sample size, and complex
dependence/correlation structure such as phylogenetic relatedness. To combat these challenges, this
proposal seeks to develop statistical methods, theory, and computational tools to accurately characterize
microbial communities within and across large studies while maintaining both statistical rigor and
biological relevance. This project develops new statistical methods, theory, and software to characterize
microbial communities within and across large studies accurately. Specifically, motivated by biomedical
and biological problems encountered in microbiome studies of skin diseases, autism spectrum disorder,
and infant growth, the investigators will develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping microbial taxa that
influence clinical outcomes of interest in a powerful and robust pattern; (2) learning the correlation
structure among microbial taxa to decode the complex networks and interactions among the microbiome
community; (3) a new mediation analysis for microbiome studies with high-dimensional microbial profiles
and other omics profiles such as metabolomics. Successful completion of this proposal will fill the gap
between the burgeoning research interests in microbiome studies and the need for more analytical tools.
This proposal will improve the understanding of the underlying microbiome mechanism of many health
and disease conditions, which is critical to designing microbiome-based interventions for prognostic,
diagnostic, and treatment purposes."
10917300,"Diseases that spillover from wild animals pose an increasing threat to human health worldwide, but
forecasting how zoonotic pathogens spread remains a major challenge. Zoonotic diseases are complex,
spatially and temporally evolving systems whose behaviors are influenced by social, ecological, genetic,
and evolutionary factors. Understanding the contributions of biotic and abiotic factors to accurate disease forecasting is an urgent priority for managing the emerging risks of rapid environmental change and for improving mechanistic models of complex ecological systems. Field studies monitoring zoonotic pathogens and their host species have typically assumed that observing high host prevalence is strong evidence that (i) the host is a ‘reservoir’ of the pathogen, maintaining it at a stable population level; and (ii) the host is a persistent source of spillover into other species. However, ecological models have shown that reservoir status can be strongly context dependent, mediated by extrinsic factors including interactions with other species and habitat fragmentation. An interdisciplinary approach combining complex systems modeling, data science, and risk analysis is therefore needed to model zoonotic spillover dynamics. This project will construct novel largescale, multi-host mechanistic models of the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) and Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) diseases in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area to investigate the stability versus context-sensitivity of hosts as disease reservoirs and identify key future data sources required to improve forecasting and identify effective interventions aimed at reducing disease burden. Both diseases are endemic to the southwestern United States and are believed to be spread by rodent hosts, but they are caused by different types of pathogens (viruses and fungi, respectively) and show divergent case trends. The project will use Petri Net models, which are modular, scalable, and readily visualized as mechanistic network diagrams, which makes them a valuable tool for exploring how adding or removing hosts and changing land use are expected to change disease dynamics. 
For training and outreach, the project will implement and evaluate initiatives to (i) communicate results in public outreach events; (ii) construct a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) focused on disease modeling; and (iii) build capacity for researching Valley Fever and mitigating outbreaks. For outreach, the project will create a free web app for public interaction with modular disease models and their visual outputs. In addition to presenting project results for HPS and Valley Fever, the web app will be linked to an interactive textbook introducing Petri Nets to be developed by the project. For the CURE class, students will focus on synthesizing zoonotic disease data to improve risk modeling, providing urgently needed research opportunities for ASU’s approximately 7,000 in-person and online biology majors. Lastly, the project will organize a capacity-building workshop of academic and public health researchers to introduce them to Petri Net resources and to identify data needs for improved forecasting."

Chicago, one of the most diverse yet segregated cities in the US, is characterized by egregious cancer health
inequities. We propose to establish the Advancing Control Equity Research Through Transformative Solutions
in Patient Navigation (ACCERT PN) Center to develop community-engaged interventions, measures and
methods for process and outcomes assessment, and researcher and community partner capacity and

eEF2K is at the confluence of multiple upstream pathways whose signals it integrates. eEF2K’s only known
target is the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which it phosphorylates on a single site. This eEF2K/eEF2-
axis is the predominant regulator of translation elongation and has a general role in cell homeostasis. It is also
an essential cue-dependent regulator of protein synthesis in localized regions of specific cell types, for example,
after neurotransmitter exposure in the synapses of neurons. eEF2 promotes the translation of specific mRNAs
while generally inhibiting translation. The mechanism of this paradoxical phenomenon is entirely unknown. We
recently showed that active eEF2K imposes a general translation shutdown in which phosphorylated eEF2 and
the phase-separating protein SERBP1 stably bind to ribosomes and renders them idle. This assembly suggests
possible mechanisms of eEF2-phosphorylation with respect to ribosome stability, mRNA decay, and ribosome
localization that collectively explain how eEF2-phosphorylation might lead to preferential translation of certain
mRNAs. eEF2K is associated with numerous human diseases, including neurological dysfunctions, infectious
diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Therapeutics targeting eEF2K are under development but
currently lack insufficient specificity. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of eEF2K-regulation and its downstream
effects are needed.
 Under this award, we will pursue two key directions: 1) determine how eEF2K structurally integrates
signals from upstream pathways and affects its downstream regulation of eEF2, and 2) determine how
phosphorylated eEF2 and idle ribosomes regulate mRNA translation globally and locally. Here, we will test the
novel hypotheses that eEF2-phosphorylation regulates ribosome stability, mRNA stability, and ribosome
localization, which collectively confers the preferential translation of a specific mRNA subset. We will use an
integrated structural biology approach using single-particle and in situ cryogenic electron microscopy, paired with
biophysical, biochemical, and cell biology approaches to address these general and location-specific roles of the
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) pathway. Our proposed research program will open the door to
promising therapeutic approaches for the long list of eEF2K-related human diseases and, more broadly, expand
our understanding of translation elongation."

taking in a scene from a high vantage point, and first-person perspectives (FPPs), such as being on the 
ground immersed in the scene, has obvious importance for navigation and, more broadly, flexible 
perspective-taking. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we will investigate the neural architectures,

10907838,"The neural bases of sensory stimulus selection, an essential function for attentional and adaptive behavior, will be investigated by 
this collaborative project in barn owls, a specialized stimulus localizer species. While a topographic representation of relative 
stimulus strength and behavioral relevance across visual and auditory space has been demonstrated in the barn owl's optic tectum 
(OT), how the information is conveyed to downstream decision-making centers for proper control of stimulus driven behaviors is 
unknown in barn owls, as well as in other species. The main goal of the proposed research is to understand the read-out 
mechanisms of the midbrain map in the ascending midbrain-to-forebrain pathway, along which a transformation involving 
abolishment of a topographic representation of spatial location is observed. Barn owls offer a strong advantage for investigating 
these questions, because of their robust and well-studied visual and auditory representations across brain regions and because a 
robust auditory saliency map has been shown in the barn owl. This study aims at answering the question of how behaviorally 
relevant sensory signals are selected and encoded to induce stimulus location driven perceptual and behavioral responses while 
others are ignored. Through simultaneous recordings of midbrain, thalamic and forebrain regions, the hypothesis that topographic 
representation of salient stimuli is translated into a non-topographic representation of salient stimuli for both visual (Aim 1) and 
auditory (Aim 2) salient stimuli will be tested in both anesthetized and behaving animals. Computational modeling describing 
network processing and coding will be used for further testing hypothesis and detailed description of network and coding 
mechanisms underlying transformational coding of stimulus selection (Aim 3). Preliminary results support feasibility of proposed 
approaches. This collaborative computational project will contribute intellectual merits and broader impact of widening view and 
understanding of neural coding and network mechanisms underlying stimulus selection by a transformational coding scheme from 
midbrain to forebrain, fundamental for selective attention and perception of salient stimuli across species. Innovative simultaneous 
recordings of midbrain and forebrain regions of anesthetized and awake animals, and interdisciplinary physiological, behavioral and 
computational approaches will be implemented. In addition, training opportunities and publication goals for undergraduate, 
graduate and postdoctoral fellows will enhance their visibility and career plans. Related to diversity and inclusion, the team includes 
members from underrepresented gender and ethnic groups and will promote international collaboration in brain sciences."
10920494,"Glial cells, including astrocytes, are the most prevalent cell type in the brain by far, and their dysfunctions
are known to play a role in a host of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, neuroimmune, and
neuroplastic diseases and disorders. However, they have been greatly understudied relative to neurons,
and it remains unclear what role, if any, they play in cortical folding. Therefore, there is a critical need for
deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of glial cells in brain development across health and disease.
The long-term goals of the PI and co-I are to use their backgrounds, in computational mechanics and
molecular and cellular neuroscience, respectively, to understand the process of cortical folding. Here they
combine their complementary expertise to investigate the role of astrocytes in gyrification using a
combined computational-experimental approach. The overall objective of this CRCNS proposal is to relate
cellular behavior at the microscale to cerebral morphology and cortical folding at the macroscale.
In particular, we will evaluate two potential mechanisms of astrocyte proliferation: 1) that astrocytes push
on the cortex or 2) that the cortex pulls on astrocytes, causing them to grow in response. To that end, we
will experimentally manipulate and track astrocytes in the developing ferret brain using in utero
electroporation (Aim 1), develop and calibrate computational models of both mechanisms of astrocyte
behavior in cortical folding (Aim 2), and use our models to evaluate their likelihood (Aim 3). This proposal
is strongly founded on our own prior work, which has shown that astrocyte proliferation under gyri is
necessary for the formation of cortical folds in the ferret brain, and that an experimentally-calibrated
computational model can capture the dynamics of cellular behavior and the resulting tissue-level
mechanics and morphology. The combined experimental-computational approach proposed here will
contribute to our fundamental understanding of the role of glial cells in brain development, which could be
important in the study of neurodevelopmental diseases and disorders, advanced diagnostics, and effective
treatments. Furthermore, our experimentally-validated computational framework could be used to design
experimental approaches to test mechanistic hypotheses and to identify pathways for treatment in spatio- or temporally-specific events such as prenatal infection, illness, or exposure."
10917412,"Changes in interactions between neurons enable diverse computations and flexible behaviors. Such 
changes can occur very rapidly by rerouting information flow through existing connections, or more slowly 
by updating connections. The proposed project will study how local and brain-wide dynamics arise during 
learning of goal-directed behaviors. Experiments will use novel ‘all-optical’ experimental techniques to 
causally map network interactions at cellular resolution in combination with data-constrained computational 
models, to follow the learning process in the living brain with unprecedented detail. The investigation will 
focus on learning mechanisms in several novel memory-guided behavioral tasks, that either do not require 
learning, or specifically tailored for studying learning within and over days. This will fundamentally advance 
the understanding of how different learning mechanisms shape brain-dynamics and behavior. 
Aim 1: Mapping changes in causal interactions (effective connectivity) between neurons in local cortical 
circuits. Modeling and experiments will allow disentangling contributions of synaptic plasticity and gating to 
changes in network interactions and representations during learning. 
Aim 2: Investigating unique properties of cortex-wide neural activity. Preliminary work, based on cellular-resolution mesoscopic imaging of ~1,000,000 neurons, led to the discovery that spatial and temporal scales 
of brain-wide dynamics follow a power-law. Intriguingly, the most dominant modes of activity are global and 
fast, differently from any existing network model. The proposed work will uncover biological mechanisms 
supporting the emergence of these newly discovered cortical states during learning. 
Aim 3: Investigating functional implications of learned neural network dynamics studied in Aims 1 and 2. To 
test the hypothesis that such dynamics enable animals to perform flexible memory-guided behaviors, work 
will focus on modeling the effect of targeted optogenetic perturbations of neural activity on different spatial 
scales on network dynamics and behavior. 
Overall, the proposed collaborative study will leverage the PIs complementary expertise, to deepen the 
understanding of mechanisms and function of neural dynamics on different spatial scales. The 
experimental and theoretical methods developed as part of this proposal will provide insight for brain-wide 
control of memory-guided behavior, and will serve as a road-map for future studies of other behaviors 
controlled by distributed brain networks."
10937151,"While antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and delay
disease progression, there is still no cure, and HIV remains a global public health challenge. A better
understanding of early and persistent immunological events in HIV infection is critical to inform novel
interventions. The majority of current strategies aiming to prevent, control or eradicate HIV rely on harnessing
effector functions of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, B cells and antibodies to attack HIV and HIV-infected cells.
However, natural killer (NK) cells might represent another subset for therapeutic modulation. Recently, our lab
has carried out in-depth, yet preliminary research into NK cells expressing the IgA receptor, CD89, using both
human and nonhuman primate samples. We have generated preliminary data showing that: (i) CD89+ NK cells
can be readily identified in various tissues including peripheral blood and mucosal tissues; (ii) CD89+ NK cells
display an altered signaling phenotype compared to CD89- NK cells; (iii) CD89+ NK cells are significantly
restricted in their activation potential; and (iv) CD89+ NK cells can be identified through multiplex imaging
indicating their relevant proximity in the GI mucosae. Collectively these data form the basis for our overarching
hypothesis that CD89 acts as an inhibitory checkpoint to regulate NK cell mucosal functions, and, therefore, may
serve as an attractive target for NK cell-based interventions and therapeutics in lentivirus infections. We will test
this hypothesis through two focused Exploratory Aims: (i) Characterize the role(s) and functional regulation
of CD89+ NK in the mucosae in normal and SIV/SHIV-infected macaques; and (ii) Investigate the role of
autologous CD89+ NK cells in therapeutic modulation of SIV infection. Ultimately, this knowledge has the
potential to inform strategies to tune CD89+ NK cells for preventive or therapeutic interventions and personalized
treatments, vaccine development, and strategies for reducing viral reservoirs."
10937779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Delayed Sleep Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) is a common circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder that is
characterized by difficulty in initiating sleep at night and subsequent difficulty in waking at times required for work
or school. Consequently, DSWPD is often associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced academic and
work performance, mood disturbances and reduced quality of life. Considering the significant negative impact of
DSWPD on sleep quality, performance, mental and physical health and well-being, the physiological basis of the
disorder surprisingly remains unclear. Classically, DSWPD is assumed to stem from a delay of central circadian
timing. However, recent evidence shows that those clinically diagnosed with DSWPD fall into at least two distinct
phenotypes: those with delayed circadian timing and sleep (DSWPD1) and those with typical circadian timing
but delayed sleep (DSWPD2). Using pupillometry, our group has shown differences in light sensitivity between
the DSWPD1 and DSWPD2 subtypes, as well as within the DSWPD1 group (high (HLS) and low sensitivity to
light (LLS)), indicating that clinically diagnosed DSWPD likely represents a complex interplay between underlying
physiological differences and behaviors that can affect sleep timing. However, current diagnostic criteria do not
consider these distinct phenotypes, which can limit diagnostic accuracy and hinder the development of
personalized treatments that target the underlying alterations in physiology and behavior of these DSWPD
subtypes. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the physiological basis of DSWPD subtypes,
and to use these findings to inform development of mechanistically based approaches in circadian medicine.
This project will enroll 220 patients with DSWPD who will undergo circadian physiological and behavioral
phenotyping by actigraphy, dim light melatonin sampling, pupillary light sensitivity, as well as assessment of
mood, alertness and meal timing using questionnaires. In addition, we will evaluate light sensitivity in LLS
DSWPD1, as measured by the suppression of melatonin, and test whether the SSRI citalopram can enhance
light sensitivity. Finally, mathematical modeling will be used to integrate physiological (pupillometry) and
behavioral assessments to identify DSWPD subtypes. The proposed research will form the basis for the
development of light sensitivity-based tools and algorithms that integrate physiological and behavioral
biomarkers which can lead to a personalized multimodal approach for the care of patients with circadian rhythm
disorders."

Social life profoundly influences health. The ability to treat and prevent illness and improve human health
therefore requires a detailed understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the influence of social
complexity on biological systems. Such understanding is key to the development of new interventions to
improve public health. Past studies have demonstrated the critical contribution of social relationships in
shaping health outcomes but are limited in application because such studies rarely consider social support or
health as “complex systems”. As a result, we lack a deep understanding of how and why individuals within
families, and families within communities, remain healthy or become unhealthy in the context of their social
environments. In this application, our proposed research overcomes this limitation by adopting an intervention-
based experimental and computational systems science approach that provides methods uniquely suited to
elucidate the complex mechanisms by which social systems influence health by modeling short- and longer
term integrative effects of social life on health in a proven nonhuman primate model."

A fundamental question in cell biology is how this crowded space can be organized to enable the control of
biochemical processes and reactions in space and time. Biomolecular condensates have emerged as a
potential universal solution to how activities and functions are organized within cells. Condensates by nature
are formed via collective interactions between biomolecules which together form concentrated assemblies.
These collective biochemical interactions govern both condensate regulation and function within cells. The
interface of the condensate with the cytosol (interfacial surface) has emerged as a critical molecular
determinant for condensate regulation, and function. Biological Pickering agents absorb the interfacial surface
of condensates and offer a versatile solution for how cellular functions can be compartmentalized. As interest
in biomolecular condensates as an organizing principle in the cell has increased, so have the criticisms of the
quality of evidence supporting the biological significance of condensates in native cells. To overcome these
valid criticisms a key challenge moving forward for the field is the development of technical approaches to
measure and manipulate the collective interactions within these assemblies in native cells. The molecular
mechanics that underpin condensate regulation, dynamics, and function in native cells is not well understood.
During C. elegans embryogenesis, RNA granules called P granules undergo a dramatic stereotyped
polarization within the zygote. Using P granule as a model condensate this proposal aims to define the core
biochemical principles that underpin the spatial and temporal regulation of P granule polarization. The goals of
this proposal are to 1) identify key biochemical determinants that facilitate P granule assembly 2) define the
molecular mechanism by which DYRK kinase regulate P granule disassembly 3) define the biochemical
mechanism by P granule assembly and disassembly is spatially regulated 4) determine the biochemical
mechanism by which biological Pickering agents are removed from the interfacial surface of P granule 5)
define the molecular mechanics that underpin the kinetic arrest of P granules. To accomplish these goals, we
will use a multifaceted approach that includes biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics. Leveraging our unique
in vivo and in vitro assays we will define the collective biochemical grammar that facilitates the regulated
assembly and disassembly of P granules."

 This proposal is focused on the challenge of understanding and thus improving treatment for
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a devastating interstitial lung disease without effective treatments.
Deregulation of lipid signaling and metabolism has long been studied in pulmonary fibrosis, pointing
to changes in sphingolipid and ceramide pathways that may impact pathology. In recent years,
increased attention has been paid to a possible role for senescent cells in the lung as a critical factor
driving pulmonary fibrosis. Senescent cells express inflammatory factors, including signaling lipids,
which may drive the fibrotic process. Current questions include why senescent cells accumulate in
these patients and how their pro-inflammatory activity might be mitigated. An inference is that
preventing formation of senescent cells, blocking their lipid signaling and/or promoting their clearance
from the lung might prevent pulmonary fibrosis or block disease progression.
 Importantly, there may be a direct link between sphingolipid pathways and cellular senescence.
Ceramides have been shown to induce senescence in otherwise proliferating cells. Our studies have
implicated lipid peroxidation and its aldehyde end-products such as 4-hydroxynonenal as key
mediators of accelerated senescence. Transcriptomic, proteomic and lipidomic analysis of
proliferative and senescent lung cells will be used to identify key senescence factors and networks
that may point to the specific lipid metabolic pathways that drive senescence and inflammatory
signaling. We will then examine lipids and modulators for the ability to promote or prevent
senescence. Finally, we will examine whether manipulation of lipid metabolic pathways can be used
to potentiate clearance of senescent cells and thereby limit pulmonary fibrosis. With success in these
studies, we anticipate identification of candidate therapeutics with potential to move to clinical trials."
10942292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) are a growing superfamily that catalyzes an impressive array of chemical
transformations critical to both human health and the environment. GREs share a common glycyl radical cofactor
which allows them to perform challenging, otherwise inaccessible chemistry; however, this simple yet effective
cofactor is extremely oxygen sensitive. Because of the anaerobic nature of these catalysts, they are prevalent
within oxygen-free environments such as the human gut, marine seeps, and crude-oil containing environments.
GREs have been implicated in liver, heart, and kidney diseases and could prove uniquely effective as
bioremediation tools and targets for biodeterioration inhibition; however, most GREs remain uncharacterized. Of
particular interest is a class of GRE known as X-succinate synthases (XSSs), which are prevalent in
hydrocarbon-degrading anaerobes. XSSs catalyze the hydroalkylation of fumarate, in which new C–C bonds are
forged between fumarate and unactivated hydrocarbon substrates. This initial hydrocarbon-activation step allows
for hydrocarbons to be further metabolized by these anaerobes. Through this mechanism, XSS-containing
organisms are able to degrade hydrocarbon pollutants in even the most recalcitrant regions for environmental
remediation. On the other hand, organisms with these enzymes also significantly contribute to microbiologically
influenced corrosion. Beyond their potential environmental significance, XSS enzymes enable challenging
chemistry and could serve as an important addition to the current C–H functionalization toolkit. The work
described here will illuminate key missing mechanistic elements of XSSs and GREs more broadly, characterize
new hydroalkylation enzymes, and explore GRE use in biocatalysis. Here, I aim to use cutting-edge cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) tools and equipment to capture never-before-seen conformations of GREs as well as
novel structures of XSS enzymes. Additionally, I aim to develop methods of installing the glycyl radical cofactor
in vitro, a feat which has not yet been accomplished for any XSS enzyme to date. In vitro installation will allow
us to probe details of hydroalkylation and activation mechanism that have been severely lacking for this class.
Lastly, I will use directed evolution to engineer XSSs as selective hydroalkylation catalysts. Collectively, this work
will provide insight into the ways in which Nature uses enzymes to achieve remarkable chemistry and will allow
us to begin to harness the powerful radical chemistry Nature has to offer. I will complete the K99 phases of Aims
1 (develop a cryo-EM pipeline for XSSs using BSS) and 2 (determine conditions for in vitro activation of XSSs)
during my postdoc in the Drennan lab at MIT. The R00 phases of Aims 1 (structural characterization of an alkyl-
SS) and 2 (directed evolution of XSSs) will take place during my independent career. During the K99 phase, I
will also develop other proposals for job applications, apply for faculty positions at research-intensive institutions,
and continue my professional development through presentations, submission of manuscripts, and outreach
activities."
10942421,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Resilience to brain aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a phenomenon whereby cognitive functioning is
better than predicted based on chronological age, genetic risk and/or advanced neuropathology, likely because
of the presence of as yet unidentified protective factors. These factors, once identified, are expected to provide
key targets for treatment and prevention of AD. However, significant barriers limit discovery of the genetic
mechanisms of resilience using human genetic methods alone, including: difficulties in identifying large
numbers of individuals with asymptomatic AD, extracting age and interacting genetic effects from complex
human genomes, controlling environmental factors, and obtaining brain tissue from asymptomatic AD cases.
Moreover, it is well known that transcript abundance is not sufficient to infer protein abundance, as they differ
spatially, temporally, and in response to learning tasks. Yet, our ability to discern how proteomes change
across aging and AD progression is limited by the impossibility of longitudinal molecular analyses on human
brain tissues, as well as the technology needed to profile cell type-specific proteomes associated with
susceptibility versus resilience to AD. To fill these significant technological and knowledge gaps, here we will
develop a robust pipeline using the most translationally relevant mouse models of human brain aging and AD
(i.e., the AD-BXDs and their non-transgenic Ntg-BXDs controls) to obtain a longitudinal knowledge base of
proteomes in specific cell types that we have found to exhibit robust changes in gene expression associated
with highly susceptible and highly resilient phenotypes. We will focus on the hippocampus as it is required for
spatial memory formation and recall in mice and humans, and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits are
common in AD. Indeed, our work and preliminary data suggest that mouse strain differences in the age at
onset and progression of cognitive deficits in the AD-BXDs (from extremely susceptible to resilient) result from
cell type-specific differences in gene expression in the hippocampus. We will integrate these mouse data with
clinical and omics data from NIA-sponsored AMP-AD and Resilience-AD Consortia to identify molecular drivers
of cognitive resilience. In Aim 1, we will identify cell type-specific changes in neuron and microglia protein
expression associated with resilience to AD using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)
in AD-BXDs. In Aim 2, we will translate drivers and molecular networks underlying cognitive resilience to
human AD cohorts. In Aim 3, we will leverage genetic engineering to functionally validate ‘in-hand’ resilience
candidates by determining their effects on memory, hippocampal neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity in
CRISPRed AD-BXDs. Using this pipeline, we will thereby discover novel and translationally relevant proteins
and complexes for consideration under AMPAD/TREAT-AD drug discovery pipelines to delay or prevent
cognitive symptoms in susceptible AD mice, and ultimately AD patients."

The overall mission of the Deep South KUH PRIME TL1 Training Core is to provide training in interdisciplinary 
and translational research that ensures pre- and post-doctoral trainees will learn the skills and knowledge to 
successfully transition to the next steps of their careers in KUH research. To overcome the challenge presented 
by a lack of researchers adequately trained in basic, clinical and population sciences, we will develop an 
integrated training program that focuses on interdisciplinary and translational research with support from 
experienced mentors and enhanced collaboration. The impact of our program will be felt across the Deep South 
through established strong partnerships between Augusta University, Tulane University and the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham. The TL1 Core is designed to support highly talented trainees from demographically 
and scientifically diverse backgrounds. This includes trainees from nephrology, urology, and non-malignant 
hematology as well as relevant disciplines in pediatrics, surgery, epidemiology, and engineering among others. 
There will be no specific restrictions to joining the KUH PRIME TL1 program across disciplines provided the 
research is relevant to KUH science. While we will leverage successful approaches developed for current T32 
and related programs and other institutional resources, this new program will broaden the spectrum of research 
training to include those not directly funded by the TL1. We will work closely and collaboratively with the U2C 
Administrative, Professional Development and Network Cores to develop a seamless process for developing 
skills that will be critical for achieving success in the modern workforce. The TL1 Core will work with each trainee 
on an individual basis to ensure appropriate mentoring, research opportunities and educational experiences to 
meet their personal and professional goals. Further training will include developing skills in managing and leading 
research teams critical for future success in KUH research. This effort will encompass the spectrum of trainees 
supported by the TL1, institutional trainees supported by extramural awards (R25s, Fs, Ks, CDAs etc.) or other 
mechanisms (graduate, medical, and public health schools, residency programs, and basic & clinical fellowship 
programs). The TL1 Core has three specific aims: 1: Establish didactic training and instructional programs to
expand the knowledge base and interest in scientific discovery of pre- and post-doctoral trainees in the areas 
related to kidney and non-malignant diseases of the upper and lower urologic and hematologic systems, 2: 
Develop individual training plans that include instilling a culture of discovery supported by interdisciplinary, 
translational activities designed to meet individual interests, needs, and goals, and 3: Collaborate with the 
Administrative, Professional Development, and Network Cores to achieve the following mission-oriented 
objectives. These include programs to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented groups, evaluate and 
support the training program, personalize research training with writing, presentation and leadership skills, and 
foster a larger network of mentors, collaborators and peers to engage the broader scientific community."

practices to remove the daunting academic and social barriers that have caused persistent disparities among 
KUH clinicians and researchers, and the direct gains of this training program will be realized most by the KUH

the NC KUH TRIO (Training, Research, Innovation, Outreach, or TRIO) U2C/TL1 Research Training Program. 
The TRIO Training Core has 3 objectives: 1) provide didactics and hands-on experience in rigorous 
basic/translational and clinical sciences research; 2) conduct research that includes adoption of emerging 
technologies and builds on the cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional team science across the KUH mission; 
and 3) establishes and nourishes a community of scholars that expands and sustains diversity in KUH research. 
Multidisciplinary and team research skills will be developed under the Professional Development Core in 
conjunction with Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) programs. A connected community of TRIO
scholars, that spans from high school to early faculty, will be built and supported by the Networking Core. 
Qualified and motivated TRIO mentors will train both pre- and post-doctoral trainees across broad, highly 
relevant KUH scientific specialties that span basic/translational, clinical, and technology arenas. Emerging 
mentors will mature to assure future leadership and longevity of the program. TRIO will exploit existing multi-institutional training infrastructures and programs in biotechnology, public health, translational science, and 
clinical research. A robust and transparent admissions process with targeted recruitment will foster diversity, and 
rigorous program evaluation will allow real-time improvement in serving the needs of our KUH trainees. The

10907534,"Despite advances in prenatal and maternal care, the incidence of pregnancy complications and preterm births
remains high in the United States. Maternal immune tolerance toward the fetus is critical to promote fetal growth,
but the regulatory mechanisms underlying fetal immune cell development remain largely undefined. Interferons
are key regulators for placentation, but excessive interferon responses contribute to fetal resorption. In addition,
maternal neutropenia is frequently associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, which has
been demonstrated to affect the fetus and newborn adversely. Our understanding of the functions of neutrophils
at the maternal-fetal interface, beyond their conventional role in infection, is still very limited. The gut microbiome
undergoes drastic changes during pregnancy. However, the role of maternal gut microbiome immune tolerance
and fetal immune regulation remains poorly understood. We have developed novel techniques to isolate and
characterize placental immune cells in pregnant mice. Built upon our novel discovery of the maternal MDSC-
IFNγ axis at the maternal-fetal interface that is orchestrated by the gut microbiome, the current proposal aims to
define the role of maternal gut microbiome-driven MDSC-IFNγ axis in fetal and neonatal immune development.
Leveraging the methodologies established in our lab to isolate and profile the transcriptome of immune cells, we
will use an unbiased and comprehensive approach to fully appreciate functional changes in the fetal immune
landscape due to perturbations of the gut microbiome. The transcriptomic studies will be coupled with ex vivo
functional studies of tissue immune cells isolated from the placentas and fetal/neonatal intestines, as well as
investigation of specific gut bacteria and metabolites that drive the immune cell changes at the maternal-fetal
interface. First, we will employ an unbiased approach to profile the transcriptome of the fetal immune cells in the
fetal liver and intestine to determine the role of the maternal MDSC-IFNγ axis in the regulation of immune cell
development in these fetal tissues. Secondly, we will investigate how lacking maternal MDSCs during gestation
impacts the postnatal immune development in the intestine, and investigate immune imprinting of T cells by in
utero excessive IFNγ signaling and assess how it impacts the susceptibility to gut inflammation in the offspring.
Upon completion, these studies will have defined the role of maternal gut microbiome, via regulation of the
MDSC-IFNγ axis, shapes the fetal immune landscape and neonatal immune development in the intestine. Our
studies will identify specific fetal immune subsets that are susceptible to perturbed MDSC-IFNγ axis that could
be potential therapeutic/interventive targets. The findings from our studies will provide the framework for future
studies of targeted manipulation of the gut microbiome to modulate these immune pathways to promote fetal
immune cell development."

The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive and state-of-the-art meta-analysis of Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy, Relapse Prevention, and other Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention (CBIs) efficacy,
moderated efficacy, and mediating processes. Building upon our prior work (R21 AA026006; PI: Magill, Co-Is:
Kiluk & Ray; Consultants: Carroll & Tonigan), this R01 project will extract additional functional endpoints from
the prior meta-analytic sample (i.e., K~100 primary studies), will conduct an updated search to yield all recent
trials, and will incorporate advanced methodologies such as Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) and Individual
Participant Data Meta-Analysis (IPD). In our prior work, consumption frequency and heavy frequency at one
early and one late follow-up time point were the a priori indicators of interest. However, the dialogue on what
constitutes an optimal endpoint in randomized clinical trials has grown in recent years (e.g., ACTIVE Initiative),
arguing that a range of functional endpoints beyond abstinence or heavy consumption should be of greater
emphasis in treatment development and clinical outcome research. Alternative endpoints such as related
problems, coping behaviors, and mental and general health are certainly of interest to patients, families, and
clinical providers. These indicators have additionally become key constructs in the what defines recovery.
Preliminary analyses of the sample of trials reviewed in R21 AA026006 show that data for 4 to 50 possible
endpoints are available per study, and that approximately 79% of the available data have yet to be
collected, analyzed, or reported. In addition, using the methods of R21 AA023662 (PI: Magill), direct data
requests for a selection of alcohol use disorder (AUD) studies will be conducted, and a number of relevant PIs
have already agreed to meet such requests. In this case, a two-stage IPD will be used to conduct an aggregate
path analysis of CBI process, considering putative mechanisms of CBI efficacy. Although R01-level meta-analytic
projects have been conducted on a) alcohol pharmacotherapies, b) DUI interventions, c) brief interventions for
adolescents/young adults, and d) combined AUD and trauma-related therapies, no such project has been
undertaken on CBIs, and this is despite their longevity and centrality in direct patient care for alcohol and other
drug use disorders. The proposed project, extracting all available endpoints from the published reports,
conducting data requests for AUD trials specifically, and conducting NMA to account for variability in type of
contrast condition will inform clinical and methodological recommendations on: 1) CBI implementation and
delivery, 2) optimal endpoints for measuring CBI effect, and 3) defining and understanding recovery in the context

manage type I diabetes. Currently, lifelong whole-body immunosuppression is administered to avoid immune
rejection of the transplant, despite the associated life-threatening adverse effects. Clinical studies reveal that
transplants eventually fail due to lack of vascular support for nutrients and oxygen supply and host immune
rejection. To address all these critical needs and supported by preliminary studies, we propose the NICHE, an
innovative subcutaneous vascularized encapsulation system with local elution of immunosuppressants to protect
transplanted cells from immune rejection. The NICHE presents dual transcutaneously refillable reservoirs, for
drug and cells, respectively, separated by a nanoporous membrane. Local immunosuppressant delivery confines
drugs to the graft site where immune attack occurs, minimizing exposure to the rest of the body, thus avoiding
systemic immunosuppression and associated adverse effects. The NICHE cell reservoir is fully vascularized with
functional vessels, recreating an ideal physiological environment conducive for maintaining long-term viability
and function of transplanted cells. We hypothesize that the NICHE will provide a vascularized environment
with local immunosuppressant delivery conducive for successful long-term islet allotransplantation to
restore euglycemia in diabetic nonhuman primates (NHP). In aim 1, we will study the efficacy and safety of
local immunosuppressant combinations as well as characterize their release from the NICHE via in vitro studies.
This will be followed in aim to define the optimal local immunosuppression regimen for islet allotransplantation
in NICHE and establish drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in healthy NHP. In aim 3, we will evaluate
the curative efficacy of NICHE with allotransplanted islets to restore and maintain euglycemia in diabetic NHPs
for one year. The proposed studies are based on our team’s extensive expertise in implantable drug and cell
delivery systems, tissue engineering, research and clinical transplantation, transplant immunology, type 1
diabetes, as well as supportive preliminary data and previously published work. Importantly, the NICHE is
designed prioritizing clinical considerations of efficacy, safety and user acceptability. Transcutaneous cell and
drug refilling allow for ease of drug replenishment when needed, thus extending implant lifespan potentially for
the lifetime of patients. Further, the thin and compact size of the NICHE, which is smaller than the encapsulation
implants under clinical investigation, is favorable for user acceptability. Successful completion of the proposed
work will provide a broadly applicable encapsulation system with localized immunosuppressant delivery for long-
term protection of transplanted islets, as well as minimize adverse effects associated with immunosuppressive
drugs. This could translate to a clinical breakthrough for deployment of cell therapies beyond islets, including
stem cell-derived β cells, to treat diabetes as well as other diseases."
10907686,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While clinical use of therapeutic proteins has grown exponentially in recent decades, utility is often limited by
unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK), mediated by rapid elimination. One approach to overcome this limitation is
half-life extension (HLE), achieved by attachment of biotherapeutics to polymers (PEG), plasma proteins
(albumin, IgG), and blood cells. There is a paucity of data describing the impact of properties of cargo proteins
and HLE-conferring ligands on PK of proteins tested using these strategies. One area where HLE has the
potential to advance clinical therapy is acute, life-threatening, thrombosis (pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke,
etc.). The only pharmacologic treatment available for treatment of this condition is infusion of plasminogen
activators, which have an unfavorable pharmacologic profile, mediated by a half-life of minutes, rapid inactivation
in plasma, and severe adverse effects (e.g. hemorrhagic transformation). Pilot data demonstrates that
conjugation of a derivative of urokinase selectively activated in thrombin-rich pathological thrombi (scuPA-T) to
an albumin-binding nanobody (Nb) leads to PK that is identical to RBC-binding scuPA-T, an approach pioneered
by Drs. Muzykantov and Cines, albeit with distribution in the plasma rather than the cellular fraction of blood.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that coupling of scuPA-T to albumin-binding ligands will
provide prolonged circulation, mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and selective thrombolysis
of pathological thrombi, sparing hemostatic plugs from lysis. In the mentored stage, the impact of
properties of the cargo drug on FcRn-enabled HLE will be identified, using FcRn knockout mice to directly
elucidate the FcRn-mediated component of HLE conferred by albumin binding (Aim 1; K99). Based on pilot
data, safety and efficacy of albumin-binding scuPA-T will be studied in a mouse model of pulmonary embolism.
These results will be used to develop a predictive modeling platform that will be used to for further engineering
and PK optimization of HLE-scuPA-T constructs (Aim 2; K99). With an eye on mechanistic and translational
advancement of this strategy, the role of albumin-binding affinity on the PK of scuPA-T will be defined, using a
newly developed library of nanobodies (Aim 3; R00). Additionally, thrombin-cleavable HLE ligands will be
devised, permitting selective release of scuPA-T in thrombi, improving diffusion into clots and lysis (Aim 3; R00).
Overarching themes of this proposal include identification of critical features of albumin-mediated HLE and
mechanism-based modeling to guide optimization and reengineering of protein therapeutics. A mentoring team
has been identified with expertise spanning the areas of research in this grant, namely, thrombosis and
hemostasis, antibody engineering, and mathematical modeling of biological systems. Mentored research will be
conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, which has a highly collegial and collaborative faculty and extensive
resources available to conduct the proposed research. This proposal is geared towards gaining the expertise
necessary to be successful as a tenured faculty member conducting high quality biomedical research."

 Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is a complex rheumatic disorder distinguished by autoimmune targeting of exocrine
glands. Severe clinical manifestations may include debilitating dryness, pulmonary dysfunction, neuropathies,
profound fatigue, and lymphoma. Salivary gland lesions involve activated ductal and acinar epithelial cells as
well as irreversible immune-mediated tissue damage. Diagnosis and treatment of SS are notoriously difficult.
Our group leads the international Sjögren’s Genetics Network (SGENE) comprised of 26 SS research groups
dedicated to understanding the genetic architecture of SS. SGENE studies have identified 15 of the 16 SS risk
loci thus far established in European-derived populations. SS risk loci coalesce in Type I and Type II interferon
(IFN), NFkB signaling, antigen presentation, autoantibody production and lymphocyte trafficking pathways. Our
genetic studies have provided strong evidence supporting a pathogenic role in SS from various innate and
adaptive immune cell subsets, however, how these cell types are functionally affected by SS risk alleles remain
poorly understood. Importantly, these studies also suggest new therapeutic targets, such as IL12 signaling, for
which biologic therapies have been developed for related autoimmune diseases, but not previously considered
in SS. Preliminary data in 2,809 SS cases suggest >40 additional candidate loci that warrant further study. Using
insights from our genetic studies, we have developed a novel model of disease pathogenesis that differentiates
3 major patient subsets based on distinct molecular mechanisms. Our overall goals are to develop a more
complete model of SS genetic determinants and to identify biomarkers that reflect the distinct molecular
mechanisms represented in our disease model that could be developed into clinical tools for stratifying patients.
In Aim 1, we will greatly expand our current genome-wide association studies by leveraging our unique access
to samples, laboratory and clinical data from well-characterized SGENE cohorts (>10,000 SS cases). In Aim 2,
we will test known SS risk variants for cell specific cis-regulatory effects on transcription in salivary gland tissues.
Banked tissues obtained from minor labial gland biopsies from subjects (n=200) classified into the 3 major patient
subsets defined in our proposed disease model, plus a subset of patients with lymphoma and controls will be
evaluated. Spatial transcriptomic technologies will be utilized to generate gene expression data in which
morphological context is retained at nearly single cell resolution. In Aim 3, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic
and proteomic data to develop multidimensional panels of soluble immune mediators that can serve as peripheral
biomarkers for these patient subgroups to facilitate patient stratification. These studies will expand our
understanding of genetic contributors to SS, identify cell-specific functional effects on transcription, foster
development of new clinical tools for more accurate diagnostics, and establish the feasibility of rapid clinical
translation for therapeutic targeting in well-defined patient subsets using novel and existing biologics directed
against pathways and cell types that drive this complex autoimmune disorder.

10907848,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The 14 million cancer survivors living in the US clearly demonstrate continued improvements in anti-
cancer treatment efficacy; yet, this success has been tempered by a parallel rise in the incidence of cancer
treatment-related cardiotoxicity, leading to morbidity and mortality. A prominent example of this conundrum
involves Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), first-line therapy in kidney cancer, the 16th most common cause of
death worldwide. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 90% of all cases with ~143,000
deaths/year. The incidence and prevalence of RCC have been increasing over the last 50 years, and with the
growth of the US elderly population, these numbers will only continue to increase.
 Mounting data support that TKIs can modify and inhibit cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.5, and
in general play a key role in cardiac excitability. At the same time, TKIs have been shown to increase reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes. In turn, ROS is known to activate the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent kinase II (CaMKII), which resides at the hub of a pro-arrhythmia signaling hub in cardiac myocytes.
In previous work, we have shown that CaMKII promotes arrhythmia in part through direct phosphorylation of
Nav1.5 at Ser571 with a concomitant increase in INa,L. Notably, INa,L has importance in regulating contractility in
normal heart, thus of all the potential ion channels to target for cardioprotection, INa,L inhibition could prevent
arrhythmias and adverse structural remodeling in patients taking TKIs. Based on these data, we will test the
hypothesis that TKI-induced arrhythmia acts in part through oxidative activation of CaMKII and increased
excitability cardiac myocytes. Thus, we propose INa,L is an attractive target to prevent TKI induced cardiotoxicity
 Results will inform clinical decision making regarding drug-induced arrhythmias, inform mechanistic
approaches to prevent Ca2+ overload, and define an innovative approach using drugs readily available on the
market as cardioprotective agents for patients during TKI therapy. We propose to: 1) Determine the role of TKIs
in modulating cardiac myocyte excitability 2) Define the impact of TKIs on cardiac phenotypes, and 3) Define
potential therapeutic strategies that mitigate TKI-induced cardiac dysfunction."
10907851,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high mortality and increasing prevalence. After AKI, some patients can fully recover but AKI is a risk factor for, and may progress to, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kidney repair is a key determinant of the outcome or prognosis of AKI survivors. Especially, maladaptive kidney repair after severe or multiple episodes of AKI often leads to chronic renal pathologies characterized by tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and progressive decline of renal function. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is a major epigenetic mechanism in health and disease. However, very few studies examined DNA methylation in AKI and post-AKI kidney repair. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated the induction of DNMT1 and DNMT3a along with DNA methylation during kidney repair. We further suggested the involvement of DNA methylation in maladaptive kidney repair by showing the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza), a pharmacological inhibitor of DNMT. In addition, our global DNA methylation assay has identified differential DNA methylation of multiple genes in post-IRI kidneys, among which homeobox A5 (Hoxa5) and microRNA-219 (miR-219) were hypermethylated at their gene promoters and the hypermethylation was associated with down-regulation of their expression. In this application, we hypothesize that: DNA methylation by DNMTs plays a critical role in maladaptive kidney repair after ischemic AKI. Specifically, hypermethylation of Hoxa5 and miR-219 leads to down-regulation of these genes, resulting in changes in downstream gene expression for the development of renal fibrosis. We propose three specific aims to: 1, test the hypothesis that DNA methylation by DNMTs plays a critical role in maladaptive kidney repair; 2, test the hypothesis that hypermethylation leads to the down-regulation of Hoxa5 in maladaptive kidney repair resulting in pro-fibrotic cell signaling for renal fibrosis; and 3, test the hypothesis that hypermethylation represses miR-219 in maladaptive kidney repair leading to pro-fibrosis gene expression. The work will gain significant new insights into epigenetic regulation of kidney repair. Moreover, by targeting DNA methylation, we may identify novel therapeutic strategies to improve kidney repair and the prognosis of AKI survivors."
10905250,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis (MASH) (aka NAFLD and
NASH) affects 1 billion people, yet no approved therapy is available. Interestingly, our new antidiabetic small
molecule thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) inhibitor, TIX100, effectively protected obese and diabetic mice
against steatosis and showed anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic effects in a non-diabetic, non-obese, model of
MASH. Of note, Txnip is known to promote oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammasome activation and to be
elevated in livers of humans and mice with NAFLD/NASH. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that TIX100
protects against MASLD/MASH by improving glucose and lipid homeostasis and inhibiting inflammation
and fibrosis. We propose 3 Specific Aims: #1: Determine the therapeutic effects of TIX100 in the context of
diet-induced obesity and non-obese MASLD and MASH models. #2: Define the cellular TIX100 effects controlling
MASH-associated inflammation and fibrosis and #3: Elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of TIX100 in MASLD/MASH. To this end, we will assess liver histology, markers for lipogenesis,
inflammation and fibrosis, hepatic and circulating lipids, and liver dysfunction, as well as any potential changes
in whole body metabolism. This will be done in the context of MASLD, induced by high-fat diet obesity and of
MASH and fibrosis, induced by a validated choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet. Involvement of
carbohydrate response-element-binding protein, a key transcription factor of Txnip and lipogenic genes will also
be determined by liver chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies. In addition, we will elucidate the specific TIX100
effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and fibrogenesis, Kupffer cells and inflammation and cell autonomous
effects using isolated primary hepatocytes. Using liver microRNA sequencing, we further discovered miR-34a
as the top microRNA downregulated by TIX100. Intriguingly, miR-34a has been reported to promote lipogenesis
and inflammation and to be upregulated in livers of humans and mice with MASLD/MASH. Now, our preliminary
studies reveal that TIX100 treatment reduces the elevated miR-34a levels of MASLD/MASH and we will therefore
continue to define the effects of TIX100 on miR-34a signaling in our liver, hepatocyte and HSC samples. To
validate Txnip as a TIX100 target in the treatment of MASLD/MASH, we will take advantage of our whole body
and liver cell-specific Txnip-deficient mouse models and expose them to DIO and CDAA-induced MASLD/MASH
with and without TIX100 treatment. This will allow us to tease apart any Txnip-mediated (and potential Txnip-
independent) effects and further define the mechanism(s) of TIX100 action in the treatment of MASLD/MASH.
Thus, the results of these studies will provide mechanistic insight and critical preclinical data for the
development of novel therapeutic approaches for MASLD/MASH at the intersection of metabolism, inflammation,
and fibrosis. Since TIX100 has already undergone extensive preclinical safety toxicology and pharmacokinetic
studies in preparation for first-in-man trials, the proposed studies also promise a high translational impact."
10905251,"ABSTRACT
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common congenital viral infection in the U.S., affecting
approximately 18,500 liveborn infants annually. Children with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection at birth can
suffer from permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities including cerebral palsy, intellectual impairments, visual
deficits, and sensorineural hearing loss. Treatment with the antiviral drug, valganciclovir, improves neurologic
outcomes, but drug adverse effects preclude universal antiviral treatment for all cCMV infected infants. Among
adults with primary CMV infection, natural killer (NK) cells serve as the first antiviral defense and are rapidly
followed by T cell responses that effectively control viral replication. In contrast, cCMV infected infants lack robust
antiviral T cell responses to cCMV infection over the first year after birth. These T cells express an exhausted
phenotype and fail to control viral replication for months to years. In-utero NK cell responses arise during cCMV
infection, but the contribution of these cells to viral control and neurologic outcomes are unstudied. We compared
the NK cell immunophenotypes of cCMV infected and uninfected neonates by CITE-seq and found 4 clusters of
cytotoxic NK cells induced by cCMV infection. These clusters expressed both activating and inhibitory receptors
associated with both NK cells and T cells, and one cluster expressed an inhibitory signature typically observed
during T cell exhaustion. Flow cytometry confirmed that cCMV-induced NK cells expressed inhibitory receptors,
but NK cells of CMV seropositive adults did not. We therefore hypothesize that in-utero CMV infection induces
novel cytotoxic NK cell responses with adaptive-like features that differ from adult responses. We further propose
that cytotoxic NK cell function differs between cCMV infected individuals, is altered by antiviral treatment, and
may correlate with neurologic outcome. In this project we will characterize the adaptive-like features of cCMV-
induced NK cells using blood samples collected longitudinally from a large cohort of cCMV infected infants, CMV
uninfected infants, and CMV seropositive adults. Aim 1 will define the immunophenotype and cytotoxic potential
of NK cells induced by cCMV infection using CITE-seq, spectral flow cytometry, and in-vitro cytotoxicity assays.
Aim 2 will determine the effect of antiviral treatment upon cytotoxic NK cell quantities and immunophenotypes
and explore potential associations between NK cell parameters and cCMV neurologic outcomes. Together,
these studies will elucidate novel features of NK cell responses induced by in-utero viral infection that differ from
adult responses and investigate their relationship to clinical treatments and outcomes among children with
congenital CMV infection."

Sleep is critical for brain maturation and development in childhood, and for neuronal healing after injury.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common pediatric critical illness affecting more than 50,000 children annually,
half of whom suffer acute and chronic sleep wake disturbances (SWD) leading to impaired quality of life. These
children also suffer substantial cognitive impairments for many years after injury, particularly in domains of
executive function, leading to reduced academic performance and psychosocial dysfunction. Whether sleep
disturbances significantly compound these cognitive deficits after TBI remains unknown. Additionally, effective
therapies shown to prevent or improve SWD and executive dysfunction among these vulnerable children are
lacking. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SWD are an independent and modifiable risk factor for
executive function impairment in children surviving TBI. The objectives of the proposed research are to: 1)
Determine the longitudinal association between SWD and executive function after pediatric TBI in a
prospective cohort study using both questionnaires and objective measures, 2) Evaluate feasibility and
effectiveness of an early melatonin and sleep management intervention started during hospitalization in a
single-center randomized controlled trial.
Dr. Cydni Williams is a Pediatric Critical Care physician at Oregon Health & Science University where she
cares for critically ill children acutely in the pediatric intensive care unit and longitudinally in a critical care
follow-up clinic. Her work has identified SWD as an important morbidity affecting more than half of critical care
survivors, particularly in the large number of TBI survivors she follows. Her long-term goal is to improve
longitudinal outcomes and quality of life through rigorous studies identifying effective interventions to improve
sleep disturbances after pediatric critical care, by first evaluating the high risk cohort of TBI survivors. This
career development proposal will provide Dr. Williams with experiential and mentored training conducting sleep
research, clinical trial methodology, and longitudinal data analyses. This proposal is significant because it
addresses the common and debilitating morbidity of SWD that affect thousands of pediatric TBI survivors
annually, advances clinical care and research through testing an early sleep management intervention, and
aligns with the National Institutes of Health Sleep Disorders Research Plan. This research and multi-
disciplinary mentored training will provide Dr. Williams with data and research expertise needed to pursue
independent research funding to evaluate SWD in pediatric TBI and other critical illness survivors."

The proposed training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Vaishnavi Kundel, MD, by
building upon her strong background in clinical sleep medicine to engage in patient-oriented research, and
develop expertise in exploring the role of sleep in cardiometabolic disease risk. Through this proposal, she will
obtain multidisciplinary training to investigate chronic sleep deprivation and sleep irregularity as potentially
modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis and visceral adiposity measured using multi-modality imaging - hybrid
18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MRI. Research plan: The proposed research builds on Dr. Kundel's pilot
studies funded by the AASM. The aims are to determine whether habitual short sleep duration and sleep
irregularity are associated with increased vascular inflammation and visceral adiposity (which is strongly linked
to increased CVD risk), independent of OSA (often a confounder in these associations). We will utilize multi-day
actigraphy to collect objective sleep metrics, and PET/MRI to measure vascular inflammation and visceral
adipose tissue (VAT) metabolic activity (a novel marker of adipose tissue inflammation) in the recruited patients.
With successful completion of the proposed training and research, we hope to underscore the role of chronic
sleep deprivation and sleep irregularity in cardiometabolic risk, establishing an index of imaging biomarkers for
future research. Moreover, the results will provide direction for future (R01) proposals - laying the groundwork
for developing multidisciplinary collaborations to elucidate mechanisms by which sleep modulates inflammation,
with a long-term goal of identifying biomarkers of early cardiovascular risk in this subset of patients, and
designing sleep extension studies. Career Development: Dr. Kundel's training plan features an outstanding
research environment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai along with nationally renowned mentors
and advisors with complimentary expertise. Her primary mentoring team comprises of (a) Dr. Neomi Shah, MD,
MPH, MS (expert in obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] and cardiovascular (CV) diseases, and application of
advanced cardiovascular imaging in OSA) (b) Dr. Indu Ayappa, PhD, (recipient of a mentored K-24 award, with
expertise in OSA, sleep physiology, and use of actigraphy for objective sleep assessments) (c) Drs. Zahi Fayad
and Philip Robson, PhD (experts in use of multimodality imaging for assessment of atherosclerosis and organ
system biology). Her training features a combination of carefully designed coursework and practical experiences
in 1) actigraphy for comprehensive assessments of objective sleep metrics 2) multi-modality cardiometabolic
imaging 3) clinical study design and patient-oriented research 4) training in biomarker science for future
proposals. Together, her mentors and advisors have a successful track record of mentoring junior faculty in
career development awards, with extensive collaborations and grant portfolios to provide a solid foundation for
Dr. Kundel's present proposal, and ultimate success in developing into an independent investigator."
10907853,"Over 17,000 will die from bladder cancer in the U.S. this year. While most patients with noninvasive tumors are
cured, most patients with muscle-invasive disease will develop metastases and die. Therefore, understanding
and targeting the molecular driver(s) which facilitate this invasive switch is essential to improve patient
outcomes. TRIM29 is a critical driver of bladder cancer initiation, invasion and therapeutic resistance in human
tumors and mouse models. TRIM29 promotes tumor formation by regulating protein interactions that govern
beta-catenin and miRNA activity. TRIM29 impacts therapeutic resistance by regulating ubiquitination of DNA
repair and innate immune pathways. The specific mechanism by which TRIM29 drives invasive progression
remains poorly understood. Rationale: Emerging evidence from our lab has identified a novel function of
TRIM29 in the regulation of intermediate filaments, focal adhesion and FAK/Src signaling. However, we do not
yet understand how this TRIM29-focal adhesion axis is regulated, how it participates in progression from non-
invasive to invasive cancers in vivo or how it coordinates with previously identified mechanisms to promote
invasive progression. This is a critical gap in knowledge because without a clear understanding of these
events, we are unable to develop therapeutic strategies to target this pathway and prevent progression to the
lethal invasive form of bladder cancer. The specific objective of this proposal is to identify the role of this novel
TRIM29-focal adhesion axis in invasive progression and to use this knowledge to develop therapeutic
strategies to block invasive progression in high-risk TRIM29+ tumors. The central hypothesis is that TRIM29
drives progression from noninvasive to lethal invasive bladder cancer by driving intermediate filament
and focal adhesion formation, and activation of FAK/Src signaling in invasive cells. This hypothesis will
be tested in the following specific aims: 1) To conduct detailed structure-function analysis of the TRIM29
interaction with intermediate filaments, the focal adhesion complex, and FAK/Src signaling during invasion. 2)
To determine the requirement for TRIM29, KRT14, and focal adhesion proteins during bladder cancer initiation
and invasive progression. 3) To evaluate novel therapeutic strategies to block TRIM29-mediated invasion in
bladder cancer. Aim 1 will utilize live cell imaging, 3D and animal models of invasion. Aim 2 will leverage
unique GEMM of bladder cancer to dissect the essential functions of TRIM29 in vivo. Aim 3 will use our
multiple models to identify therapeutic strategies to target TRIM29-mediated invasion. This research is
conceptually innovative in the characterization of a novel TRIM29-focal adhesion pathway of invasive
progression and technically innovative in the development of novel bladder cancer murine models, advanced
3D tumor invasion assays and novel therapeutic targeting strategies. The proposed research is significant
because description of the mechanism of TRIM29-mediated invasive progression will allow identification of
novel therapeutic strategies to block development of lethal invasive progression in bladder cancer."
10938773,"Project Summary:
Correlating metabolic changes with external or internal stimuli and cellular manipulations in high spatial detail
is important for understanding causation and correlation in biological systems. Especially, direct pixel-by-pixel
correlation of multiple observable quantities, e.g., metabolism, diffusion of proteins, membrane fluidity, is
difficult to observe simultaneously. Connecting these physical and biophysical behaviors across multiple
imaging modalities can enable us to understand how inhibition of one property, e.g. changing the diffusion of
the protein, can influence other properties such as metabolism or membrane fluidity. This type of correlation
and causation-based simultaneous imaging in the same biological system is something that is lacking in
current fluorescence imaging-based systems. Investigation of these properties in high resolution via confocal
and multiphoton fluorescence microscopes enables us to interrogate cellular and subcellular details of these
interactions. The goal of my research program is to create a framework and seamless workflow of imaging
methodology where all of these fundamental properties and interactions can be quantified and correlated at the
native resolution of the acquired image. To do so, we propose combining the phasor approach to Fluorescence
Lifetime Imaging (phasor-FLIM), phasor approach to hyperspectral imaging (sp-phasor) and phasor approach
to Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (phasor-FCS). We will further create an imaging biophysics
research program which combines single-molecule (SM) and ensemble fluorescence experiments in vitro and
in solution to get a deeper detail at the fundamental questions arising from the molecular interactions. Most
imaging approaches are focused on increasing resolution (either in time or space) for structural elucidation.
Our approach towards imaging is fundamentally different because we are focused on understanding the
functional aspects and quantifying physical properties that can be observed using imaging modalities. In the
next 5 years we want to establish the principle of this multiparametric and multidimensional phasor imaging
and apply them to various biological systems, both in cells and in tissues. Our future goal is to combine the
analysis methods developed here with camera-based systems, including light sheet microscopy, and extend
these approaches to a faster instrumentation and eventually to whole-organism imaging."

Our program has focused on the translation of transplantation biology from the laboratory to the clinic to improve
the outcome of blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). The development of high-dose post-transplant
cyclophosphamide (PTCy) to modulate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a prime example of our group’s
successful translational research. PTCy allows safe mismatched alloBMT with results similar to those seen with
matched donors, as well as permits virtually anyone in need of BMT to undergo the procedure. The median age
of patients diagnosed with most hematologic malignancies is 65 or older. Refinements over the years to
allogeneic BMT, including the use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and newer GVHD prophylaxis
platforms, allow patients at least up to age 80 to undergo the procedure. Accordingly, the median age of patients
enrolled on the recent large, multi-institutional trial undertaken by the BMT CTN that established PTCy-based
GVHD prophylaxis as the new standard of care, was 66. Nevertheless, transplant-related toxicities are higher in
older patients, especially those over 70, and traditional pretransplant risk assessment tools such as
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) do not predict risk as well in older patients
receiving RIC conditioning. Thus, improving BMT outcomes in older patients is critically important. Our
preliminary data suggest clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in older BMT recipients with lymphoid malignancies (to
exclude myeloid MRD masquerading as CH) is associated with significantly increased non-relapse mortality
(NRM) despite subsequent replacement by healthy donor hematopoiesis. Accordingly, older patients without CH
have the same NRM as younger patients. Detection of CH may add important prognostic information to current
risk stratification strategies for older patients. We would like to confirm these findings in a larger, independent
cohort of older recipients and include myeloid malignancies. Moreover, it may be possible to ameliorate the
effects of CH. Our specific objectives as a Core Clinical Center are to: 1) participate in multicenter trials through
the BMT CTN, 2) validate CH as a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in a large cohort of older alloBMT patients,
and 3) if the role of CH is confirmed, propose a clinical trial to address CH."

Addiction to alcohol represents a major public health issue exacting tremendous financial and social costs.
Despite this, alcohol addiction remains a recalcitrant condition with conventional pharmacotherapies lacking
substantial and durable efficacy. Much of the existing research into the neurobiology and treatment of alcohol
addiction has focused on limbic reward circuitry, changes in neurotransmission, and intracellular neuronal
signaling cascades. However, in recent years there has been a surge in research examining the role of epigenetic
factors in the development of pathological alcohol use disorders. Epigenetic control of gene expression plays a
critical role in processing neural activity in the adult brain, and there is clear evidence in humans and animal
models that link changes in brain chromatin to addiction. In recent years, chromatin-bound metabolic enzymes
have emerged as central players in epigenetic regulation, leading to a fundamental shift in models of
transcriptional regulation, and implicating epigenetic-metabolic processes in the molecular and behavioral
response to alcohol. This NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will significantly facilitate the
candidate’s, Dr. Mews, ability to begin his career as an independent scientist, allowing him to study new
perspectives of this metabolic-epigenetic gene regulation by alcohol, and to explore epigenetic factors as novel
therapeutic targets in alcohol use disorders. In the mentored K-phase of this grant (Specific Aim 1 and Specific
Aim 2), the contribution of peripheral alcohol metabolism in the liver to histone acetylation in the brain will be
determined in a translationally relevant binge drinking model in rodents. Alcohol-induced histone acetylation will
be assayed both locally and globally in the hippocampus, a region intimately linked to alcohol addiction
vulnerability, and the direct modulation of gene expression by alcohol-derived acetate that originates in hepatic
alcohol metabolism will be tested. Further, viral manipulation of gene expression to manipulate acetyl-CoA
metabolism will be used to establish causality and determine whether the metabolic-epigenetic ACSS2 pathway
links alcohol-driven histone acetylation to increased consumption and alcohol-related learning. In the
independent phase (R00), Specific Aim 3, we will combine these conceptually and technically innovative
approaches with translational binge drinking models to investigate the chromatin-based targeting mechanisms
that allow ACSS2 to regulate specific gene expression induced by alcohol in the brain. In summary, the research
proposed in this Pathway to Independence Award will illuminate the metabolic-epigenetic mechanisms by which
alcohol influences neuronal processes as well as alcohol-related learning and drinking behavior; while
simultaneously preparing the candidate with an unique set of intellectual and technical skills that will allow him
to develop a fully independent research program on alcohol addiction that is capable of integrating a wide range
of neuroepigenetic and behavioral approaches in a technically advanced and high impact manner."

Mental health issues and suicide attempts have risen among young people under 18, resulting in a declaration
of a national state of emergency for child mental health, with rural communities particularly at risk for health
disparities and with widening gaps in health equity. Addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) needs is
a crucial foundation to support children with broader health and education initiatives, including improving
school attendance with over one in four children at risk for chronic poor attendance and associated negative
outcomes. Schools are a promising way to address these health and education disparities where most children
spend most of their time and are often a trusted center of rural communities. School-based health centers are
equipped to address health needs, but often do not have capacity to meet growing social determinants of
health needs of children and their families. Community health workers (CHW) have emerged as a way to
bridge this gap between high healthcare and high social service’s needs,with the proposed clinical trial the first
to evaluate school-based CHW impact on an education outcome (attendance). The current study leverages a
robust healthcare-school- community network to evaluate the impact of school-based community health
workers in Southeast Kansas, the poorest rural region of the state. The proposed cluster randomized
crossover trial will test the Health Equity and Rural Education (HERE!) school- based community health worker
(CHW) intervention, compared to Enhanced Usual Care in 12 rural school-based health centers. The clinical
trial will include three 18-month cohorts to inform school-level and student-level outcomes across 1,200
Kindergarten through 12th grade students. In Aim 1, we will compare attendance outcomes for rural youth in
the school based CHW interventions versus youth in an Enhanced Usual Care condition. In Aim 2, we will
compare the school-based CHW intervention with the EUC condition related to impact on utilization of school-
based health center onsite and telehealth services and on socio-emotional learning and school climate. We will
also explore the RE-AIM (intervention reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) domains, including
rural factors associated with impact and sustainability. Through leveraging the healthcare-community
partnership, the HERE! clinical trial is a first step in reimagining care delivery at school. If successful, the
ultimate goal is to advance this sustainable, scalable intervention that meets individual needs, advances
community level social determinants of health, and ultimately, advances health equity at the system level."

Guanine-rich G-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences are enriched at promoter proximal regions of the genome,
in particular those of cancer and DNA repair-related genes. These regions are hot spots for oxidative lesions
such as 8oxoG, coupling their repair via the base excision repair (BER) pathway to transcriptional regulation.
Unfortunately, the molecular level interactions and mechanistic details of the coupled repair and gene regulation
are not well understood, including the role of DNA structural dynamics, the precise mechanisms of repair and
gene activation, the role of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region and redox mechanism of BER protein
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1).
My goal as the leader of my independent research program at Fox Chase over the next five years is to empower
and support a diverse team of young scientists to characterize the molecular-level interactions and coordination
events coupling the repair of oxidative DNA damage and gene enhancement at G4 promoters in response to
oxidative DNA damage. This will involve implementing a multi-disciplinary approach of techniques ranging from
structural biology and single-molecule fluorescence to cell-based assays.
By filling the current gaps in knowledge I will position my research program toward our long-term vision of
developing novel therapeutics that can modulate transcription of key disease-associated genes through
interfering with the key regulatory protein:protein and/or protein:DNA interactions."

Among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), daily diabetes self-management occurs in social contexts with close
family and friends (herein, “family”). We recently developed, replicated, and longitudinally validated a typology
of diabetes-specific family functioning. We identified four conceptually distinct profiles (""types"") which were
independently associated with diabetes self-management and psychological well-being, cross-sectionally and
over time. The typology is applicable across diverse family structures, replicated in racially diverse samples, can
be assessed through a survey tool, and has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in interventions for adults
with diabetes. Therefore, within our recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a family-
focused mobile phone-delivered intervention we applied the typology post-hoc to explore intervention
engagement and effects by family functioning type. From these analyses, we know which types did and did not
benefit from the family-focused intervention and have developed hypotheses informed by mixed-methods
preliminary data about how to tailor the existing intervention to benefit other types. Therefore, we propose to
apply the family functioning typology proactively to inform an innovative, adaptive intervention to meet
participants' evolving needs. The proposed type-informed adaptive intervention leverages our existing
infrastructure to provide mobile phone-delivered intervention components, including: goal setting and
monitoring (via phone coaching and text message support), skill building (via phone coaching), and the option
to invite a friend or family member to participate in the intervention as a support person. These components
will be turned on/off or adapted per most recent type assessment, tailoring both intervention form (individual
vs. family) and content focus (disease vs. personal skills). We will enroll N=405 adults with T2D receiving
primary care in the mid-South in a RCT lasting 16 months, including a 12-month intervention period, with
assessments every 4 months. We aim to (1) evaluate the innovative type-informed adaptive mobile phone-
delivered intervention relative to enhanced treatment as usual on hemoglobin A1c, diabetes distress, global
well-being, diabetes self-efficacy and self-care behaviors, and (2) evaluate intervention effects for each type to
discern which types experienced clinical benefit and inform which types need different intervention
components. We will evaluate effects during the intervention, post-intervention, and sustained 4 months after
the intervention ends. This project aligns with the NIH-wide strategic plan 2021-2025 to advance research on
“giving the right treatment to the right patient at the right time” (p.12) and advances this plan through its novel
focus on (a) a behavioral intervention and (b) family context as a key tailoring variable. Moreover, the proposed
intervention is consistent with the American Diabetes Association's Standards of Care 2023 recommendation
for systems that combine automated technology and coaching to support adults with diabetes."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients ventilated
for acute respiratory failure. Despite extensive study, little is known about the pathogenesis of ARDS in humans.
One salient finding is that barotrauma or ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) from high-pressure ventilation
is a consistent signal for ARDS risk regardless of the underlying disease. Beyond lung protective (low pressure)
ventilation, ARDS lacks specific treatments in large part due to the lack of knowledge about the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of pathology. Here, we will take advantage of an established ex vivo ventilation and lung
perfusion (EVLP) system to directly assess the initial cellular and molecular responses to VALI in human lung.
Importantly, each individual will serve as their own control, achieved by ventilating the right and left lung under
high and low pressure, respectively. Some studies will incorporate hyperoxia, elevated PEEP, or live bacteria
with VALI to provide even more clinical relevance. Single cell RNA sequencing on the experimental and control
lungs following ventilation will provide deep molecular profiles of alveolar cells subjected to barotrauma. This
tissue-dissociative analysis will be complemented with multimodal (protein and RNA) and multiplex staining of
intact lung tissue using two complementary technologies, to correlate the molecular with spatial and
morphological features of pathology. We will also test the capacity of human lung to recover from acute VALI by
culturing lung slice cultures at air-liquid interface following ventilation, and how this is impacted by pan and
endothelial-specific Wnt inhibition, lipopolysaccharide, and targeted pathway manipulations. In summary, our
studies will open a window into the dynamic cellular and molecular responses of human lung in acute lung injury."

Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, as well as
the polyglutamine expansion diseases, result from protein misfolding and accumulation due to genetic
and/or environmental causes. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, inherited
neuromuscular disease that is caused by polyglutamine expansion within the androgen receptor (AR);
it is related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion, including
Huntington’s disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the precise pathways leading to
neuronal dysfunction and death are unknown, the evaluation of mouse and cell models of these
diseases has yielded mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. SBMA stands apart from other
polyglutamine diseases in that its onset and progression are dependent on AR androgenic ligands. The
cell and mouse models of SBMA used within this proposal reproduce the androgen- and polyglutamine-
dependent nuclear AR aggregation seen in patients, as well as its consequent toxicity, making these
models highly useful for the analysis of the mechanistic basis for upstream events involved in AR
toxicity. Our long-term objectives are to use these models to develop a mechanistic
understanding of hormone-dependent, polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity. A growing body of
evidence suggests that long polyQ tracts cause cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death, at least
in part by dysregulating protein-protein interactions that sustain normal cellular function. We have
utilized multiple quantitative proteomics approaches to identify changes in AR protein interaction
networks caused by polyQ expansion in a cell model, and in the previous funding period, we established
an important role for one of these interacting proteins, USP7, in SBMA pathogenesis, validating this
approach to understand disease mechanisms. We propose here to 1) carry out additional interactome
screens in SBMA cell models and in spinal cord and muscle tissues of a validated mouse model of
SBMA and begin the investigation into the roles of these differentially interacting proteins, 2) continue
our mechanistic studies of the role of USP7, and of other differential interactors, in SBMA, and 3)
develop a novel therapeutic approach to specifically target the USP7-AR interaction in SBMA. We
anticipate that results from these studies will lead us to a deeper understanding of the molecular
pathogenesis of SBMA, and will yield novel pathways amenable to therapeutic modulation for SBMA."

Although aging, germline mutations, and family history of cancer are significant risks for breast cancer, it is still
unclear why one person’s breast cells are more susceptible to this disease than another person’s. Aging changes
cells and tissues such that they become more susceptible to cancer initiation. Our published data show that
breast epithelial cells from young women who have high-risk germline mutations show accelerated aging with
intermediate filament distribution, biological clock acceleration, and stromal immune cell milieu changes
comparable to those of women who are 20–40 years older. In our currently funded R01EB024989, we discovered
that the mechanical properties of normal breast epithelial cells, as measured by our mechano-Node Pore
Sensing (mechano-NPS) platform, differ among younger and older women and that normal epithelial cells from
genetically high-risk women who carry germline BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 variants are mechanically “older”
than their chronological age. We hypothesized that mechano-NPS can detect disease states based on the
emergent mechanical properties that arise from the underlying molecular networks that define lineage and
disease states. In this competitive renewal application, we extend this hypothesis to include detection of cancer
susceptibility or risk, which is so far not detectable with genetic screening. We will innovate mechano-NPS and
advance an in silico model of our device to increase the number of physical parameters it can measure, thereby
providing a more complete portrait of single human mammary epithelial cells (HMECS) (Aim 1). We will build a
machine learning cancer susceptibility detection system based on measuring mechanical properties of different
primary HMEC (young, old, high-risk, family history of breast cancer, etc.) (Aim 2). Finally, we will dissect the
molecular mechanisms of mechanical states measured by our advanced mechano-NPS platform (Aim 3). In the
last funding period, we successfully designed, built, and validated the first-generation mechano-NPS platform at
UC Berkeley and showed it to be portable and robust by building a second platform at City of Hope. The impact
of our competitive renewal application will be far more reaching. Clinically useful genetic testing relies on a
handful of known monogenic risk traits, but we hypothesize that emergent mechanical properties, measured
from just a few hundred cells, are a characteristic of the biology that underlies cancer susceptible states, even
those that are polygenic or epigenetic in nature and are passed within a family but that so far have defied
definition."

become the premier meeting on cellular adhesion biology, mechanobiology, and their relevance to development,
homeostasis, and disease. The 2024 meeting, subtitled “Adhesion and Growth Factor Receptors in Health and Disease,”
will be held from July 14 to July 19, 2024 at the Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, NH. The meeting Chairs
will be Dr. Alexander Dunn, Dr. Patrick Derksen, and Dr. Maddy Parsons. These chairs are leading investigators in the fields
of cellular adhesion and cancer biology and provide complimentary expertise in these fields. A prominent, new goal of this
meeting will be to couple fundamental discovery science with clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment. As in previous
meetings, we aim to disseminate the latest discoveries concerning mechanical and biochemical crosstalk between adhesion
and growth factor receptors, as well as how these two receptor classes interact in the context of multiple diseases.
Additionally, we will highlight the ongoing development of novel tools and techniques that promise to accelerate progress in
our field. We likewise look forward to showcasing near-physiological modeling to better understand development and
disease, and clinical applications of adhesion and growth factor receptor modulation. Lastly, we will emphasize emerging
topics in the field. This interdisciplinary meeting plays an essential role in instigating and fostering collaborations among
scientists with diverse backgrounds in bioimaging, bioengineering, and cancer and developmental biology. These
interdisciplinary interactions provide a powerful means of uncovering commonalities in how disruptions in signaling at
cellular adhesion complexes contribute to diseases that are typically studied by separate intellectual communities.
 Speakers will include established leaders in the field, as well as young, promising investigators. In addition to plenary
talks, the meeting will feature informal and interactive poster sessions. We have also planned afternoons that facilitate
informal engagement among trainees and investigators. We have initiated a concept called ‘walk with a PI’ (introduced in
the 2022 meeting; Chairs were Drs. Ann Miller and Patrick Derksen), in which junior scientists are given the opportunity to
engage senior leaders in one-on-one sessions. Importantly, a total of 10 junior scientists (trainees or newly appointed young
investigators) will be invited to give oral presentations, a policy that contributes to the mentoring culture of the meeting. As
an important feature of this meeting, the main conference will be preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS)
planned by and for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The GRS (Chairs: Drs. Timo Kohler and Fernando Valencia) will
provide a forum for future leaders in the field to present their work through oral and poster presentations in a collegial and
interactive environment. In addition, interactions with leaders from academia, industry, and government will provide GRS
participants with mentoring aimed at advancing the careers of these exceptionally promising young scientists."

With an emphasis on the integration of basic, translational and clinical approaches, the 66th annual Aspen Lung
Conference will focus on a central question: How can knowledge of cellular, molecular and genetic
mechanisms that underlie repair of fibrotic lungs help us to develop effective approaches to treat
pulmonary fibrosis? To address this central question, we have organized the program into a series of thematic
sessions, preceded by an opening keynote address to frame the conference. The thematic sessions will focus
on (i) the common threads of usual interstitial pneumonias (UIPs), (ii) exploring the dynamic cellular and
structural biology associated with lung fibrosis, (iii) diagnostic challenges and novel approaches to understand
and identify interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) and disease progression, and (iv) transformational interventions
for lung fibrosis as a pathway to develop precision therapies for the disease. By addressing these topics, we
seek to accomplish the following: 1) provide an international forum for leading basic, translational, and clinical
researchers to exchange ideas regarding the dynamic cellular and structural biology in lung fibrosis associated
with disease progression and repair; 2) stimulate interactions between scientific fields to identify emerging and
shared interests that may lead to more efficient and productive research; 3) enhance the likelihood of success
in translation of preclinical scientific advances into direct patient benefit by developing novel strategies to better
understand disease pathogenesis, resolution potential and to implement scientific advances in treatment of
pulmonary fibrosis; and 4) challenge and stimulate the scientific interests of trainees and attract a new generation
of early career investigators into the broad field of fibrosis, as well as underlying subdisciplines including
processes of repair of the epithelium, of matrix and the regenerative capacity of the lung. We have identified 11
outstanding thought leaders to present State of the Art lectures (35 min) on these topics. Each presentation will
be followed by 25 minutes of moderated discussion - a hallmark of the Conference. The program continues the
Aspen Lung Conference’s dedication to diversity and inclusivity: n=5/12 (42%) of State of the Art
speakers/Summarizer are women, and at least 5 of our speakers are from underrepresented racial/ethnic
groups. Participation of trainees and early career faculty is facilitated by two 15-minute oral abstracts, selected
from submitted abstracts, following each State of the Art speaker (24 total). There will be two evening poster
sessions for further presentation opportunities by trainees, early and level faculty (40 total posters). The final
presentation is provided by a Conference Summarizer, who reviews the impact and common themes of the
Conference. The Conference Summary will be published for widespread dissemination, to serve as a “think tank”
that not only summarizes the current state of the field, but also identifies key future directions for basic,
translation, and clinical research. Finally, and notably, registration for the Aspen Lung Conference is free,
encouraging participation from a wide spectrum of trainees and early career investigators."
10909051,"Project Summary/Abstract
Parenting is essential to the survival of infants. These behaviors are highly conserved across species, however
many animals that parent also exhibit behaviors that directly oppose the survival of young. These behaviors
are categorized as infant-directed aggression and often result in the injury or death of an infant. For instance,
in laboratory mice, virgin males are spontaneously infanticidal whereas virgin females are typically maternal.
The most interesting aspect of this phenomenon is that virgin males become paternal after mating with a
female. This behavioral switch suggests that neural circuits that underlie infant-directed aggression may be
regulated by social experience, like mating. Much is known regarding the positive control of parenting, while
the neural circuitry of infant-directed aggression is not well studied. Urocortin-3 neurons of the perifornical area
(PeFAUcn3) have recently been found necessary for infant neglect and aggression. The PeFAUcn3 fibers project
most densely to the amygdalohippocampal area (AHi), a functionally uncharacterized brain region. Optogenetic
stimulation of PeFAUcn3 terminals in the AHi facilitates infant-directed aggression in virgin females whereas
inhibition abolishes this behavior in males. Of the studied PeFAUcn3 projections, AHi stimulation resulted in the
most pronounced effects on infant-directed aggression. These results suggest that the AHi is a functionally
significant brain area in circuits governing infant-directed aggression. I suspect that the responding neural
population in the AHi expresses Ucn3’s primary receptor, corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2).
Therefore, I hypothesize that a subset of neurons in the AHi are essential for infant-directed
aggression. My central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) characterize the molecular identity of
AHi neurons involved in infant-directed aggression, and (2) identify the function of CRFR2 neurons in the AHi
during infant-directed behavior. Results from this study will provide insight into the molecular composition of
AHi neurons that are active during infant-directed aggression and currently identify a behavioral relevance for
this functionally uncharacterized brain area. Overall, this work will increase our understanding of the infant-
directed aggression and the regulation of parenting."

 Research into the molecular basis of Parkinson’s Disease has recently undergone a dramatic shift to focus
on toxic, early stage oligomers of α-Synuclein (aSyn). Understanding this promising new therapeutic target, a
departure from research on insoluble fibrils, now requires biophysical insight about the misfolding of aSyn
monomers and subsequent assembly of these toxic oligomers. These oligomer species are far less understood
than fibrils, and more difficult to study, presenting a pressing challenge to biophysicists.
 The specific overall goal of the proposed work is to identify a subset of amino acid interactions within and
between aSyn monomers that are most important in the assembly and toxicity of oligomers. Several new high-
resolution structures of aSyn fibrils will be used as an exciting starting point to launch detailed investigations into
the structural motifs that are present in the early stages of assembly. Based on strong preliminary results, we
hypothesize that, despite their relative structural disorder, there exist robust, targetable structural motifs in early
stage oligomers that persist through fibrilization. Additionally, a subset of those motifs is essential in determining
toxicity: some promote toxic assemblies while others promote cytoprotective assemblies. High-resolution
structures of early-stage oligomers will likely never be solved. Absent structures, our data will do the next best
thing: it will point to specific motifs and residues that stabilize early-stage oligomers and that should be the focus
of directed targeting campaigns.
 We have established a highly resolved technology (both temporally and spatially), time-resolved FRET, that
allows us to study with great sensitivity the early-stages of aSyn aggregation in the cell. We will support these
cellular observations with rigorous biophysical studies including 19F NMR, two-color TIRF microscopy and
computational modeling. We will also utilize our established small molecule discovery technology in an innovative
way to establish whether there are clear structural differences in oligomeric assemblies of the familial variants of
aSyn, and whether these assemblies vary in differing neuronal cell lines.
 In sum, the proposal will provide the field with a significantly deeper understanding of the biophysical basis
of aSyn oligomerization and will draw new correlations between key amino-acid residues, folding and toxicity."

Depression is a common, serious form of psychopathology that is associated with suffering, disability, and
suicide. Depression is characterized by disrupted reward function and typically begins during adolescence, a
key developmental period for change in neurobehavioral systems supporting reward-driven behavior. The
dopamine neuromodulatory system is consistently associated with depression and thought to be specifically
reflected in anhedonia, a cardinal symptom of depression that involves difficulty with motivation for or
enjoyment of pleasant experiences. Furthermore, dopamine function is postulated to mediate the influence of
neuroinflammation on depression. Developmentally, understanding the role of dopamine in depression
requires examining changes in reward function over time and across domains, including frontostriatal reward
circuitry, dopamine availability in the striatum, reward-driven behavior, and reward-focused experiences in
real-life settings.
The proposed study uses a developmental psychopathology and clinical neuroscience approach. It situates
changes in depression, dopamine, and their association against a backdrop of typical development and
captures key constructs across methods and domains. Its translational strategy emphasizes measures of
dopamine function inspired by basic neuroscience.
The study will examine developmental pathways of dopamine in adolescent depression, using an accelerated
longitudinal design with assessments at 0, 12, and 24 months in 150 adolescents (age 16-22), 75 with
depression and 75 who are psychiatrically healthy. Adolescents will complete a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) session to assess dopamine function; functional MRI of frontostriatal response during a reward
paradigm and at rest; ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of reward anticipation and reward-seeking
behavior; smartphone-based passive sensing of motor activity and phone/text activity; behavioral tasks of
reward motivation; self-report of depression, anhedonia, and reward function; and measurement of circulating
inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, IL-6). Dopamine function will be measured safely and noninvasively through
MRI. The primary focus will be dopamine availability via R2’, a measure of tissue iron, which is concentrated in
the basal ganglia, co-localizes with pre-synaptic dopamine vesicles, and is necessary for dopamine synthesis.
The study will elucidate the relation of depression and dopamine availability, their possible co-fluctuation
across adolescence, and the potential association of inflammatory markers with depression through dopamine
availability. Findings will have relevance to the pathophysiology, course, and treatment of depression."

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains a major threat to global health. Therefore, it is essential
that we fully understand the mechanism of viral infectivity to provide new avenues for therapeutic development.
After invading a non-dividing host cell, HIV-1 must gain access to the genetic vault, the nucleus. To do this, the
viral genes, packaged in a capsid assembly, need to pass through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs are
massive protein channels that function as the gatekeepers of the cell nucleus. However, how the HIV-1 capsid
breaches the barrier formed by the NPC remains poorly understood. Previous studies were hampered by the
complexity of the NPC structure and the lack of molecular-level details of capsid-nucleoporin interactions; there
was also a general inability of conventional in vitro platforms to capture the structural complexity of the viral
capsid, which presents patterns that are recognized by host factors. Therefore, unlocking more mechanistic
details of HIV-1 nuclear entry calls for innovative in vitro approaches capable of recapitulating higher-order
capsid assemblies and the native environment of nuclear pores. We propose to establish such a platform by
leveraging our recently established DNA-origami-based NPC mimics, termed NuPODs (NucleoPorins
Organized by DNA), which contain precisely controlled pore dimensions and nucleoporins grafted with
programmable density and orientation, as well as the programmable capsid protein (CA) assemblies that
faithfully recreate selective fragments or the entire HIV-1 capsid surface. We will further validate our in vitro
findings by infectivity experiments and live-cell imaging. Our multi-investigator team will draw from our
respective expertise, including HIV biochemistry, structural biology, DNA nanotechnology, nuclear transport,
and live-cell imaging, to build and apply this enabling platform for the study of HIV-1 capsid nuclear transport.
Specifically, we will first comprehensively study the interactions between HIV-1 capsids and an assortment of
cellular factors involved in HIV-1 nuclear import (Aim 1). Using soluble high-order CA assemblies and
recombinant nucleoporins, we will define the biochemical and structural basis of capsid-nucleoporin binding,
laying the foundation for the rest of the study. We will then build a library of NuPODs with increasing structural
and compositional complexity, to identify the key determinants of HIV-1 nuclear import and the associated
remodeling of the viral capsid and the NPC (Aim 2). These NuPODs will be built with multiple types of
nucleoporins positioned at designated positions on a DNA-origami channel with tunable dimensions and
stiffness. Systematically varying the NuPOD design and analyzing the resultant NuPOD-capsid docking and
insertion will help understand HIV-1 nuclear import with molecular-level details. Additionally, we will validate
our key findings using cell-based virologic experiments (Aim 3). Overall, we expect this project to create
powerful tools that will not only help define the mechanism of HIV nuclear entry, but also enable us to explore
the nuclear transport of many other viruses."

The 17th Annual CounterACT Network Research Symposium is designed to provide scientists
working across the chemical countermeasure field with the latest research findings on the mechanisms
of chemical threats, the identification or development of novel countermeasures and their translation to
relevant clinical scenarios. This research conference has been held annually since 2007 and is the main
venue for interactions among the scientists funded by the successful NIH CounterACT Program. The
symposium brings together an emerging set of trainees in this important scientific area and a range of
external investigators with closely aligned interests from federal agencies and potential industrial
partners. There are also a number of guests from other countermeasure programs across the world
and consultants from relevant Federal programs in attendance. The meeting is internationally known
for the high-quality, cutting-edge nature of the science presented and has a track record of progressive
growth over the last 16 years with the strategic funding and oversight from the CounterACT program.
The 17th Annual CounterACT Symposium will be held June 3-5, 2023 in Park City, UT. The program for
the meeting described in this application has been assembled around the themes permeating the NIH
CounterACT Network, which have collectively changed the way we think about the breadth and pace
of discovery and development for countermeasures against existing and emerging chemical threats. In
addition to the Core sessions, where progress in each funded project will be presented, we have also
included Plenary sessions designed to highlight the trajectory of the program as an exemplar of
systematic approaches to understanding the interactions between environmental chemicals and human
mortality or morbidity. To complete the program and to continue to develop a cadre of emerging
investigators in the relevant fields, we have also developed a short Program for trainees designed to:
(1) provide them with the basic background on common mechanisms involved in clinical toxidromes to
maximize their understanding of the science in the broader conference, (2) receive feedback on their
ongoing research projects from experts in the field, and (3) facilitate their interaction with senior
members of the countermeasure scientific community to promote the creation of a new generation of
countermeasure scientists.
We fully anticipate that the scientific discussions, research talks, poster sessions, and other informal
interactions between the participants of this conference will contribute to our understanding of the
mechanisms of major toxic exposures and the fundamental basis for the identification, development
and deployment of relevant countermeasures."
10911837,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A common feature of heart failure (HF) is excessive extracellular matrix deposition by a specialized and
differentiated fibroblast population, known as myofibroblasts, in response to cardiac injury. While myofibroblasts
help to maintain the structural integrity of the injured heart and prevent ventricular wall rupture, persistence of
myofibroblasts results in excessive fibrosis and subsequent cardiac decompensation. Therefore, identifying
molecular mechanisms of myofibroblast differentiation in cardiac fibrosis could yield novel clinical targets to delay
or reverse the development of HF. Recent evidence suggests metabolism may drive cellular differentiation
through the modulation of epigenetic-modifying enzymes that enhance or silence genes associated with cellular
differentiation. Altered metabolism changes the concentration of metabolites that act as substrates for
epigenetically modifying enzymes, such as the changing levels of acetyl-CoA that alter the activity of histone
acetyltransferases (HAT). Our preliminary data indicate that increased glycolytic rate is a key feature driving
myofibroblast differentiation. We identified metabolic regulation of histone demethylation as a feature of
myofibroblast differentiation and we now turn our sights to histone acetylation as an epigenetic modification
permissive of myofibroblast gene expression. This proposal hypothesizes that increased acetyl-CoA
biosynthesis is necessary for histone lysine acetylation by HATs during differentiation for the transcriptional
activation of the myofibroblast gene program. This study seeks to identify novel therapeutic targets to mitigate
the consequences of fibrosis in HF."

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the predominant neurodegenerative disease of aging. Recent
animal studies have demonstrated that the earliest cochlear pathology due to noise and aging
involves a loss of the inner hair cell ribbon synapse. The early consequences of this synaptic loss
are not believed to affect hearing sensitivity, but rather, impair speech understanding in
background noise. While this condition, called cochlear synaptopathy or hidden hearing loss, can
be detected in animal models by a reduction of suprathreshold sound evoked wave-1 amplitude of
auditory brainstem response (ABR) and confirmed by post-mortem quantitative histology, its
diagnosis in humans remains challenging. Several non-invasive electrophysiological methods such
as ABR and electrocochleography (ECochG) have been tested to detect human cochlear
synaptopathy. Two major obstacles to their proposed application include: (1) a high variability of
ABR/ECochG wave amplitudes, and (2) a lack of direct histological validation for living humans.
My strategy here is to develop a new electrical device able to generate calibration pulse to reduce
high variability in ABR/ECochG wave metrics. The validation issue will be addressed by applying
machine learning to identify multiple ABR/ECochG markers associated with cochlear
synaptopathy first in animal models, in which cochlear synaptopathy can be directly validated by
histologic synaptic counting, and then apply these identified features for human diagnosis. My
hypothesis is that clinical diagnosis of human cochlear synaptopathy can be achieved by improving
both hardware and software related for ABR/ECochG data collection and analysis. Based on our
preliminary studies, we will continue to improve our electrical circuit to test if our calibration pulse
device can address the variability issue, and at the same time, we will identify ABR/ECochG
features associated with age-related cochlear synaptopathy in mice and then validate these
identified features in gerbils since its hearing range is similar to humans. Finally, I will perform a
longitudinal study to test identified features in humans during aging.
 Early detection of cochlear synaptopathy may lead to effective preventive strategies that
would delay or potentially prevent further development of ARHL. Completion of this project is
therefore expected to lead to a major shift in current clinical diagnosis of ARHL, while providing
a unique training opportunity for the principal investigator to develop skills in developing
commercial medical devices."

The optimal management of patients with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE), who have right heart
dysfunction but a normal blood pressure, is uncertain. In addition to being at risk for poor short-term
outcomes, these patients suffer from reduced functional capacity and a lower quality of life over the long-term.
While systemic thrombolysis reduces clinical deterioration from PE, this benefit is offset by substantial
increases in major and intracranial bleeding. Catheter-directed therapy (CDT), which dissolves pulmonary
artery thrombus with a much lower dose of thrombolytic drug, appears to be as effective as systemic
thrombolytic therapy without substantially increasing bleeding. Consequently, CDT is often used in the U.S. to
treat submassive PE. However, CDT has risk and is costly, and it is not known if it improves cardiopulmonary
heath, particularly over the long-term.
We therefore plan to do an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomized trial, the Pulmonary Embolism:
Thrombus Removal with Catheter-Directed Therapy (PE-TRACT) Study, to compare CDT with No-CDT in
500 patients with submassive PE. We will use an ""adaptive sample size"" which could result in enrollment
being stopped for superior efficacy or for futility at an interim analysis. There will be two primary efficacy
outcomes; peak oxygen consumption at 3 months (short-term) and NYHA class at 12 months (long-term).
These will be analyzed sequentially using a ""gatekeeping"" approach; for NYHA class to be compared, peak
oxygen consumption must first be shown to be increased by CDT (P<0.05). The primary safety outcome will be
major bleeding within 30 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include generic quality of life (QOL) (SF-
36), 6-minute walk distance, clinical deterioration from PE, and cost-effectiveness. Exploratory analyses will
assess: disease-specific QOL, other cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters, recurrent venous
thromboembolism and complications of the CDT procedure. Predictors of therapeutic response will also be
sought. The PE-TRACT Study will change clinical practice: if CDT is effective and safe, it will become part of
standard therapy for patients with submassive PE; if not, a risky and costly therapy will be avoided. Hence,
either study outcome will improve public health and advance the NHLBI’s mission."

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized cancer care; however, ICIs can lead to off-target
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as ICI-induced acute interstitial nephritis (ICI-AIN). There are 3
major challenges in the care of patients who develop ICI-AIN. First, while 20-25% of ICI-treated patients develop
acute kidney injury (AKI) in the first year, there is no biomarker to distinguish ICI-AIN from other causes of AKI.
Second, a third of the patients with ICI-AIN do not achieve renal function recovery with corticosteroids and could
require additional second-line immunosuppressive therapies. However, there is no early biomarker to determine
if corticosteroid therapy is working besides monitoring of serum creatinine, the improvement in which is often
delayed. Third, the pathways driving refractoriness to corticosteroid therapy in ICI-AIN are poorly understood
making selection of second-line immunosuppressive therapies challenging. The overall goals of this project are
to address these challenges by testing C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL)9 as a real-time biomarker for ICI-AIN diagnosis
and predictor of response to corticosteroid therapy, and to identify dysregulated pathways in steroid-refractory
ICI-AIN using proteomics. We will recruit and retain 400 participants from 3 healthcare systems (Yale,
Massachusetts General Hospital, and Johns Hopkins) who develop AKI while on ICI therapy, of whom 100 (25%)
are expected to have ICI-AIN. In Aim 1, we will determine the accuracy of urine CXCL9 measured using
immunoassay and a newly developed point-of-care lateral flow assay in distinguishing ICI-AIN from other causes
of AKI. This aim is supported by our studies that identified and validated CXCL9 as a biomarker of AIN and data
from others showing that interferon-γ and its downstream chemokine CXCL9 are key drivers of immune-related
adverse events in ICI users. In Aim 2, we will collect urine samples 1-2 weeks after initiation of corticosteroid
therapy to test if suppression of CXCL9 by corticosteroids is an early marker of renal recovery in ICI-AIN. This
is supported by our preliminary data showing that a third of the patients do not achieve renal recovery after
corticosteroids and CXCL9 is a strong marker of renal interstitial inflammation, the key histologic feature of ICI-
AIN. In Aim 3, we will compare urine and plasma proteomic profiles between steroid-refractory and steroid-
sensitive ICI-AIN to determine pathways of steroid-refractoriness in ICI-AIN. We have assembled a
multidisciplinary team with complimentary expertise in ICI-related renal complications and AIN (MPI/PDs: Sise,
Moledina), oncology (Reynolds, Kluger, Pabani), biomarkers (Parikh), and biostatistics (Zhao). The feasibility is
supported by the high-volume cancer care provided at our centers and the MPIs’ strong track record of
prospective enrollment and collaboration. Upon completion of this award, we will identify a biomarker for real-
time diagnosis and treatment response phenotyping in ICI-AIN, and identify potentially targetable dysregulated
pathways to guide selection of second-line therapies for steroid-refractory ICI-AIN in a future clinical trial."

The social environment has profound effects on organismal biology, including human health. Individuals vary in
their physiological and behavioral responses to social stimuli, and this variation can manifest as difficulties in
social perception, learning, and behavior in everyday life, or as increased risk for specific neuropsychiatric
symptoms in response to social adversity. Previous work has focused predominantly on discovering the
mechanisms of specific forms of social perception, learning, and behavior, but less attention has been devoted
to understanding how these processes vary among individuals. This proposal leverages the strong genetic,
neurobiological, and behavioral variation within prairie voles to investigate how integrated levels of biological
organization generate individual variation in responses to social stimuli. Briefly, prairie voles exhibit a suite of
unique social behaviors, including pair bonding, consoling, extensive alloparental and biparental care, and
selective aggression toward opposite-sex conspecifics following pair bonding. These behaviors vary among
individuals, and in some instances this behavioral variation has been linked to genetic and neuroendocrine
variation, although the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are unknown. This proposal has three
main objectives: 1) improve methods for measuring social behaviors in prairie voles; 2) identify cell populations
that respond to specific forms of social stimuli; and 3) determine genetic and neuroendocrine factors underlying
variation in cell type-specific and behavioral responses to social stimuli. These objectives will be accomplished
by integrating behavioral analysis tools, genomics, single cell omics, spatial transcriptomics, and
pharmacological manipulation in a powerful model for social behavioral variation. Completion of these projects
will bridge knowledge gaps between genomics, neuroendocrinology, and circuit neuroscience; address untested
models of social neural processing; and reveal specific genes, molecular systems, and cell populations
underlying social behavioral variation."
10894848,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a commonly encountered medical problem that is associated with poor health 
outcomes in survivors, including increased mortality and re-admission to the hospital. Despite their high-risk 
status, only a small fraction (<10%) of patients receive specialized nephrologist follow-up after AKI episode. 
The low rate of follow-up care is due to lack of clear guidelines as well as reluctance on part of patients due 
to several reasons such as hospital fatigue, long travel times and unwillingness to add more doctors to the 
care team. To address the gap in care for AKI survivors, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled, 
MUlti-modal SEnsor (MUSE) platform for at-home use that can monitor patient health automatically, perform 
risk assessment for AKI recurrence, and alert the patient to seek specialized care. MUSE comprises of – 1) 
a colorimetric dipstick for capturing concentration of bio-markers (creatinine, urea, pH and lactate) in urine; 
2) a near-field communication (NFC) powered stretchable, battery-less, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
skin patch that records ECG since cardiovascular complications is a strong predictor for AKI recurrence; 3) 
an AI-enabled mobile application that acquires sensor data (from urine sample and ECG) and runs an on-device deep learning fusion AI model to combine sensor data and patient medical record (past co-morbidities 
and demographics) for precision and personalized predictions. We will harness capabilities of smartphone 
for several key tasks - a) capture images of the dipstick sensor with built-in camera; b) act as NFC reader 
for ECG patch; c) run the computer vision and AI algorithms natively on-board without requiring network 
connection, and encrypt patient data locally. The AI model will be trained and validated on a large 
retrospective dataset collected from patients at Mayo Clinic Hospital, and the sensor system functionality will 
be validated with an observational study on 20 adult participants (10 healthy and 10 AKI patients) at Mayo. 
The proposed research has the potential to drive innovations in producing the next generation of intelligent 
wearables that performs fusion of multi-modal sensor data and EMR for early detection of underlying health 
issues with high accuracy. A successful realization of the proposal aims will pave the way for a future, large-scale clinical trial with our sensor platform."
10911374,"This collaborative project will leverage the spine-hip exoskeleton, an interdisciplinary and integrative
platform uniting rapidly advancing areas of science and engineering to advance knowledge and
understanding within its field and across different fields. The state-of-the-art exoskeletons lack human
adaptability and task versatility for injury mitigation of workers. Moreover, the anatomy of the human back
presents unique challenges for the design and control of wearable robots. Thus spine exoskeletons are
required to reduce at least one of three forces (also not increase other forces), including erector spinae
muscle force and lumbar vertebral compressive and shear forces. This necessitates new solutions for
robot design, modeling, and control to achieve all objectives. This project will 1) develop
mechanics-guided spine-hip soft exoskeletons, 2) understand the high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of
the human spine and its response to exoskeletons, and 3) investigate learning-based optimal control to
reduce musculoskeletal joint loadings thus ultimately mitigate low back injuries to workers. Our
multidisciplinary team consisting of experts in robotics (Dr. Hao Su), computational biomechanics (Dr.
Katherine Saul), and learning-based optimal control (Dr. Zhong-Ping Jiang) will take a convergent
approach to assist multiple joints using a bio-inspired powered soft exoskeleton composed of the spine
and hip modules for low back pain prevention of workers who conduct lifting tasks (including squat and
stoop postures)."
10939635,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a life-threatening condition, affects ~10% adults in the United States. The
condition is accompanied by multiple symptoms (autonomic, breathing, mood, and cognition), which are linked
to increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. The impaired functions likely result from
brain changes in sites that mediate these regulations, but the pathological mechanisms contributing to brain
changes are unclear. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a primary characteristic of OSA, induces oxidative stress,
leading to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that encourages neuroinflammation and
activates immune and glial cells; that sequence leads to regional increases in brain temperature, contributing
to tissue damage. Moreover, IH induces mitochondrial dysfunction, altering metabolites, including the N-acetyl-
aspartate (NAA; neuronal integrity), choline (Cho; membrane metabolism/integrity/turnover), creatine (Cr;
energy metabolism), myo-inositol (MI; astrocyte proliferation/osmotic balance), and lactate (Lac; anaerobic
metabolism). Also, antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH) that plays a significant role against oxidative
stress, regulate neuronal/cellular protection from excessive ROS. However, the distribution of regional brain
temperatures, metabolites, and antioxidant status in OSA is unknown, leaving a gap in knowledge of sources
of injury that can be examined non-invasively with the 3D Echo Planar Spectroscopic Imaging (3D EPSI) and
the MEshcher–GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS). Therefore, using 100 moderate-to-
severe OSA and 100 age- and sex-matched controls, the specific aims are to: 1) examine regional brain
temperatures, using 3D EPSI, in OSA and controls; 2) assess whole-brain metabolites (NAA, Cho, Cr, MI, and
Lac), using 3D EPSI, antioxidant (GSH) levels from the posterior and anterior cingulate and anterior insula,
using MEGA-PRESS, in OSA and controls; 3) determine the relationships between brain temperatures and Lac
and MI levels with disease severity in OSA adults; and 4) assess regional brain temperature and metabolites
changes, using 3D EPSI, after 6-months in OSA with and without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
compliance. In summary, the objective is to examine IH-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
processes contributing to brain changes in OSA, reflected as changes in regional brain temperatures and
metabolites, and antioxidant in multiple brain sites, links between brain temperature, metabolites, and disease
severity, and assess if the CPAP normalizes such changes in OSA. The findings have important implications
for identifying interventions (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidant, and Cr therapies as used in
other conditions) to fully rescue brain changes in OSA with and without CPAP in those sites, which will benefit
to dysfunctions, especially in non-CPAP compliant OSA or no treatment, and could dramatically improve the
morbidity, mortality, and life quality."
10938220,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Buprenorphine is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorder (OUD), yet only 1 in 5
people with OUD receive this medication. Telehealth-delivered buprenorphine (tele-buprenorphine) is one of
the most promising interventions to increase treatment and retention, yet there is limited data on comparative
effectiveness and no prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support implementation. This dearth of
evidence represents a major challenge for clinicians and policymakers when weighing questions around risks
versus benefits and how to deploy telehealth to improve patient outcomes. In addition to overall effectiveness,
there are additional real-world questions, including: 1) is tele-buprenorphine effective in potentially higher risk
groups (e.g. using other substances), 2) can tele-buprenorphine address existing treatment disparities, and 3)
in this new era where telehealth is an option alongside in-person visits, are hybrid approaches effective?
Traditional RCTs would be impractical and take years to address the array of important clinical questions, and
clinical and policy landscapes are evolving quickly. Emulated target trials are an innovative causal inference
approach that use existing data to emulate RCTs by carefully pre-specifying aspects of the protocol, including:
eligibility, treatment assignment, outcome and follow-up assessments, and analytic strategies. We will harness
our team’s unique expertise in causal inference, telehealth and mixed methods research to systematically
gather needed data to develop clinical guidance to optimize tele-buprenorphine care.
 Quantitative aims focus on emulated target trials using national Veterans Health Administration and
Medicaid data across states, comprising the largest U.S. provider and payer for OUD services respectively, to
compare effectiveness of telehealth to in-person care, in patients starting and continuing buprenorphine. We
will first develop the target trial framework and apply this framework to analysis evaluating overall effectiveness
of tele-buprenorphine on retention and other key outcomes. We will then apply this framework to address
additional clinically relevant questions about effectiveness of tele-buprenorphine in high-risk groups and in
groups experiencing OUD treatment disparities. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with buprenorphine
patients and clinicians to obtain a nuanced understanding of experiences with telehealth compared to in-
person care to explain, contextualize and extend the quantitative findings. Finally, we will summarize
quantitative and qualitative findings, integrate with existing literature, and create joint displays that will be
provided to patient and clinician experts who will engage in an adapted Delphi process to form consensus
recommendations. Findings will be summarized and disseminated via publications and development of
Consensus Guidance on tele-buprenorphine care for clinicians and policymakers. This project will have high
public health impact by providing critical new insights on comparative effectiveness of tele-buprenorphine
treatment in order to directly inform best practice and policies to improve real-world care for patients with OUD."
10928163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The architecture of mammalian genes enables the production of multiple transcripts by using alternative
promoters, alternative termination sites, and differentially spliced exons, which greatly expand the coding
capacity of our genomes. We recently discovered that exon splicing can activate cryptic promoters located
nearby and that these new promoters often arise near annotated internal exons creating “hybrid” exons that
can be used as both first and internal exons in different transcripts. The regulation of these processes has
profound impacts on gene expression, and yet the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Indeed, key
gaps in our understanding of co-transcriptional gene regulation include the specific mechanisms and the trans-
factors involved in the splicing-dependent regulation of transcription and the roles of spliceosome components.
Moreover, since exon splicing influences transcription from the most upstream and nearby promoter, it is
unclear how the activation of a new promoter affects the expression of alternative promoters in the same
genes. The goal of my lab is to understand the molecular processes underlying the functional coupling
between transcription and RNA-processing, aiming to uncover novel mechanisms of gene regulation in
important contexts. In this proposal, we will combine genetic, molecular, and genomic techniques with high-
throughput computational analyses to address two key aspects of co-transcriptional gene regulation. First, we
will focus on how splicing activates transcription from hybrid exons and identify key cis- and trans-factors
involved in the splicing-dependent activation of promoters of hybrid exons. Also, we hypothesize that splicing-
dependent promoter activation affects transcription from nearby alternative promoters by modulating their
chromatin environment. We will then work on how promoter activation modulates transcription from alternative
promoters and discern the mechanism behind promoter interference that has profound impacts on gene
regulation. Furthermore, we will explore the effects of promoter activation on other promoters nearby during
stem cell differentiation to define their contribution to gene regulation and cardiac identity. Our research will
result in insights crucial to uncovering the molecular events that cumulatively establish co-transcriptional gene
regulatory networks. Ultimately, our findings will lead to the development of new computational tools to predict
gene regulatory networks and design molecules to control gene expression with therapeutic benefits."

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) is a common cause of fetal growth restriction (FGR), which is
a known risk factor for brain disability. Our previous studies identified extracellular maternal
miRNAs as a causal link between PAE and FGR. These studies in pregnant women in Ukraine,
resulted in discovery of 11 miRNAs (HEamiRNAs) that were elevated in plasma of heavy alcohol-
exposed mothers who subsequently delivered growth-restricted, alcohol-affected infants (HEa),
but not in exposed mothers who delivered infants that were apparently unaffected (HEua), or
unexposed (UE) mothers. Maternal HEamiRNAs collectively explained 24-31% of the variance in
infant height, weight and head circumference at birth, and in rodents, non-human primates, and
in human trophoblast cell lines, explained PAE inhibition of placental trophoblast epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and FGR. Studies in this proposal, test an innovative hypothesis
that two candidate cytokines, also identified in the Ukraine cohort, and extracellular miRNAs,
control fetal growth in response to PAE, and that these may be manipulated to overcome FGR.
In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that two PAE-sensitive cytokines, C-reactive protein and sFlt1,
control HEamiRNA transfer between maternal circulation and trophoblasts, as a means to inhibit
the growth of chorionic villi, leading to FGR. Aim 2 is based on initial studies that showed 3
HEamiRNAs, which were elevated in both preeclampsia and FGR, promoted EMT gene expression
in trophoblasts. We plan to test the hypotheses that cytokines, and sub-groups of birth outcome-
defined HEamiRNAs may be manipulated to overcome FGR. Studies in Aims 1 and 2 will use cell
culture and mouse models, with ultrasound imaging and transcriptomic studies, to assess the role
of cytokines and HEamiRNAs in PAE-mediated inhibition of placental and fetal growth. In Aim 3,
we will assess associations between HEamiRNAs, and other conditions linked to defects in placental
development and function (preeclampsia, pre-term birth, spontaneous abortion, FGR), in
samples from pregnant women recruited in the San Diego region with and without evidence of
placental dysfunction, including PAE. We will additionally investigate the distribution HEamiRNAs
in lipoprotein particles (LPPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) to determine whether pregnancy
and/or placental dysfunction is associated with re-distribution of HEamiRNAs among extracellular
compartments, possibly influencing their endocrine function and target tissue distribution.
The proposed studies, led by qualified investigators with complementary skills, meet a significant
need for mechanism-centered diagnoses and intervention for pregnancy complications due to
PAE and other etiologies."
10928173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Loss of energy homeostasis is a key driver in human disease. Failure to maintain cellular energy balance
results in many disease states, including diabetes, cancer, and neurological diseases. AMP-activated kinase
(AMPK) is a highly conserved kinase responsible for maintaining cellular energy balance. Under conditions of
low nutrients and low energy, AMPK controls the metabolic switch from an energy-consuming anabolic state to
an energy-producing catabolic state at both the cellular and organismal level. Upon activation by energetic
stress, AMPK phosphorylates downstream targets to arrest cell growth, regulate transcription, inhibit protein
synthesis, and reprogram cellular metabolism. One of the most well-established downstream signaling pathway
inhibited by AMPK is the pro-growth mechanistic Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. However,
the functional role that mTORC1 inhibition plays in cellular metabolic reprogramming and maintaining energy
homeostasis upon AMPK activation is controversial, as both AMPK-independent inhibition of mTORC1 and
mTORC1-independent regulation of metabolic pathways have been described.
 The long-term scope of my research program is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate energy
homeostasis and refine the current understanding of how pathways exert control of metabolic reprogramming.
To accomplish this long-term goal, my research group will address two major knowledge gaps in our current
understanding of how mTORC1 inhibition interacts with AMPK activity to drive cellular metabolism and growth:
 1) Is mTORC1 inhibition necessary for cellular metabolic reprogramming by AMPK? What aspects of
 cellular metabolic reprogramming require mTORC1 inhibition by AMPK?
 2) How does mTORC1 inhibition and AMPK activation coordinate the regulation of processes involved
 in metabolic reprogramming?
 My extensive expertise in defining molecular mechanisms of cellular processes and using innovative
mouse models makes my recently established independent laboratory an ideal environment to undertake these
efforts toward a more complete understanding of AMPK signaling. We will employ novel point-mutant mice
harboring specific serine-to-alanine mutations at the phosphorylation sites required for AMPK-dependent
inhibition of mTORC1. Using both mouse tissues and primary cells derived from these mice, we will perform
functional genomic and biochemical analyses to uncover the precise role of mTORC1 inhibition induced by
AMPK activation in regulating gene expression, autophagy, and lipid synthesis, which are critical for cellular
metabolic reprogramming. Together, these experiments will provide conceptual advances in how we think about
AMPK and its relationship with mTORC1 and will offer mechanistic insight into how dysregulation of these
pathways can lead to metabolic dysfunction and disease, which will allow us to identify new therapeutic strategies
for treatment of metabolically-linked human disease."

This proposal aims to establish a National Resource for Mechanistic Modeling of Cellular
Systems to serve the large community of cell and systems biologists. The Resource will
encompass COPASI and Virtual Cell (VCell) software platforms, which are arguably the most
comprehensive and widely used tools for computational modeling of the biophysical
mechanisms controlling cell function. VCell supports a number of key biophysical mechanisms,
including reaction kinetics, diffusion, flow, membrane transport, lateral membrane diffusion,
electrophysiology and rule-based models of multi-state/multimolecular interactions. Simulations
can be based on 0D, 1D, 2D or 3D analytical or experimental image-based geometries. Users
may choose among multiple available simulation approaches: ordinary differential equations,
partial differential equations, stochastic reaction kinetics, network-free simulations, spatial
particle-based simulations and spatial hybrid stochastic/deterministic simulations. COPASI
enables the simulation and analysis of complex biochemical reaction networks either
deterministically or stochastically. It offers a broad range of analysis tools including parameter
estimation/optimization, steady state analysis, stoichiometric analysis, sensitivity analysis and
metabolic control analysis. VCell and COPASI each boast thousands of active users.
Collectively, their users produce >100 papers per year relying on these software systems. Both
VCell and COPASI will be hosted at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. Thus, the
Resource will benefit from: (1) the common institutional organization under which it will operate;
(2) a joint website; (3) a common high performance computing facility that will serve the
computationally intensive needs of users; (4) coordinated training and outreach to the user
community in the form of web-based documentation and tutorials, a yearly Computational Cell
Biology Workshop and numerous roadshows at national and international meetings.
Additionally, VCell and COPASI will be leveraged by external systems biology software
developers as user-friendly platforms for the wide dissemination of their third party algorithms,
software and databases. Finally, the Resource will actively engage with the software standards
community to assure the reproducibility and reusability of both the software and the models it
generates."

upgraded user interface for rapid sample scanning and data collection, and integration of data analysis
software to process multi-crystal datasets. We will test a variety of serial crystallography methods in order

10893034,"Many infectious diseases that threaten humans originated among wildlife, yet we know relatively little 
about the real-world ecological conditions that enable spillover events. Despite its importance, identifying 
novel viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission dynamics remains difficult because it requires 
advanced genetic sequencing technologies, sampling wildlife likely to harbor pathogens of concern to 
humans, and sophisticated modeling techniques. We will study red colobus monkeys in Kibale National 
Park, Uganda, other nonhuman primates, and people who neighbor these wildlife populations to quantify 
transmission dynamics within and between species. Our team will collect behavioral ecology data on red 
colobus monkeys living in areas of the forest with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance and 
conduct interviews with people living along the boundary of the park with varying exposure risks for 
zoonotic diseases. We will conduct repeat sampling of people and individually identifiable red colobus 
monkeys to analyze the gut virome, assess infection with gastrointestinal parasites known to infect both 
red colobus and people, discover previously undocumented viral diversity, detect the presence of novel 
pathogens of concern to humans, red colobus monkeys, and other primates (e.g. SARS-CoV-2), and 
track the evolutionary spread of detected pathogens. To model how red colobus-associated viruses 
spread, we will develop new phylodynamic models that allow longitudinal ecological and biogeographical 
data to structure time-heterogenous epidemiological event rates. We will also create, test, and distribute 
new software for simulation, Bayesian inference, and deep learning-based inference to model how

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a complex pathogenesis, in which
environmental triggers act in individuals with a genetic susceptibility to break immunological self-tolerance.
Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common infections in patients with SLE. We have recently
reported that a subset of female patients with SLE, who have asymptomatic persistent bacteriuria, show higher
levels of pro-inflammatory markers and disease flares. These patients have high levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies
(Abs) that correlate with high levels of Abs against curli/DNA, a bacterial amyloid complexed with bacterial DNA.
Curli/DNA is produced by Gram-negative bacteria, like UroPathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a frequent cause
of bacteriuria and UTI. Translational and epidemiological studies indicate that patients with SLE are frequently
exposed to microbial products and suggest that bacterial infections may promote SLE in predisposed individuals,
but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We have also reported that curli/DNA can accelerate lupus
onset in lupus-prone mice and activate immune cells to secrete type I Interferons (IFNs), a cytokine important in
lupus pathogenesis. We hypothesize that recurrent mucosal infections, like UTI, which remain often untreated
because subclinical in women, may provide a repetitive immune stimulus in individuals genetically susceptible
to autoimmunity and trigger lupus onset or flares. The objective of this R03 application is to establish a
mouse model of UTI in lupus-prone mice that can be used to study how recurrent or chronic bacteriuria
contribute to lupus disease. In Aim 1. we will establish a model of recurrent/chronic UTls in lupus prone mice
by using a lab strain of UPEC, which express curli amyloid, and adapting the conditions of inoculation previously
established in WT mice. We will study the ability of bacteria to establish biofilms in the bladder, whether they
become systemic and activate the immune system in lupus prone mice vs WT mice. We will analyze the induction
of autoantibodies as markers of onset of autoimmunity. Comparing a strain of UPEC that expresses curli amyloid
and its curli-deficient mutant, we can determine the role of curli in UTI. In Aim 2. we will test three clinical UPEC
isolates from patients with SLE and persistent bacteriuria to establish an infection relevant for patients living with
SLE.
The successful completion of this project will provide a protocol that lupus experts can use to study the
mechanisms for the role of bacterial mucosal infections, like the subclinical UTls occurring in patients living with
SLE, in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. It may highlight curli amyloid as pivotal stimulus in infection-induced
autoimmunity. Finally, it will generate a tool to test novel therapeutic approaches in lupus through the
control of subacute infections and the re-establishment of the correct urinary microbiome."

 Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450, CYP) are essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics. The
CYP4F family of fatty acid -hydroxylases consists of the isoforms CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, CYP4F11,
and CYP4F22 which share amino acid sequence identities up to 93%. All of these isoforms assume different
functions in the human body spanning vitamin K and drug metabolism, ceramide production, and the production
of the important lipid mediator 20-hydroxteicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) from arachidonic acid. 20-HETE
regulates the blood pressure but is also associated with human disease, such as hypertension, traumatic brain
injury, and cancer. An inhibition of 20-HETE producing CYP4 isoforms ameliorates these diseases in animal
models which demonstrated their tremendous potential as drug targets. Yet, the involvement of individual CYP4F
isoforms in distinct diseases has not been examined yet and too little is known about their differential structure
and function to target them individually. My research vision is to perform an in-depth functional and structural
characterization of CYP4F -hydroxylases to unravel their impact on cellular processes and promote their use
as drug targets. My lab will close three significant gaps in current CYP4F research.
 First, we will elucidate the function of CYP4F isoforms in physiology and disease. My lab has previously shown
that the isoform CYP4F11 is significantly overexpressed in lung cancer. A transient knockdown of CYP4F11 in
lung cancer cell lines leads to a significantly reduced cell proliferation and migration which is associated with
reduced 20-HETE production. Using lung cancer as a model disease, we will perform transcriptomics and
lipidomics studies to unravel metabolic pathways and differences in lipid composition which impact CYP4F11-
dependent cell proliferation. We will extend our studies to additional CYP4F isoforms and their involvement in
noncancerous diseases. Second, we will demonstrate that the function of CYP4F enzymes is regulated by the
redox partner proteins cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome b5 (CYB5). Both proteins show a
significant allosteric effect on catalytic efficiency and ligand binding affinity for drug metabolizing and
steroidogenic P450 enzymes. However, their impact on CYP4F -hydroxylases has never been investigated.
Using recombinant human CPR and CYB5, my team will conduct a thorough evaluation of their impact on CYP4F
catalysis and the binding of substrates and drugs. Third, there is currently no structural information available for
any of the human CYP4 -hydroxylase which significantly hampers our understanding of enzyme function and
isoform specific substrate specificities. We will solve the very first structure of a human CYP4F -hydroxylase
using X-ray protein crystallography. My lab has successfully generated crystals of the isoform CYP4F11 in
complex with the inhibitor HET0016 which will soon be screened for diffraction at the synchrotron.
 Our findings will promote our understanding of structure and function of human CYP4F -hydroxylases and
pave the way for their use as drug targets exploiting significant differences in protein architecture."

can mitigate the risk of PEG-ASNase liver injury are urgently needed.
Our preliminary data show that (1) our murine model of PEG-ASNase liver injury recapitulates clinical features,
(2) PEG-ASNase activates ATGL, leading to white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and hepatic lipid peroxidation
and apoptosis; (3) PEG-ASNase sensitizes hepatocytes to lipotoxicity; (4) Inhibiting adipocyte ATGL genetically
or pharmacologically protects against PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury; (5) PEG-ASNase induces eIF2α
phosphorylation in WAT and triggers adipocyte lipolysis, which can be attenuated by GCN2 inhibition; (6) PEG-
ASNase induces CTSS expression and activates ERK in WAT; (7) in vivo CTSS inhibition attenuates PEG-
ASNase-induced liver injury and ATGL activation; and (8) RNA-seq analysis identified that the PEG-ASNase-
responsive hepatocyte lipotoxicity is associated with upregulation of Cyp2e1.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that that (1) PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury is due to ATGL
activation and subsequent WAT lipolysis. (2) Mechanistically, we postulate that PEG-ASNase-driven
WAT lipolysis is dependent on GCN2-mediated p-eIF2α and AAR activation, with CTSS induction by PEG-
ASNase leading to ATGL activation. (3) Additionally, we propose that PEG-ASNase sensitizes
hepatocytes to lipotoxicity by inducing Cyp2e1, leading to elevated ROS production and cell death. We
propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: 1) To demonstrate that inhibition of ATGL-mediated WAT
lipolysis attenuates PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury; 2) to show that the PEG-ASNase responsive ATGL
activation and liver injury are mediated by GCN2-dependent induction of cathepsin S (CTSS); and 3) to
investigate whether the PEG-ASNase responsive induction of Cyp2e1 sensitizes hepatocytes to lipotoxicity.
The proposed work will identify a novel mechanism of drug-induced liver injury caused by the anti-leukemia drug
PEG-ASNase involving drug-induced activation of ATGL and the onset of adipose tissue lipolysis leading to
hepatic steatosis. The three aims are not interdependent but are logically related with a singular focus on
elucidating the mechanism of PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury. The long-term goal of this project is to identify
approaches leading to the safe use of PEG-ASNase and to extend the therapeutic benefit of PEG-ASNase to
adult ALL patients."

People with advanced cancer experience a greater frequency and severity of physical and psychological
symptoms, ranking sleep difficulties, worry-anxiety, depression, and fatigue as four of the most common and
distressing symptoms. These symptoms form a symptom cluster, contribute to functional impairment and
poorer quality of life, and are undertreated, especially in rural communities. There is strong evidence for
biobehavioral interventions to improve these symptoms. However, cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and acceptance
and commitment therapies (ACT) are often too time and energy intensive (e.g., 12-20 sessions) and not
tailored for people with advanced cancer. Preliminary Results. In response to specific needs of people with
advanced cancer, we completed a pilot randomized, controlled trial of a brief, integrated CBT-ACT intervention
utilizing the most effective components of these treatments. Finding Our Center Under Stress (FOCUS) is a
four-module mHealth intervention that teaches patients how to control symptoms, when possible, while
continuing to live meaningfully despite these symptoms. FOCUS participants demonstrated statistically and
clinically significant improvements on insomnia severity (d=-0.98), worry (d=-0.86), depression (d=-0.77),
fatigue interference (d=-0.59), self-report and physiologic sleep efficiency (effect size d=0.92), sleep latency
(d=-0.66), and psychological distress (d =-0.78). The proposed project, guided by the biobehavioral theoretical
model, will build on the success of our pilot trial and complete a larger effectiveness trial of FOCUS compared
to a telemedicine-mHealth information control on this symptom cluster; evaluate dose-response, particularly
among rural patients; and explore biobehavioral mediators of symptom changes. Our primary goal for this
study is to improve this symptom cluster, functional status despite symptoms, and quality of life for people with
advanced cancer from underserved rural communities. Innovative features include our population (50% rural
and Appalachian), symptom cluster focus, telemedicine-mHealth delivery, tailoring for people with advanced
cancer, and use of a biobehavioral approach. Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of FOCUS on a symptom
cluster (sleep-anxiety-depression-fatigue), Aim 2. Determine the impact of FOCUS dose on symptom severity
and interference and examine usage by patient geographic location and gender. Exploratory Aim 3: Examine
biobehavioral mediators of treatment effects. Design and Method: This is a prospective, triple blinded (patient,
research assistant, statistician), single-site, randomized trial of FOCUS vs information control. We will recruit
120 participants with advanced lung, prostate, breast cancer, myeloma, and melanoma. The trial will take
place at The Ohio State University James Comprehensive Cancer Center. All participants will complete
assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks, and 6 and 12 months. We hypothesize that FOCUS participants
who use the app more frequently will demonstrate improvements on the symptom cluster longitudinally
compared to the control group via psychological, inflammatory, and endocrine mediators."

10906853,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
Gastric cancer or GC (inclusive of gastroesophageal junction cancers) is the 5th most frequently diagnosed
cancer globally. Significant variability in gastric cancer incidence and mortality has been reported between
racial/ethnic groups. In the U.S., non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB), Hispanics (USH), and non-Hispanic Asian or
Pacific Islander (NHAPI) are more commonly diagnosed with gastric cancer and have higher mortality compared
to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a key precursor to GC with an intermediate stage
of dysplasia. Gastric IM tends to be present at the antrum-corpus junction, particularly at the incisura angularis;
gastric IM can also arise in the cardia. Factors that contribute to the development of gastric IM include bile reflux
cigarette-smoking, alcohol, high salt intake, and H. pylori infection. A hallmark of IM in both the stomach and the
esophagus (=Barrett’s esophagus) is the change of cellular identity to a columnar intestinal type of epithelium,
suggesting that IM has shared mechanisms across these two organs. Several key transcription factors like CDX2
are functionally required to initiate IM, perhaps in concert with other factors and involving epigenetic
reprogramming. The main goal of our proposed studies is to resolve fundamental gaps in the field (1) How does
gastric IM arise? (2) Is there a common molecular pathway initiating IM in the gastric cardia and antrum? (3)
How do TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and inflammatory cues each contribute to the initiation of IM?
We will employ complementary, innovative platforms inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) models, 3D
organoids from patients with gastric IM, and co-culture of these organoids with fibroblasts and immune cells to
decipher how microenvironmental cues catalyze the transition from metaplasia to dysplasia and GEJ/gastric
adenocarcinoma. We seek to understand how ethnicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of gastric IM as that
might reveal new insights and address health care disparities through our multi-institutional consortium
(Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Columbia University, and University of Puerto Rico). We will test the hypothesis
that cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms underlie the formation of gastric IM, dysplasia, and
carcinoma through the following interrelated Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the molecular basis of
gastric IM using inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); Aim 2. To elucidate how TP53 mutations and
inflammatory cues contribute to the initiation of IM and/or the progression to dysplasia and cancer.
Characterization of gene expression, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin accessibility will be invaluable to
identify putative targets to prevent and/or treat gastric IM/dysplasia."
10906856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spontaneous pregnancy loss during the first 12 weeks of gestation is the most common obstetric complication
affecting 1 in 4 women worldwide. Uterine infection is associated with ~15% of first trimester losses and a
dysfunctional endometrium is suggested to play a role in ~50% of cases. Specific microbes, such as E. coli and
Herpes simplex virus have also been associated with reduced implantation success, however how the
endometrium responds to infection is unclear. Endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs) are the major cellular
component of the endometrium that undergo decidualization monthly in anticipation of pregnancy. Decidualized
EnSCs plays key roles in regulating implantation and placentation. The overall objective of this proposal is to
investigate how infectious components affect EnSC decidualization and crosstalk with placental trophoblasts.
Based on preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that exposure of undecidualized EnSCs to bacterial and
viral components triggers inflammation and accelerates EnSC decidualization and senescence. Together, this
dysregulates EnSC-trophoblast interactions, leading to impaired placentation and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Furthermore, decidualization may also reduce the sensitivity and response of EnSCs to infectious components.
To test these hypotheses, the mechanisms by which non-decidualized and decidualizing EnSCs respond to
bacterial and viral components will be determined (Aim 1). Then, how exposure to bacterial and viral components
affect EnSC decidualization and differentiation will be examined in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2). The significance of
altered EnSC function in response to infectious components will be investigated by examining their downstream
interactions with trophoblasts mechanistically in vitro and functionally in vivo (Aim 3). The first two aims will enrich
the candidate’s experience in endometrial biology, bioinformatic analysis and mouse models of decidualization
(K99 phase). The candidate has established an expert mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Vikki Abrahams
at Yale School of Medicine to enable this training. As the candidate transitions into independence, she will
combine this knowledge with her prior training in placental biology, extracellular vesicles and immunology to
study whether endometrial-placental crosstalk is affected by infection (Aim 3, R00 phase). The proposed studies
are significant because they will establish a novel mechanistic understanding of how infection regulates EnSC
decidualization and function, directly linking infection with endometrial dysfunction, implantation failure and the
myriad of obstetric complications associated with impaired placentation. Thus, these findings may contribute to
the identification of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve pregnancy success for women
worldwide."
10906857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year, over 63,000 U.S. infants are born very preterm, below 32 weeks of gestation. With >90% now
surviving to discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), reducing the short- and long-term
morbidities has become the highest priority. Neurodevelopmental impairment is a burdensome long-term
morbidity that affects 50-60% of very preterm infants after NICU discharge. Nutrition is a cornerstone of clinical
care in the NICU and represents a highly modifiable strategy to support healthy brain development during a
critical period, thereby reducing long-term impairments. Previous studies have highlighted nutrient accretion
into tissues as a key driver of healthier brain development and better neurodevelopmental outcomes. A current
gap is in accurate, specific, and feasible strategies to assess and monitor nutrient accretion over time. The
overall aim of this study is to investigate fat-free mass accretion as a dynamic bioindicator of nutritional status
in the NICU. The specific aims involve establishing a new fetal reference for fat-free mass that covers the
entire spectrum of preterm gestational ages, from 23 to 35 weeks, and using this reference to define targets for
fat-free mass accretion that are based on neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study applies the innovative
concept of “growth quality” to NICU nutrition research. Innovative approaches include the application of
bioimpedance analysis to measure body composition in the NICU setting, and the use of quantitative brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) as early biomarkers of
neurodevelopment in this population, in addition to standard behavioral measures. Our overarching goal is to
improve long-term health and developmental outcomes of very preterm infants through pragmatic, evidence-
based innovations in nutritional assessment and care during the NICU hospitalization. The results of this study
will lay the foundation for fat-free mass-driven dietary interventions in the NICU setting. This study has strong
potential to provide an impactful paradigm shift in the approach to the assessment and monitoring of nutritional
status and ultimately the leveraging of nutritional strategies during a critical window in development to improve
outcomes for this vulnerable population."
10906949,"ABSTRACT. This UG3/UH3 project will develop vaccines against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds as a
strategy to reduce illicit opioid use and the incidence of fatal overdoses. Proposed activities will include lead
vaccine selection and optimization, manufacturing of GMP vaccines, and IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies.
The US has seen dramatic increases in fatal overdoses due to heroin, counterfeit prescription drugs, and
cocaine adulterated with fentanyl or fentanyl-like analogs. Current medications may not be sufficient to address
the opioid overdose epidemic. As a complementary strategy to current medications, we will develop vaccines
against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds to reduce their abuse liability and lethality. Our team has already
developed vaccines against heroin and oxycodone that induce antibodies effective in reducing opioid
distribution to the brain, opioid-induced behaviors, and opioid-induced respiratory depression. Vaccines
effectively and selectively target the intended opioid but do not interfere with endogenous opioids nor with
approved pharmacotherapies. Opioid vaccines offer a long-lasting, safe and cost-effective intervention
complementary to medication assisted treatment (MAT). Vaccines may reduce overdoses in opioid users as
well as protect those in professions (e.g., law enforcement, airport security, postal workers) at risk of accidental
exposure to fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Our team has identified a candidate fentanyl vaccine consisting of a
fentanyl-based hapten (F0) conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein, and adsorbed
onto alum adjuvant. Immunization with F0-KLH reduces fentanyl distribution to the brain, and selectively
reduces fentanyl-induced antinociception and respiratory depression in rats. We will further optimize the lead
F0-KLH by testing alternative carrier proteins. In parallel we will develop other conjugate vaccines containing a
new series of haptens (Fn) to target carfentanil, remifentanil, and other fentanyl analogs. Development will be
staggered across UG3/UH3 phases, and we expect that the first lead F0-carrier conjugate vaccine will be
ready for IND filing by the end of Year 3. AIM1 focuses on optimization of vaccines containing the lead F0
and new Fn haptens conjugated to industry-standard carrier proteins, including two E. coli-expressed carriers
obtained from our industry partner FinaBiosolutions. Leads are identified for efficacy in inducing antibodies that
will reduce fentanyl (or fentanyl analog) distribution to the brain as well as reducing antinociception, respiratory
depression and lethality in rats. AIM1 also characterizes additional immunization regimens and vaccine
efficacy in fentanyl self-administration rat models. As a contingency plan, AIM2 tests whether AIM1 leads
containing F0 and Fn haptens can be co-administered in a multicomponent vaccine formulation to
simultaneously target fentanyl and its analogs. AIM3 focuses on manufacturing of GMP vaccines and evaluate
their safety in GLP pre-clinical toxicology studies through CMO and CRO partners. AIM3 will then file an IND
for at least one vaccine formulation against fentanyl and/or its analogs."
10906952,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intimate partner violence (IPV) among caregivers is an important risk factor for the physical abuse of children.
IPV affects 1 in 4 American women, with children present during almost half of the episodes of IPV. IPV may
serve as a “sentinel” event and can provide an opportunity for both early detection and secondary prevention of
abuse in a child who lives in an affected household. Physical abuse affects about 120,000 children annually in
the US, with the youngest children (<3 years old), who are usually unable to provide a history, at the highest risk.
Physical child abuse occurs in 30-60% of homes with IPV. We have shown that occult or inapparent injuries are
often detected by x-rays when young children living with IPV undergo evaluation for abuse. Yet, most children
who live with recognized IPV are not evaluated, perhaps because the care of abused children and adults is
separated into different, often competing care systems. Family-Centered Care (FCC), a process in which the
needs of children and caregivers are considered together, may improve caregiver engagement with the
evaluation of children for physical abuse and with IPV-related services.
The objective of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate an FCC model to improve evaluations for
physical abuse of IPV-exposed children and to engage the IPV victim in attending to her own needs. First, we will
conduct qualitative interviews of local stakeholders (including victims of IPV) and national leaders and will observe
the current process of evaluating IPV-exposed children by child protective services and by medical providers to
identify barriers to and facilitators of these evaluations. Using these data, we will use a systematic decision-
making process to develop an FCC model to improve the medical evaluation of IPV-exposed children and an
implementation strategy to enhance its use. A successful FCC model might link the child’s medical visit with
providing an advocate to connect the abused caregiver with IPV services based on preliminary data. Finally, we
will conduct a pilot trial in which we will compare our model of FCC with usual care for its acceptability and the
feasibility of subsequent studies of its efficacy. Our central hypothesis is that an FCC model that simultaneously
addresses the needs of children and caregivers will improve caregiver engagement, improve recognition of child
abuse, and reduce the risk of subsequent IPV.
I will also pursue formal training to acquire advanced skills and knowledge in community-engaged research, the
practical application of implementation science, the conduct and evaluation of clinical trials, and the development
of independent research grants. My mentors are experts in clinical and community-engaged research, child abuse
pediatrics, familyviolence, and implementation science with extensive experience mentoring junior faculty. In
addition to guidance on career development, they will provide hands-on mentorship for the proposed studies.
They will ensure that I achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator who improves child
abuse detection and identifies best practices to strengthen FCC for IPV."
10906953,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
DNA shed from tumors into the blood stream, termed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), is an easily obtained source
of tumor material. As most ctDNA is identical to normal DNA, some distinguishing feature is needed to demark
a cancer origin. In this regard, a fifth or more of all human cancers harbor a cancer-causing (oncogenic) point
mutation in the gene KRAS. This raises the exciting possibility that sequencing for the presence of KRAS-mutant
ctDNA could be used to detect many types of cancers from a simple blood draw. Indeed, the Guardant360®
ctDNA-detection assay is used for just this purpose in the clinical care of cancer patients. The challenge to
detecting ctDNA is that this form of DNA is found at vanishingly low levels in the blood. This limitation is borne
out in our own clinical experience at Duke, where we find that the Guardant360® assay successfully detected
KRAS-mutant ctDNA in only half the cases in which the patient's cancer was documented to be KRAS mutation-
positive by direct sequencing of resected or biopsy tumor tissue. Thus, while Guardant360® is real-world proof
that ctDNA can be used as a `liquid biopsy' in the clinic, there is clearly much room for improvement. In this
regard, we adopted the Maximum Depth Sequencing (MDS) technology, originally developed in the microbiology
field to detect rare antibiotic-resistance mutations in bacteria populations, to detect oncogenic mutations in
KRAS. By barcoding the original KRAS template and making multiple first-strand replicates thereof, coupled
with ultra-deep sequencing of these targeted DNA products, we were able to detect mutations engineered into
KRAS templates at a limit of 5x10-7, which is 2,500 to 50,000 times more sensitive than the detection limit of
1x10-3 to 2x10-4 reported for the Guardant360® assay. Given this, we will combine the basic research of Dr.
Counter into this KRAS-specific MDS (K-MDS) assay with the clinical and translational expertise of oncologist
Dr. Abbruzzese to optimize the K-MDS assay for blood samples (aim 1) and then evaluate K-MDS to
Guardant360® a prospective clinical comparison (aim 2). Completion of this study will thus provide an new
technology to screen for KRAS-mutant ctDNA in the blood of cancer patients at a sensitivity orders of
magnitude greater than current clinical assays, initially to monitor either recurrence of KRAS-mutant cancers
or detect such cancers in high-risk patients, but more long term, in combination with screening for other hotspot
mutations and using different sources of tissue, for the early detection of multiple cancer types."
10941731,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Severe hyperthermia (heatstroke) is due to a failure of thermoregulation that can lead to cell death in various
tissues resulting in multisystem organ failure. Hyperthermia generally results from overexertion due to severe
physical activity and/or prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. Patients who suffer from anhidrosis or
hypohidrosis, due to disease or certain medications, such as anesthetics, diuretics, anticholinergics, and
amphetamines, are likewise at greater risk. Apart from the negative effects of hyperthermia, in the clinic a variety
of approaches are being utilized to induce localized hyperthermia in the treatment of various cancers, as many
tumors exhibit enhanced sensitivity to heat. Despite the general importance of heat shock responses, however,
the mechanisms by which heat induces cell death remain unclear. Heat shock reportedly induces cell death
through the activation of various canonical pathways involving the initiator caspases-2, -8, and -9; however, we
and others find that while these pathways can serve to amplify the cell death signal, they are largely dispensable
for heat shock-induced cell death, particularly at higher temperatures or following longer exposures. Instead, in
a surprising discovery, we have found that Bim mediates heat shock-induced cell death, independently of its
BH3 domain, through an interaction with the LC8 dynein light chain subunit of the dynein motor complex (DMC).
In binding to LC8, Bim promotes anterograde trafficking of lysosomes from the perinuclear region to the cell
periphery, where they become sensitive to the effects of heat shock. Additional data indicate that peripheral
lysosomes undergo direct membrane permeabilization (LMP) or exocytotic release following heat shock,
resulting in the release of cathepsins into the cytoplasm or extracellular space, respectively. Moreover, knockout
or depletion of cathepsin L (CatL) renders cells highly resistant to cell death. Lastly, while cathepsins released
into different cellular compartments play roles in mediating cell death, targeted localization of the cathepsin
inhibitor, cystatin B (CSTB), to the nucleus results in profound suppression of heat shock-induced cell death.
Thus, our overall hypothesis is that Bim plays a critical noncanonical role in regulating lysosomal number and
positioning within cells, and as a result, it determines the susceptibility of peripheral lysosomes to heat shock-
induced LMP/exocytosis, cathepsin release, and cell death. In four specific aims, we will determine: (1) the roles
of Bim in lysosome number and positioning; (2) the roles of Bim in heat shock-induced LMP and lysosome
exocytosis; (3) the roles of nuclear CatL in heat shock-induced cell death; and (4) the roles of Bim in two mouse
models of localized and whole-body hyperthermia. Collectively, the proposed studies will provide important
insights into an unexpected role for Bim in regulating lysosomal trafficking with far reaching implications for Bim
biology in general and heat shock-induced cell death in particular."

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) can cause severe illness in young children and is the leading cause of infant
hospitalization in the United States. Prenatal RSV prefusion F protein−based (RSVpreF) vaccine efficacy is
69% for severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants through 6 months. In August 2023, the
Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for use at 32 through 36 gestational weeks with a
Prescribing Information warning about preterm birth given an imbalance in preterm birth risk observed between
the vaccine and placebo groups in the clinical trial. However, pregnant people at high risk for preterm birth
were excluded from the trial, the trial did not assess the effect of the vaccination on lactation-related outcomes,
and there are limited safety data on neonatal outcomes and longer-term infant and child outcomes including
growth, neurodevelopment, and allergic conditions.
On September 22, 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended seasonal
administration of either prenatal RSVpreF vaccine or nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody
administered to infants, to prevent severe RSV infection. Lack of safety data decreases vaccine confidence
and could contribute to poor uptake of RSVpreF during pregnancy. Though there is little biologic plausibility of
harmful effects of prenatal RSVpreF vaccination on neonatal, lactation, and child health outcomes, rigorous
real-world safety data are needed to guide informed decision-making.
To address the need for comprehensive safety data on prenatal RSVpreF, we propose to study the effects of
RSVpreF vaccination on neonatal, lactation, and child health outcomes in up to 20,000 mother-infant dyads
using electronic health record data supplemented with vaccinations from state immunization information
systems across four large health systems in Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. We will
use rigorous epidemiologic methods, including propensity scores to address confounding, inverse probability of
censoring weighting (IPCW) to address selection bias, and target trial emulation to address immortal time bias.
For associations suggesting harm, we will explore the direct effects of RSVpreF independent of preterm birth
and infant nirsevimab exposure. The exploratory mediation analysis will use a causal inference approach.
We will build on the data structure and methods that we developed through a National Institutes of Health
(NIH)-funded study of COVID-19 vaccination and lactation outcomes and expertise developed through Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention-funded research on antenatal vaccination safety. We are uniquely
positioned to study lactation and child health outcomes and overcome reporting and volunteer bias in other
studies by using routinely collected information on breastfeeding, growth, and developmental screening at well-
child visits for a defined population as we have done in prior NIH-funded research. The study will provide timely
real-world evidence to inform clinical guidelines and decision making regarding prenatal RSV vaccination."

 Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for individuals suffering from end-stage lung diseases. The
number of lung transplants is increasing annually, and over 50% of worldwide lung transplants are performed in
the United States. However, the long-term survival of lung transplant patients lags behind other solid organ
transplants. To improve the lung transplant outcome and optimize the allocation of donor lungs, it is essential to
identify factors that are associated with transplant outcomes. We propose to systematically validate a new
concept called ""Bio-Geo-Composition"" as a potential biomarker for assessing lung transplant candidates. Our
goal is to develop an automated frailty and fitness scoring system to objectively assess a candidate's fitness for
a lung transplant, which we call the “Pittsburgh Transplant Fitness Score.” The PTFS will be designed to
accurately predict the intra- and post-operative outcomes primarily based on recipients' pre-transplant chest
computed tomography (CT) scans. The Bio-Geo-Composition concept assesses an individual's biological and
geometric attributes through three components: body tissues, lung characteristics, and thoracic geometry. We
will use advanced automated algorithms to comprehensively quantify Bio-Geo-Composition features depicted
on pre-transplant CT images and analyze their association with transplant outcomes during and after the surgery.
The significant factors will be integrated as a computer model with other patient characteristics to produce the
PTFS. The model will optimize to predict intraoperative complications (e.g., delayed chest closure), postoperative
complications (e.g., primary graft dysfunction, postoperative mechanical support, and ICU stay), and survival.
Awareness of the potential factors contributing to unfitness will allow for pre-transplant care to be tailored to
address these issues with the aim of improving fitness and maximizing the benefit of lung transplants."
10940940,"Humans have a defined set of chromosomes that are essential for our normal growth, development, and
reproduction. Carrying too many (or too few) copies of these essential chromosomes is known as aneuploidy,
a condition that has been extensively investigated due to its negative impact on human health. Extra,
nonessential chromosomes that are derived from the essential set of chromosomes have also been associated
with a broad range of serious health issues such as developmental disorders, infertility, and cancer. These
supernumerary chromosomes, however, remain mostly understudied, resulting in a large gap in our
understanding of their etiology and dynamics. A critical barrier to closing this knowledge gap has been the
availability of a robust model system that will allow investigation into the unknown aspects of supernumerary
chromosome biology. The broad objective of the proposed research is to overcome this barrier by exploiting
the newly established B chromosome system in D. melanogaster to model the etiology and dynamics of
supernumerary chromosomes in humans. This work will capitalize on the arsenal of molecular, cellular, and
genetic tools available in D. melanogaster to investigate several unknown aspects of supernumerary
chromosome biology. To understand the genetic environment that permits supernumerary chromosomes to
arise from the essential chromosomes, this study will use ultra-long DNA sequencing technology and advanced
bioinformatic assembly methods to construct a map of the B chromosome and reveal the sequence context of
where it arose from its original chromosome. The proposed research will also reveal how supernumerary
chromosomes affect the stability of the essential chromosomes by applying a combination of cytological and
genetic analyses to directly and indirectly assess chromosome-chromosome interactions. Finally, to
investigate the cellular machinery required to prevent the transmission of supernumerary chromosomes,
classic genetic approaches will be combined with a newly developed assay for imaging chromosome dynamics
during female meiosis. Overall, the newly established B chromosome model system is uniquely positioned to
deliver significant advances in our understanding of supernumerary chromosome biology that will lead to
advances in their prevention and treatment in humans."
10911083,"Dr. Tregellas’ research career has focused on the neurobiology of schizophrenia, a leading cause
of disability for Veterans. Much of this research is focused on low-level sensory processing deficits and
hippocampal hyperactivity, which is now considered a core feature of the illness. In addition to work
examining various contexts in which hippocampal hyperactivity is observed in schizophrenia, Dr. Tregellas
has explored the effect of this activity on other cognitive processes and is actively engaged in therapeutic
development. Initially with nicotinic agonists, and now with other potential therapeutic strategies, he is
leading efforts to target hippocampal hyperactivity as a means to improve treatments for the symptoms of
schizophrenia. In his current project, Dr. Tregellas is determining if low-lose levetiracetam, an
anticonvulsant agent typically used to control seizures, may reduce hippocampal hyperactivity in patients.
This strategy originally was motivated not only by the fact that levetiracetam effectively reduces neuronal
excitability in epilepsy, but also that low doses of the agent were shown to reduce neuronal activity in
individuals with mild cognitive impairment, who also show excessive activity in the hippocampus. After
initial studies showing that the agent reduces a measure of neuronal excitability in a mouse model of
schizophrenia, Dr. Tregellas is now in the initial stages of a human clinical trial to determine if
levetiracetam can reduce hippocampal hyperactivity and improve cognition in Veterans with
schizophrenia. This work is currently funded by a VA Merit Review Award and a VA Research Career
Scientist Award.
 In addition to work examining the neurobiology of schizophrenia, Dr. Tregellas is also interested in
understanding how current treatments for schizophrenia cause weight gain and metabolic problems in
patients. Toward this end, he has an NIH R01 to study the neuronal processes of antipsychotic-induced
weight gain, and to examine the effects of exercise on these processes in patients. Specifically, this study
examines the neuronal effects of antipsychotics associated with a high risk of weight gain, compared to
treatments associated with a low risk of weight gain. Coupled with this, Dr. Tregellas also is studying the
effects of a 12-week exercise intervention on neuronal responses associated with food intake behavior.
Related to this work, Dr. Tregellas also is interested in understanding the neurobiology of obesity in the
general population. With his VA collaborator Dr. Marc Cornier, Dr. Tregellas has performed and published
a series of studies examining differences in neuronal response in individuals prone or resistant to obesity.
Many of these studies have examined responses to changes in energy intake or expenditure. In his
current work on this topic, Dr. Tregellas is leveraging an observation from his schizophrenia work, that an
alpha-7 nicotinic agonist causes reduced neuronal response in some of the same networks that he had
previously found to be hyperactive in individuals with obesity. This finding, along with an observed effect
of drug on weight in the schizophrenia work, led to an NIH R01-funded study of the effects of an alpha-7
nicotinic agonist on neurobiological and behavioral processes related to obesity in the general population.
The aim of this work is to better understand the neurobiology of obesity and develop treatments to reduce
its prevalence, a goal of vital importance to the VA."

Post-stroke dementia is an important and understudied component of the vascular contributions to cognitive

decade afterwards, even after accounting for other vascular risk factors of dementia and the initial effects of the
stroke lesion on cognition. Also, silent strokes occur in nearly half of all aging individuals and are associated with
dementia. We established in wildtype mice that stroke triggers chronic neuroinflammation in the stroke scar and
connected brain regions, and that this causes delayed-onset cognitive decline. In humans, there is
neuroinflammation in the stroke scar in about half of all chronic stroke survivors on autopsy, even decades after
stroke, suggesting it may play a role in people as well. However, there are no biomarkers that can currently be
used in living humans to detect who is at risk of cognitive decline and dementia after stroke. Here we propose to
test the hypothesis that inflammation-induced angiogenesis in the stroke and connected regions results in
immature leaky vessels that cause blood-brain barrier leakage even very late after stroke. We will recruit 200
participants with chronic stroke and 50 controls at 3 sites (Stanford School of Medicine, Columbia University,
and the University of Manchester). We will test an MRI-based imaging biomarker in Aim 1 and ask whether
blood-brain barrier permeability is compromised for years after stroke. In Aim 2 we will ask whether a blood
biomarker of imbalanced angiogenesis is dysregulated in chronic stroke. For both, we will also look at risk factors
for their development and how they relate to stroke size, location, sex, age, and NIHSS. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
use both traditional multivariable and machine learning models to ask whether each biomarker separately or
together predicts cognitive decline after stroke, and to identify other MRI, blood, and clinical characteristics that
are associated. If we are successful, we will establish that there is chronic blood-brain barrier dysfunction after
stroke and link it to dysregulated angiogenesis as a potential mechanism. This would be a fundamental change
in how post-stroke dementia is conceptualized and would open avenues for novel therapy development. Our
predictive models will also be useful to identify stroke survivors at high risk of cognitive decline and/or to select
patients for future clinical trials. This will thus help us better understand vascular contributions to cognitive
impairment and dementia."

The long-term goal of our research is to determine how the immune system interfaces with cells in the
dystrophic niche to impact the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to provide a foundation
for developing novel treatments for this devastating disease. The objective of the current study is to define
how regulatory T cells (Treg) regulate macrophage-stromal interactions in muscle, and how these interactions
can be pharmacologically manipulated to alter disease progression. We provide strong scientific premise for
proposing the central hypothesis that Tregs regulate the severity of DMD by suppressing a distinct galectin-3+
muscle macrophage population that promotes fibrosis. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data and
prior research, showing that 1) dystrophic muscle is populated by a putative fibrogenic galectin-3+/Spp1+
macrophage that we identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq); 2) prior research showing that spp1
promotes fibrosis in mdx mice; 3) macrophage-specific deletion of Spp1 in mdx mice causes remarkable changes
in the transcriptional profile of PGFRa+ stromal cells, as assessed by scRNAseq; 4) galectin-3+ macrophages
are expanded when Tregs are depleted in mdx mice, suggesting that Tregs suppress fibrogenic macrophages
and 5) depletion of Tregs in mdx mice causes an increased expression of pro-fibrotic genes. We will test our
central hypothesis by addressing two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will define how galectin-3+ muscle
macrophages promote fibrosis. Two subaims will be addressed under specific aim 2, identify the molecular
basis for Treg suppression of galectin-3+ muscle macrophages. In subaim 2a we will determine whether the
Treg-mediated suppression of IFNg-producing cells is IL-10 dependent; and in subaim 2b we will examine
whether the therapeutic expansion of Tregs suppresses fibrosis. Although a role for Spp1 in promoting fibrosis
in mdx mice has been documented, a mechanism for this pathological process is largely unknown. Thus, our
proposed study is significant as it will define the cellular basis by which Spp1 promotes muscle fibrosis, and
advance our understanding of how Tregs ameliorate the severity of muscular dystrophy. The proposed
research is innovative because it will define mechanisms of cellular cross talk that promote fibrosis in dystrophic
muscles. The proposed studies use innovative technologies (e.g. scRNAseq) and experimental therapeutics (e.g.
IL-2c) that will provide the framework for developing novel approaches to inhibit the development of fibrosis.
These potential discoveries will advance the field by establishing interactions between the lymphoid and myeloid
compartment of the immune system that operate in DMD to suppress or limit fibrogenic responses. Further,
findings from the proposed studies are expected to have significant clinical implications for DMD, as the
immunosuppressive function of Tregs can be therapeutically augmented to ameliorate disease severity by
inhibiting pro-fibrotic inflammatory responses."

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by
ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and bi- or multi-nucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow. The
mechanisms of erythroid dysfunction in CDAs are incompletely understood; studying the molecular defects in
these diseases can reveal critical pathways in terminal erythropoiesis. We have identified mutations in VPS4A
as a novel cause of CDA in three unrelated patients with a syndrome of dyserythropoiesis, hemolytic anemia,
and neurodevelopmental delay, pointing to the importance of Vacuolar Protein Sorting 4A (VPS4A) for terminal
erythropoiesis and normal red blood cell survival. However, the mechanisms of its action need further
investigation. VPS4A is an ATPase that has been shown in yeast and in vitro cell cultures to participate with the
Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)-III in endosomal vesicle trafficking, viral budding,
and the abscission step of cytokinesis. It is required for budding of endosomal vesicles into multivesicular bodies,
a critical step in the pathway for the sorting, recycling, and removal of transmembrane protein receptors. We
have shown for the first time a human disease in patients with dominant negative mutations in the ATPase
domain of VPS4A, resulting in dyserythropoiesis with erythroblasts connected by cytoplasmic bridges consistent
with cytokinesis failure at the abscission step and reticulocytes with evidence of altered trafficking of the
transferrin receptor (TfR1/CD71). We hypothesize that VPS4A is essential for terminal erythropoiesis and that
loss of function results in dyserythropoiesis through a combination of cytokinesis failure and endolysosomal
defects. The goal of this work is to define the molecular mechanisms by which these VPS4A variants disturb
erythropoiesis, and to elucidate the roles of VPS4A and the ESCRT machinery in human and murine terminal
erythropoiesis. We aim to model the erythroid defects due to VPS4 in vivo using a transgenic mouse model with
erythroid-targeted expression of a known dominant-negative VPS4 mutant (VPS4EQ), enabling studies on the
pathogenic mechanisms and natural history of the disease (Aim 1). Using human iPSCs, we will investigate the
contributions of cytokinesis failure and iron trafficking defects to the dyserythropoiesis observed in these
individuals using normal, patient-derived, and VPS4AEQ CRISPR gene-edited iPSCs (Aim 2). These studies will
demonstrate the role of VPS4A and ESCRT-III machinery as an essential molecular pathway for erythropoiesis."

The central goal of this project is to understand how protein motion gives rise to function. However, visualizing
proteins in motion is a problem that is inherently difficult in structural biology as it involves signals from many
conformations. To tackle this challenge, we take an interdisciplinary approach. We apply our understanding of
the theory of scattering-based structural methods to develop new computational methods for processing and
interpretating data representing conformational disorder. We have developed methods to extract dynamic infor-
mation from protein crystals that have the potential to animate crystal structures, and we have mapped the
structural interconversions of allosteric and flexible enzymes. In the coming years, we will continue to tackle
fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms of protein allostery and catalysis, and to do so, we will
expand the scope of our work by integrating cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with advanced X-ray methods.
Our goals are to: capture correlated motions in allosteric networks, apply our expertise with mathematical de-
composition to the problem of conformational heterogeneity, and (3) probe protein motions that control catalysis."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 3–11% of the United States elderly.
On the other hand, the estimated incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-induced mental disability or
disease is 10 per 1000 live births. Although theoretically PAE-induced mental diseases are preventable, the
prevalence of PAE has been reported to be as high as 10%-16.3%. Among a broad spectrum of PAE and AD-
associated symptoms, progressive impairment of cognition has been extensively investigated. However, limited
symptomatic relief in these patients by available medications demonstrates lack of understanding of the neuronal
substrates, especially the PAE and/or AD-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs). It is well accepted that
apathy, the top ranked NPS in both PAE and AD, arises through interactions between genetic and environmental
factors. PAE has been considered an environmental insult to the brain and AD high risk genes have been
identified as top genetic factors facilitating the onset of NPSs. Together with the increased life expectancy by 8-
10 years in the USA in the last 50 years, the evaluation of interactions between PAE history and AD high-risk
genes at the molecular, synaptic, circuit, and behavioral levels is highly urgent. Ca2+permeable(CP)-AMPARs in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are hypothesized as the potential substrate in mediating the synaptic loss and the
low motivation phenotype in subjects with high risk of AD and a history of PAE. In this proposal, three Specific
Aims are designed to first evaluate, and then modify, synaptic CP-AMPARs (Aim1) and excitatory synaptic
contacts (Aim 2) in the NAc, and motivation levels (Aim 3) in F344 wild type vs. transgenic AD rats at the
adolescent, early adult and middle-aged stages. Our hope is to not only fill the gap in our understanding of
neuronal mechanisms of apathy associated with AD and PAE, but also uncover novel neurobiological targets in
the clinic to treat affected patients."

What spatial and temporal controls regulate subcellular macromolecular complexes at
the cell surface (plasma membrane) and how such spatial and temporal controls impact
various disease states, is not known. The long-term goal of this proposal is to find new
targets for diagnostic and treatment approaches that address the subcellular changes
that occur in macromolecular complexes at the plasma membrane in diseases ranging
from cancer, ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease, and various neuropathies.
The objective of this proposal is to assess the novel role of a key protein in tethering
numerous factors to the plasma membrane to precisely control the location and timing
of the formation of subcellular complexes involved in cell division, growth signaling and
nerve signaling transduction. The proposal will use an innovative combination of
techniques from biological, physical and biochemical sciences. These include recently-
in-house-developed techniques using microfluidics and optogenetics to encapsulate
cytoplasm in various sizes of our choosing in which the membrane composition, cell
cycle state, and protein composition can all be precisely controlled both spatially and
temporally. The proposed research is significant, because it will determine which
proteins in these newly identified pathways should be therapeutic targets for which
diseases and in which cell types. It is also significant because it will develop a platform
that can be extended to other proteins to study their roles at the plasma membrane
alone or in combination with other factors, opening new avenues for dissecting
macromolecular complexes at the plasma membrane in various contexts. This work will
develop foundational resources that will be used by other researchers. The results will
have a positive impact immediately because they will establish a better understanding
of various cancers, ciliopathies and neuropathies and lead to new diagnostic and
therapeutic targets for these diseases, and long-term because they lay the groundwork
to develop new techniques for dissection of a multitude of different complexes at the
plasma membrane."

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare hematologic maligancy in which non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) initially presents in the central nervous system (CNS). Therapeutic options for PCNSL are
limited; standard of care high-dose methotrexate-containing regimens have been unchanged for over 40 years,
and are not curative in most patients. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy targeting CD19 (CD19-
CAR T cells) is a powerful form of immunotherapy that has an established safety profile when delivered
intravenously (IV) to treat patients with NHL. Our clinical platform for manufacturing CD19-CAR T cells at City of
Hope (COH) has been evaluated in a series of phase 1 clinical trials for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) and for NHL. To date, all previous and ongoing CD19-CAR T cell trials have infused the CAR T cell product
IV. We have preliminary evidence that IV-administered CD19-CAR T cells can be detected in the CNS and have
anti-tumor activity in treating patients with PCNSL. However, the efficacy of IV CAR T cell therapies for patients
with PCNSL is limited, possibly due to poor trafficking of CAR T cells from blood to CNS that may result in
reduced activity against PCNSL compared to systemic NHL. In phase 1 trials at COH, locoregional delivery of
CAR T cells to treat CNS malignancies such as glioblastoma has led to improved outcomes. Studies in our
animal models show improved disease response, durability and resistence to tumor rechallenge using
intracerebroventricular (ICV)- vs IV- delivered CD19-CAR T cells in xenograft mouse models of CNS lymphoma.
Thus, to optimize the efficacy of CD19-CAR T cells and improve the outcomes of patients with PCNSL, we
propose to administer CD19-CAR T cells via ICV delivery. We hypothesize that ICV-delivered CD19-CAR T
cells will be safe and demonstrate high anti-PCNSL activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a phase 1 clinical
trial to assess the safety and activity, and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ICV delivered
CD19-CAR T cells in participants with PCNSL. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a series of correlative studies
to assess mechanisms of toxicity, CAR T cell persistance, trafficking to the peripheral blood, immune cell
phenotype, and effect on tumor. We plan to examine the effects of ICV-delivered CAR T cells on normal CD19+
B cells in the peripheral blood to determine whether CAR T cells traffic from the CNS to the blood, as we expect
based on our preclinical animal models of PCNSL. Activity against normal B cells in the blood would indicate
that ICV delivery could be a viable treatment option for patients with secondary CNS lymphoma, who have both
CNS and systemic disease. Successful completion of the proposed clinical trial and correlative studies will
expand therapeutic options for patients with PCNSL and could inform the design of a potential subsequent clinical
trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating patients with secondary CNS lymphoma."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Dysfunction of
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is one of the primary early events during AMD. RPE cells play many
important roles in vision and helps to maintain the health and integrity of the retina and defects in this layer lead
to progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Hallmarks of AMD include protein deposits called drusen
which lie underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and can evolve into geographic atrophy or choroidal
neovascularization with consequent loss of photoreceptors. While treatments exist that slow down the course of
some forms of AMD, a permanent cure to stop the inexorable loss of vision does not exist. A critical need in the
field is a better model for early features of AMD such as drusen formation and recognition of disease-causing
mechanisms is needed. This is a difficult problem given the multifactorial nature of AMD. It is well known that
photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are crucially dependent on tightly controlled lipid
homeostasis to maintain function. Each day, roughly a tenth of the rod outer segments (OS) are shed and
phagocytized by the RPE, which recycle the membranes as part of the visual cycle. Given the vast amount of
cell membrane, mostly comprised of lipids and proteins that is recycled daily, it is plausible that defects in lipid
metabolism could be involved in at least some part of the disease pathology. In this project we propose to study
lipidomics in human RPE cells from patient derived iPSCs as part of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2
(AREDS2) which aims to identify predisposing factors, clinical features, and prognostic indicators of AMD. We
propose to differentiate iPSC lines from this study, assess potential variability between lines, and evaluate
transcriptional differences. We will then assess differences in the lipid content of ‘disease’ versus control lines
searching for potential biomarkers of disease. Lastly, we will explore functional differences between lines by
performing phagocytosis assays. Together, we hope to identify novel disease-associated biomarkers that may
ultimately lead to new therapeutic options for treating this devastating disease."

Microbiomes have been described as ‘ecosystems on a leash,’ because immunological control of the
microbiome is critical for host health. Variation in the genes that produce the immune system has been linked
to microbiome dysbiosis and to disease, and studying immune systems in the context of host-microbe
coevolution has generated critical insights. However, we do not understand the evolutionary forces maintaining
host genetic variation related to the microbiome or how immune systems coevolve with beneficial microbes. My
research program takes advantage of several key features of an innovative animal model system: an insect
called the pea aphid. This animal reproduces asexually, and we can precisely manipulate bacterial
microbiomes across asexual lineages by adding or removing specific strains and species of microbes. The
aphid microbiome includes species of Enterobacteriaceae that have clear benefits for their hosts including
protection against pathogens and parasites. These aspects of our model system allow us to untangle the
specific effects of host and bacterial genetic variation on the microbiome, and to study natural and ecologically-
relevant host-microbe pairings. Importantly, my lab has generated key data on the patterns of association
between microbes and host populations, and we have shown that genetic variation in the immune system
governs the association with bacterial symbionts. Over the next five years, we will use techniques adapted
from human innate immunology, functional and forward genetics, and dual-RNAseq of both host and microbes
to understand the roles by which animal immune systems and beneficial microbes evolve in a bi-directional
manner. Our preliminary data suggest that phagocytes control the density of bacterial infections, but that some
strains of microbes have evolved to kill phagocytes to grow to high density. We will test a mechanistic model
for the interaction between phagocytes and beneficial bacterial in the context of host and bacterial genetic
variation. Simultaneously, we will use an F2 cross to determine what kinds of genes underlie host genetic
variation in the microbiome, the patterns of molecular evolution at these loci, and importantly, whether these
genes also govern resistance against often closely-related pathogens. Together, this work will address
fundamental questions relevant to human health, including whether adaptation to beneficial microbes trades off
with the ability to combat pathogens, and how control of the microbiome shapes microbial virulence. This work
will establish a foundation for my lab’s future efforts to develop a comprehensive picture of how natural
selection shapes host traits related to the microbiome in a controlled and tractable model system."

Cancer immunotherapy using T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor or T-cell receptor directed
against cancer antigens is a promising new therapeutic modality for treating many types of cancer. However,
lack of efficacy due to T-cell dysfunction, particularly in the solid tumor setting, has stymied progress. Multiple
stressors exist within tumors that drive T cells to a dysfunctional state, reducing their ability to clear tumors.
Genes have been identified that improve T-cell resilience to different tumor stressors. However, these genetic
modifications that improve T-cell exhaustion resistance often act via different mechanisms, creating uncertainty
regarding the relative benefit of different approaches or how to combine them for maximum efficacy.
Altering transcription factor activity is a particularly robust way to favor a functional therapeutic cell state. The
field has identified transcription factors that can be overexpressed to promote retention of T-cell effector activity
or a more persistent, stem-like state. Additional transcription factors have been identified that promote
dysfunction downstream of chronic antigen signaling or in response to metabolic conditions in the tumor
microenvironment and can be knocked out to favor retention of T-cell activity. Both approaches have yielded
improvements in tumor control in preclinical models, but the use of different models and conflicting results leaves
uncertainty about which modifications are most beneficial and their mechanism. We intend to use protein
engineering to create protein-based inhibitors that bind and prevent the function of transcription factors when
overexpressed in T cells. This will allow the creation of overexpression libraries with members that can both
decrease and increase transcription factor activity to facilitate the comparison of genetic modifications in T cells.
The goals of this Steven I. Katz proposal are to: 1) Understand the molecular mechanism of the transcription
factors complexes regulating T-cell exhaustion, 2) Increase resistance to T-cell dysfunction through systematic
multiplexing of transcription factor perturbations, and 3) Determine the relative benefit of transcription factor
perturbations that counter different sources of T-cell dysfunction in the in vivo tumor microenvironment. As
specified by the funding mechanism, this proposal sets forth an important new research direction for our lab in
the areas of T-cell dysfunction and engineering of endogenous transcription factors and is well-based in
published literature and supported by subject matter experts and collaboration. Through screening of pooled
libraries and parallel characterization of a matrix of multiplexed engineered transcription factors using in vitro
and in vivo models of tumor-induced T-cell dysfunction, this proposal will address the important question of which
transcription factor perturbations are most effective in promoting resistance to T-cell dysfunction. Using cutting-
edge single-cell RNA-seq mapped to transcription factor perturbations, we will determine the effect of these
modifications on T cells in murine tumors. This grant will yield new transcription factor engineering solutions to
improve therapeutic cells, generating biological insight and new research paths in cell therapy engineering."

Locally-acting rectal and vaginal semi-solid products have been widely used for the treatment of diseases and
disorders in the rectum and vagina (and/or cervix) over the past few decades. Despite their prevalence, the
development and approval of generic versions of these drug products have remained difficult due to the
complexity of these products as well as the challenges of conducting bioequivalence (BE) studies with clinical
pharmacodynamic (or pharmacokinetic) endpoints. The main objectives of the project are to: 1) identify critical
quality attributes (CQA’s) of a variety of semi-solid dosage forms (such as suppositories with/without a gelatin
coating and creams) that are common for rectal and vaginal administration; 2) develop in vitro performance test
methods and method validation strategies that are unique for these rectal and vaginal products; and 3) elucidate
drug permeation mechanisms across the rectal and vaginal mucosal membranes. The proposed research builds
upon our previous research on the comparative product characterization and method development and validation
of in vitro performance tests (such as in vitro release test (IVRT) and in vitro permeation test (IVPT)) for rectal
suppositories and vaginal creams. Miconazole nitrate that is commercially available in a variety of vaginal dosage
forms (i.e., suppository with/without a gelatin coating, cream) and mesalamine will be used as the model drugs.
Comprehensive characterization of relevant physicochemical and structural properties of a variety of semi-solid
dosage forms prevalent for rectal and vaginal administration will be conducted. The quality-by-design (QbD)
principles will be implemented to identify CQA’s as well as the key material and processing parameters that can
affect the CQA’s and in vitro product performance for a variety of topical rectal and vaginal semi-solid dosage
forms. In vitro permeation behavior of a variety of topical semi-solid dosage forms and drugs (e.g., hydrophilic
vs. hydrophobic) will be investigated using both animal and human tissues to elucidate drug permeation
mechanisms across the mucosal membranes. Lastly, a pilot study on expanding physiologically based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to support BE assessment of locally-acting rectal and vaginal drug products
will be conducted. It is expected that a comprehensive understanding of the CQA’s and their relationship to
material and processing differences will be provided for a variety of topical semi-solid dosage forms. Moreover,
robust and sensitive in vitro performance test methods and method validation strategies that are unique for rectal
and vaginal products will be developed. The proposed research will support the establishment of in vitro
comparative product characterization-based BE approaches that are suitable for locally-acting rectal and vaginal
semi-solid drug products, thus facilitating the development of generic versions of these drug products and helping
advance the regulatory review and approval processes for both innovator and generic drug products. This will
ultimately increase the public access to high quality and affordable topical rectal and vaginal medication."

 This K01 award application is for Dr. Victoria L. Tiase, a PhD-trained nurse informaticist with a
commitment to improving the systems, structures, and policies that support a diverse nursing workforce. Her
overarching career goal is to become an independent nurse researcher focused on obtaining a broad
understanding of nursing workload, specifically in relation to reducing nurse burnout, through the application of
electronic health record (EHR) data and data science. This K01 will support three key areas of career
development: (1) strengthen existing knowledge of EHR audit log data for use in research; (2) acquire
advanced knowledge and skills in data science and computational modeling; and (3) transition from a
mentored researcher to independent investigator. The training and research will be conducted at an institution
with a strong record of providing excellent support and rich training and educational resources. The candidate’s
department is committed to the success of this early-stage researcher, providing any additional resources
necessary to complete the proposed career development and research aims, and ensuring ongoing protected
research time. The coursework and mentoring will be overseen by a complementary and multidisciplinary team
of experienced researchers and experts in these fields.
 Nurse burnout is persistent in the U.S. with nurses reporting concerns over their work environment,
particularly those working in primary care and community clinics in underserved settings. Increased workload is
reported as the main contributor. Although nurse burnout has been studied for decades, little has changed in
the organization of clinical care, and the measurement of nursing workload is not well understood. Workload
measurement has traditionally taken the form of self-report, surveys, and time and motion studies which are
time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to scale. Gathering sufficient data that are reliable, reproducible,
generalizable, and that represent nursing contributions within the context of work activities remains a complex,
unsolved problem. Advances in informatics and electronic health record (EHR) audit log data have shown
promise in measuring clinician work activities. State-of-the-art data science paradigms are needed to fully
understand the complexity of nursing work activities and their relevance to workload. Thus, this study’s
Specific Aims include: (1) Characterize and extract features from EHR audit log data and develop a data
representation amenable to state-of-the-art data science techniques; and (2) Develop realistic and reproducible
computational models of nursing EHR interactions. The proposed research is innovative because it will extend
an existing untapped data source to nursing activities and will create a model to quantitatively measure
workload influencers. This research lays the groundwork to test scalable interventions that mitigate nurse
burnout, improve nurse wellness, reduce costs, and ultimately, reduce health disparities."

Our research program aims to understand the role of extracellular lipid vesicles in intercellular
communication, with the ultimate goal of elucidating new mechanisms of communication
involved in disease pathologies. To achieve this, we are developing new bioanalysis tools
including tissue culture and perfusion systems for sampling exosomes released from ex vivo
tissue slices, and separations-based bioassays for the direct and selective quantitation of
exosomes in microfluidic volumes. For the next 5 years, our program goals are: 1) to achieve
key system refinements of our tissue culture perfusion system that will enable high sensitivity
measurements of secreted factors; 2) to develop a novel mode of separations-based
immunoassay tailored specifically to the quantitation of exosome release; and 3) to apply these
technologies to investigate a hypothesis of circadian rhythm coordination via extracellular
vesicle release in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain. We envision that our research will
enable new dimensions of study in the bioanalytical and extracellular vesicle research
communities, ultimately leading to new therapies that target dysregulated intercellular
communications in neurological and metabolic disorders."

 the intersection of many disciplines (microbiology, immunology, infectious diseases, public health, pathology,
 pediatrics, medicine, epidemiology, behavior, global health, implementation science, engineering, bioinformatics,
 and health policy) and plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the well-being of communities worldwide. The demand
 for transformative research and comprehensive training in vaccinology has never been more pressing. This is a
 renewal application for the fourth cycle (years 16-20) of the established Emory Vaccinology Training Program
 T32 (VTP-T32). Since 2009, our program continues to be uniquely positioned to train a cadre of basic,
 translational, public health and clinical scientists with cutting edge, multi-disciplinary expertise in vaccinology.
 The program supports skilled and diverse post-doctoral fellows through rigorous didactic coursework, hands on
 mentored project and professional development. Mentored by highly accomplished faculty, fellows will engage
 in innovative research from one of seven Research Training Sections: 1) Pathogenesis & Vaccine Discovery; 2)
 Immunology; 3) Translation, Delivery and Clinical Trials; 4) Epidemiology; 5) Implementation Science & Health
 Policy; 6) Vaccine Safety (a dedicated CDC funded slot); and 7) Bioinformatics and Computational Vaccinology.
 We will continue to build on our success: 94% of graduates have stayed in government, industry or academia
 and among them, 87% are thriving in vaccine-related fields. A total of 186 papers are directly associated with
 the VTP-T32 and 40% of these papers are with trainees as first author; in addition, a total of 145 grants from a

 pediatrics, medicine, epidemiology, behavior, global health, implementation science, engineering, bioinformatics,
 and health policy) and plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the well-being of communities worldwide. The demand
 for transformative research and comprehensive training in vaccinology has never been more pressing. This is a
 renewal application for the fourth cycle (years 16-20) of the established Emory Vaccinology Training Program
 T32 (VTP-T32). Since 2009, our program continues to be uniquely positioned to train a cadre of basic,
 translational, public health and clinical scientists with cutting edge, multi-disciplinary expertise in vaccinology.
 The program supports skilled and diverse post-doctoral fellows through rigorous didactic coursework, hands on
 mentored project and professional development. Mentored by highly accomplished faculty, fellows will engage
 in innovative research from one of seven Research Training Sections: 1) Pathogenesis & Vaccine Discovery; 2)
 Immunology; 3) Translation, Delivery and Clinical Trials; 4) Epidemiology; 5) Implementation Science & Health
 Policy; 6) Vaccine Safety (a dedicated CDC funded slot); and 7) Bioinformatics and Computational Vaccinology.
 We will continue to build on our success: 94% of graduates have stayed in government, industry or academia
 and among them, 87% are thriving in vaccine-related fields. A total of 186 papers are directly associated with
 the VTP-T32 and 40% of these papers are with trainees as first author; in addition, a total of 145 grants from a
 variety of funding sources have been awarded to our scholars.
 The specific aims of the Emory VTP-T32 are:
1- To continue implementing our systematic approach for identifying, recruiting and retaining highly qualified,
 motivated, and diverse post-doctoral trainees into the VTP-T32.
2- To provide each trainee a rigorous and tailored curriculum covering key aspects of vaccinology, a robust hands-
 on mentored research project, and career mentoring.
3- To continue integrating the strong basic science, translational research, implementation science, clinical trials,
 and vaccine policy programs at Emory into a multi-faceted training experience and inclusive environment
 promoting collaborations and interdisciplinary approaches."

Increasing evidence suggests that activated neutrophils play a critical role in promoting vaso-occlusion and
morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). Multiple factors are thought to contribute to neutrophil activation in SCD,
including products of red cell (RBC) hemolysis and cellular interactions between neutrophils and the endothelium
or platelets. Once neutrophils are activated, stimulus-dependent effects on neutrophil phenotype and functional
capacity have been reported, resulting in dysfunctional neutrophils which propagate inflammation. Unlike prior
studies in SCD which largely suggest that neutrophil activation occurs via indirect mediators, our preliminary
data support the hypothesis that sickle RBCs (SS RBCs) directly activate neutrophils, resulting in enhanced
adhesiveness and increased degranulation responses. We show that these 2 effector functions are further
enhanced when SS RBC phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure is increased and when SS RBC adhesion receptors
are activated. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show that in steady-state, exchange transfusion reduces
neutrophil activation. Based on the preliminary data presented in this application, we will test the hypothesis that
intact SS RBCs induce a specific neutrophil activation profile which recapitulates neutrophil dysfunction in SCD.
We also hypothesize that therapies that reduce the RBC characteristics enabling this effect might both reduce
neutrophil activation and decrease the frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive events. In Aims 1 and 2, we will
delineate upstream characteristics of RBCs contributing to neutrophil activation as well as downstream
consequences of SS RBC-induced neutrophil interaction in vitro. In Aim 1, we will establish the effect of SS
RBCs on neutrophil phenotype, function, and gene expression. In Aim 2, we will establish the requirements
needed for SS RBCs to activate neutrophils by examining physical requirements such as concentration
thresholds and need for contact. We will also establish the role of PS exposure and the known activatable RBC
membrane adhesion receptors (BCAM/Lu, ICAM4, CD47, and CD44) on neutrophil activation. In Aim 3, we will
determine if the SS RBC-neutrophil interactions and measures of neutrophil activation we have described in vitro
reflect those seen in patients during acute chest syndrome (ACS). In addition, we will determine the effect of
transfusion, which we have shown affects neutrophil activation in steady-state, on in vivo neutrophil activation
during acute illness. Together, these studies build on our novel observation that SS RBCs are able to directly
induce neutrophil activation. The work outlined in this proposal will systematically define the characteristics of
SS RBCs which cause neutrophil activation and the functional/phenotypic/transcriptional changes seen in
neutrophils after activation by SS RBCs. These results will potentially identify new therapeutic targets and will
provide significant biologic insight into the role of neutrophil-RBC interactions in SCD."

Inflammation is a tightly regulated and necessary biological process that protects humans from invading
pathogens and repairs tissue following injury. Failure to resolve inflammation is associated with the pathology
of many chronic diseases including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegeneration.
Complex cellular signaling, mediated by the enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by
cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, induces and then resolves inflammation, restoring the human body to
homeostasis. The structure of PUFAs also make them susceptible to autoxidation or nonenzymatic oxidation.
The resulting autoxidation products include lipid electrophiles (LE) that react with nucleophilic amino acids to
form protein post-translational modifications (PTM). These PTMs are deleterious to protein function and thus
can be toxic to the cell. Accumulation of LE PTMs is associated with the chronic diseases mentioned above
and clinical trials attempting to treat these diseases have used antioxidants and LE scavengers to prevent the
formation and accumulation of toxic PTMs. We discovered that LEs are generated in the mitochondria of cells
through an autoxidation process and exert their toxic effects by targeting mitochondrial proteins. Mapping each
LE back to the PUFA source and the pathway of formation is difficult in mammalian cells because of the
presence of multiple PUFAs and PUFA metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, we propose using Staphylococcus
aureus as a simplified model system to study PUFA autoxidation in cells. We discovered that S. aureus
autoxidizes PUFAs to LEs that deleteriously adduct cellular proteins, killing the bacterium. S. aureus is also
genetically tractable, metabolically similar to mitochondria, and does not have PUFA metabolizing enzymes.
These characteristics will allow us to use S. aureus to unambiguously define the pathways that contribute to LE
generation. S. aureus does not synthesize PUFAs, facilitating our ability to trace LEs back to their specific
PUFA source. Alkynyl PUFAs, tools that I developed and validated during my Ph.D., will enable the
identification of the protein targets of LEs. The autoxidation chemistry of alkynyl PUFAs is indistinguishable
from their native PUFA counter parts and S. aureus will metabolize alkynyl PUFAs to alkynyl LEs. The resulting
protein PTMs will be enriched by attaching an affinity tag to the alkynyl LE modified proteins through click
chemistry. Following affinity purification, quantitative proteomics will identify the protein targets of LEs for
comparison to other treatment conditions and for downstream validation of each pathway for its role in the
cellular toxicity of LEs. In sum, my research program will identify LEs formed through autoxidation, determine
their PUFA and cellular pathway source of formation, and elucidate the cellular pathways that are modified by
LEs. The findings of this research will define the molecular mechanisms of LE formation in cells and inform
future design of LE scavengers, antioxidants, and other small molecules that can modulate LE protein PTMs to
treat chronic human diseases."

Columbia University is uniquely positioned to provide advanced dual training of the next generation of dental 
scientists in dentistry and biomedical engineering, to prepare them to lead the transformation of the daily practice 
of dentistry towards personalized and precision treatments. Through strategic investment over the last 10 years, 
Columbia University has become the place for biomedical engineering research training of dentists. The College 
of Dental Medicine (CDM) has created a new 15,000 sq ft Center for Precision Dentistry that transforms the 
traditional dental practice into a digitalized hub that tracks clinical activities in real time. Each of the 48 
operatories is able to track patients, providers and dental instruments usage and location. In addition, Columbia 
CDM is one of the first schools in the country to fully integrate dental and medical electronic records through 
EPIC, which provides an integrated patient’s health record. Moreover, the Department of Biomedical 
Engineering (DBME), established in 2000, has quickly risen to become one of the top 10 ranked graduate 
programs in Biomedical Engineering, and leads the nation in funding per faculty, with renowned strength in 
foundational areas (bioimaging, biomaterials, biomechanics) as well as in frontier research areas (cell and tissue 
engineering, neuroengineering, synthetic biology and deep learning). We propose here a new Dental-Biomedical Engineering Scholars Training (D-BEST) Program that brings together leading biomedical 
engineering researchers and dental clinicians and scholars at Columbia University. This unique dual-degree
DDS/PhD training program will integrate dental and biomedical engineering research training of dental 
scientists in four key thematic areas: 1) Stem Cells and Regenerative Engineering, 2) Craniofacial Imaging and 
Biomechanics, 3) Big Data and Deep Learning for Dental Diagnostics, and 4) Detection and Modeling of Oral 
Diseases. The two tracks of D-BEST are (i) Pre-Doc – an 8-year dual degree program in dentistry (DDS) and 
in Biomedical Engineering (PhD), and (ii) Post-Doc – post-doctoral research training in biomedical engineering 
to US or foreign trained dentists. Over the 5 years, we plan to have 24 pre-doctoral slots and 7 post-doctoral 
slots with each trainee staying on the grant for 3 years. In addition to the highly successful Summer Health 
Professions Education Program (SHPEP), we are partnering with the School of Dental Medicine at Ponce Health 
Sciences University in Puerto Rico to enhance the diversity of the trainee pool and ensure participation of 
trainees from traditionally under-represented groups in the D-BEST program. This new T90/R90 training program 
will provide a unique opportunity to promote, enhance, and deepen multidisciplinary dental research. Our long-term goal, above and beyond this 5-year grant, is to continue with a productive and sustainable program for this 
integrated training of dental scientists, with expertise rooted in both engineering and dental sciences. It is 
anticipated that this new generation of dental scientists will lead the creation of personalized solutions to 
eliminate the persistent poor oral health of adults in this country."

10938848,"Abstract
 Virtually every step of HIV-1 replication as well as numerous cellular antiviral defense mechanisms are
regulated by viral and cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that recognize distinct sequence or structural
features on viral RNAs. One such interaction takes place between the HIV-1 major structural protein, Gag, and
the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). Through its nucleocapsid (NC) domain, Gag selects two copies of an unspliced
positive strand gRNA from a pool of cellular and spliced viral mRNAs in excess and orchestrates key steps of
virion assembly. How gRNAs are selected for packaging, why only a dimer is packaged in a single virus particle
and whether NC-gRNA interactions guide other RBPs that target the same gRNA remain poorly understood.
 Previous CLIP studies demonstrated that Gag predominantly binds to guanosine-rich sequences in the
cytosol, but its binding preference shifts towards sequences with adenosine-rich nucleotide composition
(including binding sites on cellular mRNAs) at the plasma membrane where virions assemble. Here we propose
to formally test whether adenosine-richness of the HIV-1 gRNA facilitates its selective packaging through
complementary genetic and biochemical approaches (Aim 1). According to a widely accepted model, recruitment
of a dimeric gRNA to the plasma membrane nucleates virion assembly, resulting in progressive recruitment of
Gag molecules from the cytosol. As the late arriving pool of Gag molecules at the nucleation site needs to be
devoid of RNAs, we hypothesize that affinity of Gag towards cognate RNAs is a key parameter that underpins
dimeric gRNA packaging. In Aim 2, we propose to disrupt this balance by generating Gag chimeras with altered
affinity/avidity towards target RNAs and determine the impact on dimeric gRNA trafficking to the PM, gRNA
packaging and virus particle assembly. In Aim 3, using the Gag chimeric viruses as tools, we propose to target
key NC functions and determine the NC- and gRNA-dependence of other viral and host RBPs that are critical
regulators of HIV-1 replication and host defenses. Specifically, we propose to examine whether members of the
antiviral APOBEC3 protein family infiltrate into virions through binding to the viral gRNA or other virion-
incorporated host RNAs, such as 7SL. As part of this aim, Gag chimeras that can package gRNA independent
of NC will be used to test the dependence of integrase-gRNA binding, an event critical for proper virion
maturation, on NC and NC-gRNA interactions.
 Understanding the interplay between multiple RBPs that target the same gRNA is highly relevant to our
fundamental understanding of HIV-1 replication and virus-host interactions. Currently, no antiretrovirals target
gRNA packaging and assembly despite these steps presenting a clear vulnerability for HIV-1. Our preliminary
studies demonstrate that Gag-gRNA interactions are finely tuned and can be targeted. Proposed work is thus
significant as it may guide the development of NC- or gRNA-targeted drugs that abrogate gRNA packaging,
virion assembly and infectivity."

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and lethal brain cancer is notorious for wide dissemination in the brain.
Understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of GBM invasion is thus critical. While earlier research has
made progress on intrinsic drivers of cell motility, how GBM cells meet the challenge of extrinsic factors such as
physical constraints to negotiate narrow paths through the brain parenchyma remains unclear. Our preliminary
studies have revealed that endocytosis at the front of migrating cells is a critical process for membrane dynamics
during confined migration. Furthermore, our new data have also implicated alteration of the negative electric
charge at the inner membrane surface as a key organizer of cytoskeletal activity of migrating GBM cells in
confined space. These novel preliminary findings were made possible by applying new microchannel devices
coupled with live-cell imaging and advanced fluorescent probes to study GBM confined migration. In this
exploratory R21 proposal, we will conduct mechanistic studies to test the hypothesis that membrane dynamics
and membrane surface charge via mechanoelectric coupling are key drivers of confined GBM migration. In Aim
1, we will investigate how membrane dynamics mediated by endocytosis facilitates GBM confined migration. We
will conduct functional assays to assess how specific endocytosis inhibitors impact membrane dynamics and
migratory capacity of invading GBM cells through microchannels. In parallel, we will perform in vivo GBM
transplants for proof-of-principle efficacy studies of limiting endocytosis to curb invasive spread of GBM. In Aim
2, we will explore the emerging concept of surface membrane charge and mechanoelectrical coupling for
confined GBM migration. We will test the hypothesis that change of electrical charge at the inner leaflet of plasma
membrane (by anionic lipids or membrane-associated proteins) bestows GBM cells with increased migratory
capacity through organization of cytoskeletal activity. We will first generate novel molecular reagents to either
increase or decrease surface charge in an inducible manner and test the impact on GBM confined migration.
We will apply the microchannel devices for high-resolution live-cell imaging to monitor the effects of altering
membrane charges on actin network, calcium flux, and endocytosis-mediated plasma membrane dynamics. We
will then conduct proof-of concept in vivo GBM transplant studies to examine the efficacy of these novel
molecular agents to impede GBM invasion. Together, our studies will provide mechanistic insight and conceptual
advance on membrane plasticity and mechanoelectrical membrane dynamics for confined migration of GBM
cells and their impact on GBM invasiveness in vivo. It will open translational opportunities to impede GBM spread
and recurrence. We will also make the innovative microchannel devices available for the wider research
community, thus accelerating the research of cancer mechanobiology and tumor invasion."

Immunoparasitology Meeting (WHIP), which brings together principal investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows
from around the world who are in the field of immunoparasitology. The 2024 meeting will be held on April 21-24, 2024,
as an in-person meeting with virtual components. The annual gathering of scholars in this field was established in 1997
with the intent to provide a collegial meeting place for scientists to exchange ideas in this important field. While there are
other meetings where senior principal investigators in this field present their data, the focus of this meeting is to provide a
forum where trainees (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) present their work to each other and established
investigators. The meeting also aims to provide the opportunity to highlight new junior faculty in the field in our virtual
component. The location was chosen because of the strong association of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) and the
field of parasitology. This relationship began almost 40 years ago with the establishment of the annual summer course,
“Biology of Parasitism,” and with the annual Molecular Parasitology meeting held in the fall at the MBL. It is close to
laboratories on the east coast, and accessible via direct flights to Boston from around the world. Over 85% of the talks at
the WHIP meeting will be given by either graduate students or post-doctoral fellows, making this a unique meeting in the

 The ASXL-Related Disorders are ultra-rare neurodevelopmental and congenital malformation
syndromes caused by variants in one of the ASXL genes (Bohring-Opitz Syndrome: ASXL1, Shashi-Pena
Syndrome: ASXL2, Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome: ASXL3). The ASXL genes regulate transcription of the Hox
genes and are considered “readers” of the epigenetic code by playing a role in histone modification and
chromatin regulation. The clinical variability of these syndromes ranges from autism and overgrowth to profound
intellectual disabilities and growth failure. In the majority of these individuals, multiple organ systems are
affected, including the neurologic system (non-verbal, hypotonia, seizures, dysautonomia), psychiatric
functioning (behavioral disorders, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, autism spectrum), vision (retinal anomalies, optic nerve
dysplasia, high myopia), and gastrointestinal (chronic vomiting, feeding intolerance, gallstones), thereby
requiring a high level of care. There is also an increased risk for Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma in ASXL1.
 This NIH R13 grant is for the ASXL-Related Disorders Scientific Conference and Family Meeting,
which will be a 4-day international symposium at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, MD from July 18-
21, 2024. The event will include clinical and scientific presentations from experts on these disorders. It will also
involve a trainee poster session, research room to provide opportunities for participation in clinical research
studies, and family events. The goals of the meeting are: 1) To further knowledge about the natural history and
clinical management of the ASXL-Related Disorders; 2) To expand the research network and share data from
the international scientific community on the ASXL disorders; 3) To increase cross-talk and collaboration
between scientists, clinicians, and families in an effort to build on our basic understanding about the pathogenicity
of the ASXL genes; 4) To further clinical translational efforts for the ASXL conditions by developing an
infrastructure for clinical trials through developing biomarkers, collecting biologic samples, and natural history
data; 5) To foster a family network that provides a safety net for families and allows for the improved holistic care
for all ASXL families.
 This symposium focuses on genetic conditions that have a significant impact on the health and well-being
of the entire family unit. While these conditions are congenital, primarily impacting children, a growing number
of individuals are surviving into adulthood. Supporting the health and development of children throughout their
lifespan while recognizing the role of the entire family’s health, is a critical mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)."
10938637,"SUMMARY
 Chronic lung infection is the primary cause of death in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by
mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Currently, CFTR modulators
are effective in treating most CF patients, but this pharmaceutical rescue is costly, necessitates a lifelong
commitment and provides no benefit to those who produce insufficient or no CFTR. Gene therapy remains the
best hope for a cure applicable to all CFTR genotypes, and it would be less expensive than current modulator
therapy. For gene therapy to become feasible, current strategies for CFTR addition, which lead to unregulated
CFTR expression, must be adapted to reproduce the cellular heterogeneity of CFTR expression in the lung. This
is essential for bacterial clearance and innate immunity. CRISPR-based gene editing holds promise for correcting
the defect in CFTR without altering its endogenous regulation, and permanent correction is achievable by
targeting the airway progenitor stem cells. However, the cell-cycle dependent homology-directed repair (HDR)
is inefficient for application to the terminally differentiated airway epithelial cells and quiescent basal stem cells
of the lung airways. Here we propose to overcome the inefficiency of the current HDR approach with homology-
independent targeted integration (HITI), which has shown promise for correcting genetic defects in post-mitotic
cells in vivo. We hypothesize that a mutation-free CFTR gene can be rebuilt by using HITI to trap a pre-spliced
CFTR mega exon (associated with splicing acceptor) in a desired intron. rAAV2.5T efficiently transduces multiple
epithelial cell types (including basal stem cells) in polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures, as well as
in ferret lung airways. We will use rAAV2.5T to deliver the components necessary for editing by HITI and evaluate
the effectiveness of the HITI approach in correcting the CF phenotype both in vitro, using polarized HAE cultures
derived from CF patients, and in vivo, using a G551D CF ferret model. However, the clinical utility of rAAV2.5T
is currently limited by the need of pharmaceutical augmentation, because its transduction in polarized airway
epithelium requires the co-administration of doxorubicin (Dox) to overcome a significant post-entry block to
nuclear entry. To address this limitation, we will apply the insights gained from our preliminary studies on
rAAV2.5T transduction biology to develop a next-generation rAAV2.5T vector. Specifically, we will create random
mutants of the N terminus of the large capsid protein VP1 (VP1N), which plays a crucial role in vector
translocation from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the nucleus in productive transduction. By directed evolution
of the libraries in polarized HAE cultures, we will screen for AAV2.5T variants that efficiently transduce airway
basal cells in the absence of Dox. The lead mutants from the screening will be evaluated for efficiency of
transduction in HAE cultures and ferret airways in the absence of Dox, the best-performing variant will be used
in the HITI gene editing approach. We expect that a therapeutic genome editing approach is feasible for
permanent correction of mutations in CFTR for CF gene therapy, using a Dox-independent rAAV2.5T vector."
10942739,"Administrative supplement “Sex differences in Alzheimer's Disease blood biomarkers in middle
aged persons of African ancestry “
 In this administrative supplement, we propose to measure and compare blood levels of Alzheimer's Disease
(AD) biomarkers in men and women of African ancestry, aged 45-65, and assess the influence of sex and
adipo-myokines. This proposal extends the goal of the Tobago Brain Study (TBS, RF1AG077474), which is
currently focusing on adults aged 65 and older.
 This proposal is motivated by our recent preliminary results in the TBS cohort aged 65 and older; we find
women have worse blood AD biomarkers levels than men independent of age, adiposity, diabetes,
hypertension, or physical activity. We also find that among women (but not men), higher levels of Leptin and
IL-6 are associated with worse AD biomarkers' levels, whereas BDNF appears to have a protective effect.
 Why do older women of African ancestry have greater AD pathology than men and when do these
differences begin? Our hypothesis is that these differences may begin as early as middle-age and are due, at
least in part, to mid-life exposure to cardiometabolic diseases and adipo-myokines. If our hypothesis is correct,
mid-life intervention on cardiometabolic conditions (and perhaps also on selected cytokines) could reduce
amyloid disparities in this high-risk population.
 We propose to measure blood AD biomarkers and inflammatory adipo-myokines in 190 men and women of
African ancestry in Tobago, aged 45-64 years, whose samples are stored at the University of Pittsburgh. This
proposal is time-sensitive; the results will inform a new grant to add recruitment of middle-aged women and
men while the TBS is still actively recruiting, thus maximizing our chances of success as well as NIA existing
investment in resources and infrastructure. This proposal has high potential impact: it will increase the
likelihood for the parent TBS to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field of AD risk in persons
of African ancestry, especially women in middle-age, a critical window of time for exposure to AD risk factors."

Natural products from bacteria, fungi, and plants have long been a rich source of molecules with
fascinating chemical structures and therapeutically-relevant bioactivities. One major challenge in
natural product discovery is rediscovery of known compounds. One way to overcome this
challenge is to mine for natural products from underexplored taxa. As part of the parent award,
we applied machine learning and other bioinformatics techniques to identify the taxa that are most
likely to produce multiple novel and bioactive compounds and few or no known active compounds,
increasing the chances of discovering novel active compounds. In the work supported by this
supplement, a graduate student, Adrian Russ, will perform further bioinformatic analysis of these
prioritized strains, isolate active natural products from the strains, and investigate the strains’
response to commonly used elicitors of secondary metabolism.
This work is related to the first project in the parent award, which involves the development
application of machine learning methods for studying structure-activity relationships of natural
products and applying these machine learning methods to discover natural products with
therapeutically relevant bioactivities. Adrian’s project has three aims 1) to apply bioinformatics to
investigate the conservation and diversity of BGCs in the genera of interest to determine which
genera are most likely to harbor unsequenced biosynthetic diversity 2) to isolate and characterize
bioactive natural products from the prioritized strains and 3) to determine if the strains’ secondary
metabolism is stimulated by elicitors that have been successful in Streptomyces and other well-
studied secondary metabolite producers. Through this project, Adrian will learn multiple
computational, microbiology, molecular biology, and analytical chemistry techniques which will
likely be useful in his planned career. This award will also support Adrian’s career development
by funding his travel to conferences and enabling him to dedicate more time to research."

The proposed work in this MIRA application focuses on my long-term goal to create programmable toolkits for
proteome editing. Inspired by research into developing broad-targeting CRISPR enzymes for programmable

this point, we leverage generative artificial intelligence approaches to design these peptides, including protein
language model (pLM)-based interface predictors and diffusion models for de novo peptide binder generation.
Integrated with these efforts, we experimentally engineer peptide-E3 ubiquitin ligase fusions (termed
ubiquibodies or uAbs) that can degrade diverse pathogenic proteins. Building upon this work, we will combine
our current technologies and expand our research into three new areas to enable broad-scale proteome
editing applications via generative protein language modeling. First, we will build upon our current
experimental efforts to enable peptide-guided deubiquitination, thus enabling both protein degradation with
our uAbs and now protein stabilization of target proteins. To accomplish this goal, we will explore fusion of
generated peptide binders to deubiquitinase domains, as well as to designed recruiter domains of
endogenous deubiquitinases. The results of this research will establish easy-to-design “on” and “off” switches
for controlling protein states in cells. Second, we will develop a new line of investigation, specifically to
enable mutant-specific targeting of protein variants. Here, we will leverage the variant prediction capabilities
of state-of-the-art pLMs, alongside Gaussian Process-based predictors, to prioritize binders that discriminate
between wild-type proteins and highly-similar mutant variants that confer pathogenic properties. These
binders can then be integrated into our degradation and stabilization architectures for experimental validation.
We envision that this new line of investigation will enable selective degradation of mutant, disease-causing
proteins, such as mutant Huntingtin protein or mutant KRAS. Third, we will establish a specific focus on
selectively targeting dysregulated, post-translationally-modified proteins, which have numerous implications in
various diseases, such as aging and cancer. To enable discrimination between wild-type proteins and their
modified counterparts, we will train new PTM-specific protein language models via both masked language
modeling and autoregressive training tasks. By integrating SwissProt annotations with unique per amino
acid-based tokenization strategies, the results of this research will enable the design of degraders that are
selective to modified proteins, such as phosphorylated oncogenic drivers, leaving wild-type isoforms intact.
Together, the work we propose in this MIRA application promises to yield robust, scalable, and most
importantly, programmable tools for protein targeting and editing applications."
10941676,"Translational approaches to unravel organ-specific microvascular endothelial responses in sepsis.
PROGRAM SUMMARY:
 Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an
infection and is associated with high mortality. Systemic inflammation and endothelial activation with resultant
microvascular leak, thromboses, and hypoxic tissue injury are hallmarks of sepsis. Yet, in over 100 trials, drugs
aimed at modulating cascades of inflammation and coagulation have not proven to be efficacious. The primary
reason for this failure is attributed to clinical and biological variability among critically ill patients. More recently,
high-throughput approaches including gene-expression profiling have shown promise in disentangling patient-
level heterogeneity in the host immune response. In contrast, sampling challenges coupled with cell and organ
level heterogeneity have impeded a similar understanding of the host endothelial response. It follows that
translational approaches that shed light on human microvascular pathobiology may lead to the discovery of
targeted therapies that restore tissue homeostasis and shift sepsis care paradigms toward organ recovery.
 My research program seeks to address key knowledge gaps that currently impede scientific progress
through projects spanning 3 domains. 1) DISCOVERY: The endothelium in patients remains inaccessible.
Moreover, while endothelial heterogeneity and organ-specificity are increasingly recognized, their contribution
to the evolution of organ dysfunctions remains poorly understood. To address this, we will enrich circulating
endothelial cells from whole blood of children with septic shock with the primary objective of developing a
transcriptomic atlas at single-cell resolution. By comparing signatures of circulating endothelial subsets from
patients, relative to published datasets of tissue-resident endothelial cells, we will identify organ-specific targets
for future hypotheses testing. 2) DISEASE MODELS: The reductionist nature of current preclinical models has
impeded translation of basic science discoveries into improved sepsis outcomes. Thus, there is a significant
need for advanced disease models that recapitulate human sepsis pathobiology. My laboratory will develop
human induced pluripotent stem cell derived microvascular organoids and stimulate them with biomarker risk-
stratified plasma from patients to model endothelial dysfunction in human sepsis. Our models are expected to
serve as robust testbeds for hypotheses testing. 3) DISEASE MECHANISMS: Finally, we will establish cutting-
edge CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tools in vitro to efficiently study the mechanistic basis of candidate genes
identified through our studies. This transdisciplinary proposal is made feasible by a long-standing study of
pediatric septic shock with unparalleled access to biospecimens, institutional shared resources, and ongoing
collaborations with a rich network of scientists with technical expertise. The approaches established through
this proposal are expected to enhance our understanding of organ-specific microvascular endothelial
responses and hold potential to inform development of precision therapies. Funding through the NIGMS ESI-
MIRA will thus maximize my laboratory’s research efforts to improve the outcomes of children with sepsis."
10940784,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Mast cells (MCs) expand within the airway epithelium and sub-epithelium during prevalent and burdensome
human respiratory disease, including asthma and nasal polyposis, where they are thought to play a central role
in disease pathobiology. MCs take on discrete protease expression profiles in each location, with sup-epithelial
MCs co-expressing tryptase and chymase (MCTC) while epithelial MCs express tryptase alone (MCT). Neither
the mechanisms underlying this expansion, the signals directing the epithelial and sub-epithelial MC
phenotypes, nor the differential contribution of MC phenotypes to tissue inflammation are well understood. This
application focuses on understanding the mechanisms through which airway tissue structural cells differentially
direct the expansion and differentiation of MC progenitors (MCps), based on preliminary studies identifying a
central role for fibroblasts and epithelial cells in both processes. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that
MC hyperplasia in inflamed human airway mucosa is driven by the recruitment of MCps exhibiting a robust
proliferative capacity, and that the proliferation and differentiation of these recruited MCps towards the
histochemically recognized MCT and MCTC subsets are driven by key signals secreted by airway structural
cells. A related hypothesis is that the resulting intraepithelial and subepithelial MC phenotypes are maintained
through a network of transcription factors regulated by these tissue stromal-derived signals, and that signal
nucleotide polymorphisms in these transcription factors increase risk of developing airway disease. Aim 1 of
this proposal evaluates MCp concentration in human sinonasal tissue across disease endotypes, determining
the relationship between recruited MCp and the proliferative population of MCs we previously identified in
nasal polyposis. Aim 2 of this proposal tests the impact of a series of candidate stromal-derived ligands on
directing MCp proliferation and differentiation using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Aim 3 probes the transcription
factor network underlying MC polarization via shRNA knockdown and evaluates the impact of key asthma-
associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in one such transcription factor on intraepithelial MC
differentiation. Completion of these aims will greatly expand our understanding of the pathways through which
MCs are capable of influencing tissue inflammation and the mechanism(s) through which these pathways are
regulated by their tissue microenvironment."
10939846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The severity of traumatic injuries has increased in recent years, resulting in further complications that can impair
patient recovery or even result in death. The rate of injuries that become chronic wounds has also increased in
recent years. In both the acute and chronic injury site, there are key regulators of inflammation needed to protect
the body from pathogens, remove damaged tissue, and recruit new vessels to supply nutrients to tissues
undergoing repair. Failure to balance these beneficial hallmarks of inflammation with a transition to tissue
regeneration has resulted in secondary tissue damage and chronic injury progression. Immune cells, such as
macrophages, remodel the extracellular matrix and release cytokines to govern the injury microenvironment, but
dysregulation of these processes can result in chronic inflammation and non-healing wound formation. Locally
occurring or exogenously delivered chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a potent regulator of inflammatory cytokine
signaling and can help restore balance in dysregulated inflammatory conditions. Moreover, CS can directly
modulate immune cells towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes. However, uncontrolled CS delivery can impede
tissue repair by creating a physical barrier to local cells. Establishing a balance between modulating inflammation
and promoting repair with CS will require investigation of the specific role of CS-presentation on the local immune
response. To that end, the goal of this project is to engineer CS biomaterials that control CS presentation in the
injured tissue and reprogram inflammatory immune states to support resolution of chronic inflammation and
promotion of tissue repair. Over the next 5 years, we will investigate the use of nanoscale and microscale CS
biomaterials to resolve excess inflammatory cytokine activity and reprogram immune phenotypes towards an
anti-inflammatory, pro-regenerative state. These materials will be evaluated through in vitro studies to identify
intrinsic and extrinsic molecular mechanisms by which CS-presentation reprograms immune cells. Translational
mouse mouses will be used to investigate CS-presentation in tissue localized inflammation as an acute strategy
to modulate chronic disease progression as a prophylactic strategy, and as a chronic strategy to treat chronic
inflammation. Two distinct injury models that experience chronic inflammation through immune dysregulation will
be utilized. The first model that will be employed is a rodent model of spinal cord injury, as there is no cure for
paralysis associated with the injury, in part due to the robust inflammation that results in secondary injury and
progresses into a chronic diseased state. The second model used will be a rodent skin injury model, as the acute
injury can be used to test therapeutic outcomes that can subsequently be evaluated in chronic, non-healing skin
wounds. Development of strategies for chronic, non-healing wounds is essential as there is no unifying treatment
strategy, and of the therapies that exist, tissue repair is inconsistent across patients. Use of two disparate injury
models will lead to an improved understanding of the role of CS on the local immune cells responsible for healing
and will enable CS therapies that can re-establish immune balance without impairing tissue repair."
10941654,"Abstract. The maintenance of a differentiated cell type (i.e., cell identity), a feature established by cell type-
specific transcriptional programs, is critical for cell function and tissue homeostasis. Yet, despite acquiring a
specific function, the differentiated cell remains a plastic entity which retains the ability to functionally reprogram
itself in response to incoming signals while simultaneously maintaining its identity. To maintain this plasticity, the
cell relies on transcription factor (TF) networks that access, interpret and implement genomic information. Upon
receiving and processing an incoming signal (whether developmental, environment or damage), the cell
responds by rewiring its TF network. In some instances, the processing of the incoming signal rewires the TF
network and destabilizes cell identity leading to a transitional cell state with reduced function known as
senescence. Originally described as a stable proliferative arrest, senescence has recently emerged as a
transitional cell state heavily linked to the aging process and development of diseases such as osteoarthritis
(OA), cancer and fibrosis. The resolution of this transitional state can lead to outcomes linked with disease
development, including cell death, stabilization of senescence or disease states (Graphical Abstract). With this
understanding, we hypothesize that transitional senescence states represent critical intermediates that could
be manipulated for therapeutic applications. Given the overarching contribution of senescent cells to pathological
processes such as aging, cancer and fibrosis, manipulating senescence states has tremendous potential for
restoring cellular and tissue function across many diseases. The chief focus of our research program is to
define and manipulate the gene regulatory networks that dictate the transition through senescence states. To
achieve this goal, we employ an unbiased approach that involves the generation of TF network models from bulk
and single-cell time-series high-throughput sequencing epigenomic data from primary human cells representing
various tissues undergoing senescence-associated transitions linked to disease development. Using the TF
network model as a logical structure to validate and guide the manipulation of senescence states, we target
critical nodes using reverse genetics, genome editing and pharmacological approaches, and confirm key findings
in human samples using senescent cell isolation methods. Over the next 5 years, the main goals of our research
program are: 1) To generate TF network models of primary human chondrocytes (to model OA) and hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs, to model fibrosis) undergoing replicative and cytokine-induced senescence (RS and CIS),
2) To test the prognostic potential of senescence-linked epigenomic signatures using publicly available human
datasets, and 3) To develop strategies to restore the function of senescent cells by modulation of their TF
network. The overall vision of the research program is to design and implement strategies to reprogram
senescent cells across multiple diseases. If successful, this research program will pave the way toward a new
era of cell therapy in which diseased cells could recover their function through TF network reprogramming."

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in both genders and lacks effective therapeutic options.
We propose to study elovanoids (ELVs), which are stereospecific dihydroxylated derivatives of the free fatty
acids (FFAs) 32:6n-3 or 34:6n-3 that yield ELV-N32 and ELV-N34, respectively, to protect the stroke penumbra
from irreversible damage. The precursors of ELVs are made by the enzyme ELOVL4 (elongation of very long-
chain fatty acids protein-4). Our preliminary data showed improved behavior, decreased infarct size, restored
blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and upregulation of 76 genes in the ischemic core and penumbra by ELV
precursors 32:6n-3 or 34:6n-3 when intranasally delivered (IND) after ischemic stroke in rats. Our central
hypothesis is that the FFAs precursors 32:6n-3 or 34:6n-3 activate ELV synthesis, promoting cell survival in the
penumbra. We postulate that ELV bioactivity is elicited by targeting gene clusters in neurons, astrocytes, and
microglia/macrophage phenotypes. Our goal is to identify specific cell survival events using ELVs instead of
blocking inflammation, as is often the case. In this project, we will use the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) model, MRI to assess brain edema, the ischemic core and penumbra volumes, single-nuclei Multiome
Gene Expression plus ATAC sequencing (snRNA + snATAC), Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) using
Visium and Xenium, and Jess technology to identify the cells and the cell-specific mechanisms that limit core
expansion into the penumbra and assessment of the BBB permeability after administration ELVs. Aim 1: To test
the hypothesis that ELV precursors 34:6n-3 or 32:6n-3 protect the ischemic brain by activating ELV biosynthesis
in the ischemic penumbra. We will explore the concept that the failure of penumbra and ischemic core cells to
survive ischemia-reperfusion damage results from the inability to generate specific ELVs. We will investigate
dose-response, therapeutic window, use of deuterated 32:6n-3 or 34:6n-3 to assess endogenous pool sizes of
the fatty acids, identify pathways using LC-MS/MS, and characterize the ischemic penumbra in young and aged
rats. Aim 2: Define the molecular mechanisms by which IND ELV precursors (32:6n-3 or 34:6n-3) and ELVs
(ELV-N32 or ELV-N34) sustain penumbra integrity and limit core expansion into the penumbra. We will
determine: 1) How ELVs modulate the inflammatory response leading to penumbra protection by specific
proteins using Jess technology. 2) How ELVs mediate cell-specific transcriptional landscape in astrocytes,
microglia/macrophages, and neurons using snRNA + snATAC, SRT using Visium and Xenium to identify gene
expression networks and determine cell phenotypes. 3) Whether blocking BBB leakage with LMs restores the
NVU and BBB integrity by suppressing inflammation, preventing hemorrhagic transformation, and improving
behavioral functions. The results of this project have the potential to develop novel therapeutics to protect the
ischemic stroke penumbra and improve the quality of life of young and older individuals of both genders after
ischemic stroke, which remains among the most significant challenges to public health."
10941648,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of the human transcriptome and play a central role in
tissue development. As the hematopoietic system is composed of a multitude of mature cell types constantly
produced from stem and progenitor cells, it is not surprising that correct miRNA biogenesis, function, and decay
are essential for hematopoietic differentiation. We have recently identified U6 Biogenesis 1 (USB1) as being a
novel 3·_ end miRNA deadenylase that regulates degradation of different miRNAs. As mutations in USB1 cause
the bone marrow failure syndrome poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN), it becomes clear that the correct 3· - end
processing of miRNAs by USB1 is critical for hematopoiesis. Due to a lack of adequate models and intrinsic
difficulties in studying mi RNA processing, the pathways that control miRNA degradation remain largely unknown.
A better understanding of the posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA processing, and how it relates to activation
of different miRNA degradation pathways is essential to decipher the role of these non-coding RNAs during
hematopoiesis.
The focus of this proposal is to use the targeted hematopoietic differentiation of human pluripotent stem
cells to decipher molecular pathways controlling posttranscriptional regulation and degradation routes of
miRNAs. We have generated a large panel of human pluripotent stem cell lines harboring pathogenic mutations
in USB1 and other miRNA 3'-end deadenylases, as well as mutations in different components of the exosome
RNA decay complex. From these, we derive hematopoietic cells in vitro, following established protocols that
recapitulate the in vivo formation of these cell types.
Two specific aims are proposed that utilize this platform to identify novel regulators of miRNA processing
and decay, and to determine their function in the hematopoietic system. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms
regulating target specificity and overlap of different deadenylases necessary for development, during several
stages of hematopoiesis. We will complement these assays by determining which miRNA decay routes are
activated in these cellular populations, focusing on exosome activation and target-directed miRNA degradation
(TDMD). We will determine to which extent TDMD is modulated by incorrect miRNA 3'- end adenylation and
deadenylation in WT and USB1 mutants. Aim 2 will investigate the specific mechanisms leading to impaired
neutrophil development in USB 1 mutant cells, as PN causes severe non-cyclic neutropenia. We have identified
potential targets of USB 1 that modulate neutrophil yield and will test their functional role in different processes,
such as cellular replication and apoptosis, that could lead to a failure of myeloid progenitors to efficiently generate
neutrophils.
These studies will decipher novel effectors of miRNA degradation in the hematopoietic system, a tissue
where miRNA-regulated gene expression plays a central role. Our unique molecular and cellular tools, combined
with our expertise in DNA and RNA biology, as well as in hematopoiesis puts us in an ideal position to make a
significant impact in this field."

Overview: The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a novel digital application (SHIFT) for improving
sexual health outcomes, quality of life (QOL), and psychological outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HCT) survivors.
Background: Sexual dysfunction is the most common and persistent complication post-HCT, with over 50% of
male and 60-80% of female HCT survivors reporting long-term impairment in sexual function post-HCT. Impair-
ment in sexual function is associated with worse QOL, relationship dissatisfaction, and psychological distress,
which further contributes to the morbidity in this population. HCT survivors experience a unique and wide range
of biologic, interpersonal, psychological, and social factors that impact their sexual function. Given the multifac-
torial nature of sexual dysfunction, a multimodal approach is necessary to address patients’ specific issues and
concerns. Despite the increasing use of HCT and the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in HCT survivors, inter-
ventions to improve sexual health outcomes are lacking. Limited availability of clinicians with expertise in ad-
dressing sexual health concerns at most transplant centers hinders the scalability and dissemination of in-person
supportive care interventions to address sexual health concerns. We developed a self-administered novel digital
app (SHIFT) for HCT survivors experiencing sexual health concerns. SHIFT includes five modules focused on
empowering patients to address their sexual health concerns with attention to the biologic, interpersonal, psy-
chological, and social factors contributing to sexual dysfunction. We recently completed a pilot randomized trial
demonstrating the feasibility of SHIFT and its promising efficacy for improving sexual health outcomes (i.e.,
sexual satisfaction, interest, and function), as well as QOL, and psychological distress compared to enhanced
usual care.
Research Plan: We propose to conduct a multi-site randomized trial of SHIFT versus enhanced usual care in
300 HCT survivors to assess the efficacy of SHIFT for improving patient-reported sexual health outcomes. We
will also assess the impact of SHIFT on patients’ QOL and psychological outcomes as well as explore mediators
and moderators of the intervention effect on patient-reported QOL.
Environment: This project will be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital, Fox Chase, and the University
of Miami. These sites have the supportive care research and transplant experience, infrastructure, and pro-
cesses to conduct this trial. The MGH research team has the expertise in developing and testing supportive care
and digital health interventions for patients with serious illness and HCT survivors to ensure the successful im-
plementation of this trial across all study sites.
Relevance of Research: Data from this project will be used to obtain FDA approval for SHIFT as a digital
therapeutic that can be prescribed to address the sexual health needs of HCT survivors."

Pancreatic cancer arises from precancerous lesions that are curable if detected and treated early enough.
Recent multi-region genomic analyses of one type of precancerous pancreatic lesion, intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), suggest unique evolutionary and selective pressures in IPMNs compared to
invasive cancers, underscoring the potential importance of selection in the progression of precancerous
lesions. We propose to characterize the role of selective forces in IPMNs using comprehensive molecular
analyses and computational data integration of both human IPMN tissue samples and organoid cultures. We
will determine the molecular features of progressed subclones in human IPMN samples using multi-region
whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. In addition, we will develop and apply novel multi-omics
computational methods to integrate DNA and RNA-sequencing data to delineate selective forces in human
IPMNs. We will determine the function of progressed clones identified by whole genome DNA sequencing with
gene signatures inferred from bulk transcriptional data in a new semi-supervised framework. We will then
employ a three-dimensional in vitro organoid culture model of human IPMN cells to characterize the relative
contributions of selective pressures over time. We will use combined DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA-
sequencing to identify gene expression signatures of progressed subclones in our organoid model, further
adapting our computational framework to single cell RNA-sequencing data. Taken together, the proposed
studies combine direct analysis of human tissue samples and manipulation of human precancerous cells in
three-dimensional culture with novel multi-omics computational integration to greatly expand our knowledge of
the role of selection in pancreatic cancer precursor lesions."
10912450,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Defining the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that drive cellular transformation has provided
insights into potential therapeutic approaches to cancer. However, the myriad of genetic changes
that accompany specific types of cancer makes it difficult to find therapeutic approaches
applicable to the bulk of patients with a given disease. We have identified an oncogenic role for
the epigenetic enzyme “co-activator associated arginine methyltransferase 1” (CARM1) in AML,
and a dependency of AML cells, but not normal hematopoietic stem cells, on CARM1 activity.
CARM1 methylates a variety of histone and non-histone substrates and targeting its activity, via
small molecule inhibitors, knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) approaches, triggers AML cell
differentiation and death. The proposed studies represent a conceptual shift from targeting
specific mutations found in AML to developing therapies that target chromatin modifiers and
transcriptional regulators that are essential to large numbers of AML patients. To advance this
new paradigm we have proposed the following specific aims:
Aim 1: We will define the molecular basis for the differentiation-promoting effects of CARM1
inhibition on AML cells, identifying the critical CARM1-interacting proteins, substrates and
target genes that regulate myeloid differentiation, proliferation and survival. We will use state-of-
the-art techniques including the BioID2 system, mass-spectrometry, RNA-Seq and
ChIP-Seq. Aim 2: We will determine the mechanisms that control the level of CARM1
activity in AML cells, defining how changes in CARM1 mRNA levels, protein levels, and post-
transcriptional modifications, including phosphorylation, affect CARM1 activity in AML cells. Aim
3: Determine the basis for the unique sensitivity of AML cells to CARM1 inhibition or KD. We will
also define CARM1 inhibitor resistance mechanisms, and test CARM1 inhibitor-containing
combination therapies, using human AML cell lines and primary AML samples and NOD/SCID
mice engrafted with human AML cells. These studies will help establish the importance of CARM1
in the pathogenesis of AML, and advance our understanding of how CARM1 inhibitors can be
used as part of an effective and novel “epigenetic-targeted” strategy for treating cancer."
10912452,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosome missegregation or errors in cytokinesis produce aneuploidy, a chromosome content other than a
multiple of the haploid number. The linkage of aneuploidy to tumorigenesis has long been recognized. A striking
chromosomal abnormality linked to chromosome missegregation is chromothripsis (also known as
chromoanagenesis), an event in which one (or two) chromosomes appear to have been shattered into tens to
hundreds of small genomic fragments and religated back together in random order. Chromotriptic chromosomes
are now recognized to be present in a broad range of cancers.
With support from an NIGMS R35 grant, we have identified mechanisms of normal chromosome segregation
that act to prevent aneuploidy in the normal situation and have determined that single chromosome
missegregation or transient spindle pole amplification is a driver of tumorigenesis. We have identified the
epigenetic mark of centromere identity and determined that DNA replication acts as an error correction
mechanism to maintain that identity. We have identified key molecular mechanisms underlying the mitotic
checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint), the primary guard against chromosome
missegregation in mammals. We have identified how both mitotic checkpoint activation and silencing involve the
catalytic action of a conformation altering AAA+ ATPase TRIP13. We have also determined that mitotic exit has
an absolute requirement for TRIP13-mediated disassembly of the checkpoint inhibitor or the non-essential
APC15 subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets mitotic cyclin destruction. By exploiting a unique feature of
the human Y centromere, we have produced cells in which we can induce selective, transient inactivation of the
Y centromere, with the Y chromosome missegregated into micronuclei at high frequency. With these and whole
genome sequencing, we determined that simple missegregation into a micronucleus can initiate chromothripsis
and drive the complex genome rearrangements frequently found in human cancer.
In the upcoming 5 years, we propose to determine mechanisms of fragmentation of a chromosome during
chromothripsis, identify and validate nucleases that fragment micronuclear chromosomes, determine how
shattered chromosomes are reassembled and produce extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), determine
mechanisms of inheritance of ecDNA, and determine the role of spatial proximity in the inheritance of centromere
identity, including neocentromere formation and other genomic abnormalities. We will also exploit our
development over the last 15 years of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy for nervous system disease to
undertake proof of principle therapy development targeting inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint by testing
suppression of TRIP13/APC15 for the major brain cancer glioblastoma."
10912543,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity – with its many comorbid conditions – has now surpassed smoking as the leading cause of preventable
death in the United States. Despite the fact that obesity is both treatable and preventable, treating the
comorbidities, rather than obesity per se remains the mainstay of therapy. Importantly, obesity is being
increasingly recognized not only as a risk factor for disease, but a disease unto itself. Despite this fact, <1% of
people with any degree of overweight or obesity are offered anything other than lifestyle advice. Reasons for
lack of weight management prioritization are extensive and complex. Effectively, the major stakeholders,
including people with obesity, their clinicians and insurers, have yielded to the epidemic. Thus, there is a
critical need to systematically address these diverse barriers with pragmatic approaches and evidence that
facilitates the practice of weight management. To address this gap, the University of Colorado Health Family
Medicine clinic in Westminster, Colorado developed PATHWEIGH. PATHWEIGH prioritizes weight
management in primary care by: 1) using a designated, time-efficient flowsheet built into EPIC (the most
widely utilized electronic medical record (EMR) system in the U.S.) that guides and captures history around
weight gain and recommendations for weight loss, as well as practical issues related to diagnosis and billing,
and 2) clinician and team training on a) use of PATHWEIGH as a tool, and b) education on current effective
practices for weight management. Our pilot study demonstrated the ability to effectively implement
PATHWEIGH in a primary care clinic that lead to significant improvement in patient weight loss over 18
months. The overall objective for the proposed work is to test the effectiveness of PATHWEIGH vs. standard of
care in 57 primary care clinics that span diverse settings, patient populations and community contexts, as well
as to examine methods to optimize implementation. Our specific aims include: 1) Evaluate the implementation
of PATHWEIGH and determine its effectiveness versus control clinics using standard of care (SOC) on patient
weight loss at 6 months (primary) and weight loss maintenance at 12 and 18 months (secondary) for weight-
prioritized visits in primary care, 2) Identify predictors of patient weight loss and weight loss maintenance
using mediator and moderator analysis, including relevant patient, provider and clinic-level variables, and 3)
Examine contextual factors affecting the adoption, implementation and sustainability of PATHWEIGH using
the Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). To complete these aims, we will
utilize a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. Data collection and analysis methods include clinical data,
surveys, observations and interviews using statistical, qualitative and mixed methods. PATHWEIGH has the
potential to be a scalable, low-cost, pragmatic approach to obesity. The rationale that underlies the proposed
research is that the ultimate success of PATHWEIGH relies on understanding how to implement evidence-
based weight management interventions and make them most effective, used and maintained in practice."
10912549,"The majority of symptoms of Lyme disease are due to the host immune response to the organism, Borrelia
burgdorferi, and resolve over time, even without antibiotic treatment. In its natural host, little or no reaction to
infection can be seen despite the fact that the organism persists for life. In humans and inbred mice (which do
develop immune responses to the organism), inflammation is thought to be initiated by receptors of the innate
immune system. In vitro, loss of innate, pathogen-sensing receptors that recognize B. burgdorferi such as toll-
like receptor 2 (TLR2) results in a decrease inflammatory response. However, in vivo studies of animals
deficient in these receptors or their adaptor molecules do not show reduced inflammation and in many cases
show increased inflammation. Recently, in humans, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the tlr1 gene
that results in loss of expression of the receptor on the cell surface was found to be associated with increased
inflammation and symptoms. This suggests that after the initial stimulus, a major role for these innate immune
molecules is in dampening inflammation. One major difference between in vitro studies and the in vivo
infections is that the in vitro experiments are typically conducted by measuring responses minutes to hours
after exposure to the organism. We have evidence that more prolonged exposures in vitro result in the
development of innate immune “tolerance” to stimulation by B. burgdorferi.
 In this proposal, we will study the role of the tlr1-1805GG SNP in disrupting innate immune tolerance,
thereby leading to excessive inflammatory responses. The 1805GG SNP results in a loss of localization to the
cell surface but does not affect the activity of the receptor. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will first determine the
effects of the SNP on specific, localization-dependent signaling pathways and downstream cytokine
responses. We have previously shown that the TLR1/TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 can initiate signaling from both
intracellular and cell surface locations although the signals are different in each location. It is likely that the tlr1-
1805GG SNP continues to signal endosomally. We will track movements of the receptors and ligands as well
as compare a tlr1 deletion to the tlr1-1805GG SNP. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of the tlr1-1805GG SNP
on macrophage reprogramming leading to loss of innate immune tolerance to B. burgdorferi. We will focus on
understanding its effects on macrophage polarization, cell death and the role of glucose metabolism. Finally, in
Aim 3, using isogenic B. burgdorferi isolates that do or do not initiate tolerance, we will identify the role of
specific components of the organism in moderating macrophage reprograming and loss of tolerance.
 We believe that B. burgdorferi infection, where there is prolonged infection with minimal evidence of
inflammation over time, is an excellent model to understand how the immune system can control responses to
invasive bacteria that pose less threat to health than continued efforts to clear the infection—in essence
making the organism an invasive “commensal” through the development of innate immune tolerance."
10912550,"With a rapidly aging population, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD), are expected
to rise to 25% by 2030, presenting a huge economical and emotional challenge to society. While most PD cases
are sporadic, approximately 10-15% are familial. One of the few genes leading to early-onset PD is the recently
discovered VPS13C (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 Homolog C). Autosomal-recessive mutations in Vps13C result
in protein-truncation and loss of function, with patients demonstrating Lewy body pathology with α-synuclein

endolysosomal pathway in non-neuronal cells, its neuronal function and how loss of this function leads to PD in
patient neurons still remains to be elucidated. Through an unbiased mass-spectrometry based screen, we
recently identified Vps13C as a novel interactor of Ykt6, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment
protein receptor (SNARE) protein critically involved in the endolysosomal pathway and linked to the pathobiology
of α-synuclein. Interestingly, we further found that the Ykt6 and Vps13C interaction was regulated by the
phosphatase activity of Calcineurin, a master regulator of Ca2+ signaling and a key player of toxicity in several
PD models. Importantly, we demonstrated that the Calcineurin-dependent phosphorylation site in Ykt6 is a critical
regulatory step mediating autophagosome to lysosome fusion during autophagy, and Vps13C can further
regulate autophagy. Based on strong preliminary data, the goals of this proposal are to investigate the role for
Vps13C in regulating neuronal autophagy via its interaction with Ykt6 (Aim 1) and its functional dependence on
Ca2+ dynamics mediated by Calcineurin activity (Aim 2) in PD. Our central hypothesis is that loss of Vps13C
misregulates neuronal autophagy and Ca2+ dynamics, contributing to PD pathogenesis in patient neurons. The
proposed studies will test our hypotheses using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human midbrain
dopamine (DA) neurons from patients carrying VPS13C truncation mutations, as well as iPSC-human DA neuron
CRISPR/Cas9-generated VPS13C knockout lines. To address this, we will implement: 1) micropatterned
substrates which we have generated which allow for the culture of individually separated neurons over extended
periods of time, 2) affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis of Vps13C’s interactome
under both basal and stressed conditions, 3) neuronal imaging of Vps13C dynamics and function using state-of-
the-art imaging techniques available at Northwestern University’s Nikon Imaging Center Microscopy Core
including live cell super-resolution microscopy, and 4) advanced organelle-specific Ca2+ and lipid sensor imaging
techniques in PD patient-derived DA neurons to further elucidate Vps13C function. These studies will provide a
mechanistic understanding of Vps13C’s role in autophagy and Ca2+ signaling in patient neurons. Moreover, the
proposed research is significant as it offers novel insights into the endolysosomal role of Vps13C in relation to
PD pathogenic phenotypes with the goal of potentially highlighting new therapeutic angles for PD."
10912681,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC), the predominant subtype of esophageal cancer worldwide is
one of the most known lethal cancers. The prognosis of metastatic ESCC is dismal with a 5-year relative survival
rate of only 5%. Mutations in TP53 (mouse homolog Trp53), which are detected in approximately 70% of ESCC
patients, contribute to tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. To understand the mechanisms of Trp53R172H-
mediated metastasis, which is one of the “hotspot” mutations in ESCC, we utilized mouse models and performed
RNA-Seq on metastatic ESCC cells generated from this model, from which I identified Colony stimulating factor-
1 (Csf-1) to be significantly upregulated. While it is canonically involved in polarization of tumor-associated
macrophages through binding to its receptor CSF-1R, my data demonstrate the existence of autocrine signaling
that is potentially co-regulated by epigenetic reader Bromodomain-Containing Domain 4 (BRD4). The
overarching hypothesis of this study is that CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine signaling is one of the major mechanisms
by which missense TP53 mutations can promote invasion and lung metastasis in ESCC. I will test this hypothesis
through the following interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Elucidate the role of Trp53R172H-mediated CSF-1/CSF-1R
signaling pathway in promoting invasion and lung metastasis in ESCC, (2) Investigate BRD4 as a candidate co-
regulator of Trp53R172H that contributes to CSF-1 upregulation and assess the anti-tumorigenic efficacy of
inhibiting BRD4, and (3) Delineate the tumorigenic, as well as epigenetic/transcriptomic states mediated by
missense p53 mutations recurrent in ESCC patients and impact upon CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling. To accomplish
Aim 1, I will assess the role of CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling in proliferation, migration, primary tumor and 3D organoid
formation, invasion and lung metastasis, as well as its downstream effectors through utilizing in vitro and
complementary in vivo approaches. I will accomplish Aim 2 by studying the direct interaction of p53-R172H and
BRD4, and also their shared DNA binding motifs through CUT&RUN-Seq. Additionally, I will genetically delete
and pharmacologically inhibit BRD4 to evaluate their effects on tumorigenesis and lung metastasis. To
accomplish Aim 3, I will introduce p53 mutations through base editing and evaluate their distinct roles in pro-
oncogenic activities. I will also investigate how these mutations affect the transcriptional expression of factors in
CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling pathway during metastasis, and also conduct single-cell ATAC-Seq on mouse primary
and metastatic tumors to evaluate their chromatin accessibility. This study will elucidate the tumor cell intrinsic
mechanisms underlying ESCC metastasis, which will ultimately open new avenues in developing therapeutic
strategies for metastatic ESCC patients that can be extended to other SCCs. I will develop skills in analytical
thinking, technical approaches, scientific communication, grant and manuscript writing, and mentorship with the
support and resources available through my sponsors, advisory committee and graduate program, which will be
critical to accomplish my long-standing career goal to become a tenure-track faculty to conduct cancer research."
10912688,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in prevalence, yet chemotherapy options remain very limited.
Resistance to systemic therapy and recurrence at local and distant sites following systemic therapy are major
problems in HCC. Innovative combination therapy is an appealing strategy for treating HCC. Cancer stem cells
(CSC) are a small subset of self-renewing, pluripotent, slowly proliferating malignant cells that play key roles in
tumor initiation, metastasis, recurrence, and multidrug resistance in various cancer types, including HCC.
Targeting CSCs may offer a promising avenue for effective anti-HCC therapy. However, targeting CSC alone
would be insufficient because new CSCs could be constantly derived from non-CSC tumor cells through
activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is therefore critical to simultaneously eliminate CSCs
and proliferating non-CSC tumor cells. To date, pharmacologic approaches toward this goal remain largely
unsatisfactory. This proposal seeks to develop a polymeric micelle-based solution to drug resistance in HCC.
The polymeric micellar delivery system is co-formulated with cyclopamine (CPA), a naturally occurring hedgehog
(Hh) signaling inhibitor capable of eliminating CSCs, and paclitaxel (PTX), a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent
that blocks the progression of mitosis and triggers apoptosis. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that
polymeric micelles containing both CPA and PTX, termed M-CPA/PTX, significantly prolonged median survival
of transgenic mice with spontaneous c-Myc-driven HCC in both preventive and therapeutic settings. Moreover,
M-CPA/PTX was significantly more efficacious than PTX alone, CPA alone, or a physical mixture of CPA + PTX.
M-CPA/PTX downregulated c-Myc, suppressed tumor spheroid formation, inhibited EMT, and decreased
components of extracellular matrix in favor of vastly improved tumor disposition of both drugs. Taken together,
our preliminary warrant further pre-IND development of the M-CPA/PTX technology. There are two primary goals
for this project: to de-risk clinical translation of M-CPA/PTX and to obtain a robust IND package. To achieve our
goals, we will pursue 3 specific aims: 1) to scale up synthesis of high-quality M-CPA/PTX and fully characterize
the resulting products; 2) to determine the antitumor efficacy, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicity,
pharmacodynamics (PD), and PK/PD correlation of M-CPA/PTX in preclinical models of HCC; 3) to evaluate the
mechanism by which M-CPA/PTX exerts its anti-HCC activity. Our ultimate goal is to translate M-CPA/PTX into
the clinic as a safe and effective therapy that improves survival of patients with HCC. This project will have
exceptional impact because it will pave the path for clinical translation of a potentially effective systemic therapy
for HCC patients and provide insight into the role of CSCs and tumor stroma in resistance to anti-HCC therapy."
10912481,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite the availability of effective treatments, glaucoma causes more people to become irreversibly blind than
any other disease worldwide, especially among socially and economically disadvantaged groups. 80% of
patients do not adhere to their prescribed glaucoma medications. African Americans and people with lower
socio-economic status are more likely to experience poor medication adherence and adverse vision-related
outcomes. Because improved adherence is associated with decreased vision loss from glaucoma, there is a
critical need to better support the diverse self-management needs of people with glaucoma. Our long-term
goal is to substantially increase glaucoma medication adherence among patients from diverse backgrounds by
more effectively engaging them in glaucoma self-management behaviors. Our scientific premise is based on
prior rigorous National Eye Institute-funded work demonstrating the need for improved self-management
support for patients with glaucoma. Evidence-based communication, education, and outreach strategies, such
as tailored education, motivational-interviewing (MI) based counseling and reminder systems, can improve
adherence and outcomes for diverse patients. Our central hypothesis is that glaucoma patients with poor
adherence who participate in the Support, Educate and Empower (SEE) Program will improve their medication
adherence. In the SEE Program, participants receive 1) Personally tailored education generated by an eHealth
application delivered in-person combined with MI-based counseling from a health educator trained as a
glaucoma coach and 2) reminders tailored to participant preference including audible or visual alerts and/or
text or phone calls when a dose is missed. Our overall objective is to test whether the SEE Program,
compared to standard care, improves medication adherence through a randomized clinical trial among 230
glaucoma patients with poor medication adherence at enrollment. An essential component of the SEE Program
is its inclusion of non-physician health care providers—health educators— to provide the education,
counseling, and support that glaucoma patients with poor adherence require. Impact: Upon completion of the
trial, we will have rigorously evaluated an intervention that is highly scalable and sustainable due to its
application of eHealth technologies and use of non-physician providers. The evidence from this study will
inform effective behavior-change strategies and approaches to address racial and socioeconomic disparities in
glaucoma outcomes. Ultimately, our findings will inform and shape clinical practice guidelines by promoting
evidence-based models that improve medication adherence and visual outcomes."
10936804,"Behavioral Research on Acculturation and moderating and mediating Variables Observed Specifically among
Latinos: BRAVOS
Abstract/Project Summary:
Low-income Latino children are disproportionately affected by obesity. It is estimated that 15.6% of Latino
children age 2-5 years old are obese. By preschool, Latino children (2-5 years old) are 3 times more likely to
be obese compared to non-Latino white children. Preventing obesity in childhood can reduce risk for adult
comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cancer. A possible influence on
obesity risk among Latinos is acculturation, the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place
as a result of contact between two or more cultural groups and their individual members. There is a need to
understand the impact of acculturation on obesity as well as the likely mediators and moderators of this
association such as dietary behavior. One important dietary determinant of obesity is the daily fruit and
vegetable intake (FVI). A majority of the existing evidence among Latino preschool-aged children (PSAC) is
cross-sectional. Evidence suggests that increasing acculturation to the US reduces FVI. New technology that
uses reflection spectroscopy on skin to measure carotenoids non-invasively, is a promising tool to easily and
reliably detect carotenoid biomarkers that is quicker than 24-hour recalls. The longitudinal mechanisms through
which parent acculturation affects the FVI, and Body Mass Index (BMI) of their PSAC is understudied. We will
employ a longitudinal study design guided by Social Cognitive Theory, utilizing Community-Based Participatory
Research principles, and leveraging an existing partnership between UNLV and Research, Education, Access
to Community Health (REACH). Nevada is the ideal setting for this study as nearly half of Latino
kindergarteners (48.3%) are overweight or obese. We will recruit a cohort of 251 Latino parents and their
PSAC and follow them longitudinally for three years. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine the longitudinal
association of parental acculturation with child outcomes: fruit and vegetable intake, and BMI z-score, 2) Test
the feasibility and acceptability of skin carotenoid biomarker measurement among young Latino children, 3)
Evaluate carotenoid biomarkers and their association with FVI via 24-hour recalls among Latino parents as
proxy reporters for their children. This R16 award will accelerate Dr. Johansen's program of research on
parental determinants of their PSACs obesity risk, develop his expertise in conducting longitudinal studies and
support his training of diverse UNLV undergraduates in health disparities research. Results from this project
will be used to develop a culturally relevant pilot intervention involving Latinx PSAC, which will inform the
development of an expanding program of research eligible for R01-level support."
10935241,"Increasing diversity in biomedical research enhances the talent pool, broadens the scope of scientific questions addressed, and increases the impact of science in society. People of color, women, individuals with disabilities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals remain underrepresented in the research workforce. Community colleges are critical to efforts to enhance the size and diversity of the biomedical workforce. Intentionally designed, structured training programs are essential to ensure students successfully transfer to a bachelor-degree granting institution and persist in biomedical sciences through undergraduate degree completion and beyond. This proposal aims to establish a Bridges to Baccalaureate Program (BtB) in partnership between California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) and Allan Hancock Community College. The mission of BtB at Cal Poly is to recruit, mentor, and train ten students per year to complete baccalaureate degrees in the biomedical sciences. The multi-faceted program consists of one-year of research skills training and academic and transfer support at Allan Hancock College, followed by a robust curriculum post-transfer at Cal Poly. The one-year Cal Poly curriculum includes mentored research, two seminar courses that enhance conceptual and technical research skills and responsible conduct of research. Both years of the program, students will have formal mentoring teams, develop individual develop plans, experience culturally informed strength coaching and enrichment events that draw on decades of research on effective programs to build science skills, values, self-efficacy and science identity. The specific and measurable objectives of BtB at Cal Poly are to improve transfer and graduation rates for BtB trainees. We also expect trainees will experience improvements over two years in the following: Conceptual, technical, operational, and professional skills in biomedical research; science identity; science and research self-efficacy; and sense of belonging in biomedical research. We will also assess institutional efforts in essential transfer practices at both institutions. BtB at Cal Poly addresses the urgent need to diversify the biomedical workforce by promoting a culture of collaboration between institutions and among students and mentors. Students will access state-of-the-science opportunities, engage with motivated mentors, and receive an inclusive training program that captures the ongoing process of understanding and deconstructing structural inequalities in the biomedical field."

Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy holds great promise in treating various diseases, including cancer
and neurodegenerative disorders like Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). A critical challenge in advancing ACT
therapies is the non-invasive tracking of therapeutic cells to assess their effectiveness and safety. The parent
R01 (R01EB031224) focuses on leveraging Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) for tracking ACT T cells in cancer
therapies. This Administrative Supplement aims to extend this work to track Molecular Guided T Cell Therapy
(MCT) in preclinical models of LBD, a neurodegenerative condition with no current disease-modifying
interventions.
Two primary aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Evaluate the Dynamics of MCT Trafficking in a Preclinical Model of LBD: This aim focuses on using
MPI tracers developed under the parent R01 to label MCT cells, facilitating non-invasive tracking of these cells
in the brain. The goal is to understand how MCT cells distribute and persist in target regions, thereby providing
insights into their therapeutic potential.
Aim 2. Correlate MPI Signal to α-Synuclein Pathology Burden: This aim seeks to establish a relationship
between the MPI signals generated by labeled MCT cells and the subsequent burden of pathological α-synuclein
in the brain, a hallmark of LBD. This correlation could offer a predictive measure of therapeutic effectiveness and
survival outcomes in treated animals.
The proposed work aligns with the goals of the Administrative Supplement to Help Develop Alzheimer's Focused
NIH Grants (NOT-AG-23-032) by contributing to the development of non-invasive techniques to advance our
understanding of T cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Achieving the proposed aims will
establish MPI as a robust tool for non-invasively tracking therapeutic cells in the central nervous system, thereby
facilitating the development and optimization of ACT therapies in the context of LBD and potentially other α-
synucleinopathies."
10910911,"Project Summary/Abstract
Shigella species are highly infectious and important pathogens of humans. In 2016, there were an
estimated 269 million cases and 212,000 deaths due to Shigella. Humans are typically infected with
Shigella after oral ingestion of a minimal inoculum, consisting of as few as 10-100 bacteria. A major
roadblock in Shigella research is the lack of an in vivo oral infection mouse model that recapitulates key
aspects of human disease. Mice resist oral doses of Shigella as high as 100 million bacteria, but the reason
for this resistance remains poorly understood. In our preliminary data, we describe our discovery that the
reason mice are resistant to Shigella is because of a robust and mouse-specific innate immune
inflammasome response in intestinal epithelial cells. Mice lacking inflammasomes are thus susceptible to
oral Shigella infection and provide the first opportunity to use the full repertoire of mouse genetic and
immunological tools and methodologies to dissect Shigella pathogenesis in a physiological infection model.
Importantly, our data suggest that inflammasome-deficient mice are a highly relevant model because, in
humans, we find Shigella inhibits or evades the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome. We propose three Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize innate immune and bacterial factors responsible for shigellosis in vivo.
In Aim 2, we will characterize the adaptive immune responses of mice to wild-type and mutant Shigella. In,
Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Shigella encodes effectors to inactivate the human NAIP/NLRC4
inflammasome. By exploiting the experimental tractability of our new model, we hope to identify the key
factors mediating immunity and disease during Shigella infection, thereby providing a foundation of
knowledge to inform the development of safer and more effective vaccines."

The overall objective of this proposal, “Multimodal Artificial Intelligence to Predict Glaucomatous Progression
and Surgical Intervention”, is to use multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning strategies to predict
which glaucoma patients will need glaucoma surgery and which are likely to have progressive visual field loss
in the future. This study is designed to leverage longstanding well characterized clinical and research cohorts
of glaucoma patients and its validated decision support AI infrastructure to predict which glaucoma patients will
progress and which will need surgery. The proposal includes the following two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use
baseline electronic health records (EHR), optic nerve head (ONH) optical coherence tomography (OCT)
imaging, visual field (VF) data, intraocular pressure (IOP) and central corneal thickness (CCT) in a multimodal
DL model to predict the likelihood of surgical intervention for glaucoma. Aim 2 will use baseline EHR, ONH
OCT imaging, VF data, IOP and CCT in a multimodal DL model to predict the likelihood of fast glaucomatous
visual field progression. To address these aims, existing data from glaucoma patients 1) enrolled in the
National Eye Institute funded Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS 1995-present) and African
Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (ADAGES 2009-2021), and 2) managed at the UCSD Viterbi Family
Department of Ophthalmology will be used in the AI model development and testing. We will also leverage
UCSD's existing cloud-based AI pipeline to build a glaucoma-specific platform to train, test and in the future,
update the deep learning models developed. In the future, this infrastructure can be used to support
randomized clinical trial testing of AI guided glaucoma management and enable real-time decision support for
clinicians."
10910626,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT FOR FUNDED GRANT (MOSAIC K99/R00)
The androgen receptor (AR) is the master transcription factor responsible for development and maintenance of
the male sex phenotype. Aberrant AR activity is associated with multiple disorders, including but not limited to
metastatic prostate cancer, androgenetic alopecia, and Kennedy’s disease. Cell-based studies have reported
AR is regulated through numerous processes, including 1) androgen stimulation; 2) anti-androgen inhibition; 3)
intramolecular contacts among its domains; 4) association with various protein coactivators and corepressors.
Despite its importance in disease etiology, the mechanistic details underlying AR regulation are largely
unknown due to historical difficulty isolating pure, active multidomain AR variants.
This research will employ biochemical and complementary structural methods – including electron and atomic
force microscopy, and x-ray crystallography – to illuminate the molecular determinants of AR activation through
identification of surfaces important for intramolecular and cofactor-mediated stimulation (Aim 1), and for AR
inhibition by anti-androgen binding and self-regulatory modes of autoinhibition (Aim 3). The molecular details
revealed by the biochemical and structural studies will be validated in biologically relevant AR-dependent cell
lines to determine the functional outcomes of these interactions on cell morphology, growth, AR signaling and
the AR cistrome (Aim 2). The findings from these studies will provide novel insight for modes of dimerization,
intramolecular regulation, and DNA binding for AR as well as other type I nuclear hormone receptors, including
the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors, and can facilitate potential design of novel
AR-targeting drugs. This research is in line with the goals of the NIGMS of generating fundamental knowledge
that will bear implication for human disease and health.
The comprehensive training plan described will enable the investigator to achieve her career goals of running
an independent academic laboratory dedicated to studying fundamental modes of AR transcriptional regulation
in the context of its active, hyperactivated, and inhibited states, and will provide biochemical, structural, and
functional insight to the consequences of its aberrant activity in disease. As a joint mentee in top prostate
cancer and structural biology laboratories at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Rockefeller
University, she will receive diverse training in prostate biology and electron microscopy that will expand the
investigator’s biological understanding and technical repertoire that will enable significant innovation in her
future research. The leadership, networking, and communication skills she will acquire through the MOSAIC
UE5 will facilitate her transition to independence, and equip her to enhance diversity in the scientific workforce."

The critical challenge in the clinical management of newly-diagnosed localized prostate cancer remains
distinguishing indolent from aggressive and life-threatening cancers. Biomarkers are urgently needed to
identify those patients who harbor aggressive disease and will derive benefit from definitive treatment. We
therefore, propose to apply complimentary proteogenomic-based discovery approaches to identify and then
validate molecular features in prostate proximal fluids and tumor tissues that will be utilized in accurate early
detection of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and improve disease risk stratification. The intended use of
these biomarkers will be the early identification of men at risk for grade progression and improved risk-
stratification for them.
We have three biomarker development laboratory aims: 1) Validate our existing urine-based biomarkers for
grade progression in a ProBE-compliant study selected from our own cohorts and the EDRN GU upgrading
study. 2) Develop and validate urine and tissue-based biomarkers for the risk-stratification of MRI “invisible”
high-grade lesions. 3) Develop and validate biomarkers to sub-stratify risk associated with deleterious
germline BRCA2 variants.
Our biomarker reference laboratory will develop and validate targeted clinically robust assays for multi-protein
biomarkers panels. We will also develop decision algorithms that are cross-referenced for statistical rigor and
benchmarked for optimal clinical performance. In addition to these BCC activities, we will develop robust
PRM-MS assays and statistically rigorous decision tools for other EDRN BCCs and CVCs.
Taken together, our EDRN biomarker characterization center will be a core part of the the EDRN ecosystem.
We will continue to actively participate in trans-Network activities, and to share patient cohorts, protocols,
datasets and analysis approaches and expertise. We will supplement these activities by focusing on
promoting the growth of new and diverse talent in biomarker development through fostering junior investigator
involvement across the full spectrum of biomarker development."

This grant supports a project to generate and characterize Xenopus mutants in key genes related to human
disease, develop new transgenic lines for genome editing and establish efficient site-specific integration. The
long-term goals of the studies are to generate new models of human disease that will provide useful resources
for the biomedical research community. The proposed studies will use CRISPR-Cas gene editing to create
precise models of human disease in the amphibian Xenopus. The current studies are focused on developing
Xenopus models of many different diseases for the entire Xenopus community, and each mutant will be
developed in close coordination with individual researchers. There are four main aims to this proposal. First,
we propose to collaborate with Xenopus researchers to characterize existing mutants (over 200) that were
developed over the last 5 years. The mutants cover a wide range of topics that require varied expertise that
can only be obtained through interactions with other researchers. Second, we propose to generate new
mutants using CRISPR-Cas as requested by researchers. As the national stock center for Xenopus, we have
the expertise to breed and maintain these mutants. Third, we will generate new transgenic lines that will be
used for genome editing. These new lines will allow for more tissue-specific expression of Cas9. Fourth, we
propose to develop homology directed repair for more efficient generation of site-specific integration of
exogenous DNA. All these aims will help enhance the utilization of CRISPR-Cas gene editing methods in the
Xenopus model system."

career mentorship to young otolaryngologists interested in clinician-scientist careers with mentorship from
established, NIH-funded otolaryngologist-scientists. The goals of the program are to support the
development of otolaryngologists to become successful NIH-funded investigators, to strengthen the
research training pipeline, and to support diversity among otolaryngologist-scientists. The current proposal
details the activities of the Mentorship Network that will help mentees reach their goals. These activities
include three in-person and eight virtual meetings annually, one-on-one mentoring opportunities,
maintenance of a listserv, and mock grant reviews. In addition, the Network offers online, “just-in-time”
educational materials for clinical research. The Neely National Clinician-Scientist Mentorship Network
targets two pools of otolaryngology mentees. Mentees in the first pool have some research training
experience but have yet to submit their first PI NIH grants. These mentees may be otolaryngology
residents, fellows, or new faculty members. The second pool of mentees are those who have NIH funding
in the form of an introductory grant (typically a K08 or K23 grant) and are looking to convert that grant to an
R01 or similar independent award. Mentorship in the network is provided by a large cadre of successfully
funded otolaryngologist-scientists many of whom are members of the Triological Society. The Network
includes mentors whose research spans the breadth of NIDCD mission areas, including research in
hearing, balance, speech, olfaction, and health disparities, as well as other research areas related to
otolaryngology, such as cancer and immunology. The research techniques and foci employed by the
mentors are diverse and include basic discovery in animals, clinical research, health services, disparities,
and population-based research. The mentors come from varied backgrounds and institutions across the
country, and a significant strength of the proposal is the depth and breadth of the mentorship group. The
Network is led by two experienced clinician-scientists with help from an experienced executive committee.
Mentees from diverse backgrounds will be recruited through a website developed for the Network, through
direct outreach to otolaryngology departments, and through personal outreach by members of the Network.
Continuous evaluation of the program by mentors and mentees will be used to improve the program.
Outcome measures include the number of mentees participating, the retention of mentees throughout the
program, and the success of mentees in securing NIH grants. This network is unique in otolaryngology and
innovative in that there is no other national mentorship network for otolaryngologist-scientists."
10986969,"PGC-1 family proteins (PGC-1á, PGC-1â, and PPRC1) are transcriptional co-activators that act as central 
hubs to coordinate diverse cellular inputs to promote the transcription of genes that regulate metabolism to 
maintain homeostasis. Transcriptional coactivator Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma 
Coactivator 1 â (PGC-1â) is over-expressed in colorectal cancers (CRC) with K-Ras mutations and 
promotes the survival of tumor cells. PGC-1 family proteins lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and function by 
facilitating interactions between transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and transcription initiation 
machinery. To identify the protein-protein interactions required by PGC-1â to coordinate gene expression 
we immunoprecipitated PGC-1â and identified binding partners by mass spectrometry. Our data reveal that 
Host Cell Factor 2 (HCF2) is a PGC-1â binding protein that we propose is required to bring PGC-1â to the 
proximal promoter and imprint epigenetic marks that promote transcription. Our long-term goal is to inhibit 
CRC growth by blocking the interaction of PGC-1â with HCF2 or by blocking the interaction of HCF2 with 
histone lysine methyltransferase SEDT1A, which is required to enhance PGC-1â-dependent gene 
expression. In Aim 1, we will define the motifs required for HCF2 to bind PGC-1â and SETD1A and assess 
the loss of function of HCF2 binding mutants in PGC-1â-dependent gene expression and genomic

10936968,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, opioid use and dependence has increased to epidemic levels. A prominent contributor to this trend is
oxycodone, (Oxy), a semisynthetic opioid analgesic and most widely-prescribed opioid painkiller. A major hurdle
in addiction treatment, including for opioid addicts, is a long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Evidence indicates
that the drugs of abuse produce long-lasting maladaptive plasticity in nucleus accumbens (NAc) synaptic function
that underlie compulsive drug seeking. Such plasticity accounts for the fact that cue-induced craving
progressively intensifies (‘incubates’) over weeks/months of forced abstinence or withdrawal in both humans and
animals, for many drug classes. During withdrawal from extended-access Oxy self-administration, rats exhibit a
progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced Oxy craving that is accompanied by adaptations in in
AMPA receptor subunit composition in the NAc, similar to other drugs. A key challenge is how to reverse this
plasticity in a translationally-relevant manner. Growing evidence suggests that subanesthetic doses of the
glutamate-NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (Ket) may be a potential long-lasting treatment option for
substance use disorders. Our preliminary data show systemic subanesthetic Ket, given daily during withdrawal
from Oxy self-administration in rats, reduces incubation in a seeking test one day after the last Ket injection.
There are 3 objectives of this proposal: (1) characterize the time course of Ket’s ability to reduce Oxy incubation,
(2) determine an effective dosing regimen and timepoint for therapeutic intervention, and (3) test potential
mechanisms for Ket’s effect. The central hypothesis is that altered activity and/or altered protein translation in
the reward circuitry is responsible for Oxy incubation and that Ket may be exerting its effects by normalizing
pathological changes. Aim 1 will determine the duration of incubation reduction by repeated Ket and test
a role for projection-specific changes in glutamate afferents to the NAc. cFos (an indirect marker of neural
activity) immunohistochemistry will be combined with retro-AAV viral tracing to examine input-specific activity in
key regions of the reward circuitry that project to the NAc: orbitofrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral
subiculum of the hippocampus. Activity will be assessed at 4 points after discontinuing Oxy self-administration:
withdrawal day 1 (WD1), before adaptations have occurred, WD15, when craving has “incubated”, or at WD30
or WD45, to assess the persistence of incubation. The effects of daily subanesthetic Ket will also be examined
to determine the duration of its effects. Aim 2 will characterize protein synthesis during Oxy incubation.
Puromycin labeling will be used to measure protein translation of the key AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and
GluA2 in NAc tissue on WD1 and WD15. Daily Ket’s impact on AMPAR translation will also be examined. Aim
3 will examine if a single dose of Ket can prevent or reverse Oxy incubation. One Ket injection will be
given either on WD1 or WD14, and craving will be measured on WD15. These studies characterize how
excitatory transmission in the NAc contributes to Oxy incubation, and test Ket’s viability in relapse-prevention."

Relapse prevention post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) remains a paramount
challenge. This project aims to test a novel graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen that could
also prevent malignant relapse. Our novel regimen accomplishes this goal by eliminating mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF) from a post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and sirolimus (SIR)-based regimen, and
instead adding a novel, oral Aurora kinase A inhibitor that not only constrains GVHD through CD28 signal
transduction blockade but also provide direct anti-tumor effects. Elimination of both MMF and tacrolimus (TAC)
from our proposed regimen enhances graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, further contributing to relapse
mitigation. We propose to compare our GVHD prophylaxis regimen of PTCy/SIR/VIC-1911 to the widely used
PTCy/SIR/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) regimen in a randomized, phase II clinical trial in adults with
hematologic malignancies undergoing myeloablative alloHCT. We hypothesize that substitution of VIC-1911 for
MMF will result in a significantly better 1-year graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS),
setting a new standard in the field. Preclinical and phase I human data from the University of Minnesota show
significant promise in the combined PTCy/SIR/VIC regimen, with low rates of acute/chronic GVHD and relapse,
while not adding significant patient burden or side effects to the GVHD prophylaxis regimen. Partnering with
the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) will provide a robust platform for trial
implementation, capitalizing on their expertise, multicenter collaborative infrastructure, and access to a large
and diverse patient population, ensuring rigorous evaluation of our innovative regimen and its transformative
potential in the field of alloHCT. The University of Minnesota unequivocally affirms its commitment to the BMT
CTN, bringing its expertise and institutional resources to further enhance its mission and objectives through
clinical trials such as the one we propose herein."

The goal of the STrengthening Research OpportuNities for Growth at Meharry Medical College (Meharry-
STRONG) Program is to assess research capacity and develop an institution-wide action plan to meet our
specific needs identified. We hypothesize that first developing an infrastructure that supports engaged
evaluation of our research capacity will allow us to perform high quality needs assessment and develop an
action plan that truly permits capability enhancement. In Aim 1, we will engage stakeholders before developing
and administering the needs assessment, which includes both qualitative and quantitative tools. In Aim 2, we
will analyze results and interpret data based on topic areas: administrative, research, and faculty and student
development. In Aim 3, we will formulate an institutional action plan that incorporates interventions to build
capacity at Meharry. The plan will provide a detailed roadmap for enhancing our research infrastructure and
capacity using step by step additions to gradually and progressively build on past successes to generate

10932494,"This proposal for the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) will use the mouse model to investigate how differences between male and female external genitalia arise at the single cell level. Congenital malformations of the external genitalia (CAEG) are among the most prevalent human birth defects, affecting ~1:150 live male births. Hypospadias is a CAEG that is characterized by ectopic opening(s) of the urethra on the ventral side of the penis. In severe hypospadias, the urethral plate can open along the entire underside of the penis, giving it a clitoris-like appearance. This condition is termed ambiguous genitalia. Genetic causes of hypospadias have been elusive. The global prevalence has led to increased scrutiny of environmental factors, particularly endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can induce genital anomalies in animal models. Sexual differentiation of the embryonic genital tubercle (GT) into a penis or a clitoris is regulated by gonadal androgens and estrogen. The central role of sex hormones in GT development creates sensitivity to EDCs; however, the mechanisms that mediate EDC effects on the GT are unknown, particularly at a cellular level. Do EDCs that cause hypospadias act on all cells in the GT, or do they target specific cell types? If subpopulation(s) of hormonally-responsive cells control urethragenesis, then buffering those cells against EDCs could be a method for prevention of hypospadias (analogous to folic acid’s ability to prevent neural tube defects). For genetic hypospadias, identifying cell-specific gene functions can distinguish direct regulators of urethragenesis from genes with indirect effects (e.g. sensitivity to EDCs). Understanding cell type diversity in developing external genitalia is essential for identifying the causes of CAEG and for developing preventative strategies. A major obstacle to progress in prevention and treatment of CAEG is the lack of knowledge of the specific cell types in external genital tissues. This project aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps by using single cell RNA-sequencing combined with novel imaging modalities to map cell type diversity in the developing external genitalia of normal male and female mice."

Compromised intestinal barrier function and alterations in intestinal microbes are critical factors contributing to
many autoinflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), celiac disease and Type 1
diabetes, and affect ~24 million Americans (www.niehs.nih.gov). Genetic contributions to these diseases
include the increased association with loss-of-function single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein
tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) gene. Moreover, PTPN2 was identified as a major
influence on microbiome composition across multiple patient cohorts.In mice constitutively lacking Ptpn2, we
identified substantial changes in gut microbiota populations highlighted by increased abundance of a novel
mouse adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). This mouse AIEC was able to colonize mouse intestine, exacerbate
colitis onset, and delay recovery from colitis. Moreover, we now report that PTPN2 loss compromises Paneth
cells which have critical roles in preserving intestinal mucosal-microbial homeostasis. We also identify that
epithelial PTPN2 deletion reduces Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide expression, and increases susceptibility to
pathogen infection. Thus, we hypothesize that PTPN2 serves as a “microbial modulator” by regulating innate
defense mechanisms of epithelial cells to protect the intestine against bacterial ‘dysbiosis’, including expansion
of, and colonization with, the disease-relevant pathobiont, AIEC. The goals of this proposal are to determine
how loss of PTPN2 activity disrupts i) Paneth cell antimicrobial properties; and ii) how does PTPN2 regulate
other (non-Paneth cell) features of epithelial antimicrobial defense and intracellular bacterial handling.
Expected Outcomes & Impact: This proposal will increase our broader understanding of the molecular basis by
which host factors preserve the intestinal barrier and microbial homeostasis, and lead to development of new
approaches and targets to restore host-microbe relationships in diseases such as IBD."

Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney dysfunction and failure for
more than 400 million patients worldwide. While the high prevalence of obesity is closely
linked to the increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure, the
complex interplay between these conditions is incompletely understood.
Our recent work revealed an important role for a specialized group of cells in the kidney
called TREM2 resident macrophages. These cells appear to increase in numbers in both
mouse and human kidneys in the setting of obesity and diabetes. Therefore, the molecule
TREM2 that is found on the surface of these immune cells may be a therapeutic target for
kidney disease.
The goal of this proposal is to build on our recent discoveries and perform detailed studies
in mouse models and human kidney tissue to gain further insight into whether TREM2
macrophages can protect the kidney from the harmful effects of obesity-driven type
2 diabetes. This work will pave the way for new therapies for diabetic kidney disease
patients, which are greatly needed."
10905170,"SUMMARY
Cells use a broad arsenal of proteins to change the curvature of cell membranes. This is important for cell motility,
endocytosis, and establishment of cell morphology. As such, it comes as no surprise that components of this
machinery are central in the etiology of many diseases, including developmental and immunodeficiency
disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer. One protein family that appears repeatedly at the
intersection of membrane biology and disease is the Bin1/Amphiphysin/Rvs family of proteins (BAR proteins).
Homologues of this family are found from yeast to humans and are essential for the induction of morphological
changes of cells and for the coupling of membrane curvature to actin polymerization. While BAR proteins are
proposed to function in these processes, little is known about the structure/function of these proteins in an in
vivo context. This gap of knowledge hinders leveraging BAR proteins and their targets for the treatment of cancer
and other diseases. A comprehensive model of full-length BAR proteins is needed to perform structure/function
analysis in vivo, so physiologically relevant structures can be identified. The goal of this exploratory proposal is
twofold: to establish an in vivo model of BAR protein structure/function using the pioneering organism C. elegans
(Aim 1), and to use cryoEM/cryoET to identify salient structural motifs in a full-length human BAR protein bound
to the membrane in the presence and absence of one of its main targets, the small Rho GTPase CDC42 (Aim
2). The accomplishment of these two aims will provide information on essential structural interfaces and amino
acid residues that can be then tested in vivo. Data obtained here will set the groundwork for a comprehensive in
vivo determination of BAR protein structure/function that we will pursue in the future. Ultimately, this work will
advance our understanding of how cells change morphology in health and disease."
10905782,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disruptions in mechanosensation are commonly responsible for symptoms in diseases of gut-brain interaction
(DGBI), like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affect ~15% of the US population. Therefore, my laboratory’s
long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of gastrointestinal (GI) mechanosensitivity
in health and in DGBIs.
There are several mechanosensory pathways in the GI tract. One such important mechanosensory pathway that
is involved in DGBIs is initiated through the specialized sensory epithelial enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Upon
stimulation, EECs release diverse signaling molecules that have a range of physiologic effects, and disruption
in this signaling is involved in DGBIs. We discovered an EECs sub-population which is mechanosensitive. These
EECs express Piezo2, a mechano-gated ion channel that connects forces to release of EEC signaling molecules
and endows the intestine with an ability to sense small luminal forces to adjust GI motility and secretion.
The objective of this proposal, based on strong rationale and extensive preliminary data, is to test the hypothesis
that rectal Piezo2+ mechanosensitive EECs co-express select GPCRs sensitive to digestive metabolites, which
modulate Piezo2 mechanosensitivity. These rectal mechanosensitive EECs connect chemo- and mechano-
signaling in rectal EECs, and thereby regulate regional and proximal intestinal motility. We have established
novel transgenic mouse models that allow us to lineage track, stimulate, and interrogate specific EEC sub-
populations, and we will use these mouse models and validated EEC lines with a range of innovative and
established gold-standard approaches from single cells to in vivo to study mechanosensitive EECs and their
roles in GI physiology. Aim 1 will determine the cellular mechanisms of chemo- and mechano-signaling in EECs.
Aim 2 will determine how the mechanosensitive EECs stimulated by forces and luminal digestive metabolite to
modulate GI motility.
The proposed experiments are foundationally linked to our previous work, but they represent a new and exciting
direction and can be completed in the defined award period. The results from this study are important because
they will allow us to deeply understand mechanosensitive EEC cellular physiology and their roles in GI motility,
which will enable us to examine alterations in disease, and then potentially target these pharmacologically as
novel and specific therapies for DGBIs."

Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse class of neurons of indisputably high biomedical importance.
Interneuron dysfunctions are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia and are also
implicated in epilepsy and neurodegeneration. Cortical interneurons are born in the ganglionic eminences. As
they develop, they migrate to intercalate into diverse cortical circuits throughout the brain, where they become
increasingly specialized and modulate many aspects of neural circuit function. Recent transcriptomic and lineage
tracing studies have begun to identify new levels of transcriptional diversity among interneuron subtypes and
between species. Similarly, genomic studies are increasingly identifying genetic risks for disease that are
predicted to impact interneuron function. What is needed to integrate these findings are 1) means to define the
genetic programs that endow interneurons with their successive levels of functional specialization and 2) to be
able to produce these features in vitro for use in disease modeling and genetic loss and gain-of-function studies.
The overall goal of this study is to leverage a new combinatorial transcription factor (TF) screening method for
direct neuronal reprogramming to define transcriptional programs that produce both generic and more
specialized interneuron subtype identities. We will then test the resulting induced interneurons using deep
quantitative methods for cell type phenotyping at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional level. We will
apply new AI-enabled in vitro methods to assess cell morphology, motility, and synaptic specificity in vitro, paired
with in vivo assays for migration and specific synapse formation. These collaborative interdisciplinary studies will
accomplish three goals relevant to brain development and repair. First, they will enable the production of defined
interneuron subpopulations in vitro, which will accelerate genetic studies using loss and gain-of-function. Second,
we posit that by performing a high throughput screen for transcription factor “codes” that can induce different
aspects of interneuron diversity, we will uncover new transcriptional modules that govern key functional aspects
of interneuron identity. Third, by developing the first reliable assays to assess the capacity of “synthetic” induced
neuron to achieve synaptic specificity in vitro and in the brain, we will advance reprogramming technology and
open the door to modeling disease that impact some synapses but not others, as is the case for most common
diseases including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease."

Meiosis is the specialized cell division that gives rise to haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. During
prophase I, homologous chromosomes are physically tethered via the formation of the synaptonemal complex
while undergoing DNA double strand break (DSB)-induced recombination. In XY mammals, there is an additional
challenge presented by the sex chromosomes, which synapse only at the Pseudoautosomal Region (PAR),
leaving vast asynapsed regions that trigger a unique chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing mechanism
termed Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI). MSCI occurs within the context of the Sex Body (SB), a
membrane-less sub-domain of the nucleus that houses the XY. MSCI is a specialized version of the broader
process of Meiotic Silencing of Unsynapsed Chromatin (MSUC) that occurs in male and female meiosis when
homologs fail to synapse, triggering apoptosis of aberrant germ cells. All of these events are critical to ensure
the formation of viable euploid gametes, underscored by the fact that humans show exceptionally high rates of
meiotic errors leading to miscarriages and birth defects, with non-disjunction of the sex chromosomes, Klinefelter
syndrome, being the most frequent trisomic disorder (1:500 live births). Our labs and others have shown that the
kinase ATR is central to many prophase I events, including DSB repair, synapsis, and MSCI. However, these
numerous overlapping roles have posed a barrier to understanding the precise mechanistic actions of ATR in
meiosis. In the prior funding cycle, we generated novel separation-of-function mouse mutants in ATR regulators
that allow us to dissect specific roles for ATR in MSCI with minimal effects on its other meiotic functions. These
mice bear mutations in TOPBP1, a key ATR activator that also mediates substrate selectivity, and in RAD9A/B,
components of the 911 clamp that helps anchor TOPBP1. Our analysis revealed critical functions of TOPBP1
and 911 in driving ATR functions within the SB, and highlighted essential downstream ATR targets in these
processes such as the RNA:DNA helicase Senataxin (SETX). We hypothesize that the ATR-TOPBP1-911 axis
plays critical roles in establishing the unique chromatin and transcriptional environment required to
initiate, maintain, and terminate MSCI in a temporally restricted manner during meiotic prophase I, and
that this function is dependent on downstream ATR targets including SETX. Utilizing our unique mouse
models in combination with high-resolution genomic tools and cutting-edge proteomic approaches, we will
elucidate the mechanisms by which ATR signaling orchestrates MSCI in male meiosis, and MSUC in male and
female meiosis. Finally, based on our findings that ATR signaling is constantly antagonized, indicative of
prominent roles for phosphatases during MSCI maintenance and termination, we will determine the mechanisms
by which ATR signaling is counteracted by phosphatases to achieve temporally-appropriate shutdown of
transcriptional silencing, permitting prophase I completion and enabling the production of high quality gametes."

Development of resistance to chemotherapy was linked to persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are
characterized by the ability to self-renew, grow as spheres, differentiate and generate tumors in immunodeficient
mice. They are resistant to traditional forms of treatment, including chemo and radio-therapy. Building on our
previous work showing that ovarian CSCs residual after treatment with platinum display increased DNA
methylation, we hypothesized that other epigenetic modifications occur, promote a stem-like phenotype,
and render CSCs vulnerable to epigenome modifying agents. To begin to address this question, we used
partial wave spectroscopy to visualize chromatin at the nanoscale level, the Assay for Transposase Accessible
Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map accessible promoter regions, and proteomic
analysis to measure histone marks in CSCs vs. non-CSCs. We found less open chromatin associated with
repressive histone marks in CSCs vs. non-CSC and identified increased expression of the H379 histone methyl
transferase Dot1L in CSCs vs. non-CSCs. Our preliminary data show that Dot1L inhibitors blocked stemness
features. FOXK2, one of the transcription factors found to have an open promoter by ATAC-Seq in CSCs vs.
non-CSCs was shown to be a Dot1L target gene and was highly expressed in ovarian CSCs. These preliminary
observations led us to propose dissecting the link between Dot1L-induced H3K79 methylation, cancer
stemness, and platinum-resistance by addressing three main objectives.
Aim 1: Determine whether H3K79 methylation regulated by Dot1L is a mark and a target in OCSCs. H3K79
mono-, di-, and trimethylation will be mapped to chromatin extracted from OCSCs vs. non-CSCs by using
chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing. Effects of Dot-1L inhibitors and Dot-1L knock-down on stem
cell characteristics and response to platinum will be assessed in vitro and in vivo.
Aim 2: Determine whether H3K79 methylation is altered in platinum-resistant OC models and tumors.
Paired parental and platinum resistant cell lines, xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models (PDX)
developed by our group will be used to measure DOT1L expression and H3K79methylation. Expression and
function of Dot1L will be measured in human ovarian tumors sensitive or persistent after platinum-based
chemotherapy. Effects of genetic and pharmacological inhibitory strategies on response to platinum will be
investigated in vitro and in vivo.
Aim 3: Determine the function of FOXK2, a Dot1L target in ovarian CSCs. FOXK2 expression will be
measured in platinum-resistant vs. platinum-naïve models and in human ovarian tumors. Knock-in and knock-
out experiments will determine its function on transcription regulation in ovarian CSCs.
In summary, the proposed studies will address an important biological question with direct clinical applications.
Our preliminary data and extensive expertise on cancer stem cell biology and platinum resistance strongly
support the project’s feasibility and impact. We will use state of the art technologies to propel the development
of new epigenome-directed strategies, such as Dot1L inhibitors, to target ovarian CSCs. Our proven track record
of bench-to-clinic interventions will facilitate translation of our findings to clinical applications. The results of this
project will be immediately applicable to ovarian cancer, but may have broader implications for other platinum-
resistant solid tumors. In all, this project will bridge a gap of knowledge in platinum-resistant malignancies that
affect a significant number of US Veterans and US military."
10908258,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is among the most disabling conditions affecting wounded members of the U.S. military.
Unfortunately, no effective treatment has been available for SCI patients. Developing novel repair strategies to
mitigate the devastating nature of SCI and translating them clinically are urgent medical needs that will improve
quality of life of our veterans with SCI. The lumbar motoneurons (MNs) are the final common pathway for motor
output to the hindlimbs. Any impairment of these MNs can cause hindlimb paralysis and muscle atrophy. The
lumbar MNs could be impaired by a direct injury to the lumbar cord or by an indirect injury occurring at levels
above the lumbar cord at cervical or thoracic levels (called above-level injuries). For the latter, the lumbar MNs
are not directly injured by the trauma, but they undergo profound dendritic atrophy and synaptic stripping from
denervated supraspinal and propriospinal axons. Such altered MN morphological and synaptic changes could
result in impaired motor outputs to hindlimb muscles and therefore impaired locomotor functions. While most
SCI studies have been focused on the regeneration or protection of injured spinal cord at the site of injury, few
studies have explored how modulation of lumbar MN circuitry would affect pathological and functional
consequences after an above-level SCI. The goal of our research is to understand how lumbar MNs are altered
anatomically and functionally after an above-level SCI and how a beneficial restorative treatment affects their
reorganization and functional consequences. Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that regulate neuronal
survival, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Among them, Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) plays
a particular role in motor restoration by promoting axon growth and synaptic plasticity in multiple spinal pathways.
Exogenous administration of NT-3 has been proposed as one potential therapeutic treatment for SCI. This allows
us to propose the first hypothesis that the release of retrogradely transported NT-3 from MNs will result in an
elevation of local NT-3 levels around the MN pools, promoting remodeling of lumbar motor circuitry, and
enhancing physiological and behavioral recoveries following an above-level SCI. We and others also showed
exercise training alone improved coordinated motor function following SCIs. Exercise training also
contributed to the increased levels of intraspinal neurotrophic factors that promote neuronal survival and plasticity,
to the reorganization of neuronal circuitry, and to improvements in synaptic function and behavior. Therefore, we
propose the second hypothesis that exercise training will synergistically enhance the effect of NT-3 perhaps by
remodeling the spared descending spinal circuits and facilitating the formation of their functional connections
with lumbar MNs. Using an adult mouse T9 moderate contusive SCI model and an adeno-associated virus
serotype 2 vector encoding NT-3 (AAV2-NT-3) gene transfer approach, we propose 3 Specific Aims to
etermine the mechanism by which NT-3 improves recovery after SCI and the long-term efficacy of the NT-3
that
(1)
d
treatment using a clinically feasible delivery route, (2) determine whether exercise training will enhance the
effects of NT-3 on the remodeling of lumbar MN circuitry and functional recovery after an above-level SCI, and
(3) determine the functional roles of specific descending pathways to lumbar MNs in their ability to modulate
lumbar neural circuitry and functional recovery after the optimal treatment. Completion of this proposal will not
only allow us to reveal fundamental mechanisms of NT-3/exercise training-mediated remodeling of MN circuitry
but also to identify new therapeutic strategies targeting hindlimb locomotor recovery."
10908487,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression and contributes to protein
diversity between tissue types. Recent work has demonstrated that tissue-specific “microexons” that are 3-27
nucleotides in length are highly conserved in metazoans, play a prominent role in neuronal development, and
are frequently mis-spliced in patients with autism spectrum disorder. Work from the last decade has
demonstrated that splicing frequently occurs during transcription elongation (co-transcriptionally), with introns
rapidly excised following their synthesis. It is unclear how microexons can be defined rapidly enough to be spliced
during transcription elongation when both the 3' and 5' splice sites emerge from the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)
exit channel nearly simultaneously. Additionally, the co-dependence of microexon splicing with downstream
mRNA processing events is unknown. The work outlined in this proposal, broken down into three independent
aims, will fill substantial gaps in our understanding of neuronal microexon splicing regulation. In Aim 1, I will
adapt sequencing-based methods pioneered in the Neugebauer lab to investigate the relationship between
microexon splicing and transcription elongation. I hypothesize that microexons are spliced under different
transcriptional parameters than “conventional” exons which are on average ten times longer. In Aim 2, I will
analyze single molecules of mRNA to determine processing steps that co-occur in mRNAs with microexons. I
anticipate that microexons will serve to influence downstream processing events (e.g polyA cleavage site
choice). Finally, in Aim 3, I will use a series of splicing reporters to investigate the influence of local mRNA
sequence to microexon splicing. This proposal addresses many unresolved questions related to neuronal
microexon regulation."

Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on society. Physical and cognitive decline limit
the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of,
cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with
extended resistance to decline and disease should be a major objective of current medical research.
Fortunately, tremendous progress has been made in the biology of aging field and the science is poised to be
translated into preclinical and clinical science.
Simple animals models such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been at the heart of this success.
Many genes and chemical compound interventions that modulate aging processes are likely to act similarly in
humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group
involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for their
ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated
super-group is to test promising compound on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus,
which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that
treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being
effective in humans.
The emphasis of this specific proposal is the screening of test compounds for the capacity to promote longevity
and health across a genetically diverse test set. We will consider compounds via a public access portal, from
leads in the literature, and from high throughput chemical screens for longevity. Our labs will also develop and
test utility of engineered deletions of genes encoding fundamental executors of proteostasis, metabolism,
intercellular signaling and mitochondrial maintenance in diverse genetic backgrounds for compound evaluation.
By creating “at risk’ strains impaired in conserved hallmarks of aging, we might increase the dynamic range for
identifying anti-aging therapies. We will expand understanding of mechanisms for the most effective
compounds, aiding their translation. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to
define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with
implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging."

Influenza is one of the most common respiratory infections globally and has led to an alarming number of deaths
annually. Seasonal vaccines and therapies vary in efficacy among higher risk patients although they currently
serve as the only countermeasures. This presents a critical need to further understand the host response to
influenza in order to uncover pathways that can be targeted using novel therapies. One of the target cells of
Influenza A virus (IAV) are the multiciliated cells of the lung airway. Our lab had previously discovered a subset
of multiciliated cells defined by the expression of MIWI2, an Argonaute family protein most commonly studied in
mammalian testes. MIWI2 binds to PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and suppresses retrotransposon activity in
germline cells to maintain genome integrity. However, MIWI2 expression in somatic cells is not well understood.
In order to understand lung MIWI2, we used a MIWI2-TdTomato heterozygote (haplo-sufficient) and a
homozygote (deficient) knock-in reporter mouse model. Mice deficient in MIWI2 exhibited a markedly decrease
burden of Influenza A virus suggesting that MIWI2 plays a critical role in regulating viral pathogenesis and the
immune response. Incorporating an HA-mNeon reporter IAV, we ruled out the possibility that MIWI2 multiciliated
cells were preferentially infected as we observed no differences in viral tropism between MIWI2 haplo-sufficient
and deficient mice. Recently, we identified the presence of an immune cell population that also expresses
MIWI2, raising the prospect that this heretofore unrecognized hematopoietic cell could be key to MIWI2
dependent immune function. Taken together, we hypothesize that a MIWI2 expressing cell in the lung critically
modulates the host response to IAV infection. We will examine our central hypothesis by pursuing two aims. In
the first Aim, we will use bone marrow transplantations and cell-specific deletion of MIWI2 mouse models to
determine the identity of the MIWI2 expressing cell population that modulates the immune response during an
IAV infection. In the second Aim, we will employ single cell sequencing to elucidate MIWI2-dependent pathways
that critically regulate the lung’s antiviral immune response. Overall, the work proposed here will expand our
understanding of the viral pathogenesis of IAV as well as uncover novel pathways that are involved in the lung’s
host immune response. These studies will also provide functional information regarding the action of Argonaute
proteins in somatic cells. Most importantly, this serves as a platform for an integrated and cogent training plan
that will support my development as an independent researcher."

The demonstration that extracellular vesicles (EVs), carrying RNA, DNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites, play
important roles in maintaining human health as well as contribute to driving disease has opened up a whole
new field of research. Therefore, EVs have tremendous biologic significance and clinical potential, making a
meeting focused on this area of research both highly timely and highly significant. The 4th Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) and 3rd Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) entitled “Extracellular vesicles: structure and
function, technology development, and clinical application"" to be held July 28 - August 2, 2024, at the Grand
Summit Hotel at Sunday River in Newry, Maine, will bring together a very diverse array of senior and early
career investigators in both basic and clinical fields. There will be an emphasis on promoting interactions
between participants to facilitate the development of collaborative and translational research. GRCs are one of
only a few types of meetings that facilitate these important interactions between senior and junior investigators.
This GRC will be led off with keynote presentations by Guillaume van Niel and Xandra Breakefield on EV
biogenesis and on EVs as biomarkers in cancer, respectively followed by sessions covering: 1) Fundaments of
EV Biology & Diversity; 2) Novel developments in EV diagnostics; 3) Novel developments in EV engineering for
therapy 4) EVs in cancer; 5) EVs in immune biology and disease; 6) EVs in neurobiology and disease; 7) EVs
in host-pathogen interactions; 8) EVs in preclinical and clinical settings. General issues to be focused on will be
EV heterogeneity, isolation and quantification strategies, trafficking of EVs, the role of EVs in disease and
therapeutic efficacy of EVs, both pre-clinically and clinically. Up to 12 open speaker slots have been reserved
for early career investigators who will be selected from submitted abstracts. There also will be GRC Power
Hour, designed to address challenges women and other minorities face in science and issues of unconscious
bias, diversity and inclusion. In this proposal, we seek to obtain funding to support registration fees for invited
speakers and discussion leaders (prioritizing women, minorities, grads, post-grads and early career
researchers) for both the GRC and GRS. Overall, the GRC and GRS on EVs promise to be very diverse and
exciting conferences, which should lead to important collaborations that move the field forward both to basic
studies and clinical applications."

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-system disease with the highest mortality among major rheumatologic
diseases. Though certain genetic loci have been robustly linked to SSc susceptility, development of effective
therapies for SSc is hampered by a fragmented understanding of mechanisms by which the identified genetic
variants lead to SSc. The current proposal is designed to elucidate mechanisms by which a variant in
deoxyribonuclease 1-like 3 (DNASE1L3) that results in Arg to Cys substitution at amino acid 206 (R206C)
contributes to SSc pathogenesis.
The Pl's preliminary data indicate that digestion of circulating genomic DNA is impaired in SSc patients with
the DNASE1 L3 R206C variant. Aim 1 of the proposal is designed to further define the circulating DNA profile
in SSc patients with DNASE1 L3 R206C. Two specific populations of circulating DNA will be analyzed--nucleosomal
DNA associated with apoptosis-derived extracellular vesicles and DNA contained in neutrophil
extracellular traps. A potential role of DNASE1 L3 in digestion of mitochondrial DNA will also be examined.
Next-generation sequencing will be employed to determine length differences in circulating DNA fragments.
An ELISA for measurement of circulating DNASE1L3 will be developed and validated. Aim 2 will elucidate
aberrancies in immune cell function that occur in the setting of DNASE1 L3 deficiency, using a dendritic cell
functional assay and single cell RNA Sequencing analyses of murine and human immune cells. Together,
these studies will shed light on the downstream biochemical and immunologic consequences of DNASE1 L3
dysfunction, strengthening the foundation for development of targeted therapies to treat SSc.
The Pl is an MD/PhD Rheumatologist with the long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused
on SSc pathogenesis. The proposed research and training plan will help the Pl to develop proficiency in
analyses of genomic and transcriptomics data and in experimental approaches for the study of adaptive
immunology. The work will be performed in an excellent institutional environment with mentorship from Dr.
Shervin Assassi, a leader in molecular profiling of SSc, and additional guidance from co-mentors with expertise
in bioinformatics and immunology. This award will accelerate the Pl's research as well as career development
into an independent researcher."
10973775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of individuals annually resulting in disrupted neuronal circuitry,
persistent neurological deficits, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. Following TBI, the
peripheral immune system (PIS) cells contribute to subsequent neuroinflammation and exacerbate
neuropathology by homing to the injured brain, associating with micropathological features, and releasing
inflammatory factors. Additionally, following TBI, the injured brain releases damage signals into the blood which
alters PIS homeostasis and functionality. Indeed, these adjustments to the PIS can result in chronic
immunodeficiency, reduced tissue regenerative capacity, impaired neurological outcomes, and an increased
mortality rate. However, the mechanisms and outcomes of how these two organ systems affect one another after
trauma has never been investigated in a clinically relevant model of diffuse TBI. Therefore, I propose to quantify
the liming, extent, and location of the infiltrating PIS in the brain after TBI, to investigate TBI-induced changes to
PIS functionality at baseline and after a clinically relevant immune challenge, and to fabricate a therapeutic
treatment strategy that will employ cells of the PIS to modulate TBI-induced neuroinflammation. Specifically,
immunomodulatory microparticles will be loaded into infiltrating immune cells and these autologous
microparticle-loaded cells will be administered intravenously after TBI. Thereafter, the therapeutic efficacy of
these cells will be quantified by characterizing the extent of infiltration, effects on the PIS, and distribution of
neuropathology. To complete this work, I propose to utilize a high-fidelity preclinical porcine model of closed-head
diffuse TBI - which is the most clinically relevant model of TBI biomechanics in use today - along with
comprehensive and quantitative PIS characterization. I hypothesize that infiltrating immune cells will localize with
micropathological features, the innate and adaptive PIS will exhibit chronic immunosuppression after TBI, and
that neuroinflammation will be mitigated when infiltrating immune cells are loaded with immunomodulatory
microparticles. Information gained from this proposal will develop a translationally-relevant treatment strategy for
TBI that could improve care of affected individuals and inform basic science questions about neuro-immune
interactions. Importantly, this research can only be completed at the University of Pennsylvania and VA Medical
Center because of unique resources, equipment, and institutional environment that is not available anywhere
else in the world. During this career development award, I will have access the injury device that induces the
porcine closed-head diffuse TBI, equipment and assays for comprehensive PIS characterization,
immunomodulatory microparticle fabrication, and large animal facilities. This career development award will offer
a unique training opportunity, answer basic scientific questions, develop translational immunomodulatory tools,
and foster committed mentorship that will cultivate a specialized research niche on neuro-immune interactions
that will allow me to transition into an independent researcher."

Cellular responses to environmental stressors (e.g., hypoxia, metals, and oxidants) are essential
to animal performance and their dysregulation is associated with blindness, cancer, and aging.
These responses are mediated by protein-level mechanisms regulating cytoprotective programs
essential to animal survival. However, the majority of our knowledge into these proteins stems
from human and mouse systems, ignoring the rich diversity of animal specialists —such as fishes,
whales, and birds—that have evolved to survive chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress. This limits
our understanding of the organismal stress response, as well as our ability to modulate these
pathways in novel and unanticipated ways. With hundreds of these animals now represented by
high-quality genomes, my goal is to harness evolutionary adaptation to identify novel molecular
mechanisms modulating the environmental stress response. I recently demonstrated the
enhanced NRF2 stress response of birds, pinpointing the protein-level mechanisms responsible.
Since then, I have produced strong preliminary data identifying additional novel mechanisms in
avian NRF2, as well as equine NRF2 and HIF-1 stress responses—species adapted to
environmental oxidants, metals and chronic hypoxemia. We have identified substantial overlap of
these adaptive mechanisms with those implicated in human diseases, suggesting these animals
have evolved additional compensatory mechanisms. My vision is to reverse engineer these
animal systems to reveal novel strategies capable of modulating the NRF2 and HIF-1 axis in
human diseases where they are dysregulated. Thus, my plan over the next five years is to dissect
these systems with a range of interdisciplinary techniques. Through a research strategy that
integrates diverse perspectives from evolutionary biology, biochemistry, and cell biology, my
program will address major gaps in our understanding of how stress response pathways operate
in natural systems. Thus, my work is well-poised to improve our understanding of human health
by harnessing the molecular strategies ‘discovered’ by natural selection millions of years ago."
10940885,"Project Summary
Small molecular drugs play a pivotal role in treating a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, infection,
cardiovascular diseases, and various other ailments. However, many of these small molecular drugs, suffer
from limited solubility, severe side effects, and unsatisfactory efficacy due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics
and inefficient drug delivery to diseased sites. Drug delivery systems, including antibody-drug conjugates,
polymeric micelles, liposomes, polymer-drug conjugates, and nanoparticles, have been widely used to
improve pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, ultimately leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy and
reduced adverse effects. Yet, delivery of therapeutic agents is unsatisfactory in many cases. There is a
pressing need for the development of innovative delivery approaches for a vast variety of therapeutic agents.
Toward this end, two novel strategies designed to improve the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of small
molecular drugs, especially those with unfavorable physiochemical properties toward conventional drug
delivery systems are proposed: 1) Development of albumin-binding targeted prodrug; 2) Targeted
responsive polymer prodrugs with tunable drug release. On one hand, we aim to design and synthesize an
albumin-binding targeted small molecule drug conjugates consisting of a targeting ligand, an albumin-
binder that can hitchhike endogenous albumin as a carrier, and a highly potent drug linked via responsive
linker. We will systematically investigate the effect of the payload linker chemistry, albumin binding, and
targeting ligands on the in vitro self-assembly, drug release, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity, and in vivo
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy. On the other hand, we propose to use prodrug-
initiated ring opening polymerization (ROP) to obtain a polymer prodrug in one step. We will investigate the
effect of prodrug polymer chain length on the prodrug hydrophobicity and loading efficiency and capacity,
the formation of stereocomplexes with the nanocarrier, and release kinetics, cellular uptake, in vitro
cytotoxicity, and therapeutic efficacy in vivo. The outcome of this research proposed is to establish modular
platforms toward the safe and effective delivery of therapeutic agents leveraging advances in organic and
polymer chemistry, materials science, and nanomedicine. The proposed research focuses on engineering
prodrugs for improved drug delivery which features improved pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and
therapeutic efficacy with reduced systemic toxicities. We will establish rules and principles to guide the
design and development of albumin-binding targeted prodrugs and responsive polymer prodrugs. Our
innovative strategies can be applied to a diverse array of therapeutic agents and will have a transformative
impact in the field of drug delivery and offer tremendous opportunities in disease treatment."
10911036,"Project Background
Lung cancer represents a large burden of disease within the US and the VA population killing more Americans
than the top three cancer types combined. Fortunately, the widespread adoption of CT screening for lung
cancer is expected to result in more patients identified with early stage disease, however these patients still face
a significant risk of lung cancer recurrence or development of a second primary lung cancer. National
guidelines for follow up imaging surveillance exist, however structured data to evaluate guideline concordance
and associations between guideline concordance and clinical outcomes are lacking. The current literature upon
which the guidelines are based are not robust at the most recent data offer conflicting recommendations. Thus,
the goal of this study is to examine patterns of post-treatment surveillance and determine concordance with
national guidelines, impact of surveillance on clinical endpoints, and model best practices for optimal
surveillance strategies in this high risk population.
Project Objectives
The objectives of this study are to (a) determine patterns of care and concordance with national guidelines for
imaging surveillance, (b) determine the impact of guideline concordant routine imaging surveillance on clinical
endpoints, and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of newer recommendations stratified by stage and cancer
treatment on post-lung cancer treatment survival to clarify provider decision conflict.
Project Methods
To achieve these objectives, we will conduct a retrospective analysis of secondary clinical data linking patient
records from multiple data sources. Patient demographics, provider information, inpatient ICD-9 codes for
medical comorbidities, and diagnostic and treatment interventions from the Central Data Warehouse (CDW)
will be linked to mortality records in CDW and other VHA vital status files. Cancer data will be obtained from
the VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) including stage, treatment, and recurrence information. VACCR will
also provide initial cohort identification. Raw CDW data files will be used for radiology text report information
which are also available through CDW. To perform more efficient data collection, we will use a novel semi-
automated chart abstraction method previously employed by our team for detection and categorization of lung
nodules in an unscreened population. The method involves feeding electronic text imaging reports through a
two-step process using coded data through SQL, a search tool to identify presence of potential key words
related to each category, followed by manual chart review from highlighted text abstracts. Imaging tests will be
categorized as to the indication for a given study, the presence or absence of recurrent or new disease as well as
recommendations for follow-up. Patterns of care received will be compared to national standards to assess
concordance with published guidelines and specific radiologist recommendations for follow-up. Clinical
outcomes will be assessed to determine the association between receipt of guideline concordant care and
detection of recurrent or new lung cancer, receipt of secondary therapy or interventions, and overall and lung
cancer specific survival. We will then examine survival outcomes associated with adherence to
recommendations based on the findings of the prospective randomized controlled Intergroupe Francophone de
Cancerologie Thoracique (IFCT) group trial supporting less frequent surveillance imaging versus the newest
National Comprehensive Cancer Center clinical guidelines supporting more frequent imaging for patients with
late stage disease. Our goal in Aim 3 would be to test the impact of the newer recommendations that rely on
tailoring imaging surveillance based on stage and treatment in order to reconcile the impending conflict
between the two recommendations."

10911039,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Malignant melanoma is a tumor of the pigment-producing melanocytes, and is responsible for the majority of
skin cancer related deaths. Cutaneous melanoma can be successfully treated through surgical excision;
however, once the disease has metastasized, the survival rate is significantly reduced. Some recent studies
have suggested that in certain contexts, cues from the tumor microenvironment can epigenetically reprogram
melanoma cells into a malignant melanoma initiating cell (MIC) that is drug resistant and primed for invasion and
metastasis. In the Kilian laboratory we have discovered a relationship between tumor topology and activation of
a tumorigenic MIC that may prove an early transformation step preceding metastasis. In the Copland laboratory,
we have developed novel combination therapies to treat melanoma, and several patient derived tumor xenograft
(PDTX) models that accurately mimic patient response to standard of care. We will employ our suite of
engineered extracellular matrices to decipher the interplay between topology, mechanics and matrix
composition, in guiding activation of the MIC state in patient derived cells that display varying degrees of drug
sensitivity. We will translate these matrix parameters into a novel 3D geometrically structured tissue engineered
microtumor model. To evaluate the potential as a tool for drug development we will fabricate a 96-well plate-
based format and evaluate microtumor response to standard of care and prospective new therapies. We will use
orthotopic xenografts in athymic nude mice to study growth, invasion and dissemination of our cells, and use this
information to inform the design of our model 3D tumor-mimics. Towards leveraging our microtumor array for
therapeutic development, we will perform a small pilot study of combination therapies using our tumor-mimics—
in vitro and as a novel in vivo microtumor xenograft—to discern how closely our biomimetic system recapitulates
oncogenesis and drug sensitivity compared to cell lines and xenografts. This project aims to establish a
complementary or even alternative approach to patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, where a patient’s cells
derived from biopsy or excision may be integrated into a tumor-mimic for individualized medicine."
10911158,"Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in older persons, and is
associated with marked physical disability, poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), frequent
rehospitalizations, loss of independence, high mortality, and enormous health care costs. However, most of
the trials testing a wide range of medications and strategies in ADHF have been neutral. In our recently
completed NIA-funded phase 2 trial (REHAB-HF), an innovative, early, transitional, tailored, and progressive
multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention produced a large improvement in the primary outcome of Short
Physical Performance Battery (+1.5 points) in older patients with ADHF. At baseline, the participants (53%)
with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), had significantly worse impairments in physical function,
frailty, HRQOL, and depression than those with HF with reduced EF. They also appeared to derive greater
benefit from the intervention, with ~50% larger effect sizes in physical function, frailty, HRQOL, and
depression. Patients with HFpEF also appeared to have much greater reductions in rehospitalizations and
death and potential for reduced medical resource use. The finding of potentially greater benefit in HFpEF is
noteworthy as HFpEF is highly relevant to older persons and has the most urgent need for new treatments
since it is: 1) the most common form of HF, nearly unique to older persons, and disproportionately affects older
women and Black persons; 2) increasing in prevalence; 3) accepted as a geriatric syndrome; 4) associated
with marked impairments in physical function and HRQOL and high rates of frailty; 5) has high morbidity and
mortality which are worsening over time; and 6) has limited evidence-based treatments. The phase 3 REHAB-
HFpEF trial will focus on this large, growing, vulnerable, underserved population. The 5-year, randomized,
attention-controlled, single-blinded trial will enroll 880 older adults age >60 years with ADHF and HFpEF
across 20 geographically dispersed clinical centers. We will test the hypothesis that the innovative REHAB-HF
intervention will improve the clinically compelling combined primary endpoint of all-cause rehospitalizations and
mortality during 6-month follow-up, the most vulnerable time period following ADHF hospitalization (Aim 1) and
the secondary endpoint of prevalence of major mobility disability, a clinically meaningful outcome in trials of
older adults, at 6-months (Aim 2). We will also assess the intervention’s impact on HRQOL, frailty, depression,
physical activity, and health care costs. Our diverse, cohesive, multi-disciplinary team and experience from the
phase 2 trial will ensure efficient and effective execution and dissemination. REHAB-HFpEF directly addresses
the key recommendations of several recent NIA and NHLBI sponsored workshops. Its results could improve
key outcomes that are meaningful to patients, caregivers, health systems, and payers. The trial has strong
potential to change clinical guidelines, reduce health care costs, and influence national coverage
decisions for the large, growing, underserved, high-risk population of older patients with acute HFpEF."
10911159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. Cohesin is a chromatin-bound ring
complex involved in 3D genome organization, sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and DNA repair.
Mutational inactivation of genes encoding components of the cohesin complex is common in GBM, and
mutations of the STAG2 subunit account for >50% of all cohesin mutations. However, the mechanism(s) of
STAG2 tumor suppression remain unknown. Recent ground-breaking studies in the basic biology of cohesin
have shown that cohesin plays a critical role in generating and maintaining the chromatin loops that underly
much of 3D genome organization and that link enhancers to the promoters the regulate. However, the
relationship of these functions of cohesin to GBM pathogenesis is undefined. This grant will test the hypothesis
that tumor-derived STAG2 mutations result in alterations to 3D genome organization and enhanced Polycomb
Group (PcG)-mediated transcriptional repression to drive neoplastic transformation in GBM. This hypothesis is
based on experiments performed in the Waldman (multi-PI) and Jin (multi-PI) labs that utilized gene editing to
correct the endogenous mutant allele of STAG2 in GBM cells, with matched corrected and uncorrected cells
analyzed by Hi-C and RNA-seq. The data were analyzed using a new bioinformatics pipeline Jin developed
called “HiCorr” and “DeepLoop” that makes it possible to clearly identify chromatin loops from sub-billion read-
pair sequencing depth with the highest possible sensitivity. These experiments showed that whereas STAG2
was dispensable for maintenance of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), STAG2 was essential for
regulating the size and strength of individual CTCF and H3K27me3-anchored chromatin loops, leading to
alterations in the expression of adjacent genes. The preliminary studies also showed that STAG2-mutant GBM
cells have dramatically increased levels of chromatin-bound H3K27me3, enhanced repression of Polycomb
Group (PcG)-regulated genes, and sensitivity to inhibitors of PcG signaling in vitro. Based on these data, two
aims are proposed. In Aim #1 we will examine the relationship between STAG2-regulated chromatin loops and
gene expression in GBM cells and tumors. In Aim #2 we will define the role of STAG2 in PcG-mediated chromatin
looping and transcriptional repression in GBM. Completion of the research proposed in this grant will define the
role of tumor-derived STAG2 gene mutations in 3D genome organization and PcG-mediated transcriptional
repression in GBM cells and tumors. These findings will provide a long-sought molecular mechanism for cohesin-
mediated tumor suppression, providing important clues for how cohesin mutations can be targeted for
therapeutic purposes in GBM."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global health concern and despite the fast-track development of vaccines and the
imminent prospective of new antiviral drugs, is expected to become endemic. COVID-19 is associated with
atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) complications like acute coronary syndrome (ACS), Myocardial Infarction
(MI) and stroke, a risk that remains high for up to one year following recovery, but the underlying mechanisms
are poorly understood. In preliminary work using atherosclerotic tissue from COVID-19 patients at autopsy and
subjects who recovered from COVID-19, along with an ex-vivo SARS-CoV-2 model of human vascular explants,
we identified SARS-CoV-2 viral material in human plaques that persists in plaques of patients who recovered
from COVID-19. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of human atherosclerotic plaques identified high levels
of neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, in plaque macrophages and foam cells. NRP-1
blockade abrogated the accumulation of viral material in SARS-CoV-2 treated human plaques. These data
suggest that SARS-COV-2 or its viral components can accumulate in human plaques, where they exacerbate
inflammation and disease progression by engaging NRP-1. Using the Syrian Golden hamster model, that
faithfully mimics human SARS-CoV2 infection, we found that viral replication in the heart, lungs and olfactory
bulb of infected hamsters did not correlate with expression levels of Ace2, supporting a role for alternative
mechanisms of viral entry such as NRP-1. Moreover, this model revealed acute and sustained tissue-specific
inflammatory responses (i.e. Nfkb1, Il6, Il1b) in several tissues due to the persistence in the circulation of
noninfectious viral RNA debris (vRNA) for up to several weeks following viral clearance. Based on these exciting
preliminary data, we propose two independent aims to study how SARS-CoV-2 aggravates plaque inflammation
and atherosclerosis and to determine the molecular basis for the increased risk of acute and long-term CV events
in COVID-19 patients. In Aim 1 we will identify the role of NRP-1 in SARS-CoV-2-induced atherosclerotic plaque
inflammation and atherosclerosis progression. Aim 2 will identify the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 vRNA debris
to inflammation and atherosclerosis. We will also determine the effect of persistent vRNA on inflammation and
atherogenesis following viral clearance and recovery from COVID-19. These studies will address important gaps
in knowledge on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on plaque inflammation and atherosclerosis, and will tackle
the molecular basis for the increased CV in patients with COVID-19. We foresee that this information will help
guide the future design of precise therapies to prevent CV outcomes in patients with COVID-19."

fulfills a unique niche within UC, providing focused training in translational pharmacology to trainees with either
a clinical or scientific background (some trainees have both a clinical and PhD degree). Although the primary
mission is to prepare clinicians for an academic research career in clinical pharmacology, the program also has
successfully trained scientists for careers in government and the pharmaceutical industry. Most trainees have
medical degrees and are board eligible in their area of specialty; other trainees hold PharmD or clinical PhD
degrees (e.g., psychology,. We offer numerous opportunities for dual training with many departments within the
UC community including the Department of Medicine's section of adult hematology/oncology, rheumatology,
pediatric hematology/oncology, and psychiatry and a new collaboration with pathology. We will be offering joint
training in Clinical Chemistry/Clinical Therapeutics and Clinical Informatics/Clinical Therapeutics.
In all disciplines, the program is primarily focused on research training, under the supervision of a mentor
selected by the trainee (and approved by the Executive Committee) and is supplemented with formal
coursework and participation in seminars, career and leadership development, and teaching. Clinical training
includes participation in our Personalized Therapeutics Clinic, the Institutional Review Board, the Clinical Trials
Review Committee and the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. Trainees submit abstracts and attend the
annual American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics meeting. A maximum of 10% effort is
allowed for clinical responsibilities in the area of the trainee's specialty. Upon completion of this program, the
trainee is expected to become accomplished in basic research methodology, experimental design, and data
interpretation and presentation, and be prepared for a competitive research career in clinical therapeutics, as
well as certification in Clinical Pharmacology."

needed, especially given that Veterans have higher pregnancy risk profiles than the general population.
Significance: Given the growing share of women Veterans, their increased pregnancy risk, and known U.S.
racial and geographic maternal health disparities, VA needs to better understand the provision and outcomes
of pregnancy care to implement policies to optimize pregnancy outcomes for Veterans. Findings will facilitate
the VA Office of Women’s Health Services (WHS) efforts to improve pregnancy care and outcomes.
Innovation and Impact: Existing state of the art methods will be innovatively applied to examine national VA
and state Medicaid records in parallel to comprehensively assess VA maternity care. This project is the first to
rigorously compare VA pregnancy outcomes with those in the general population at a national level.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. This aim has two parts, of which the first is purely descriptive: We will describe a wide
range of key maternal outcomes, examining trends and changes over time (with respect to key VA policy
changes) for all pregnancies where the VA provided pregnancy care (purchased). Key maternal outcomes will
include cesarean deliveries, pregnancy complications and severe maternal morbidity (SMM), a CDC defined
set of serious life-threatening maternal complications. We will also describe a broad range of maternal risk
factors (individual health factors, and systemic factors of race and geography) and process outcomes including
use of prenatal care, VA mental healthcare, and post-partum reintegration to VA care. We will also examine if
Veterans with known risk-factors deliver at settings appropriate for their risk levels, as outcomes are
demonstrably worse when high-risk deliveries occur in sub-optimal settings. Concurrently we will assess key
infant outcomes (e.g., mortality, prematurity, and unexpected NICU admission—i.e. in non-preterm infants).
The final part of Aim 1 will use regression analyses to examine the impacts of VA policy changes on key
outcomes, while also analyzing the extent of racial/ethnic and urban/rural disparities in outcomes.
 Aim 2: Repeat, in parallel, the Aim 1 descriptive analyses, for deliveries to VA-enrolled Veterans who
do NOT use VA maternity benefits, but instead use Medicaid. We will assess how these Veterans differ in
characteristics and maternal outcomes. Since they have chosen not to have VA cover their delivery, we will
also assess their use of VA care in the years prior to and after delivery to determine if opting for non-VA
pregnancy care was a temporary or lasting healthcare shift away from VA.
 Aim 3: Compare key outcomes (e.g., complication rates and SMM) of VA-covered deliveries and of
Medicaid-covered Veterans’ deliveries with those in the general population. Examine if known disparities
racial/ethnic and urban/rural in birth outcomes are more/less pronounced in VA or Medicaid covered Veterans.
Methodology: Established CDC methods will be used to search VA administrative records, including
purchased care, to identify all enrolled women Veterans who received pregnancy care, extending back to
2000, when VA first covered pregnancy, through 2021. These data will be supplemented by all years of
Medicaid data that are available. In addition to descriptive analysis, regression analyses will be used to adjust
for known risk factors and moderators to examine a wide range of pregnancy outcomes. Causal inference
techniques will be used to analyze the effect of VA and other policies on key outcomes. The study team is led
by internationally recognized experts in the evaluation of perinatal care and they have all of the needed
expertise to conduct appropriate analyses and effectively disseminate the findings.
Next Steps/Implementation: We work closely WHS to share results and tailor analyses to their information
needs. WHS can directly implement change via directives to maternity care coordinators at all VA facilities."
10911086,"The overall goal of the proposed project is to improve the care of Veterans with schizophrenia. Deficits
in initiating and sustaining goal-oriented behavior, termed avolition, is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia that
has cascading effects on interpersonal relationships, occupational functioning, and psychological well-being.
There is widespread consensus that adequate interventions for avolition do not exist. The development of
effective and tailored interventions for avolition depends on a clearer understanding of its neurobiological
underpinnings in concert with translational models that bridge with pre-clinical research. Recent models have
posited several mechanisms that contribute to avolition, including failures to sufficiently recall past personal
experiences when imagining and evaluating future gains, reduced capacity to anticipate reward from future
outcomes, and indecision when preparing movements towards a goal. To date, there has been no thorough
test of how these various processes contribute to avolition in the context of schizophrenia. Animal models of
goal pursuit show that core brain rhythms orchestrate memory and reward functioning; similar oscillatory
patterns support memory and reward processing in humans and are often deficient in schizophrenia. Taken
together, avolition in schizophrenia could arise, in part, from neural oscillatory signals that can be compared to
preclinical models. Noninvasive neurostimulation methods are a safe and promising avenue to try to augment
these oscillatory signals in Veterans with schizophrenia, in an effort to reduce avolition. Mounting evidence
shows that stimulation applied to a novel episodic memory-related brain target enhances memory in healthy
individuals. Whether targeting this same region remediates memory-related oscillatory deficits in
schizophrenia, and corresponding behavioral sequalae, is unknown.
 This proposal aims to address these gaps in the literature by isolating a set of mechanisms related to
avolition, and by testing whether a single session of transient, noninvasive neurostimulation can augment the
neural signals associated with these mechanisms in Veterans with schizophrenia. This study will combine
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and theta burst stimulation (TBS), a noninvasive neurostimulation
method, to achieve three specific aims: 1) to investigate the contributions of episodic memory, reward
anticipation, and motor preparation processes in the prediction of clinical avolition in schizophrenia using a
translational reward task; 2) to identify episodic-memory neural oscillatory deficits in Veterans with
schizophrenia using EEG, and evaluate relationships between oscillatory dysfunction with reward anticipation,
motor preparation, and clinical avolition; and finally, 3) to examine whether memory-related oscillatory activity
in Veterans with schizophrenia can be enhanced with a brief TBS protocol applied to a novel memory-related
brain target. The proposed work will leverage the temporal precision of EEG and the efficiency of TBS.
 Knowledge gained from this study could provide important insights into the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia. In turn, these findings could facilitate the identification of neurophysiological targets for novel
interventions specifically aimed at ameliorating avolition, thereby improving functional outcomes in Veterans
with schizophrenia."
10911087,"The goal of this project is to determine the role of epigenetic modifications of mitochondrial genes in
the induction of the plateau phase after spinal cord injury (SCI), and to exploit these modifications to
promote recovery. SCI is a devastating disorder often resulting in loss of function below the injury site. In recent
years, service members have been threatened by more advanced warfare, such as improvised explosive
devices, ultimately inducing more severe and complex injuries, including SCI. The devastating and debilitating
nature of these injuries has not been lessened. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest healthcare
network for individuals suffering from SCI, providing care for 25% of total victims in the United States. Improved
therapeutics for the treatment of SCI would greatly benefit not only sufferers, but also the VA healthcare system.
SCI is defined by direct trauma to the spinal cord, which disrupts the vasculature, leading to decreased oxygen
delivery within the area and reducing the ability of mitochondria to maintain cellular energetics. Thus far, the
majority of studies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction following SCI have focused on downstream aspects of
mitochondrial function (e.g. antioxidant defenses). Reestablishment of mitochondrial function through
pharmacological induction of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) remains an underexplored but novel strategy.
I previously reported that treatment with the mitochondrially biogenic FDA-approved β2-adrenergic receptor
agonist formoterol beginning up to 8h after SCI improves spinal cord mitochondrial function, decreases lesion
volume and enhances locomotor recovery by 7 days post-injury (DPI). Consistent with other published data, the
majority of the improvements observed with formoterol occurred within the first 2 weeks, after which recovery
plateaued. A similar effect is observed in humans, with the majority of recovery taking place within the first year
then reaching a plateau. The mechanism behind the development of this plateau phase, however, is not fully
understood. By determining the mechanism of its formation, the plateau phase could be prevented and/or
reversed, potentially allowing for continued recovery following injury. My preliminary studies revealed genetic
differences within the injured spinal cord of formoterol-treated mice between the recovery phase (7 DPI) and the
plateau phase (15 DPI), namely a decrease in genes associated with mitochondrial function, and a concurrent
increase in genes associated with epigenetic modifications. Therefore, I hypothesize that epigenetic
alterations contribute to decreased transcription of mitochondrial genes within the spinal cord during
the plateau phase, preventing continued recovery of mitochondrial function and limiting the efficacy of
formoterol treatment in mice. To address this hypothesis, I propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Further
elucidate the genetic profile within the spinal cord during the post-SCI recovery period (7 DPI) and plateau phase
(≥15 DPI), with and without formoterol treatment in mice; 2) Elucidate the mechanisms of epigenetic
modifications on the transcription of mitochondrial genes during the transition from recovery to plateau phase
post-SCI, with and without formoterol treatment; 3) Assess the pharmacological efficacy of inhibiting epigenetic
events on MB and recovery post-SCI in vivo, with and without formoterol treatment.
Successful completion of this proposal could provide integral information into the recovery plateau observed
after SCI. I am using an FDA-approved compound, male and female mice and initiating treatment up to 8h after
injury, emphasizing the clinical applicability. This proposal will also directly assess the therapeutic potential of
my findings by determining if modulation of epigenetic status improves recovery after injury.
My mentoring team has formulated a comprehensive career development plan that includes exposure to a rich
educational environment, opportunities to improve oral and written communication skills and mentoring on
project and laboratory maintenance to ease transition to independence. This project and training will facilitate
the completion of my long-term career goal of becoming and independent VA researcher."
10911088,"Heart failure (HF) is the number one reason for admission among patients in the Veteran (VA) health system,
consuming a significant portion of VA medical resources. However, the molecular mechanism of HF is poorly
understood and the treatment of HF still remains at the level of controlling symptom and reducing risk factors
without a cure. Hence, further research into developing pathogenic mechanism-specific novel therapies for HF
is an urgent need. Our pilot studies have demonstrated that a deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin carboxyl-
terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of mouse and human failing hearts. In
addition, cardiomyocyte-restricted (CR) transgenic overexpression of UCH-L1 (CR-UCH-L1 Tg) exaggerates
cardiac pathological remodeling and dysfunction in a mouse model of pressure overload (PO)-induced
cardiomyopathy and HF, and the CR-UCH-L1 Tg-induced adverse phenotypes could be rescued by the
treatment with a reversible, competitive, act-site directed inhibitor of UCH-L1, LDN-57444. Moreover, UCH-L1
is capable of suppressing autophagy in PO-hearts, which serves as crucial adaptive mechanism to protect
against PO-induced cardiomyopathy and HF. At the molecular level, it is most likely that UCH-L1 facilitates
mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) dependent inactivation of ULK1 (uncoordinated-51-like
kinase 1)-mediated autophagy induction and the activation of DAP1 (death-associated protein 1)-mediated
inhibition of autophagy flux in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, the circulating level of exosomal UCH-L1 is
elevated conceivably via a mechanism of autophagy inhibition (AI)-induced increases in exosomal loading and
secretion of UCH-L1 in cardiomyocytes of PO-hearts. Collectively, our findings compellingly support the
hypothesis that targeting UCH-L1 is a novel approach for the treatment of HF and circulating exosomal UCH-
L1 serves as novel biomarker of HF. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims in mouse models as
well as in VA HF patients as follows: Aim 1 is to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting UCH-L1 in HF
in mice. The impact of CR-UCH-L1 knockout (KO) and the efficacy of UCH-L1 inhibitor, LDN-57444 on PO-
induced cardiomyopathy and HF will be investigated. Aim 2 is to determine the molecular mechanism by which
UCH-L1 mediates HF, testing the hypothesis that UCH-L1 controls the assembly of mTORC1 in favor of
increasing the access of mTOR to ULK1 for phosphorylation of ULK1 at S757 while decreasing the association
of mTOR with DAP1 for dephosphorylation of DAP1 to enhance AI in cardiomyocytes, thereby exaggerating
cardiac pathological remodeling and dysfunction. We will determine whether CR-UCH-L1 Tg-induced adverse
phenotypes are rescued by additional enhancement of cardiac autophagy via CR overexpression of autophagy
related gene (Atg)7 or autophagy activator, rapamycin. Also, we will dissect the signaling mechanism by which
UCH-L1 inhibits autophagy with an initial focus on the regulation of mTORC1 assembly thereby inhibiting
ULK1-mediated autophagy induction while enhancing DAP1-mediated suppression of autophagy flux in
cardiomyocytes. Aim 3 is to define PO-induced upregulation and release of cardiac UCH-L1 with a focus on
the molecular mechanism for exosomal release of UCH-L1 into circulation in animal models and the diagnostic
and/or prognostic value of circulating exosomal UCH-L1 in VA HF patients. While a critical role of AI in driving
cognate of heat shock protein 70 (HSC70)-mediated exosomal loading of UCH-L1 and secretory carrier
membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5)-mediated exosomal release of UCH-L1 in cardiomyocytes with accumulated
UCH-L1 will be dissected, the concept that circulating exosomal UCH-L1 is a novel biomarker for evaluating
HF in VA patients will be tested. The outcome will pave the way for translational studies of targeting UCH-L1 to
treat and manage cardiac disease and HF. Thus, this proposal outcome will, in addition to establishing a
unique and independent research program relevant to the VA medical research mission, result in a
mechanistically based therapeutic approach for reducing the HF burden within the VA patient population."

10911093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are involved in a variety of biological processes that enable the
healthy development of the brain-gut axis of infants, a true understanding of how their molecular structures and
composition dictate such functions has largely remained a mystery. HMOs possess a tremendous degree of both
structural complexity and isomeric heterogeneity due to their many possible permutations of linkage positioning
and monosaccharide constituent arrangements. Therefore, improved analytical advancements are necessary to
unravel this isomerism puzzle and gain a better understanding of their infant-specific roles. Mass spectrometry
(MS) in conjunction with liquid chromatographic (LC) separations has been broadly used for HMO analyses.
Unfortunately, in many instances, LC-MS-based techniques suffer from insufficient chromatographic resolution
resulting in convoluted MS/MS spectra for co-eluting species, and thus limiting the accurate identification and
structural elucidation of HMOs. The overall goal of our research program is to develop a bioanalytical
workflow to enable more effective characterization of HMOs. To achieve this, we will implement a
multidimensional separations platform using recycling liquid chromatography coupled to high-
resolution cyclic ion mobility separations and mass spectrometry in conjunction with the development
of solution and gas-phase chemical probes and top-down sequencing approaches. Our multidimensional
separations platform will not only enable improved peak capacity, but also higher resolution separations to
facilitate the characterization of previously indistinguishable HMO isomers. Additionally, our cyclic ion mobility-
based separations will allow the determination of highly precise collision cross section values that will be
disseminated to other laboratories in the glycobiology community. Our chemical probes will facilitate the
improved identification of glycosidic linkage positioning in isomeric HMOs, especially when no authentic standard
is present. Lastly, our top-down sequencing strategies will enable the arrangement of monosaccharide
constituents to be better determined. Overall, we envision that our proposed bioanalytical toolbox will make
strides toward the de novo sequencing of HMOs and help achieve our overarching goal of unraveling the human
milk glycome to identify essential HMOs to be incorporated into infant formula."
10911184,"This proposal is a collaboration between University of Abuja, FHI 360, New York University and Saint Louis
University. Access to antiretroviral drugs has led to increased survival of people living with HIV (PLWH), who
now experience higher CVD-mortality than the general population, largely due to increased HTN burden. Global
Burden of Disease reported a 95% increase in HTN-related mortality in Nigeria from 1990 to 2015. Thus,
strategies to control HTN in PLWH are sorely needed. Physician shortage and poor access limit Nigeria’s
capacity to control HTN in primary health centers (PHCs), where most PLWH receive care. Access to care and
task-shifting of duties to nurses may mitigate these barriers. In 2011, FHI 360 initiated a USAID-funded program,
Strengthening Integrated Delivery of HIV-AIDS Services (SIDHAS), which provides universal access to HIV
services for over 190,000 PLWH in Nigeria . In a cluster RCT of 32 health centers in Ghana, we showed that a
nurse-led task-shifting strategy for HTN control (TASSH), based on the WHO CVD Risk Package, led to a 34%
greater systolic BP reduction than health insurance coverage alone (U01HL114198; PI: Ogedegbe). TASSH
includes CV risk assessment; medication titration; and patient lifestyle counseling. The existence of an effective
HIV chronic are platform (SIDHAS) and a well-proven evidence-based intervention for HTN control (TASSH)
provides a unique opportunity for implementation of TASSH as an integrated NCD-HIV model for HTN control in
PLWH. However, PHCs in Nigeria [with its weak healthcare system] lack the expertise needed to coordinate
multilevel system changes. An implementation strategy to overcome this barrier is PF via provision of external
expertise and support for addressing challenges in implementing evidence-based care. Although PF has been
widely utilized in high income countries, its role in translating EBIs into routine practice in Africa has not been
tested. FHI 360’s SIDHAS program and the 47 PHCs it supports in Akwa Ibom – [the state with the highest HIV
burden in Nigeria] - provide a viable HIV chronic care platform for implementing TASSH as an integrated model
for HTN control in PLWH. We will conduct this study in two phases using a mixed-methods design: 1) a UG3
planning phase that will use Promoting Action on Research in Health Services (PARiHS) to develop a context-
specific PF strategy to implement, and facilitate integration of TASSH into an HIV chronic care platform (SIDHAS)
for management of HTN in PLWH; and 2) a UH3 implementation phase that will use Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) to evaluate, in a stepped-wedge cluster RCT of 30 PHCs
in 960 PLWH with uncontrolled HTN, the effect of PF on levels of TASSH adoption (primary outcome); BP control
(co-primary outcome); and levels of TASSH sustainment (secondary outcome) at 18 months. We will also
examine adoption and implementation fidelity of TASSH as potential mechanisms that may explain the impact
of PF on BP control. The PF strategy comprises: (a) an advisory board that will provide leadership support for
TASSH implementation; and (b) trained nurses (practice facilitators) who will serve as coaches, provide support,
knowledge exchange and performance feedback to the nurses who will deliver TASSH at the PHCs."

Although knowledge of cancer biology in the laboratory has increased exponentially in recent years, progress in
cancer treatment in the clinic has been more gradual. To accelerate progress in the clinic, a larger group of
exceptional clinician-investigators is needed to perform patient-oriented, hypothesis-driven therapeutic
translational research. The MD Anderson (MDACC) K12 Paul Calabresi Program in Clinical Oncology has taken
advantage of an extraordinary environment for clinical and translational research to help to fill this need. MDACC
brings together 1,743 faculty and 40,000 new patients each year with a well-developed infrastructure for clinical
and laboratory research and novel ideas that are supported by 378 NCI grants. For eight decades, MDACC
investigators have made important contributions to clinical cancer research. Since the inception of the MDACC
K12 Program in 2000, 35 junior-faculty investigators have been trained in patient-based translational research
with the program's support. Of the 31 graduates, 28 (89%) remain in academia and 13 have led or contributed
to discoveries that have changed the standard of cancer care. Among the 12 scholars trained since the last
renewal, three are from under-represented minorities (URMs). During the current grant period, eleven of twelve
(91%) scholars had either earned an additional advanced degree during the program or had previously earned
an MS or PhD. Collectively, Calabresi Scholars have authored 485 peer-reviewed publications while participating
in the program and 1,844 following graduation with impact factor >5 in 28.6% and >10 in 11.6%. They have
competed successfully for $35M in grants and contracts. Over the next 5 years, faculty supported by this award
will conduct hypothesis-driven clinical trials and will have the opportunity to earn an M.S. or Ph.D. in a newly
chartered track in Clinical and Translational Science. They will participate in the monthly “Master Class” and the
annual “Calabresi K Symposium”. Their Individualized Training Plans will include didactic classes, clinical trials,
publications, grant applications, and long-range planning. Each Calabresi Scholar is guided by a clinical mentor
and a translational mentor chosen from 40 experts in clinical, laboratory, and translational research. Particular
emphasis will be placed on rigorous evaluation and recruitment of minority scholars. Our overall goal is to identify
and develop careers of leaders who are needed to move an increasing number of new drugs and strategies from
the laboratory to the clinic and to bring insights, images, data and tissue from the clinic to the laboratory,
accelerating the development of more effective, less toxic personalized therapy. Funds are requested to include
five junior faculty not only from MDACC, but also from Baylor College of Medicine and UT Health in Houston."
10912532,"Current medication options for AUD have only partial success and have a low evidence base in cirrhosis. Gut
dysbiosis, which may be initiated by alcohol, contributes to cirrhosis development. Our overarching goal is to
develop a potent therapeutic targeting the intestinal microbiota to alleviate the impact of AUD and AROD
through the gut-liver-brain axis. We base our approach on fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), originally
developed for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). We have also shown in randomized, placebo-
controlled clinical trials the benefit and safety of different FMT formulations in cirrhosis. Furthermore, in a
recent randomized trial of actively drinking AUD cirrhotic patients, we demonstrated that FMT reduced alcohol
consumption and craving, and improved cognition and psychosocial health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
versus placebo. We also found similar engraftment with capsule versus enema FMT. The FDA regulates FMT
as a drug and a biologic. Our group uses Good Manufacturing Practices to manufacture FMT products in both
liquid and freeze-dried, encapsulated formulations.
Our hypothesis is that restructuring the gut microbiota using FMT will reduce alcohol consumption
compared to placebo in patients with AUD and cirrhosis. To test this, we will conduct a Phase 1b/2a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using administration of a standardized oral
encapsulated FMT preparation (FMT) at baseline and day 30 in patients with AUD and cirrhosis.
Aim 1: Measure the effect of FMT on alcohol consumption. The primary outcome is number of abstinent days
at three months in FMT compared to placebo. We will assess daily alcohol consumption and cravings using
patient-reported measures and objective urinary and plasma markers.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of FMT on safety and liver dysfunction. We will monitor safety outcomes and liver
function throughout the trial.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of FMT on microbial compositional and function. Comparative analyses of stool
microbial composition, and serum metabolomics will be performed between and within groups. Targeted
metabolomics will be focused on neuroactive metabolites that are produced or modulated by microbiota, e.g.,
SCFA, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, indolic compounds, and bile acids.
Aim 4: Determine the impact of FMT on brain dysfunction and patient-reported outcomes using cognitive
testing and HRQOL testing. We will evaluate HRQOL and cognition using validated instruments (Sickness
Impact Profile, EncephalApp Stroop, Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score).
We will enroll 80 participants with AUD cirrhosis (randomized 1:1 to FMT versus placebo) under FDA IND. The
team has access to patients, microbial expertise, infrastructure and AUD trial experience to carry out the trial."
10912659,"Project Summary: Mechanistic understanding of emerging catalytic methodologies is an important factor
in the successful application of novel transformations to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-
value chemicals. Despite this, there is a significant lag between new reaction discovery and its
mechanistic description. This research program addresses this challenge in two important areas of
contemporary catalysis – photoredox catalysis and biocatalysis by engineered enzymes.
 Photocatalysts harness the power of visible light to generate highly reactive radical intermediates
that can be strategically channeled to participate in a variety of valuable bond-formations. There are a
variety of photophysical approaches for the detection and characterization of these open-shell
intermediates. However, experimental probes of the transition state geometry, of key bond-forming and
bond-breaking events in photoredox catalysis, are virtually non-existent. In this context, this research
program establishes 13C kinetic isotope effects as the elusive experimental probe of the transition state
geometry of photoredox reactions. In addition to shedding light on these complex reaction mechanisms,
this measurement serves as an important experimental benchmark to calibrate theoretical methods to
accurately evaluate the rate- and selectivity-determining steps in these reactions.
 Directed evolution of cytochromes P450 has led to the discovery of carbene- and nitrene-transfer
activity of these heme-containing enzymes. Mechanistic investigations of these systems have largely
been limited to theoretical studies due to the inherent challenges associated with conducting standard
physical organic experiments in enzymatic systems. This program utilizes a newly developed
intramolecular 13C kinetic isotope effect technique along with classical kH/kD experiments to gain insight
into the transition state geometry of C–C and C–N bond-forming steps in these reactions. High-level
QM/MM calculations and MD simulations are also utilized to interpret experimental findings and
understand the origin of selectivity in these biocatalytic reactions."
10912660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Key to multicellularity is the coordinated interaction of the various cells that make up the body. Indeed, patterning
of embryos, establishment of cell type diversity, and formation of tissues and organs all rely on cell-to-cell
communication. Thus, arguably one of the most important principles of biology involves “one group of cells
changing the behavior of an adjacent set of cells, causing them to change their shape, mitotic rate, or fate”.
Conventional methods of reproducing biological patterns and cell-fate in vitro suffer from multiple limitations.
Previous work on understanding pattern formation has relied on delivering global stimuli and studying reaction-
diffusion mediated patterning of cell fates in the cell culture. Another method has been to generate morphogen
gradients using signaling molecule patterned surface or optogenetics. However, all current methods produce
static patterns and give neither precise spatial nor temporal control over the cell fate.
My research group aims to overcome this critical challenge, via a unique and novel cyber-bio system, in which
microrobots direct the biological system, in a closed loop approach, to enable position-specific functionality and
reduce noise – to direct cellular fate leading to the formation of cellular structures. Inspired by “human-in-the
loop” approaches for engineering systems that must interact with complex, living individuals, we propose a
“µrobot-in-the-loop” approach in which physical signaling among cells is substituted with microrobot-controlled
inputs to afford excellent spatiotemporal precision and feedback control in directing cell behavior.
Our efforts in the next five years would focus on designing and fabricating microrobots along with developing
control algorithms for automated actuation of the microrobots. We will use these microrobots to deliver
morphogens at precise positions in a cellular system which would alter cell fate at those positions only. We
would also use this technology for controlling the formation of multilayer cellular structures. We would extend
this to three dimensional tissues by interfacing microrobots with organoids.
The proposed work is important because it would demonstrate how individual cells in a tissue volume can be
spatially and temporally targeted for manipulation. This methodology applies more dynamic control over
differentiation factors, which allows for increased understanding of complicated cell fate and differentiation
events during cancer, development, or fibrosis as just a few of many applications."
10912544,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Potentially inappropriate prescribing includes the use of medications that may no longer be necessary or that
may increase the risk of harm. Inappropriate prescribing is a “morbidity multiplier,” increasing overall symptom
burden, and adversely affecting health-related quality of life and function. Inappropriate prescribing of certain
drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, highly anticholinergic agents, and certain oral
hypoglycemic medications poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more prevalent among those with
Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of
multimorbidity and associated polypharmacy. The Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers
to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease Study (D-PRESCRIBE-
AD) will test a health plan-based intervention leveraging the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research
Network, which uses the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel Initiative infrastructure. The overarching
goal of our proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate the effect of a patient/caregiver-centered,
multifaceted educational intervention on inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. Our research
hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can
reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and lead to an improvement in medication
safety for this vulnerable population. Our study population will include community-dwelling patients with
AD/ADRD, identified based on a diagnosis of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer’s Disease, who
have evidence of inappropriate prescribing. We will evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed to
stimulate patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication safety (versus usual care) on the
proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the primary outcome of this study. The trial will be health
plan-based, conducted in two large, national health plans. The study design will be a prospective, cluster
randomized, comparative effectiveness intervention trial with three arms: (1) a combined patient/caregiver and
provider educational intervention; (2) a provider only educational intervention; and (3) usual care. A one-year
R61 planning phase will precede a four-year R33 implementation phase. During the R33 phase we will
sequentially implement two separate pragmatic trials, each enrolling over 11,000 patients, adapting the second
trial based on the findings and experience gained in the first. The R33 aims are: (1) to assess the impact of the
patient/caregiver educational intervention on inappropriate prescribing to AD/ADRD patients, employing a
prospective, cluster randomized trial design with three arms; and (2) to create a plan for disseminating study
findings to stakeholders who might implement the intervention or make decisions about its future use. The
proposed study is feasible because our partners include two large, national health plans, we will leverage an
existing FDA Sentinel infrastructure, and we have a strong, multidisciplinary research team."
10912545,"ABSTRACT
Machine learning has the potential to transform pathologic diagnosis and to address very limited accessibility of
expert pathology in low-income countries. Routine histology images of solid tumors contain an immense number
of visual features that can be extracted and processed by artificial intelligence tools like machine learning, which
excels at basic image analysis tasks such as tumor detection. In addition, machine learning can also predict
clinically relevant features directly from histology images including microsatellite instability and immune features
that independently predict prognosis response to therapy. This large, multicultural, racially and ethnically diverse
study uses images of whole slides from routinely collected clinical specimens and applies computational
pathology methods and digital spatial expression profiling to quantifiably improve CRC diagnosis, prognosis and
predictive models together with clinical, epidemiologic and genetic data. The study goals will be accomplished
through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will apply novel machine learning algorithms from whole slide images
to reproducibly identify MSI, histopathologic and immune features of colorectal cancer in racially/ethnically
diverse populations. We will study H&E slides from 6,751 CRC cases, digitizing existing slides from 5,551 CRC
cases and 1,200 new cases of CRC with contemporaneous clinical and epidemiologic data. Then, we will apply
deep learning methods to accurately identify histopathologic features and immune characteristics of CRC. We
will use a robust training validation, and testing design (70%/15%/15%) to ensure the rigor and reproducibility of
our findings. In Aim 2, we will test whether machine learning algorithms that predict MSI and immune features
related to CRC prognosis improve with the addition of clinical, epidemiologic, and germline genetic data. We will
use machine learning statistical methods to test whether algorithms developed in Aim 1 improve prediction of
overall survival and response to therapy with the addition of supplemental information beyond whole slide digital
images. Finally, in Aim 3, we will compare the information derived from digital spatial profiling of expressed
proteins in colorectal tumors with the information derived from Immunoscore quantification of lymphocyte
populations at the tumor center (CT) and the invasive margin (IM), and explore whether these measures improve
the models developed in Aims 1 and 2 in a subset of samples. We will perform GeoMx digital spatial profiling of
56 proteins expressed in 150 Stage I-III TNM colorectal cancers to compare the performance of digital spatial
profiling to Immunoscore, a scoring system relying exclusively on expression patterns of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells.
This study takes advantage of pathologic, epidemiologic, clinical, immunologic and germline genetic data from
racially/ethnically diverse CRC patients from California, Detroit, New York, Florida, Puerto Rico, Israel and Spain.
Our overarching goal is to improve the efficient diagnosis of colorectal cancer with clinically impactful immune
profiles."
10912684,"There is a quality chasm between the care Gulf War Veterans (GWVs) should receive and the care they do
receive. Our data show 70% of GWVs with Gulf War Illness (GWI) do not receive treatment recommendations
for their GWI and 78% are NOT very satisfied with their care. Reducing this quality chasm is essential. The VA
and DoD have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop new treatments, including the second largest
clinical trial for GWVs which is finding health coaching and problem-solving treatment both reduce the disability
of GWI. Without effective models of healthcare to implement these treatments, GWVs will not benefit. In the
current model of care, GWVs receive care locally through VA’s primary care patient aligned care teams
(PACTs). The VA War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) supports the current model of care by
increasing local knowledge of the skills and treatments needed to manage GWI through national education
efforts and electronic consultation (e-consultation) on difficult cases. The WRIISC and other stakeholders are
currently questioning whether improving local knowledge of skills and treatments for GWI is enough to address
the quality chasm, or if GWI is too complex to be treated in primary care without additional support from
specialists in GWI. A potentially useful model of care for GWI is collaborative specialty care where specialists
work with PACTs to synergistically treat patients. The local PACT is the lead of the team with the specialist
providing some direct care to the patient (through tele-health) and also consulting with the PACT about other
aspects of care. Collaborative specialty care is effective for other complex conditions (e.g., depression) with
over 40 studies documenting its efficacy. The goal of this proposal is to conduct a hybrid type 1 randomized
effectiveness/implementation trial for GWVs with GWI (n=220). Our primary aim is to determine the
effectiveness of tele-CSC as compared to e-consultation. In tele-CSC, our specialty provider team will deliver
health coaching and problem-solving treatment to GWVs and recommend the PACT make monthly
optimization of analgesics. In e-consultation the specialty provider team will make a onetime recommendation
to the PACT that the GWV locally receive health coaching and problem-solving treatment and analgesic
optimization. Our secondary aim is to understand implementation outcomes. This information will be used to
guide a future randomized (by VISN) multi-site implementation study. Throughout, an advisory committee of
operations partners will be convened to ensure that the results of the study are able to directly and immediately
improve care. Determining the best model of care to translate research into practice for GWVs with GWI is a
key goal of the VA Gulf War Strategic Plan and a specific aim of this Request for Applications."
10912686,"Project Summary
Every winter, seasonal influenza infects over 10,000,000 US children, hospitalizes 50,000, and kills 300‐500.
Black children are 2‐3 times more likely to get sick, be hospitalized, and die than children of other races and
ethnicities. These disparities are associated with influenza vaccination disparities, which are in turn associated
with historical exploitation, access to care, health illiteracy, and vaccine hesitancy. The long‐term objective of
the candidate, Joshua T.B. Williams, MD, is to reduce vaccination disparities by partnering with minority
stakeholders to co‐create interventions that improve vaccination equity in pragmatic trials. This objective will
further the mission of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development to ensure all children have an
equitable chance to grow and fulfill their potential free from diseases. Dr. Williams is well‐suited for this work
as a general pediatrician with prior health services research training who has received 4 competitive grants
and first‐authored 15 papers on vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine‐preventable diseases since 2019.
 To achieve this objective, Dr. Williams will pursue formal coursework, mentored experiential training,
and directed learning in three specific areas: (1) health disparities and disparities research, (2) community
engagement, and (3) implementation science, including the design and conduct of pragmatic trials. To support
him, Dr. Williams has identified a primary mentor with national expertise in vaccine hesitancy, intervention
design, and pragmatic vaccination trials (Dr. Sean T. O'Leary). He has assembled a team of three co‐mentors
with expertise in health disparities (Dr. Romana Hasnain‐Wynia), community engagement (Dr. Donald
Nease), and implementation science (Dr. Amy Huebschmann). Moreover, he has an established partnership
with the Center for African American Health (Ms. Deidre Johnson) and support from 6 other distinguished
experts. Dr. Williams proposes 3 sequential projects that build upon his training goals and prior work, which
uncovered a stakeholder recommendation to improve vaccination confidence through personal stories.
 Digital stories are personal narratives that synthesize images, video, voice, or text to create compelling
accounts of human experience. In pilot pragmatic trials, digital stories have improved hypertension control in
Black adults and increased self‐report of Human Papillomavirus vaccination in Korean women. The 3 specific
aims of this proposal are to (1) explore diverse stakeholders' perceptions of and priorities for a digital
storytelling intervention through qualitative interviews, (2) co‐create a digital storytelling pediatric influenza
vaccination intervention through novel community‐engaged methods, and (3) assess the feasibility,
acceptability, appropriateness, and pilot effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic trial involving 200
Black parent‐child dyads in two safety‐net clinics in Denver, CO. The outstanding research environment at the
University of Colorado and Dr. Williams' expert mentorship team will ensure his success, enhance his training,
and advance our understanding of engagement methods and interventions to promote health equity."
10912467,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication regimen to reduce HIV transmission risk among HIV negative
individuals, has utility in helping to reach national HIV prevention goals. However, clinical side effects,
particularly those impacting gastrointestinal (GI) (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite), hepatic and renal injury
outcomes may inhibit PrEP persistence. Importantly, alcohol use which is frequent in PrEP users may interact
with PrEP and exacerbate PrEP-associated adverse GI effects and consequently affect PrEP persistence.
Recent data implicates that these side effects are likely associated with changes in the gut microbiome
(dysbiosis). Despite the important ramifications that PrEP, alcohol, and their combined use may have on the
gut dysbiosis and subsequent PrEP continuance, there is little research to elucidate this interaction and few
attempts to address it. Moreover, there is little research exploring decision-making processes regarding alcohol
and PrEP utilization and adherence among PrEP users. To address these gaps in research, this study will
employ the following aims. Aim 1: Qualitatively explore mechanisms by which alcohol use impacts
movement through the PrEP continuum and understand how an early intervention and treatment
approach impacts alcohol use and PrEP adherence. Aim 2: Investigate the effectiveness of the SBIRT
intervention in preventing hazardous alcohol use and its impact on gut dysbiosis in PrEP users. Within
this longitudinal cohort study, we will identify alcohol impacted participants, with patterns of use
ranging from episodic to long-term (engaging in risky or hazardous use). Aim 3: To determine
alterations in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis), intestinal homeostasis, systemic inflammation, and
markers of liver disease associated with hazardous alcohol use among PrEP users. Recruiting from local
PrEP clinics, we will determine alterations in the gut microbiome, intestinal homeostasis, systemic inflammation
and markers of liver disease associated with alcohol and PrEP use. We will also execute a randomized control
trial among PrEP users demonstrating heightened alcohol use to test the effectiveness of the Screening, Brief
Intervention, & Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention to reduce alcohol use and examine subsequent
impact on the gut microbiome compared to individuals receiving treatment as usual and PrEP users not
demonstrating elevated alcohol use. Finally, we will employ qualitative methods (in-depth interviews) and
analysis to understand decision-making factors influencing PrEP adherence and alcohol use over time. Priority
populations, including those engaging in alcohol use, need to increase engagement in the PrEP Care
Continuum to optimize HIV prevention. Clinical research has yet to focus on interactions between PrEP,
alcohol use and GI adverse events. This study may have important implications for mitigating a salient
challenge to PrEP adherence and persistence (side-effects) and elucidating, from clinical and public
health standpoints, factors promoting maintenance in the PrEP care continuum."
10912574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a critical process within the solid tumor microenvironment. Cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the primary producers of matrix proteins and remodeling enzymes that cross-
link and degrade matrix proteins. CAFs are enigmatic in that they can promote or impede tumor growth,
suggesting heterogeneity that is not completely understood. How CAF heterogeneity evolves over tumor
progression and how this evolution impacts ECM remodeling within solid tumors remain an outstanding question
in cancer biology. Recent studies have focused on CAF function in models of adult cancer, but little attention
has been directed toward understanding CAF heterogeneity and ECM remodeling in childhood cancers, which
are etiologically different diseases.
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer of neuroendocrine cells that accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer
deaths. The 5-year overall survival rate for high-risk NB remains at 50%, highlighting the need for a deeper
understanding of the molecular and immunological mechanisms driving tumorigenesis in this subset of patients.
Like other solid tumors, the NB tumor microenvironment includes malignant cells, CAFs, and immune cells. Our
laboratory studies NB using a penetrant, spontaneous model of high-risk NB (TH-MYCN, AlkF1178L/+) in
immunocompetent mice, allowing in vivo investigation of the tumor immune microenvironment from
tumorigenesis to progressive disease. Using this model, we previously demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic role of
macrophages and CD4+ T cells by showing that their depletion significantly reduced the formation of tumors and
extended survival.
My preliminary experiments utilizing 10X Chromium gene expression analysis of stromal cells from nascent and
mature tumors identified two distinct subsets of CAFs characterized by alpha smooth muscle actin (Acta2) and
Wilms tumor 1 (Wt1) expression. Interestingly, only Wt1 CAFs expressed chemokines and cytokines involved in
recruitment of myeloid and T cells. Wt1 CAFs were enriched in the early tumor microenvironment and expressed
genes encoding ADAMTS enzymes involved in degradation of the proteoglycan versican. Our preliminary
findings indicate that Wt1 CAFs may be a crucial early recruiter of pro-tumorigenic immune cells in our model of
neuroblastoma. The studies proposed will assess how CAF heterogeneity affects ECM remodeling over
neuroblastoma progression, examine tumor-CAF and CAF-immune signaling, and test the effect of perturbing
ECM deposition and degradation on tumor formation and progression. Together, these studies will generate new
and exciting information about the tumor microenvironment and potential vulnerabilities to exploit in pediatric
solid tumors."
10912485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many diseases of excess, abnormal, or insufficient angiogenesis such as peripheral artery disease, neovascular
age-related macular degeneration, solid tumors, peripheral artery disease, and heart failure exhibit sexual
dimorphism with respect to risk factors, incidence, and optimal interventions. Despite widespread
acknowledgement of these disparities, the molecular mechanisms that promote sex differences in vascular
conditions are understudied. Studies from our lab established that human IgG1 (and the murine equivalents
IgG2a/c) possess intrinsic anti-angiogenic activity which occurs independently of antigen binding. Instead, this
activity is due to recognition of the Fc domain of IgG1 by the high-affinity activating receptor FcγRI in
macrophages. We term this activity “antibody-dependent cell-mediated angioinhibition” (ADCAI). These findings
suggest that ADCAI is an evolutionarily conserved, fundamental process that affects vascular remodeling in
multiple tissue beds and physiologic states. Prompted by the NIH's Guidelines on Sex as a Biological Variable,
we recently made several striking observations suggesting that female animals and female-derived cells exhibit
markedly reduced ADCAI compared to males. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that sex disparities
in vascular remodeling may arise from differences in ADCAI responses. However, the mechanisms responsible
for ADCAI sex differences, and whether ADCAI disparities are conserved in humans are unknown. Here, I
propose to further investigate the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in ADCAI. Specifically, I will
determine the role of the gene DDX3Y, which was identified as a potential mediator of ADCAI in an unbiased
screen of Y chromosome encoded genes (Aim 1). I will also investigate the affects that gonadectomies have on
ADCAI (Aim 2). In addition, I will test whether ADCAI sex differences are conserved in human macrophages and
humanized Fc receptor mice (Aim 3). My central hypothesis is that sexual dimorphism of ADCAI is a conserved
process that is potentiated by expression of DDX3Y in macrophages. This project will shed new light on the
contrasts between the angiogenesis regulation between sexes, revealing new pathways and targets to modulate
angiogenesis in a more personalized manner to improve therapeutic outcomes."
10912488,"ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is a group of diseases, second leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide, characterized by
the chronic degeneration of RGC axons and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which results in
visual field defects and vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the best-well known factor contributing
to the onset and progression of glaucoma. There are not therapeutic treatments to offer neuroprotection in
glaucoma. Current glaucoma therapies are directed at lowering IOP, but cannot rescue RGCs. A better
understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms triggering RGC death and axonal degeneration in glaucoma
is essential for the development of neuroprotective treatments.
Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative process, which plays a central role in cellular homeostasis by eliminating
damage organelles and proteins. In addition to having a key role on maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis,
autophagy is regarded as a survival pathway, involved in stress-induced adaptation. Dysfunction of the
autophagy pathway has been associated to a growing number of human diseases, in particular age-related
diseases, as well as to several neurodegenerative disorders. Paradoxically, in the neural tissue, autophagy plays
an important role in neuroprotection as well as neuronal injury and death depending on the circumstances.
Although not extensively, autophagy within a context of glaucoma, has been investigated by independent
laboratories using different experimental models. While all of the studies agree that autophagy is activated in
RGC in response to injury or elevated IOP, there is no consensus on whether autophagy promotes survival or
triggers cell death. Latest studies seem to suggest that a protective or pro-death role of autophagy depend on
the initial injury (i.e traumatic insult vs IOP elevation). Moreover, autophagy seems to have a different role in
RGC death and axonal degeneration.
The purpose of this grant application is to investigate the independent contribution of autophagy to apoptotic
RGC death and axonal degeneration in acute injury and chronic hypertensive experimental models of glaucoma.
For this, we will use unique tools generated in our laboratory, including our unique DBA/2J transgenic mouse
glaucoma models with upregulated and deficient basal autophagy. We anticipate that completion of this project
will contribute to a further understanding of the role of autophagy in neurodegeneration in glaucoma. Most
importantly, our studies have the potential of identifying a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ocular
hypertension and glaucoma."
10912590,"Project Summary
 Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) have the unique ability to generate new hair follicles throughout the lifetime
of an organism. When the growth of a new hair follicle occurs, HFSCs are activated; they proliferate to fuel the
production of a new follicle and quickly return to quiescence. While the means by which this transition between
quiescence and activation is regulated remain elusive, identification of these processes is critical, because
abnormal HFSC activation has implications in hair loss, aging, and cancer.
 Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) 1 and 2 are chromatin transcriptional regulators that are essential
for maintaining stem cell identity. By performing loss-of-function studies, we showed that loss of PRC1 in
HFSCs results in premature activation of HFSCs and the induction of hair growth, whereas loss of PRC2 leads
to a prolonged HFSC quiescence and delayed hair growth. These data show the critical and opposing roles of
Polycomb complexes in regulation of HFSC quiescence. This is an intriguing observation because PRC1 and
PRC2 are thought to act together, and, in most systems, the loss of either PRC1 or PRC2 results in identical
phenotypes. We hypothesize that PRC1 and PRC2 maintain the delicate balance of quiescence and activation,
but their mechanism of action is different than what was previously reported.
 In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PRC2 fine-tunes HFSC quiescence. By
performing RNA-seq, we identified that Wnt inhibitors Notum and Sfrp2, and BMP receptor Bmpr1b are
upregulated in the PRC2-null HFSC. Because Wnt inhibition and Bmp activation are known to promote HFSC
quiescence, we hypothesize that expression of these genes leads to delayed HFSC activation. Here, we will
analyze whether expression of Notum, Sfrp2, and/or Bmpr1b promotes HFSC quiescence and recapitulates
the PRC2-null phenotype. In Aim 2, we will examine cooperation between repressive PRC1 and PRC2
functions in control of HFSCs. Our recent studies showed that PRC1 and PRC2 have additive gene-repressive
roles and that only loss of both leads to complete de-repression of PRC1/2 target genes. Here, we will ablate
repressive functions of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes in HFSCs, analyze the phenotype, and determine
molecular mechanisms of PRC1/2 control of HFSCs. In Aim 3, we will examine noncanonical gene-activating
roles of PRC1 in promoting HFSC quiescence. Because loss of PRC1 and PRC2 show opposing phenotypes,
respectively, we hypothesize that PRC1 functions independently of PRC2 to promote the expression of genes
that influence HFSC quiescence. Here, we will identify genes that are under the control of PRC1 in HFSCs by
performing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies and test whether downregulation of said genes results in
precocious HFSC activation. The completion of these studies will define how Polycomb-mediated gene
regulation fine-tunes the delicate balance between quiescence and activation in HFSCs."

10912595,"Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is managed primarily with topical medical therapy, with laser and surgical
interventions reserved for those in whom medical therapy is ineffective, intolerable, or inappropriate. The
effectiveness of medical therapy is limited by patient adherence with therapy; inadequate adherence has been
extensively documented. Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has comparable efficacy to preferred first-line
prostaglandin analogues, is very safe, and obviates the need for daily medical therapy in most patients when
applied as primary therapy. A recent randomized trial demonstrated superior glaucoma outcomes (less
progression, fewer surgeries required) in newly diagnosed OAG patients receiving primary SLT vs. medical
therapy, providing the evidentiary basis for a paradigm shift that is already underway in which SLT supplants
medical therapy as the preferred first-line treatment for OAG. SLT is largely performed as first described by its
inventor; little exploration of dose-response has been undertaken. An intriguing data set from Italy (with
significant weaknesses and limitations) suggests that low energy SLT repeated annually is far more effective
than standard SLT repeated as needed when its effect wanes, in delaying or preventing the need for topical
medical therapy. This finding is consistent with the limited data exploring the dose-response relationship
between SLT and intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Further, it is biologically plausible that ongoing health
maintenance of trabecular meshwork (TM) function with proactive annual low energy SLT would better
preserve the TM's long-term health and function than a repeated cycle of SLT, progressive TM re-impairment
by the glaucoma process, loss of IOP control, and repeat SLT. Our proposal describes a multi-center clinical
trial to answer two key questions: 1) Is primary low energy SLT as effective as primary standard energy SLT in
newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with mild-moderate OAH or high-risk ocular hypertension?; and
2) Does annual low energy repeat SLT more effectively delay or prevent the need for medical therapy
compared to standard SLT repeated as needed when its effect wanes and IOP rises? Participants will be
randomized to initial standard SLT or initial low energy SLT with the possibility of a single repeat SLT as
needed in the first year of the study. The first primary outcome will be 12-month survival where failure
represents the need for repeat SLT to achieve/maintain protocol-specified target IOP. At Month 12, all
participants who remain medication-free will be re-randomized to undergo repeat SLT either as needed when
IOP exceeds target IOP (at initially randomized energy) or to annual low energy SLT irrespective of IOP. The
second primary outcome will be 42-month medication-free survival in subjects who were medication-free at
Month 12. Our study seeks to clarify the optimal way to utilize SLT with the ultimate goal of maximizing long-
term SLT responsiveness and medication-free survival. If successful, our results will shape the course of
treatment for most newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with mild-moderate OAG or high-risk OHT."
10913406,"Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) will combine their world-renowned expertise and exceptional resources to lead the PREVENTABLE trial. This trial will determine the role of a moderate-intensity statin in preventing dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias, and prolonging disability-free survival in patients 75 years and older without clinically evident coronary heart disease, including those with frailty, impaired physical function, mild cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and multi-morbidity. This collaboration joins together the DCRI, the world’s largest academic research organization and a leader in the conduct of multi-site clinical trials with WFSM, and its recognized expertise in clinical trial design, conduct, analysis, and cognitive and disability assessment for trials involving large populations of at-risk older adults. The PREVENTABLE team will leverage established and overlapping partnerships with PCORnet, Boston VA Research Institute (BVARI), NIA, NHLBI, and NINDS to facilitate this large, pragmatic, multicenter trial. The team has a long history of pioneering innovation in trials. Duke developed the first electronic medical record in 1968 and more recently the DCRI has led efforts to streamline clinical trials through 1) large-scale integration of electronic health records for clinical trials (NIH HCS Collaboratory and PCORnet); 2) electronic consents (ADAPTABLE); and 3) monitoring and collecting patient data to define health and discover biomarkers. WFSM has internationally acclaimed innovative expertise in the integration and analysis of cognitive and physical function outcomes important to older adults and an aging society, having demonstrated this expertise in trials such as SPRINT, ACCORD, LIFE, LookAHEAD, and GEM. DCRI and WFSM will partner in a traditional split of Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) activities and Data Coordinating Center (DCC) activities. Each coordinating center will be responsible for their respective components within each core. AIM 1: Provide the internal administrative structure to support study leadership in conducting the PREVENTABLE trial as well as identifying and responding to risks and barriers. AIM 2: Ensure successful communication and financial management throughout the trial’s life cycle staying within budget and on schedule for key trial milestones.

Our DCC experience will help ensure success in the implementation of PREVENTABLE by overseeing all data related aspects of the trial. We have a single specific aim: to provide project coordination, administration, data management, and biostatistical support for PREVENTABLE. We will accomplish this by facilitating and guiding the protocol development process, by providing scientifically sound study design, excellent operational and analytical methodology, a dedicated focus on recruitment, high quality follow-up and fidelity to the intervention, monitoring safety and working with the DSMB to ensure participant safety and careful study management, working with the CCC to monitor the clinical sites, and by leading development and maintenance of the protocols, manual of procedures, statistical analysis plan (SAP), forms, and other study documents. We have several strengths: (1) a team whose members are experts in the coordination of multi-center trials, (2) experience with cardiovascular disease (CVD) trials (SPRINT, ACCORD, and Look AHEAD) and trials involving cognitive and physical outcomes in large populations of at-risk older adults (SPRINT, ACCORD, Look AHEAD, LIFE, and GEM), (3) experience with blinded intervention trials in lipid management (ACCORD), (4) success working in pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) infrastructure (ADAPTABLE), (5) successful previous collaborations with the VA central pharmacy for drug distribution, (6) established security plan and web-based trial management system proven in many RCTs, (7) specific project management expertise, and (8) a history of efficient and effective communication with field centers, the executive committee, and the project office. Both WFSM and DCRI have long histories serving as DCCs. WFSM coordinated ACCORD, which was the first large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) coordinated primarily over the web. Duke and DCRI are leaders in PCTs, currently serving as the DCC for PCORnet which centrally collects electronic health record (EHR) data via an established common data model (CDM) from 35 partner networks. Expertise within the DCC will be further enhanced via collaboration with the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), which will support the identification and recruitment of participants from the Veterans Affairs (VA) system and the integration of EHR data from the VA."

Recruitment into clinical trials is challenging and enrolling older adults can be particularly difficult. Participants must also include large numbers of women, racial and ethnic minorities, very old adults, and people with frailty, limited mobility, cognitive impairment (including Alzheimer’s disease) and comorbidities. Unique barriers to recruiting and retaining older adults include lack of perceived benefits and relevance of study, unfamiliarity with research, difficulty understanding and reading the consent, burdensome study visits, transportation to study visits, refusal by family members who share in decision making, and a perceived burden on clinical teams involved in recruitment. If not addressed, these will result in a study that is underpowered, not generalizable, or longer and more expensive than anticipated. Clinicians’ enthusiasm for referring patients to and endorsing primary prevention studies will also be critical. The Recruitment and Retention Core will be under the leadership of Dr. Consuelo Wilkins of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Schuyler Jones of DCRI.

This comprehensive approach, involving all stages of the study — design, planning, protocol development, start-up, Vanguard, implementation, and dissemination — will facilitate development of a high quality, feasible protocol, minimize challenges, and optimize recruitment and retention. We will partner with the Trial Innovation Network and leverage the competency of our team with participant-centered approaches that recognize the varying needs and preferences of older adults and authentic engagement of patients, community groups and clinicians to ensure maximal retention into the study. AIM 1: Catalyze enrollment of older adults including women, racial and ethnic minorities, mild cognitively impaired persons (including those with Alzheimer’s disease), frail, and very old individuals. AIM 2: Integrate stakeholder input into the study protocol, recruitment and retention strategies, and feedback on the participant experience. AIM 3: Engage primary care clinicians to understand barriers to randomization and minimize burden and ensure value to clinical staff. AIM 4: Implement, study, and iterate a variety of strategies to enhance recruitment and retention."
10913413,"The Biorepository Core will manage collection, processing and storage of biospecimens from 17,000 PREVENTABLE participants using state-of-the-art biobanking operations in the Mayo Clinic Biorepository. Biospecimens provide a number of important operational and scientific opportunities to determine the role of a moderate-intensity statin in preventing dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) and prolonging disability-free survival in patients 75 years and older without clinically evident coronary heart disease, including those with frailty, impaired physical function, mild cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and multi-morbidity. These include confirming treatment efficacy and/or participant compliance with therapy (e.g., expected levels of lipid lowering with statins) and defining subgroups that preferentially benefit, furthering the construct of precision medicine. The collection of biospecimens is also an opportunity for discovery science that may provide insights into disease mechanisms, identify new treatment targets, elucidate mechanistic intersections between diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease [CVD] and dementia). The Biorepository Core will be under the leadership of Drs. Mine Cicek at Mayo and L. Kristin Newby at DCRI. The Mayo Clinic manages hundreds of active biorepositories, is the central biorepository for the NIH All of Us Research Program, and is uniquely positioned to function as the PREVENTABLE Biorepository. We will assemble a team of experts in aging, geroscience, dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease), frailty, and CVD biomarkers to support proposal development for studies using banked biospecimens as well. The Biorepository team will leverage collective experience to coordinate the collection, processing, storage, retrieval for use in ancillary studies, and eventual transfer of the biospecimen library to BioLINCC. AIM 1. Collect, process, transfer, and store 17,000 baseline samples in randomized participants, implement biorepository policies and procedures, maintain effective communications with trial leadership, facilitate transfer of biospecimens to BioLINCC at study close, and apply continuous quality control to ensure the integrity of the biospecimens for future studies. AIM 2. Support protocol-specified laboratory testing. Study drug adherence and physiologic effect will be assessed by changes in lipid levels. AIM 3. Collaborate in planning future biomarker studies to identify important markers of cardiovascular risk, cognitive decline, healthy aging, and frailty."
10938069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: I am an Assistant Professor within the Department of Neurology at the Medical University of South
Carolina in Charleston, SC. My career goal is to become an independent investigator within the field of
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research, with a focus on translational work aimed at improving clinical care. Currently,
my main research interest is on the validity and diagnostic impact of blood plasma based biomarkers including
tau phosphorylated threonine 181 (p-tau181), which has strong potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and
disease monitoring in AD. Over the past five years, I have not been engaged in paid research activities due to a
combination of circumstances including relocation to accommodate a spouse, child-rearing responsibilities, and
pursuing non-research activities to facilitate earlier repayment of debt accrued during doctoral training. This re-
entry supplement would facilitate a return to research activities; during the proposed funding period between
August 2024 and July 2026, I would contribute to multiple peer-reviewed publications as first author, attend
relevant scientific conferences, and complete additional training in relevant fields.
Mentoring Team: My primary mentor will be Andreana Benitez, PhD, the Principal Investigator on the parent
grant (2R01AG054159). The proposed supplement would not change the scope or activities of this grant. This
is a longitudinal study examining the role of early changes in white matter microstructure in the context of
preclinical AD. My interest allows for a partnership to examine the role of blood-based biomarkers in white matter
within this sample. The parent grant also includes co-investigators within the Center for Biomedical Imaging (Drs.
Jensen, Falangola, Brown, and Moss) and biostatistics (Dr. Nietert). This team will assist with professional
development during the two-year supplement period and prepare for a career development award (K23).
Research Strategy: Blood-based biomarkers such as plasma p-tau181 have emerged as an attractive and
scalable model for early detection and disease monitoring in AD. However, further understanding of how this
biomarker reflects AD processes is necessary, especially its relationship to white matter microstructural changes
that occur in preclinical AD. This research supplement will leverage the data being collected by the parent grant
to examine the role of plasma p-tau181 in preclinical AD through the following specific aims: 1) Examine the
relationship between plasma p-tau181 and amyloid plaque burden in preclinical AD; 2) Analyze relationships
between plasma p-tau181 and early changes in white matter diffusion restriction in preclinical AD using advanced
MRI techniques; 3) Examine relationships between plasma p-tau181 and concurrent indices of cognitive
functioning in preclinical AD; and 4) Determine the prognostic and longitudinal relationships between plasma p-
tau181 and white matter microstructure and cognitive decline along the AD clinical continuum. These findings will
advance the understanding of blood-based biomarkers in preclinical AD."

The goal of the parent project is to understand how social isolation and loneliness affect caregiver burden,
understand the momentary role of loneliness in physical health outcomes, and identify temporal targets for
intervention based on momentary loneliness in ADRD spousal caregivers. We will examine how vagally
mediated HRV impacts mental and physical wellbeing in ADRD spousal caregivers as an exploratory aim.
Three Hundred ADRD spousal caregivers will complete assessments on attachment, quality of life, caregiver
burden, grief symptoms, and participate in a blood draw to evaluate inflammation and indices of cellular aging
(i.e., mitochondrial and glycolytic function). These caregivers will also complete momentary assessments of
depressive affect, loneliness, and social isolation, and we will continually measure vagally mediated HRV over
two weeks.
The present study aims to provide biobehavioral evidence in support of the minority stress model with respect
to Latino ADRD spousal caregivers. Aging Latino adults are at increased risk for inflammatory disease,
including type 2 diabetes mellitus and ADRD. Chronic stress underlies one mechanism contributing to this
increased risk. For example, those caregiving for a spouse with ADRD and experiencing stress from ongoing
discrimination may be at increased risk for inflammatory disease. To our knowledge, no studies examine the
specific association between compounding caregiving and discriminatory stress and risk for inflammatory
disease. We predict that Latino ADRD spousal caregivers will report increased caregiver burden and display
increased risk for inflammatory disease (proinflammatory cytokine production). We also predict that these
associations will be explained by discriminatory stress. Investigating the role of discrimination may help future
researchers develop interventions that may reduce disease burden in Latino ADRD caregivers."
10937680,"Project Summary/Abstract
The current opioid epidemic is a major health crisis that has contributed to decreased life expectancy in the U.S.
A main cause of morbidly and mortality is opioid reuse and relapse in chronic cases. Understanding the
neurocognitive mechanisms and factors underlying reuse vulnerability is thus a pressing need. Leveraging a
novel combination of neurocognitive tools and a multi-session longitudinal design, our recent work in opioid use
disorder (OUD) has begun to delineate a precise decision making mechanism for opioid reuse by showing that
treatment-engaged patients are at higher risk for reuse when they exhibit increased tolerance of unknown
probabilistic outcomes (ambiguity tolerance) in a financial choice task (Konova et al., 2019 JAMA Psychiatry).
But why patients become more tolerant of ambiguous uncertainty in periods preceding reuse remains unknown.
One potential explanation consistent with decision theory is that, in these periods, they become overoptimistic
about ambiguous outcomes, which leads them to overestimate the probability of good outcomes (or
underestimate bad outcomes) when faced with a decision to reuse, and therefore more likely to do so. Here, we
propose a multi-level, convergent test of this framework by using well-defined, quantitative measures of this
presumed “optimism bias”, alongside quantitative measures of uncertainty tolerance, which we propose to collect
with concurrent high-resolution fMRI recordings, and yoked to longitudinal clinical assessments. In Aim 1, we
aim to establish the relationship between uncertainty tolerance and optimism bias in patients with OUD and
matched controls by studying these behaviors across a set of choice and estimation tasks (the latter designed
to capture optimism about simple financial and more complex outcomes, tapping into drug-choice-relevant
domains such as health outcomes). We also examine for potential moderation by various psychopathological
dimensions in a large, unselected population of online (MTurk) subjects. In Aim 2, we collect fMRI data during
the same choice and estimation tasks to delineate the mechanism by which optimistic neural representations of
uncertainty might drive behavioral tolerance of this uncertainty, and reuse, in OUD. In Aim 3, we use a multi-
session longitudinal design to understand the interaction between optimism bias and uncertainty tolerance as
they relate to opioid reuse, session-to-session, allowing us to elucidate the specific timescale and nature of this
interaction. With this project we aim to provide an answer to why patients become more uncertainty tolerant in
periods preceding reuse and, in doing so, hope to uncover an upstream mechanism (centered on optimism bias)
of this vulnerability, including its neural implementation. In addition to this conceptual advance, this work will
provide a novel set of cognitive tools to precisely and objectively measure these processes with potential to
predict poor outcomes such as reuse, in a way that can be easily implemented in clinical settings. Finally, the
findings from this work will inform novel therapeutic interventions by providing precise neurocognitive targets, as
well as their ideal timing, with the goal of mitigating reuse risk and improving long-term patient outcome."

Aging is the primary risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. Cerebrovascular dysfunction (i.e., reduced cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral blood flow) is
a key mechanism contributing to the increase in risk with aging and is largely mediated by decreases in the
vasodilatory molecule nitric oxide (NO), leading to impaired cerebrovascular dilation. Excessive reactive
oxygen species production by mitochondria (mtROS) is a major contributor to cerebrovascular dysfunction
as mtROS can reduce bioavailable NO and impair cerebral endothelial cell (EC) function. Because the aging
population and prevalence of MCI and dementias are projected to increase in coming years, establishing novel
strategies to decrease mtROS to improve cognitive and cerebrovascular function in older adults is an
important biomedical research goal to reduce the risk of MCI, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.
MitoQ is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant biochemically modified to accumulate in the inner mitochondrial
membrane where it is optimally positioned to reduce mtROS. We reported in an NIA R21-funded pilot clinical
trial that 6 weeks of MitoQ treatment in older adults improves peripheral vascular endothelial function
(brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) by reducing mtROS-related suppression of endothelial function.
We also found that MitoQ treatment-induced changes in the circulating milieu (plasma) evoke improvements in
human aortic EC function, as shown by higher acetylcholine-stimulated NO production and lower basal mtROS
bioactivity in ECs treated with plasma from subjects after MitoQ supplementation vs. placebo.
Our parent award is a larger, NIA R01-funded (AG067730) randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial
assessing 3 months of MitoQ treatment for improving peripheral vascular function in older adults. To explore
the possible effects of MitoQ on cognitive and cerebrovascular function, we utilized subjects enrolled in the
parent trial to obtain preliminary data that suggest MitoQ treatment may improve fluid cognition (i.e., the
domain of cognition most heavily influenced by aging and Alzheimer’s disease) and cerebrovascular
function vs. placebo. We propose to leverage the R01-funded trial to determine the efficacy of MitoQ
supplementation for improving fluid cognition and cerebrovascular function in older adults and provide
insight into possible mechanism(s) contributing to these improvements. This research is highly relevant to
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias as it will evaluate a novel clinical intervention for improving
cognitive and cerebrovascular function in asymptomatic older adults, a group disproportionately
burdened by MCI, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Leveraging our ongoing clinical trial will
stimulate research in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias by providing initial evidence for the efficacy
of dietary supplementation with MitoQ as an innovative prevention strategy for decreasing dementia risk and
promoting translation of this promising alternative intervention to other at-risk groups."

HIV is over-represented in substance using and criminal legal involved populations. The syndemic risks for
incarceration and HIV risk and acquisition are strongly correlated as a result of both structural and individual-
level factors. While effective HIV prevention strategies exist, they are rarely adapted or deployed with people in
jails, prisons, during re-entry, or on community supervision. And, when they are, equal collaboration with the
community to develop and implement intervention strategies is often missing. Improving meaningful
representation of individuals with expertise based on lived experience (“context expertise”), can improve the
effectiveness, relevance, validity, and acceptability of health research and service delivery systems. The overall
goal of the INTERACT (Using DesIgN jusTicE to impRove cArCeral health ouTcomes) Center is to improve
representation and engagement of individuals with context expertise in the criminal legal system, HIV and
substance use in research to illuminate key barriers to service access and utilization and identify and test
potential solutions that are human-centered and scalable. Our team possesses complementary content and
context expertise related to the criminal legal system, and is multidisciplinary (i.e., reflecting training in public
health, human-centered design, education, nursing, criminology, social work, community psychology, and
cultural anthropology) and multi-tiered (i.e., representing multiple academic roles). As such, we are uniquely
positioned to successfully execute all components of this resource center. The specific aims for the INTERACT
Center are to: 1) Recruit and engage a Community Advisory Board reflecting context expertise in HIV, substance
use, and criminal legal involvement/history; 2) Use human-centered design principles to document experiences
with HIV and substance use treatment services and identify strategies to optimize care delivery for future testing;
3) Conduct > two pilot studies, each co-led by a Community Advisory Board member, to explore the feasibility
and acceptability of strategies to improve HIV and substance use outcomes; 4) Evaluate the efficacy of the
INTERACT Center in supporting the meaningful inclusion of context experts in the development and
implementation of HIV and substance use-related research. Successful completion of the proposed aims has the
potential to increase trust in health science and improve the availability and desirability of HIV and substance use
interventions for a multiply marginalized group."

The critical challenge in the clinical management of newly-diagnosed localized prostate cancer remains
distinguishing indolent from aggressive and life-threatening cancers. Biomarkers are urgently needed to
identify those patients who harbor aggressive disease and will derive benefit from definitive treatment. We
therefore, propose to apply complimentary proteogenomic-based discovery approaches to identify and then
validate molecular features in prostate proximal fluids and tumor tissues that will be utilized in accurate early
detection of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and improve disease risk stratification. The intended use of
these biomarkers will be the early identification of men at risk for grade progression and improved risk-

10911024,"ABSTRACT
Sudden cardiac arrest is highly prevalent among hospitalized veterans and results in overwhelming mortality.
Unfortunately, there are no pharmacologic therapies that have been shown to reliably increase survival after
sudden cardiac arrest. Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest typically have systemic organ damage requiring
intensive care in the hospital. The majority of these patients have reduced cardiac function and one quarter of
these patients die from cardiogenic shock. Cardiac inflammation is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and
is likely driven by damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). One prominent DAMP is mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA). Preliminary work in our lab has shown that strategies aimed at preserving mtDNA integrity,
including overexpression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), are protective to cardiac function in a
mouse model of sudden cardiac arrest. TFAM is a nuclear gene that regulates mtDNA expression, packaging,
and copy number and is known to be protective in a number of heart disease models.
My overarching hypothesis is that ischemia-reperfusion injury from cardiac arrest results in mtDNA release,
which triggers an inflammatory response in the heart, and that this response is dependent upon cGAS/STING
signaling. To explore this hypothesis, I will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will explore the mechanism
by which mtDNA is released using microscopy in vitro and confirm these changes in an in vivo model of
sudden cardiac arrest. In Aim 2, I will use transgenic mouse models to manipulate TFAM to affect mtDNA
release and also knock-out STING signaling to explore the relationship between mtDNA release and
inflammation after sudden cardiac arrest. In Aim 3, I will characterize the inflammatory response in the heart
after sudden cardiac arrest and manipulate cGAS/STING signaling to evaluate cGAS/STING mediated
inflammatory changes.
Together, these aims will evaluate the role of mtDNA release following sudden cardiac arrest and its role in
innate immune signaling, which may guide future therapies for human studies. This work will support my goal
of transitioning into an independent research career as a physician-scientist studying mitochondrial changes in
cardiovascular disease. This grant will support continued research and career development at both the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh, including coursework, career
mentorship, and scientific training aimed at transitioning to independence as a physician scientist in the
Veterans Administration system."
10911027,"Incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder is a major problem for the VA, affecting roughly 13% of individuals
serving in OIF or OEF. Women appear to be more susceptible to development of PTSD than men, often
occurring in the context of sexual assault (which can occur during military service). Frontline treatment options
can improve symptoms but do not currently offer a cure. To develop further strategies to this end, it is critical
to understand the foundations of the disease process as it develops. The proposal is designed to test the
hypothesis that hormonal responsiveness to stress and trauma are critical for driving susceptibility to
development of behavior pathologies relevant to PTSD. In humans, PTSD is linked to heightened sensitivity to
glucocorticoid signals, due to enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling (due to increased glucocorticoid
receptor expression and/or decreased expression of its inhibitory binding partner FKBP5). Both GR and
FKBP5 gene variants are linked to PTSD incidence or severity, indicating of a role as trait variable influencing
disease development or progression. PTSD-related GR and HPA axis dysfunction are emulated in rodent
models, suggesting that they contribute to pathological behaviors associated with trauma. Pathological
mechanisms are thought to be driven by disruption of prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections controlling
expression of fear, anxiety and emotional memory, processes that are in turn subject to regulation by stress
hormones. This proposal tests the hypothesis that post-trauma glucocorticoid signaling disrupts prefrontal
(infralimbic) cortex and amygdala circuitry responsible for fear regulation, causing lasting decrements in
neurocircuit function and behavior. Here we employ pharmacological, genetic and physiological approaches to
understand glucocorticoid control of neurocircuit mechanisms driving posttraumatic pathologies, using a well-
characterized and reproducible rodent single prolonged stress (SPS) model to emulate core symptoms of
PTSD. Aim 1 uses pharmacological approach to either block or amplify infralimbic cortex glucocorticoid signals
in the aftermath of SPS, testing the impact of altered glucocorticoid receptor binding on generation of
enhanced anxiety related behaviors, social withdrawal, impaired extinction of fear memories and impaired
decision making. Novel machine learning approaches are used to model the constellation of behavioral deficits
following SPS and determine how blocking or amplifying infralimbic GR signaling modifies the pathology
model. Aim 2 uses a recently-developed conditional rat GR deletion model to test the specific role of the
infralimbic GR signaling in mediating stress pathologies, including direct query of GR action across the
infralimbic-basolateral amygdala connection. Aim 3 addresses possible mechanisms of post-SPS GR signaling
in disruption of infralimbic-amygdala circuit function, employing electrophysiological approaches to test the role
of GR signaling in causing long-term pathological reductions in prefrontal excitability. Overall, these data are
expected to define the role GR binding in generation of neurocircuit pathology related to PTSD, providing a
springboard for evaluating the utility of new or existing GR modulating agents as a putative disease treatment
or prevention."
10911142,"Falls are the most common cause for injury-related hospitalization in older adults and account for over $50
billion per year in medical costs. For the ~27% of US adults with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) the odds of
falling are up to 54% higher than for people without OA. The high incidence of falls associated with OA remains
high after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The incidence of falls during the first year after TKA is up to 51.8%.
With over 750,000 TKAs performed annually, the scope of the problem is large. Despite several calls in the
literature for new methods to decrease fall rate after TKA, there are, to our knowledge, no such interventions
specifically targeting this group. Our recent work, however, demonstrates the promise of perturbation training
in knee OA. We have established that limiting trunk angle and angular velocity during the initial recovery step
after a disturbance, such as a trip, is a critical factor in avoiding a fall. This motor skill can be improved through
task-specific perturbation training. In our pilot study, trip-specific perturbation training effectively improved trunk
kinematics during the initial recovery step after a trip-simulating perturbation in women with moderately
symptomatic OA. Further, we have shown that trip-specific perturbation-training reduces fall-rates in the
community in healthy older women. Building on this past success, our long-term goal is to reduce the incidence
of preventable gait-related falls by older adults with joint replacements. The objective of this application is to
establish that preoperative task-specific training of stepping responses to sagittal and frontal plane
disturbances reduces the risk of postoperative falls in people undergoing TKA. Our central hypothesis is that
individualized preoperative sagittal and frontal plane perturbation training will significantly reduce postoperative
fall rates in people scheduled for TKA by improving trunk kinematics during the initial recovery step. To test this
hypothesis, we will evaluate preoperative TKA patients, randomized into either a perturbation-training group or
a conventional fall-prevention education group. We will assess our central hypothesis through two aims. Aim 1:
Demonstrate the extent to which perturbation training focused on forward and laterally directed stepping
responses improves recovery step trunk mechanics in preoperative TKA patients. Aim 2: Demonstrate the
effectiveness of forward and laterally directed perturbation training in reducing incidence of preventable gait-
related falls for one year after TKA. With extensive collective expertise in OA and arthroplasty gait mechanics,
aging, falls, and fall-prevention, including clinical trial experience, we are well poised to accomplish these aims.
Further, through our innovative prehabilitation approach, we will, for the first time, address both trip-specific
and laterally directed falls in this patient population. In addition, this study will advance our mechanistic
understanding of trip-specific and laterally directed fall risk in people before and after TKA. By introducing a
new prehabilitation approach to reduce postoperative falls in people undergoing TKA, our proposed work will
exert a positive public health impact addressing a common and expensive public health problem."
10933749,"Project Summary
Our ability to learn and to remember countless experiences is essential for our daily lives. However, our
dependence on these processes also makes us vulnerable to disorders which affect the underlying neuronal
circuits. Notably, disorders causing cognitive impairments may broadly disrupt multiple forms of learning and
memory, even without directly affecting the underlying circuits themselves. This may be due to disruptions of
processes that coordinate learning across multiple learning systems. While the systems that form our different
kinds of memories, like motor skills or directions, are largely separate, they interact in various and surprising
ways. Memorizing facts can for example interfere with or boost the learning of motor skills. This suggests that
the continuous stream of experiences and learning events needs to be tightly controlled to prevent disruptions
and to take advantage of existing memories. We suggest that prefrontal cortex (PFC) exerts such cognitive
control and coordinates learning across multiple systems. Cognitive impairments disrupting PFC function may
therefore impair learning broadly. In particular, we suggest that PFC, to coordinate learning processes, extracts
common rules and task components. In the long term, this allows for identification of hidden relationships,
generalization across tasks and improved learning of new tasks. We hypothesize, however, that in the short
term, the underlying mechanisms interfere with and, under certain circumstances, also enhance learning. We
will test this using our cutting-edge custom infrastructure for high-throughput behavioral training and for
continuous (24/7) long-term in vivo electrophysiological recordings. With this, we will address three
interrelated, but fully independent aims. Aim 1 will identify the task components which, when shared across
tasks, drive interactions between learning systems. In large-scale behavioral experiments we will train animals
on pairings of procedural and declarative tasks and manipulate shared procedural or declarative task
components. This will reveal whether the two learning systems differentially affect the mechanisms underlying
learning interactions. Aim 2 will determine the neural activity dynamics in PFC during learning interactions,
track the development of representations of shared task components, and show how optogenetically identified
PFC projection neurons mediate learning interactions. Importantly, for this we will integrate high-density
Neuropixels probes with our system for long-term electrophysiological recordings. Finally, Aim 3 will causally
test if and at what times during training PFC and its projections are necessary for learning interactions, using
chemogenetic manipulations via implanted micro-infusion pumps over weeks of training. This multi-level,
orthogonal experimental approach promises vertical advances toward an understanding of the circuit
mechanisms underlying learning interactions and the relationships between distinct learning systems. Our
insights may also help to understand how cognitive impairments broadly affect multiple forms of learning and
memory and aid the improvement of existing and the development of novel diagnostic tools and treatments."

10939086,"Abstract
The development of -amyloid (A) pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is accompanied by hyperactivation
of microglia and neuroinflammation. Genome-wide association studies established a causal role of microglia in
AD pathogenesis. Microglia cluster around Aβ plaques to form a protective barrier and are also responsible for
Aβ uptake and clearance. These processes are energy intensive and require the expression and remodeling of
cell-surface proteins. Microglia under chronic Aβ exposure become reactive displaying less phagocytic
capacity. Increasing evidence implicates impaired metabolic and lipid homeostasis as key contributors to
microglia dysfunction. The complement pathway is a conserved innate immune modulator. The central
complement component C3 and its C3a receptor (C3aR) are elevated in the brains of AD patients and mouse
models and their inactivation confers protection against age-associated functional decline and AD
neuropathology, suggesting that inhibiting this pathway may provide therapeutic benefit against AD. Our recent
study of complement signaling identified Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α), which is an essential molecule
in oxygen sensing and metabolic reprogramming, as a downstream effector of C3aR mediating microglia
metabolism, A receptor trafficking and phagocytosis. Accordingly, understanding the role of HIF-1α in
regulating microglia metabolic state and identifying microglia cell-surface receptors in response to A
pathology are major objectives of the current proposal. Interestingly, besides C3a, C3aR also binds to TLQP-
21, a neuropeptide derived from VGF, which has been nominated as a key driver in AD by the Accelerating
Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. However, little is known about the
relationship between the TLQP-21-C3aR and C3a-C3aR pathways. Thus, another goal of the application is to
decipher C3a and TLQP-21 mediated C3aR interaction. Overall, these studies will achieve an insightful
understanding of the two distinct ligands yet both implicated in AD, complement C3a and neuropeptide TLQP-

between microglia metabolism and neuroinflammation through the C3aR-HIF-1α immunometabolic pathway

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) affects girls and women throughout the world, with 3 million girls cut
each year. The highest rates of FGM/C are in East Africa. There are significant reproductive, sexual, and
mental health consequences for girls and women impacted by FGM/C. Healthcare providers (HCPs) require
training to meet these needs, yet globally there is a dearth of training programs. Effectiveness studies of
FGM/C training are even rarer. Tanzania has a high FGM/C rate, yet we found in preliminary studies that
healthcare students were unprepared to meet the need of these patients. The goal of the proposed study is to
develop training materials specific to the needs of HCPs within Tanzania, deliver a pilot intervention/training
program, and study the effectiveness of the program at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences
(MUHAS). In order to meet that goal, it is critical that training materials are developed carefully, with attention
to both cultural and ethical concerns facing healthcare providers within the country. There are three specific
aims. In Aim 1 we will conduct a social ecological needs assessment of the healthcare needs of women in
Tanzania who have experienced FGM/C. The results of Aim 1 will be used to adapt a promising training
program to accomplish our second aim. In Aim 2 we will develop a FGM/C training tailored to the Tanzanian
context. A core component of Aim 2 will be to use a train the trainer program. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the
effectiveness of the training through a randomized, controlled, single blinded trial of the training (intervention)
against a waitlist control arm (n=200 students per arm; 400 in total). In Aim 3 we will assess medical, nursing,
and midwifery students’ improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and clinical skills. Development and testing of a
tailored training course about FGM/C for students in health care, if effective, has high potential to be integrated
into existing curriculum; and be widely adopted as a new standard of training for health professionals across
both low prevalence and high prevalence FGM/C areas."

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal
morbidity including preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) and maternal morbidity including pyelonephritis.
Hypothesis: Treatment of pregnant individuals with AB will reduce the incidence of newborns with LBW in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Significance: LBW occurs in more than 20 million newborns each year globally and is associated with an
increased risk of neonatal death and lifetime morbidity. This proposal will examine the impact of treating AB
in pregnant individuals in LMICs on the incidence of LBW and serious maternal and neonatal morbidity.
Investigators: Dr. Chisholm (mPI) is an academic maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist with 5 years of
experience as a member of the NICHD Global Network for Women’s and Children’s Health Research (GN)
and investigator in global clinical trials. Dr. McClure (mPI) is a perinatal epidemiologist and PI of the Data
Coordinating Center who has more than 20 years of experience contributing to the leadership of the GN and
overseeing research in LMICs. Co-Is Dr. Petri at the University of Virginia and Dr. Haque at the International
Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, have collaborated for 30 years on maternal–child
health and infectious diseases research.
Innovation: The proposed study will address calls from the World Health Organization, USPSTF, and
numerous professional societies for data evaluating the impact of treatment for AB in contemporary obstetric
populations in LMICs where the burden of LBW and associated neonatal morbidity is highest and where the
practice of screening for AB is less widely implemented.
Approach: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-arm trial to address the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Test the primary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic (nitrofurantoin)
treatment of AB on LBW. This will be done by comparing the incidence of LBW between those randomized
to receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo.
Specific Aim 2: Test the secondary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic treatment of AB on
serious maternal morbidity in pregnancy. This will be done by comparing maternal morbidity between those
randomized to receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo. We hypothesize that
treatment of AB in pregnancy will reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia."

Adenylyl cyclase (AC) and its product, cyclic AMP, regulate functional outcomes in every mammalian tissue
and organ system, controlling processes such as learning and memory, motor coordination, cardiac
contractility, drug dependency and withdrawal, renal function, pain, stress, immune responses, and anxiety
behavior, to name just a few. Importantly, G protein coupled receptors that transmit signals via stimulation
(Gαs) or inhibition (Gαi) of AC are major clinical drug targets (e.g. beta-blockers for heart disease, opioids for
pain, or beta-agonists for asthma). Funded largely by NIGMS, my research career over the last 27 years has
focused on how the catalytic activity of AC enzymes are regulated by G proteins and other regulatory
molecules. Additionally, we are interested in how AC/cAMP signaling specificity can occur in a cellular
environment. We have identified multiple macromolecular complexes assembled by A-kinase anchoring
proteins that respond to low levels of local cAMP production upon anchoring of AC to the system, driving
physiological responses, or when altered, have pathophysiological consequences. However, many
fundamental questions remain about the mechanisms of AC regulation within these signalosomes, the
regulation of ACs by covalent modifications, and the potential for regulation of cellular events from intracellular
sites. To address these key questions, we have performed proximity dependent identification of near neighbors
(BioID) to build a comprehensive AC interaction network in cardiomyocytes and characterized new tools for
selectively probing the properties of AC9. These will be applied to broad projects that examine the scaffolding
of AC activity that ultimately control cardiac pacemaking and conduction. Popdc proteins act as one novel
scaffold for AC enzymes that promote AC activity within the complex to drive cAMP-dependent regulation of
TREK channels. The unique mechanism of AC regulation by Popdc and the localization of this complex will be
further explored in two related projects. Additionally, we will examine the mechanism of AC regulation by a
novel modifying enzyme, identified by BioID. Although these modes of regulating cAMP signaling will be
examined in the context of cardiomyocytes and cardiac function, many of the mechanisms are universal in
nature and have implications for many biological systems."

This proposal will investigate the role of small non‐coding RNAs, termed microRNAs (miRs), in the regulation
of sodium (Na+) transport in the distal kidney nephron. We will investigate the hypothesis that the
mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone regulates the expression of specific miR clusters in the distal kidney
nephron cortical collecting duct (CCD). These miRs target mRNAs to alter Na+ transport. Expended up-
regulation of the aldosterone-induced miRs then feedback to reduce the aldosterone response (negative
feedback regulation). We propose to test this novel role of miRs in Na+ homeostasis but using a miR cluster
KO mouse line. The miR-17~92 cluster will be deleted from the kidney nephron using a conditional, inducible
KO line and the impact on long-term aldosterone signaling will be investigated. In the second part of the
proposal, the mechanism the aldosterone-regulated miRs use to alter Na+ transport will be investigated in
primary kidney cells."
10905553,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Diabetes is a costly and complex chronic illness and a serious public health problem.
The number of individuals with diabetes, particularly obesity-linked type 2 diabetes (T2D), is certain to increase
over the next decades. Shockingly, the children of today have an estimated overall lifetime risk of developing
diabetes of nearly 50%. Therefore, developing new methods to prevent T2D and properly treat T2D patients is
exceptionally timely and of great significance. The progression to T2D is increasingly being linked with changes
in cellular and molecular signaling pathways in the insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cell, preventing adequate
insulin secretion to stimulate the body’s cells to take up glucose from the blood. Yet, few T2D drugs specifically
target the β-cell, and those that do are not effective in all individuals and are controversially linked with β-cell
failure long-term. Two molecules that are cornerstones of our research program are prostaglandin EP3 receptor
(EP3), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for the arachidonic acid metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and
its associated G protein alpha subunit, Gαz. Work from our group and others has definitively shown EP3
expression and signaling is increased in β-cells of T2D mice and human organ donors and blocking EP3 signaling
can stimulate β-cell insulin secretion and proliferation. These exciting results suggest targeting EP3 and/or Gαz
might increase the number of functional β-cells in T2D; yet, much more work is necessary to achieve this. Our
long-term goal is to fully characterize the EP3 and Gαz activation and signaling pathways during the progression
to T2D at the whole body, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels, providing us key information on how to target
this β-cell pathway in T2D. The overall objective of this work, which is the next logical step in pursuit of our goal,
is to define the molecular signaling pathways responsible for the impact of EP3 signaling, both Gɑz-dependent
and -independent, on mouse and human β-cell compensation and β-cell failure. Our central hypothesis is EP3
and Gαz, when active, modulate intracellular signaling pathways critical for β-cell compensation in obesity but,
when chronically active, contribute to β-cell dysfunction and loss in T2D. We will test our central hypothesis with
a combination of innovative cellular imaging, metabolomics, and proteomics assays, correlating changes in EP3
and Gɑz signaling pathways with measurements of β-cell function in response to glucose and glucagon-like
peptide 1: a well-accepted class of T2D drugs. We will accomplish this goal by pursuing the following three
Specific Aims: 1. Determine effects of EP3 on discrete cellular pools of β-cell Ca2+ and cAMP and
downstream β-cell function and mass; 2. Quantify Gɑz-dependent Rap1GAP translocation, Rap1GAP
phosphorylation, and their effects on β-cell function and mass; and 3. Quantify changes in the human
islet arachidonic acid metabolome, and the functional consequence of these changes, during the
progression to T2D. This work, when completed, will provide a much more complete understanding of the role
of the β-cell and its signaling molecules in the progression to and pathophysiology of T2D."

Recent studies have pointed to roles for the cerebellum beyond its canonical roles in motor coordination, with
evidence pointing to prominent roles in the regulation of non-motor behaviors and parallel evidence for the
contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to numerous conditions marked by non-motor challenges throughout
development1-5. Indeed, our lab has shown that cerebellar function is necessary for social behaviors and for
behavioral flexibility6. During the course of our previously funded grant period, we have published multiple
studies delineating the presence of critical periods in cerebellar-regulated behaviors, demonstrated a key role
for cerebellar CrusI in the regulation of social and repetitive behaviors, and demonstrated an important
anatomic circuit between this region and the mPFC in the regulation of these behaviors7-10. Importantly, we
also demonstrated that modulation of this circuit is sufficient to improve behaviors in a cerebellar-specific
neurodevelopmental model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, important questions remain,
including whether this circuit has more generalizable importance in models beyond TSC and whether circuit
modulation might be sufficient to benefit, not just cerebellar-specific models, but also global, constitutive
human disease-relevant models. Moreover, although we have shown that these circuits are necessary for
proper performance of these social behaviors, how this circuit communicates and actually contributes to social
behaviors remains unknown.
In these proposed studies, we hypothesize and show preliminary data to support that these circuits are
relevant to both cerebellar-specific and global neurodevelopmental models; that neuronal activity within the
cerebellar CrusI-mPFC circuit processes social behaviors; that this communication is necessary for proper
social behavior; that disruptions of the mPFC or CrusI impairs this communication; and that social behaviors
improve upon improvement of this communication. To evaluate these hypotheses further, we propose the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim1. Delineate CrusI-mPFC circuit contribution to global/constitutive Cntnap2 mutant mice
Specific Aim2. Delineate CrusI-mPFC communication during social behaviors
Specific Aim3. Delineate integrity of CrusI-mPFC communication in cerebellar (PC-Tsc1) and
constitutive (Cntnap2) mutant mice and evaluate impact of CrusI modulation on this communication
In summary, this work will both delineate basic mechanisms underlying the cerebellar and mPFC circuit
contributions to social behaviors while also providing a pre-clinical foundation for understanding the impact of
circuit-based neuromodulation on these behaviors."

Kidney transplantation is the preferred modality of treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is
known to improve quality of life and survival of patients compared with dialysis. However, racial and ethnic
disparities in access to kidney transplantation have persisted for more than two decades. The lower access of
Black and Hispanic adults to kidney transplantation has been attributed to individual-level characteristics such
as socioeconomic barriers, differences in cultural beliefs or attitudes surrounding organ transplantation, and
higher prevalence of contraindications to kidney transplantation. However, system-level factors may contribute
to the racial and ethnic inequities in access to kidney transplantation, but have not been thoroughly explored.
In this renewal application, we propose to leverage electronic health record data to examine the role of
providers and provider-patient interactions on inequities in access to referral for kidney transplant candidacy
evaluation and waitlisting at University of California healthcare systems, Hennepin Healthcare, University of
Minnesota, University of Maryland, and University of Texas Southwestern. We will focus on patients with CKD
stage 4-5 who would potentially be eligible for referral for kidney transplantation in our study. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether race/ethnicity associates with the language used in provider notes (positive or negative)
and frequency of provider-patient interactions or monitoring. In Aim 2, we propose to evaluate whether these
factors mediate the association between race/ethnicity and outcomes including preemptive referral for kidney
transplant candidacy evaluation or transplant center decisions surrounding a patient’s eligibility for waitlisting.
In Aim 3, we will then relate the language used in provider notes to outcomes following the onset of ESKD,
such as first-year mortality and post-transplant outcomes (hospitalizations, rejection, and graft failure). We are
particularly interested in the strength of these associations by race/ethnicity and whether effect modification is
present. The results of our study will enhance our understanding of mediators of racial and ethnic disparities in
access to transplantation and inform the design of interventions that can be delivered to address provider-
related variables that may contribute to inequities in access to kidney transplantation."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint disease caused by a chronic inflammation in
joints, where no effective treatment is currently available. Currently there is no effective model can accurately
dissect RA pathogenesis and consistently predict the effect of a therapeutic agent in patients. Better model
systems that can accurately recapitulate the immune responses and pathological processes of RA in the
human synovial microenvironment with immunomodulatory treatments are critically required. In this work we
aim to develop a fully patient-derived in vitro RA disease model termed “Synovium-on-a-Chip” by including full
spectrum of synovial cell types, which can serve as a precision medicine platform to (1) interrogate human RA
pathobiology and to (2) achieve ""clinical trial on chips"" for stratifying patients and pre-screening of novel
immunotherapy. Simulating the structure and inflammatory microenvironment of the synovium with such a
biomimetic vascularized immunocompetent microphysiological system will represent a major advance over
existing models, providing much greater biomimicry and enabling next-step studies to allow rational selection
of immunomodulatory drugs to personalize treatment of RA patients."

Asian Americans are the fastest growing and most diverse U.S. racial/ethnic group. They have unique and
disparate patterns of cancer, including being the first U.S. racial/ethnic group for whom cancer is the leading
cause of death. Their incidence of certain cancers far exceeds those of other groups, including lung cancer
among never smoking females, nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Chinese Americans, liver cancer in Southeast
Asian Americans, gastric cancer in Korean and Japanese Americans, and thyroid cancer in Filipino Americans.
Counter to the prevailing view that Asian Americans have high socioeconomic status and favorable health,
certain groups have high rates of poverty, low healthcare access, and low rates of cancer screening. As we
acknowledge the importance of the lived experiences of Asian American populations, including chronic stress
and weathering due to historical trauma and anti-Asian racism, acclimating to and establishing a life in a new
country, and navigating unfamiliar and complex institutions and healthcare systems, we propose a paradigm shift
in studies of cancer risk to include the examination of structural and social determinants of health specific to
Asian American populations. We propose to establish the national ASPIRE– ASian American ProspectIve
REsearch cohort, beginning with 20,000 men and women, ages 40-75 (inclusive of all Asian American ethnic
groups and those who are multiracial/ethnic) via focused community-engaged recruitment in six regions that
comprise more than a third of the Asian American population (California (Bay Area, Los Angeles, Orange
County, Sacramento), New York Metro/North Jersey, and Greater Philadelphia Metro/South Jersey), in addition
to national outreach to other U.S. regions. This population-based cohort will include: 1) multiple Asian American
communities; 2) collection of data on health behavior exposures across the life course; 3) detailed information on
structural, social, and environmental factors; 4) novel assessment of epigenetic age; 5) a precision adaptive
design to develop best practices for community-engaged research in traditionally understudied ethnic groups;
and 6) methodologic research on analytic approaches to assess small populations and intersectionality. This
cohort is supported by a national network of researchers and community partners committed to Asian American
health and well-being. We will use transparent and equitable processes among scientific and community
collaborators to inform research priorities, data collection and sharing, and dissemination of timely, actionable,
and policy-relevant study results. The ASPIRE Cohort will thus be suitable to address multi-level contributors to
the unique cancer burden experienced by Asian American populations. This first phase will address structural
and social determinants of health and their impacts on multiple pathways to cancer initiation that considers 1)
healthcare access and cancer screening, 2) cancer-relevant health behaviors, and 3) social epigenomics of
stress embodiment. The ultimate vision of ASPIRE is to serve as a rich, contemporary epidemiologic resource to
advance our understanding of cancer etiology and achieve health equity in Asian American populations."
10908338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae is the etiologic agent of the severe diarrheal disease known as cholera,
which affects millions of people annually, worldwide. In order for V. cholerae to successfully colonize in the
small intestines of the host, it must express a series of virulence factors, which have been the main focus of
the cholera research. However, bacterial pathogenicity is a multifactorial process in vivo that depends not only
on virulence factor expression, but host responses to infection and interactions with the commensal microbes
of the gut, the gut microbiome. One major set of host-produced factors that must be overcome by V. cholerae
comprises nitric oxide (NO) and NO-derived nitrogen oxides and dinitrosyl-iron complexes, collectively known
as nitrosative stress (reactive nitrogen species, RNS). Previous studies show that inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS or NOS2), the enzyme that synthesizes NO, is among the most upregulated proteins in
duodenal tissue during cholera, and our results show both that iNOS is highly induced upon V. cholerae
infection of an adult mouse model, and that V. cholerae colonization is reduced in iNOS-/- mice or mice treated
with the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG). However, little is known about how increased RNS in vivo
impacts V. cholerae, the gut microbiome, and the inter-microbial interactions that drive the ultimate outcome of
infection. We hypothesize that RNS production induced during infection modulates the structure, function, and
pathogen interactions of the gut microbiome, granting V. cholerae a competitive advantage over commensals
due to several RNS-resistance mechanisms that are tightly regulated alongside virulence factor expression.
We will examine this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how V. cholerae responds to RNS
during infection, and how these responses are regulated alongside virulence. In Aim 2, we will examine the
role of RNS in modulating the gut microbiome, how RNS-dependent changes influences V. cholerae
susceptibility, and how RNS affects specific microbial interactions between this pathogen and commensal gut
microbes."

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), known as a brittle bone disease, is a genetic disorder typically caused by
autosomal dominant mutations in one of the two genes that encode type l collagen (Col1). In addition to bone
fragility, growth deficiency is a critical musculoskeletal issue in OI. There is no cure for OI. While
bisphosphonates are the standard treatment to strengthen bones, there is no reliably effective treatment for
growth impairment. One of the major hurdles preventing the development of such treatments is that the
mechanism of how a mutation in Col1 causes growth deficiency has not been elucidated. Given that
treatments to improve osteoblast function were not effective for resolving bone length deficiency, cell types
other than osteoblasts might be involved in OI growth retardation. We and others found abnormalities in the
growth plate, where longitudinal bone growth occurs, including increased total height, decreased chondrocyte
turnover and fewer proliferating chondrocytes, suggesting that mutated Col1 somehow affects chondrocytes in
the growth plate. Thus, understanding the mechanism underlying chondrocyte defects is critical to develop
treatments for OI growth deficiency. In this proposal, we will focus on dominant OI using G610C mice
harboring Col1 mutation because 85-90% of OI are autosomal dominant forms. Our data demonstrated that OI
HCs began to express Col1 as they mature along with the enlarged endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting
that OI HCs are exposed to higher ER stress similar to OI osteoblasts. Our preliminary studies demonstrated
that G610C OI chondrocytes had a lower ability to express hypertrophic phenotypes in pellet cultures and an
ER stress reducer ameliorated this defect, suggesting that ER stress may cause dysfunction not only in
osteoblasts but also in HCs in OI. Indeed, it has been shown that induction of ER stress in HCs causes HC
dysfunction and results in growth deficiency. Collectively, these findings provide rigorous premises for our
highly innovative hypothesis that HC dysfunction induced by ER stress plays a pivotal role in growth deficiency
of dominant OI. This hypothesis will be addressed by experiments supporting the following specific aims: (1) to
characterize ER stress occurring in HCs in G610C OI mice, (2) to determine HC dysfunction in G610C OI
mice, and (3) to determine ER stress in HCs from dominant OI patients with distinct mutations. The completion
of these aims will determine whether growth deficiency in dominant OI is a consequence of HC dysfunction
caused by ER stress. The outcome of this innovative project has potential to change our understanding of OI
by redefining OI not only as “bone disease” but also as “cartilage disease”, and by providing approaches
focused on chondrocytes, rather than osteoblasts or osteoclasts in developing therapeutic strategies for growth
impairment in OI."

One of dura mater’s most important functionalities is to keep Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) inside
of the cranial cavity. To avoid life-threatening complications there exists a need for effective and
reliable dural graft replacements post-surgery. A broad selection of dura grafts exists; however,
no consensus has been reached on which graft is best suited to avoid dura mater ruptures and
adverse immunological responses. Naturally derived and synthetic grafts are most used as dura
replacements in the clinic. Native ECM constructs, when properly treated and handled, have the
potential to preserve the overall architecture of the tissue matrix. Decellularized constructs have
been shown to provide structural support, adhesion sites for cell attachment, and growth factors
for cell proliferation. However, the commercially available naturally derived matrices undergo
extensive processing, including lyophilization, which may be cause for clearing of relevant ECM
proteins needed for sustained tissue health. The research question we propose to answer in this
study is Do acellular xenogeneic dural grafts elicit a less deleterious immune response than
naturally derived commercial grafts and maintain structural integrity over the long term for in vivo
studies?
We will examine the rigor of graft sealing strength, risk of infection and/or inflammation, and
wound healing/tissue incorporation in vitro and in vivo within a rat model. Our central hypothesis
is that native xenogeneic ECM grafts with multiple ECM proteins will perform better than
the naturally derived (commercial) ECM dural grafts due to their improved mechanical and

grafts. We will examine two naturally derived, commercial dural grafts, Biodesign®, and
Lyoplant®, and two tissue-based grafts directly from the source—porcine dura, and cadaveric
human dura. In Aim 2 we will investigate, in vivo, the border integrity of all grafts by quantifying
leakage of CSF. Additionally, we will assess scar formation and immune infiltration in our
xenogeneic vs. naturally derived commercially available grafts. The knowledge gained from this
work will provide empirical knowledge on the role of tissue-derived xenogeneic grafts for dural
replacement. Increased surgeon confidence will enable appropriate graft selection for patients,
reduced operative morbidity and mortality following cranial procedures."

10908342,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although mathematics skills are crucial for academic achievement, future job opportunities in adulthood, and
healthcare-related decisions, the fundamental cognitive and neural mechanisms that underpin learning of basic
math skills remain poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms and specific factors that lead to better
math learning is essential for those endeavoring to improve targeted remediation techniques for those with math
learning difficulties. Despite the fact that long-term learning and memory systems have been carefully studied
for over a century, and are well-known to play a major role in related domains such as language and reading,
their role of in shaping learning and the developmental trajectory of math skill acquisition remains largely
unknown. Knowledge of these mechanisms can provide a major theoretical advance in our understanding of
math learning and development, which in turn can reveal critical leverage points for improving early math
education and interventions to narrow the math-achievement gap for those with persistent math deficits. There
is therefore a critical need for a definitive, systematic study of the specific mechanisms by which long-term
memory systems support the acquisition and development of foundational math skills. Continuing to overlook
the role of these memory systems in mathematics will impede theories of math development and practical efforts
to improve long-term efficacy of interventions for children with math difficulties.
We will implement a repeated-measures longitudinal design examining two key memory systems, declarative
(DM) and procedural memory (PM), and their contributions to developmental trajectories of a range of math skills
in children in 1st through 5th grades. To test specific hypotheses about the link between each memory system
and different math skills, we will collect measures of standardized math achievement, arithmetic skills, and basic
quantity processing. DM and PM systems have been well characterized at the neural level, so to deepen
understanding of the mechanisms linking math and memory systems, we will also collect functional neuroimaging
measures at both time-points to characterize learning-related changes in both brain and behavior. Repeating
each measure at each time-point will make it possible to account for initial variability in and prior existing relations
between variables, thus allowing us to predict changes in a particular math outcome. By revealing links between
specific memory systems and math-related changes in brain and behavior, this project will provide the most
comprehensive picture to date of how long-term memory mechanisms subserve math learning. This in turn will
help take much of the guesswork out of determining the target of interventions aimed at improving educational
outcomes for children with and without math learning difficulties."
10908470,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key functional modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many
of them use closed architectures (e.g., the use of custom ASICs instead of commercial over-the-shelf
components) and proprietary software.
 Therefore, the overall objective of this HORNET Center for Autonomic Nerve Recording and Stimulation
Systems (CARSS) is to develop an open-architecture and open-source implantable system for autonomic nerve
stimulation and recording. We propose to develop the CARSS implantable system tailored for bioelectronic
medicine applications. The CARSS system includes an external charger and controller, implantable pulse
generator, and an assortment of interoperable and implantable leads for stimulation and sensing. As such, this
seamlessly unified system will enable closed-loop sensing and neuromodulation, providing experimental
flexibility and control to the clinical research community.
 In order to make the developed system and its components available to the community, our CARSS Center
will engage with the user community and facilitate technology dissemination by providing system templates and
libraries (along with supporting technical documentation) as well as training. The central goal of our
dissemination approach is to collaborate with the community to reduce the technical, regulatory, and financial
barriers to entry into bioelectronic medicine research and thereby accelerate the development and translation of
novel bioelectronic medical therapies. We have assembled a collaborative team from industry and academia to
achieve a CARSS system suitable for use in human clinical research."
10908605,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with perinatal organ injury and the risk of developing
cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders in later life. Hence, elucidation of the mechanisms that cause early
and progressive organ derangement in growth-restricted newborns is necessary to reduce infant and adult
morbidity and mortality. Urotensin II (UII), a potent vasoactive peptide modulates renal function, and its levels are
increased in infants with heart and kidney disease. Although its physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms
are unresolved, recent evidence suggests that the UII system can promote neurotransmission, thereby altering
organ function. Here, we propose a new concept that an increase in UII activity contributes to renal insufficiency
in growth-restricted newborns. UII stimulates peripheral sympathoexcitation via Ca2+-dependent tyrosine
hydroxylase phosphorylation, catecholamine biosynthesis, and neurotransmission. Sympathetic outflow elicited
by UII triggers kidney injury in the neonates. These concepts will be investigated in newborn pigs and a preclinical
porcine model of naturally-occurring human asymmetric IUGR. Using innovative procedures for translational
research, we will study renal function in small-for-gestational-age neonatal pigs and elucidate the function and
regulation of the UII system and the contribution of its components to 1) alterations in neonatal renal
hemodynamics and 2) renal insufficiency in growth-restricted infants. We anticipate that our proposed studies will

Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare metabolic disease due to PCCA or PCCB mutations. PA could develop various
complications even with dietary restriction. While gene therapy holds promise, it remains hampered by
challenges. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop novel, effective, and systemic therapy for PA.
PCC deficiency leads to propionyl-CoA accumulation, depleting free CoA and inhibiting acetyl-CoA synthesis.
This reduces the C2/C3 ratio from 11 to 0.08 in PA mouse model. Elevated propionyl-CoA disrupts acetyl-CoA-
involved pathways, impeding energy metabolism (propionyl-CoA, methylcitrate), causing hyperammonemia
(propionylglutamate), and affecting histone acetylation and gene transcription. Restoring the acetyl-CoA level,
particularly the C2/C3 ratio, is crucial to prevent metabolic alterations and subsequent propionyl-CoA-driven
pathology. Our preliminary data demonstrate the therapeutic efficiency of acetate supplementation, which
improves the C2/C3 ratio and further overall survival of Pcca-/-(A138T) mice.
Triacetin, an FDA-approved food additive, is a glycerol and acetic acid triester that undergoes rapid metabolism
into glycerol and acetate upon absorption. This makes it a secure and effective means of supplementing acetate.
Therefore, we hypothesize that balancing the acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA ratio via triacetin supplementation offers
therapeutic potential for PA, bolstering acetyl-CoA synthesis and competitively impeding propionate metabolism.
To test our hypothesis, we have formulated the following two specific aims. Aim 1. To evaluate the efficacy of
triacetin in rectifying metabolic abnormalities, cellular phenotypes and functions in human PA cells and its
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) in vitro. We will utilize human PA fibroblasts and PA
hepatocyte (PCCAA138T-HepG2) to examine whether triacetin can mitigate propionyl-CoA metabolism, cellular
phenotypes and function in vitro. PK/PD of triacetin will be examined to establish correlations between its efficacy
and these parameters. Aim 2. To assess the metabolic effects, therapeutic efficacy, and PK/PD of triacetin in
Pcca-/-(A138T) mice in vivo. To thoroughly validate the therapeutic effectiveness of triacetin, we will conduct an
in vivo study involving PK/PD analysis in Pcca-/-(A138T) mice. We will assess the metabolic impact of triacetin
supplementation by examining parameters such as the C2/C3 ratio and the levels of propionylcarnitine,
methylcitrate, and ammonium in the plasma and various tissues of Pcca-/-(A138T) mice. Additionally, we will
perform tissue histological evaluations and monitor overall survival to gain valuable insights into the therapeutic
potential of triacetin."

The overarching goal of the PI’s research program is to decode the intricate biophysical and biochemical
functions in diverse molecular processes underlined by the interplay among individual biomolecules and the
nanoscopic local environments. To achieve this goal, the proposed research program will focus on the tailor-
design of switchable and functional fluorophores and the integration of the probes with multi-dimensional single-
molecule imaging (md-SMI) techniques for multi-functional super-resolution microscopy (mf-SRM) and spatially-
resolved single-cell multi-omics. Super-resolution optical microscopy has enabled the visualization of subcellular
structures and protein molecules with resolution down to the true molecular level (< 5 nm). However, the
functional information (i.e., how the biomolecules and the environments interact with each other) within the
complex biological system remains elusive. A major bottleneck in decoding the functional information at the
single-molecule level is the incompatibility of the existing fluorophores for mf-SRM. Specifically, the (switchable)
fluorophores used in existing super-resolution microscopy are predominantly exploited to label and locate the
biomolecules and engineered to impose minimal changes responding to the environment thus incompatible in
functional imaging. Fluorescent sensors, on the other hand, have been extensively explored to report
environmental changes by capturing fluorescent responses (e.g., spectra, lifetime, polarization, intensity) to the
environment at the ensemble level. Yet, conventional fluorescent sensors are dim, non-switchable, and lack
subcellular molecular specificity, which are key requirements to operate mf-SRM. To address this challenge,
therefore, we propose to develop a toolbox of fluorescent sensors as single-molecule functional probes toward
mf-SRM. Four research thrusts will be pursued: (1) chromophore engineering to decouple intrinsic fluorescence
inhomogeneity at the molecular level from its nanoenvironment factors for hyperplexed mf-SRM strategy for
complex molecular interaction imaging related to the chromatin remodeling processes and their coordination with
transcription factors, (2) leveraging the development of single-molecule biophysical probes to study the role of
the physiochemical functional changes within the higher-order chromatin structure packing/unpacking processes
on the epigenetic, (3) developing photon upconversion-based fluorophores for simultaneous near-infrared
excitation towards parallel super-resolution interaction and functional imaging. The successful accomplishment
and dissemination of the proposed functional fluorophores and enabled mf-SRM imaging capabilities in (a) multi-
molecular interaction and (b) mapping the distinct nanoscale biophysical landscapes of subcellular architectures
in live cells are anticipated to have an immediate impact on enabling new experimental and computational studies
in the fields of chromatin epigenetics and spatially-resolved omics. The newly developed fluorescent probe
toolboxes will further promote scientific discoveries and innovations in a wide range of biomedical questions in
the fields of epigenetics, chromatin biology and cell biology"

The transition from curative-intent treatment to survivorship can be an overwhelming and confusing time for
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance for cancer recurrence is a critically important part of CRC
survivorship care, as CRC recurrences are common and may be curable if detected early. However, up to 60%
of the 1.5 million CRC survivors in the U.S. fail to receive surveillance as recommended by the American
Society for Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Among CRC survivors, there
are gaps in knowledge about the purpose of surveillance and the risk of cancer recurrence. Particularly
because CRC surveillance is a “package” of three separate components (CEA blood test, imaging,
endoscopy), knowledge about surveillance is key to survivors’ self-efficacy for managing surveillance. To
improve knowledge about and self-efficacy for managing surveillance and to promote effective supporter
engagement in surveillance, we developed an intervention prototype, Current Together After Cancer (CTAC),
for CRC survivors and their supporters. The objectives of the R01 are to evaluate the effectiveness of CTAC in
1) improving knowledge about and self-efficacy for managing surveillance and 2) improving receipt of
surveillance, while assessing factors that influence its implementation in diverse community oncology
practices. Our proposed study will leverage the resources of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program
(NCORP) and the SWOG Cancer Research Network to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of
CTAC vs. static online cancer survivorship information in 654 survivors with Stages II and III CRC. Survivors
will be randomized 2:1 to the CTAC arm and will be given the option to invite their supporter to participate with
them in the CTAC intervention. This innovative study has the following aims: (1) To determine the effect of
CTAC on key clinical outcomes: knowledge about and self-efficacy in managing surveillance, and receipt of
surveillance; (2) To explore the association of supporter inclusion in CTAC with survivors’ knowledge about
and self-efficacy for managing surveillance, receipt of surveillance, and satisfaction with supporter engagement
in surveillance; (3) To assess factors related to use of CTAC across diverse survivors and community oncology
practice settings. Through this series of Aims we expect to demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAC in
improving knowledge about and self-efficacy in managing, and receipt of, surveillance in a cohort of survivors
of stages II and III CRC. In addition, we expect to obtain new knowledge that will support the future population-
based implementation of CTAC. Improving knowledge about and self-efficacy in managing surveillance, and
improving receipt of surveillance, will lead to improved clinical outcomes for the large and growing population
of CRC survivors."
10941666,"The risk and burden of stroke are disparately experienced by racially and ethnically minoritized populations and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups; these disparities are substantial and persistent despite prior intervention attempts. Minoritized and disadvantaged people experience greater adverse social determinants of health, leading to greater health-related social needs (HRSN; i.e., food, transportation, housing). Routine post-stroke care adds more medications, medical appointments, and rehabilitation to patients’ and caregivers' already busy lives. The unexpected burden of HRSN imposed by stroke and recommendations for more medical care are major contributors to medication non-adherence among stroke survivors. New ideas are needed. In the words of a community advisory board member and a stroke caregiver, our new idea is to 'help you [stroke survivors and caregivers] do the best you can with what you got----what you can do right now. And if you get more, what can you do then?' The Advancing Community Connections and Calculating Risk to Optimize Stroke Survivorship (ACROSS) proposal seeks to meet stroke survivors where they are by 1) increasing stroke survivor capacity by providing linkages to personalized resources to address HRSN; 2) decreasing stroke survivor workload by reducing the burden of treatment by aligning medication regimens to stroke survivors' priorities. Our long-term goal is to decrease stroke disparities through community-engaged health equity research and interventions bridging the community and health system. ACROSS will be conducted in partnership with Flint, Michigan, and the South Side of Chicago, Illinois communities and will focus on Black, Latino/a/x, and socioeconomically disadvantaged stroke survivors with HRSN. The main objectives are to understand the lived experience of stroke survivors with HRSN (Aim 1); enhance existing HRSN community maps to include community stroke services (Aim 2); adapt a risk reduction calculator to provide personal estimates of the effects of various secondary stroke prevention medication regimens (Aim 3); and determine the acceptability and feasibility of the simple, personalized ACROSS intervention among stroke survivors from populations that experience health disparities (Aim 4). The Health Equity Research Partnership, our 13-year, highly productive academic-community partnership committed to stroke equity, is the cornerstone of ACROSS. Additionally, we partnered with the Flint Public Health Youth Academy and the Chicago- MAPSCorps program, a national model for training students from disinvested communities to work as community data scientists and advocates. Through meaningful community engagement, we will achieve clinical trial readiness, enhance community partnerships, invest in local public health capacity, and contribute to thriving communities to promote health equity."
10939667,"Abstract
Understanding how DNA is damaged and how the damage is repaired is critical. This is because DNA damage
contributes to genome instability, aging, and diseases, and DNA-damaging agents are used in chemotherapy.
Covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are ubiquitous and bulky DNA lesions. Despite that it has been well
accepted that DPCs are highly toxic, compared to other types of DNA damage, DPCs are much less well studied
mainly due to the lack of approaches to detect, quantify, and synthesize DPCs. My research program studies
DPCs at 3′-DNA termini (3′-DPCs) within single-strand breaks (SSBs). They are derived from the
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that is one of the most frequently formed DNA lesions and induced by many
endogenous and exogenous genotoxins including some anti-cancer drugs. If left unrepaired, 3′-DPCs will block
DNA replication and transcription, prevent the SSB repair, cause genome instability, and may lead to cell death.
We hypothesize that 3′-DPC formation is a previously uncharacterized cytotoxic mechanism of the AP site and
its inducing agents, 3′-DPCs are new biomarkers of oxidative stress-related diseases, and inhibiting 3′-DPC
repair will synergize DNA methylating agents. Our goal is to elucidate the formation and repair mechanisms of
3′-DPCs. In past work, we have detected 3′-DPCs in human cells using a novel mass spectrometry pipeline, but
their cellular abundance and to what extent they are induced by genotoxins are unknown. We have chemically
synthesized 3′-DPCs and demonstrated that they can be repaired by three human nucleases, but only when the
cross-linked proteins are initially digested by trypsin. How 3′-DPCs are proteolyzed in cells remains elusive. We
will fill these knowledge gaps. Notably, during studying 3′-DPC repair, we discovered in vitro that proteolyzed 3′-
DPCs and an AP site repair intermediate (i.e., 3′-PUA) are excised by human three-prime repair exonuclease 1
(TREX1). This unexpected finding is the first to report a direct role of TREX1 in DNA repair and challenges the
previous notion. It opened a new and exciting research direction that we will also pursue in this MIRA application.
Our hypothesis is that TREX1 is a 3′-DNA lesion processing enzyme and a promising therapeutic target. Our
goal is to delineate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of TREX1 in DNA repair. We will focus on several
important questions. For instance, does TREX1 play a role in cells in response to DNA damage? If so, is that
dependent on its exonuclease activity? And how is TREX1 recruited and regulated? We will address these
questions and study 3′-DPC formation and repair mechanisms using interdisciplinary techniques including
organic synthesis, quantitative mass spectrometry, proteomics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology-based
approaches. This research will advance fundamental understanding of DNA damage and repair. Such new
knowledge will inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions."
10940573,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Protein sequences can be broadly categorized into two classes: those which adopt stable secondary structure
and fold into a domain (i.e., globular proteins), and those that do not. This latter class of sequences are
conformationally heterogeneous and are described as being intrinsically disordered. Structural biology has
enabled the development of bioinformatic approaches that can sub-classify globular sequences by domain type,
an approach that has revolutionized how we understand and predict protein functionality. Conversely, it is
unknown if protein intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which cannot be resolved by structural biology, are
subject to broadly generalizable organizational principles that would enable their sub-classification and the a
priori prediction of function.
Protein Low Complexity Domains (LCDs) are a class of IDRs enriched in a small subset of amino acids. By
simply gazing at LCDs, local sequence biases are evident. We hypothesized that the non-uniform distribution of
amino acids with LCDs may be a conspicuous manifestation of a more general organizational principle widely
operative in IDRs. We therefore developed a statistical approach that quantifies linear variance in amino acid
composition across a sequence. This algorithm has led to the surprisingly discovery that IDRs are non-randomly
organized into juxtaposed modules of distinct compositional bias. This type of sequence organization is present
across the three domains of life and in IDRs of both low and high sequence complexity. Our data show that this
sequence organizational principle is broadly operative and suggest a hitherto unappreciated level of logic and
interpretability in this enigmatic class of sequences. Motivated by these observations, this proposal seeks to use
the logic of modularity to comprehensively classify IDRs, develop a predictive understanding of IDR function,
and define how the modular architecture of disordered sequences impacts their conformation and function.
In Aim 1 we will use computation and quantitative metrics to categorically cluster modules in order to assess
both the evolutionary diversification of IDRs and to relate module types (and thus IDRs) with specific functions.
In Aim 2 and Aim 3 we will undertake in vitro and in vivo functional studies targeting two model disordered
sequences. Specifically, we will determine how the unique modular structure of a DNA-binding IDR and a
desiccation-tolerant IDR relates to their in vitro conformation and function using biochemical assays and related
in cellula approaches. Altogether, these studies will provide the first comprehensive classification of IDRs to
enable a priori functional predictions for disordered sequences, and the proposed functional studies will delineate
how modularity impacts conformation and function. Altogether, this work will usher in a new level of interpretability
and predictability in our understanding of the functional mechanism of IDRs."
10940498,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Societies are organized into hierarchies, which fundamentally involve social conflict. As a result, there are
winners and losers, and social defeat can profoundly impact animals, with the potential to induce abnormal
behavior and disease. In this research interest statement, I propose the social ant Harpegnathos saltator as a
novel model system to study how epigenetic factors and gene regulation modulate neuronal circuitry resulting in
specific social behaviors. The social ant Harpegnathos saltator is an emerging model to study epigenetics of the
social behavior because the distinct caste phenotypes of workers and gamergates are specified by the same
genome. Unlike most ant species, Harpegnathos individuals can change caste through adulthood: when the
queen dies or is removed from a colony, workers enter a dominance tournament until a few become reproductive
individuals, called gamergates. Along with changes to behavior and physiology, gamergate status is
accompanied by a six-fold lifespan extension and changes in neuronal gene expression and chromatin
organization. This transition to gamergate can also be completely reversed by inducing social defeat in
gamergates. Our research will address two major topics of epigenetic regulation in the social brain. First, how
do social interactions like social bonding, aggression and social defeat induce epigenetic changes responsible
for long-lasting behavioral phenotypes? Second, we plan to develop ant models of autism spectrum disorders
by generating mutants of ant homologs to human ASD risk genes. We will study the impact of these mutations
on chromatin organization, gene expression and behavior in both castes. Harpegnathos ants can provide
mechanistic insights into connection between epigenetic pathways, behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders."

 Chronic inflammation has emerged as a potential pathway linking low-socioeconomic status (SES) with
disease risk; however, the development of SES disparities in inflammatory risk from adolescence to adulthood
is not well understood and there remains uncertainty over the underlying pathways. This transitional period
often involves normative changes in social relationships and sleep behavior. Given that psychosocial stress
and sleep disruption have both been implicated in inflammatory pathways, the transition from adolescence to
adulthood may be an ideal developmental period to assess SES associations with inflammation and elucidate
the psychosocial and biobehavioral factors that may underlie these associations. The present study will utilize
two independent datasets to assess SES links with inflammation at multiple levels, i.e., via circulating levels of
inflammatory markers and via gene expression of inflammatory pathways. The research will identify potential
psychosocial factors (i.e., social isolation, stress, discrimination) and biobehavioral factors (i.e., changes in
sleep duration and quality) that may explain how SES creates risk for a pro-inflammatory state.
 Data from the first study were collected as a part of a longitudinal study of adolescent health and
experiences, in which N=350 youth were followed from the 10th/11th grade into 3-years post-high school.
Adolescents reported on psychosocial experiences, measured sleep via actigraphy for 8 nights, and provided
dried blood spot (DBS) samples to assess inflammation. Data from the second study will be collected from
N=150 young adults of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds at three time points throughout the first year of
college, in which participants report on psychosocial experiences during the transition to college, report on their
sleep duration and quality, and provide a DBS sample. The two datasets will be used to address three aims: 1)
investigate the relationship between SES and inflammation across the transition from adolescence to
adulthood, 2) identify psychosocial experiences that link SES with inflammation and 3) examine the role of
sleep in the association between SES and inflammation. It is hypothesized that low-SES will be significantly
associated with inflammatory risk, and that low-SES youth will show greater increases in inflammation over
time. Secondly, it is hypothesized that low-SES will be associated with adverse psychosocial experiences and
that these experiences will statistically mediate associations between SES and inflammation. Finally, it is
hypothesized that low-SES will be associated with poorer quality sleep, and that disruptions to sleep will
statistically mediate associations between SES and inflammation. Findings from this work will contribute to the
literature’s understanding of the biologic embedding of SES in health and can be used to inform interventions
aimed at reducing health risk for low-SES youth."

We identified preliminary proof-of-concept metabolomic markers for human LuCa from paired tissue and blood
serum samples from pre-symptomatic LuCA patients. The markers can be used as imaging probes for Luca
characterization. To validate the efficacy of the markers for classifying LuCa, we propose to evaluate and
enhance their capability as probes for LuCa detection and ultimately advance LuCa early-detection using
serum metabolomic markers. The project’s goal will be achieved through tasks in the following three specific
aims: 1) To evaluate the efficacy of tissue-serum LuCa MRS metabolomic probes identified in a successful
preliminary project, by comparison with an additional 200 pairs of tissue and serum specimens and 200 serum
samples from matched healthy controls, 2) To measure tissue-serum LuCa MRS metabolomic probes with

serum MS LuCa probes, and 3) To test LuCa metabolomics probes using 200 serum samples collected before

The overall goal of this project is to develop tandem mass spectrometry for newborn screening
of a subset of congenital diseases in neonates in which initiation of early treatment leads to a
better patient quality of life. A punch from a dried blood spot on a newborn screening card is
used as the sample to measure the activities of relevant enzymes and to quantify disease
biomarkers. These assays are multiplexed together in order to minimize the workload in the
newborn screening laboratory so that an increasing number of diseases can be included (as
new treatments become available). Tandem mass spectrometry is also being developed for use
in the second stage of newborn screening in order to reduce the number of false positives
resulting from only a single stage of analysis. This is important to reduce patient follow-up and
associated costs and to reduce family anxiety. A third component is to test the hypothesis that
the lower the level of residual function of a particular protein, the more severe is the disease.
Predicting disease severity including age of onset of symptoms is important in planning follow-
up and treatment options in newborns who screen positive for a disease."
10912465,"ABSTRACT:
Ischemia, caused by restriction of blood flow, often results in severe tissue damage. Critical limb ischemia (CLI)
is a serious condition in which peripheral artery disease (PAD) leads to irreversible limb muscle damage. About
40% of CLI patients undergo limb amputation one year after diagnosis, and 50% die after five years. Current
treatment options focus on improving limb perfusion but these often fail to prevent disease progression,
pointing to a critical need for a deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms regulating human muscle
regeneration and how they are disrupted by ischemic damage. In the long-term, this information may lead to
new regenerative treatment strategies for limb salvage that are independent of limb perfusion. Recent studies
suggest that failure of skeletal muscle regeneration is key to determining tissue loss in CLI versus repair.
Successful muscle regeneration requires the orchestrated activation, proliferation and differentiation of muscle
stem cells (MuSCs, also known as satellite cells) that are normally quiescent. In our preliminary analysis of
MuSCs from one representative CLI patient, we found that the transcription of genes important for MuSC
regeneration are dysregulated in ischemia, and that these changes are associated with rearrangements in 3D
chromatin organization. These finding support the hypothesis that CLI involves a failure in the normal dynamic
reorganization of 3D chromatin structure that orchestrates the regeneration of MuSCs. The overall objectives
of this study are to identify the spatial-temporal changes of chromatin organization (the 4D nucleome, 4DN)
normally associated with regenerative human MuSCs, and to understand the functional consequences of
defects in this mechanism for muscle damage in CLI."

Until now, CRISPR has not been readily applied to isolate linked genome-wide association studies (GWAS) alleles as
Cas9 tends to re-cut the donor template. Our project will be the first to establish that CRISPR-edited cells can be
used to isolate closely linked alleles in a GWAS-associated disease. Furthermore, research on age-related
conditions uses traditional cultured cells as the metabolic backdrop for studies. Given that these rapidly proliferating cells
more closely resemble embryonic cells than aged adult cells, they likely do not provide the appropriate environment to
study the molecular biology of aging. Here, we propose to use cells that have been pharmacologically aged, enabling
our model to better recapitulate the conditions present in the older adult eye, and ultimately identify appropriate areas of
intervention. By using this innovative approach, we will develop a patient-specific disease model to test not only the
particular mutations addressed in this application, but also other mutations and, potentially, other age-related retinal
diseases down the road."

The human gut microbiome harbors microbes with the capacity to cause infection or drive pathogenic
inflammation. Immune status often determines risk for microbiome-associated disease, which is typically
attributed to immune impacts on microbial community composition. But pathogenic or commensal lifestyles can
also be dynamically regulated within individual microbes, and there is far less understood about immune
impacts on microbial inherent pathogenic potential. Candida albicans is a morphologically and transcriptionally
dynamic commensal fungus that can cause life-threatening infections and exacerbate pathogenic
inflammation. The ability for C. albicans to cause disease depends on its phenotypic state. Of particular
importance is the formation of hyphae, which are elongated cells specialized for adherence and invasion, and
promote disease in both infection and inflammatory settings. Immune status is crucial for determining risk for
C. albicans-associated disease and both immune deficiencies and active inflammation are linked to C. albicans
pathogenesis. However, the role of immune environment on in vivo C. albicans pathogenic potential is not well
understood. Here, I will investigate the impact of two human relevant immune environments on C. albicans
pathogenic potential. Project 1 will focus on IgA regulation of C. albicans biology. Anti-C. albicans IgA
antibodies are found in the gut of most people, and I previously found that C. albicans hyphae and associated
effectors are heavily targeted by IgA during colonization. In mouse models, IgA targeting is associated with
reduced hyphae and reduced capacity to exacerbate colitis. Here, I will interrogate mechanisms by which IgA
regulates C. albicans biology in vivo using a mouse colonization model that permits investigation of immediate
regulatory impacts of IgA targeting on C. albicans biology. Using this model, I will interrogate IgA impacts on C.
albicans morphology and gene expression, which will include single cell transcriptional profiling to investigate
gene expression in individual IgA-targeted cells. The goal of Project 2 is to define the impacts of inflammation
on C. albicans pathogenic potential. Evidence from human IBD studies and mouse models of colitis suggest
that this fungus exploits inflammation to bloom and perpetuate disease. Here, I will use a mouse model of
intestinal colitis to define inflammation-dependent impacts on C. albicans morphology and transcriptional
profile, with the goal of defining C. albicans pathways responsible for disease exacerbation. This proposal will
reveal fundamental mechanisms by which immune environment regulates C. albicans biology and advance our
understanding of how C. albicans becomes pathogenic in certain people. Broadly, these efforts will provide a
foundation for our long-term goal of identifying targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent commensal C.
albicans reservoirs from causing disease."

 Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections (intestinal worms) affect 1.5 billion individuals
globally. Recent evidence from trials and modeling studies suggests that community-wide mass
drug administration (cMDA) of deworming medication with sufficient coverage and adherence
can eliminate STH transmission. However, in settings with ongoing environmental transmission
and low coverage of networked sanitation, persistent environmental reservoirs of STH eggs
result in high reinfection rates and hinder progress towards elimination.
 STH control programs use human stool-based methods to assess STH prevalence and
intensity in endemic settings. However, individual stool sampling is expensive and logistically
difficult, particularly when human infection prevalence is low. If collecting and analyzing soil from
locations in communities with high human activity (e.g. home entrances, water points, schools)
were established to be equally or more sensitive than human stool diagnostics, this approach
may represent a less invasive and more cost-effective surveillance tool for MDA program
monitoring and evaluation.
 This study will leverage a multi-country cluster-randomized controlled trial delivering
three-years of biannual cMDA in Benin and India (DeWorm3). The trial will collect and analyze
human stool samples 6 months and 24 months (n=120,000 in total) after the final round of
cMDA, which will yield highly accurate human STH infection prevalence estimates in the study
areas. Through extensive laboratory studies and field testing in India and Benin, our team has
developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH environmental DNA
(eDNA) in large volumes of soil. We will nest soil sampling within the trial at the same time
points as human stool collection with the specific aims to: 1) Quantify the effect of a biannual
cMDA intervention on the soil STH reservoir; 2) Determine whether soil STH eDNA levels can
predict community-level human STH infection prevalence; and 3) Develop the optimal soil
sampling strategy and compare costs to human stool-based surveillance.
 Pairing soil STH eDNA assessments with human infection prevalence data already
being collected by the DeWorm3 trial is a unique and time sensitive opportunity to validate and
test the utility of environmental STH surveillance. Our findings will also contribute to
understanding the conditions under which MDA program integration with improved sanitation
interventions is needed for achieving sustained reductions in STH infection prevalence."
10938365,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RATIONALE: Pulmonary vascular remodeling is a pathological feature of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
(PAH) that ultimately leads to death. Pulmonary Arterial Endothelial Cells (PAECs) are critical regulators of
pulmonary artery homeostasis. During PAH, PAECs undergo metabolic changes (Warburg effect) and PAECs
dysfunction that leads to a pro-proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype that causes Pulmonary Vascular
Remodeling. Current therapies targeted at the vasomotor tone and inflammatory regulators have improved
prognosis, however, do not remedy vascular remodeling. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is
the rate-limiting protein in NAD+ synthesis. NAMPT overexpression upregulates glycolysis, promotes pulmonary
vascular remodeling, and contributes to PAH pathobiology. The Loss or pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT
attenuates PH in animal models, indicating its therapeutic potential. However, there is a gap in our understanding
of the cellular mechanisms by which NAMPT promotes PAECs dysfunction and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Sirtuin3 (Sirt 3), an NAD+ dependent deacetylase enzyme involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, has been
implicated in PAH, as Sirt 3 KO mice were shown to develop experimental PH. Based on these observations,
we hypothesize that in the glycolytic environment characteristic of PAH, Nampt in human PAECs (hPAECs)
impairs Sirt 3 function to cause a metabolic reprogramming mediated PAEC dysfunction, and vascular
remodeling. METHODS: To investigate the hypothesis, NAMPT, an appropriate control, and a NAMPT construct
lacking enzymatic activity will be overexpressed in hPAECs using lentiviral particles at 20 MOI for 24hrs. This
model is advantageous as it ensures stable gene expression and further experimentation. Experiments proposed
in AIM 1 will permit the evaluation of NAMPT in regulating the function of SIRT3/SOD2 (Manganese-dependent
Superoxide Dismutase) axis to promote hPAECs dysfunction. The evaluation will be performed using seahorse
metabolic assay, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, oxidative stress assays, SIRT 3 activity assay, and
SOD2 activity assay. AIM 2 will address how NAMPT leads to the metabolic reprogramming of PAECs in vivo
to promote PAH. Conditional NAMPT EC (Endothelial Cell) overexpressing (OE) mice and conditional NAMPT
EC deficient mice (KO) models will be utilized. Hemodynamic studies assessing pulmonary artery remodeling,
right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular systolic pressures will be performed, and harvested PAECs
subjected to metabolic and SIRT3 activity assays. CONCLUSIONS: These studies when completed will help
show that NAMPT overexpression can promote endothelial dysfunction via Sirt3 activity inhibition, resulting in
an increase in SOD2 acetylation which could lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
promoting vascular remodeling and PH pathogenesis."

This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development application will support Dr. Matthew McGraw in
his transition to independence as a clinician scientist studying the mechanisms of airway basal cell dysfunction
in chemical-induced bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). BO is a devastating fibrotic airways disease, most commonly
seen after organ transplant. However, BO is becoming more frequently associated with inhalation exposures to
certain viruses or chemicals. One of the most well-known chemicals associated with inhalation-induced BO is
diacetyl (DA; 2,3-butanedione), a highly reactive diketone found in foods, coffee and e-cigarettes. Despite DA’s
common use as a flavoring additive, the mechanisms of DA-induced BO remain poorly understood. Central to
BO development is injury to the airway epithelium. When injured, the airway relies on epithelial progenitor cells
for proper repair. The objective of this application is to better understand the functional role of airway basal cells,
the primary progenitor cell of the human airway, in chemical-induced BO. Two preclinical models of chemical-
induced BO were developed for this application. First, rats exposed consecutively to DA vapors developed
persistent hypoxemia, reduced weight gain, and histologic evidence of BO. Poly-ubiquitinated proteins
accumulated in rat airways after DA exposures not seen in air controls. Second, in human airway epithelial cells
exposed to DA vapors, poly-ubiquitinated proteins accumulated and co-localized primarily with airway basal
cells. With repetitive DA exposures, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins resulted in proteotoxicity of
airway basal cells. Our central hypothesis is repetitive DA vapor exposures results in abundant protein damage,
leading to proteotoxicity of airway basal cells, impairing airway epithelial repair and promoting BO development.
Aim I of this proposal will determine how abundant protein damage in airway basal cells impairs epithelial repair
and promotes BO development using both models of repetitive DA vapor exposure. Aim II will determine the role
of the ubiquitin proteasome system in airway basal cell toxicity and BO development. Aim III will compare the
efficacy of multiple ubiquitin proteasome pathway drug targets in preventing basal cell toxicity and BO
development. Dr. McGraw has assembled a mentoring team of experts in the fields of airway epithelial biology
(T Mariani, PhD; primary), inhalation toxicology (JN Finkelstein, PhD; I Rahman, PhD), and proteomics (WJ Qian,
PhD) for critically examining the role of airway basal cells in chemical-induced BO. Mentoring in airway stem cell
biology and proteomics, as described in this proposal, will facilitate Dr. McGraw’s transition to independence. At
K08 completion, the data generated from this application will significantly advance our understanding of airway
basal cell function following inhalation exposures and have a broader impact on neighboring research fields of
inhalation toxicology and BO development."
10911258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The basic mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are unknown. We are only beginning to
understand how the human brain extracts the most fundamental linguistic elements (consonants and vowels)
from a complex and highly variable acoustic signal. Traditional theories have posited a ‘universal’ phonetic
inventory shared by all humans, but this has been challenged by other newer theories that each language has
its own unique and specialized code. An investigation of the cortical representation of speech sounds across
languages can likely shed light on this fundamental question. Previous research has implicated the superior
temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds. Most of this work has been entirely carried out in English.
The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface from individuals with different language
experience is a promising approach since it can provide both high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we
propose to examine the mechanisms of phonetic encoding, by utilizing neurophysiological recordings obtained
during neurosurgical procedures. High-density electrode arrays, advanced signal processing, and direct
electrocortical stimulation will be utilized to unravel both local and population encoding of speech sounds in the
lateral temporal cortex. We will examine neural encoding of speech in patients who are monolingual and bilingual
in Mandarin, Spanish, and English, the most common spoken languages worldwide and feature important
contrastive differences of pitch, formant, and temporal envelope. We will test a novel hypothesis that speech
processing across languages will reflect a general auditory encoding of relevant phonetic properties, but that
processing is modified by language-specific “tuning”. A cross-linguistic approach to the neural encoding of
speech will powerfully advance our understanding of how the brain processes sound pattern variability within
and across languages. This will provide fundamental insights into the shared mechanisms of auditory processing
and experience-dependent plasticity in humans. The results may have significant implications for the
development of new diagnostic and rehabilitative strategies for language and neurological disorders (e.g.,
aphasia, dyslexia, autism). Furthermore, this proposal strives to achieve a broader view of diversity and
inclusion in the neuroscience of language."
10911264,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The goal of this R01 proposal is to investigate a novel molecular mechanism by
which extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP), released from microglial cells upon alcohol
exposure, leads to tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is the 6th leading cause of death in the US
and the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. Although studies link heavy alcohol drinking to
AD, the underlying mechanisms have not been sufficiently explored. We have shown that eCIRP is a critical
mediator of memory impairment induced by exposure to binge-drinking levels of alcohol, leading us to
postulate that eCIRP may be a key player in the relationship between alcohol and AD. Indeed, we discovered
that eCIRP was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. We also showed that alcohol increased the
brain levels of eCIRP in an animal model of binge alcohol drinking, and that microglial cells are the probable
source of eCIRP in the brain after alcohol exposure. Moreover, eCIRP increased tau phosphorylation and
upregulated the Cdk5 hyperactivator p25 via the direct binding to and activation of the interleukin-6 receptor α
(IL-6Rα)/STAT3 pathway. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that alcohol-induced microglial cell-
derived eCIRP activates the neuronal IL-6Rα/STAT3/Cdk5 pathway, leading to pathological tau phosphoryl-
ation and aggregation. We also showed that the CIRP-derived peptide C23 effectively inhibited the activation
of the IL-6Rα/STAT3/Cdk5 pathway induced by eCIRP. Therefore, we further hypothesize that treatment with
C23 attenuates the development of alcohol-induced tau pathology. In this project, we plan to further establish
the role of alcohol-induced microglial cell-derived eCIRP in pathological tau phosphorylation and aggregation.
We will then elucidate the molecular mechanism through which eCIRP produces AD-like pathological tau
phosphorylation and aggregation. Finally, we will examine whether inhibition of eCIRP with C23 attenuates tau
phosphorylation and aggregation after exposures to binge-drinking levels of alcohol. These studies will provide
novel pivotal insights into the mechanisms responsible for the influence of heavy alcohol drinking on the
pathogenesis of AD, as well as a new potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD patients in the future."
10911386,"Abstract
Chronic pain represents a major public health concern, and aging confers increased risk for chronic pain, with
half of older adults reporting persistent or recurring pain, and aging is associated with greater pain-related loss
of physical and psychosocial function. Current knowledge regarding pain and aging is surprisingly limited, and
future progress in the field hinges on the availability of well-trained scientists who have an appreciation for
preclinical and clinical research approaches to the study of both aging and pain. To address this unmet need,
we developed a new postdoctoral training program: the Integrative and Multidisciplinary Pain and Aging
Research Training (IMPART) Program, and we propose to extend and expand this program via this competing
renewal. The overall goal of the IMPART program is to develop outstanding independent investigators capable
of sustaining productive clinical and translational research careers addressing the biopsychosocial mechanisms
underlying age-related changes in the experience of pain and/or designing clinical interventions to ameliorate
acute and chronic pain among older adults. In order to accomplish this overarching goal, the specific aims of this
new postdoctoral training program in pain and aging research are to: 1) Recruit and train promising junior
investigators to conduct mechanistically-based and clinically relevant translational research in pain and aging;
2) Implement an integrated didactic and experiential training program, which will equip trainees with new
research skills and the knowledge and expertise to apply these skills to address important and unanswered
questions regarding pain and aging; and 3) Create a culture of research excellence in order to ensure that
trainees aspire to the high standards of scientific integrity and quality, which will set the tone for their future
careers in pain and aging research. IMPART leverages two excellent and collaborative research programs at
the University of Florida – the aging research community represented by the Institute on Aging (IOA), and the
pain research community, organized under the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence (PRICE).
We have been highly successful in recruiting and training an outstanding and diverse group of trainees during
the initial funding cycle. Each member of the training faculty boasts an excellent track record of both research
funding and mentoring experience. The proposed program requests support for six postdoctoral trainees from
a variety of training backgrounds, each of whom will work with their multidisciplinary mentoring team to create
and implement a tailored independent development plan as the blueprint for their training. Trainees will achieve
their research and career development objectives through a combination of didactic, research, and professional
development activities, and program evaluation will be ongoing and multimodal. The IMPART Program is
committed to promoting diversity among our trainees, and the program will provide a training experience that
emphasizes excellence in research integrity and ethics."
10911030,"This is a second submission of a CDA2 application by Alexander Bullen MD, under the mentorship of Dena
Rifkin, a researcher at VA Medical Center in San Diego. This proposal will establish Dr. Bullen as an
independent clinical investigator and will rigorously evaluate how markers of tubular dysfunction are
associated with development, progression, and recovery of acute kidney injury.
Candidate: Dr. Bullen’s career goals are: 1) to improve understanding on associations between tubular
dysfunction and AKI; 2) to become proficient at novel biomarkers methodology and translation to patient-
oriented research; 3) to gain expertise in advanced statistical methods for biomarker analyses; and 4) to
develop an independent research program. To accomplish these goals, he has assembled a multidisciplinary
mentorship team comprised of a primary mentor, Dena Rifkin, a leading VA researcher with Merit Award
funding and extensive experience in research design in kidney disease and the following additional co-mentors
and advisors: Joachim Ix, an established expert on tubular aspect of kidney disease in design and
implementation of clinical trials as well as insight to the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)
utilized for Aim 1 and REGARDS utilized for Aim 2; Edward Siew, MD, an expert in clinical research and
biomarkers in AKI with expertise in the Validating Acute Lung Injury Biomarkers for Diagnosis (VALID) used for
Aim 3, and Ronit Katz PhD, a statistician with expertise experience in kidney research, collaborative history
with Drs. Bullen, Rifkin, and Ix, and experience in utilizing the SPRINT and REGARDS data.
Research: AKI plays an important role in the non-linear progression of CKD. Factors at the time when patients
are healthy that predispose to future AKI risk are likely to give insights not only to risk of AKI but also to CKD.
Dr. Bullen’s overall hypothesis is that measurement of tubular cell dysfunction may not only provide clinical
utility for future AKI risk assessment but may also provide important insights to mechanisms leading to AKI
acutely, and to its recovery. In Aim 1, he will expand upon the markers of tubule dysfunction evaluated in pilot
data and examine longitudinal changes in markers to determine if trajectories of worsening tubule function
predict AKI above and beyond a single baseline value. His prior work in SPRINT evaluates tubule function in
stable outpatients and risk for subsequent AKI secondary to dehydration/hypotension. In Aim 2, he will expand
his research to investigate other causes of AKI, evaluating the association between tubule cell dysfunction at
times of health and future risk of AKI due to infection, a common cause of AKI among Veterans. Finally, in Aim
3, he will examine tubule function at the time of ICU admission among the VALID cohort and determine
whether the function markers predict short-term risk of AKI and determine how tubule dysfunction markers
change during episodes of AKI."
10911031,"It is well known that alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly co-morbid with both depression and
chronic pain. Chronic pain and depression are particularly high and debilitating in the veteran
population. The majority of research in AUD has been in samples of participants without co-
occurring disorders since research typically excludes common co-morbidities from recruitment.
Therefore, we would benefit enormously from studies where we include these co-morbidities,
examine them, and build a neural signature (constellation of neuroimaging and clinical
symptoms) of chronic pain and depression in AUD as a model to test with advanced machine
learning algorithms. What is currently unknown is the neurobiological and neurochemical
patterns that form a brain signature (the neural circuitry) of depression and of chronic pain within
AUD. This study will use multi-modal neuroimaging data and behavioral symptomology
measures to attain the overall objective of this proposal, which is to delineate the separate and
overlapping contributions of co-morbid depression and chronic pain brain signatures on the
neural signature of AUD. We will use advanced computational modeling algorithms (machine
learning) of clinical and multi-modality neuroimaging data. Results from this proposal will
provide a deeper understanding of AUD neurobiology and will identify a pattern of neural
circuitry that signifies depression versus chronic pain in AUD neurobiology as the scientific basis
for individualized precision medicine treatment approaches that target AUD co-morbidities of
depression and chronic pain.
My overarching career goal as an independent investigator is to build a multidisciplinary
research program on neuroimaging of substance use disorders. I will achieve this by clarifying
brain mechanisms contributing to co-occurring symptomology (depression, chronic pain) that
often presents in substance use disorders and particularly high and debilitating in Veterans. A
better understanding of to what extent behavior and co-morbid symptomatology relates to brain
neurobiology could facilitate more accurate predictive modeling of individual treatment response
and relapse using multi-modal imaging and advanced computational analyses methods.
My short-term research goals for this career mentored proposal are to identify the separate
and overlapping neural mechanisms of co-morbidities (depression and chronic pain) prevalent
in alcohol use disorders, and relate these mechanisms to behavior and relapse risk in Veterans.
These goals will be accomplished using state-of-the art multi-modal neuroimaging techniques
(whole-brain magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging, resting state functional MR
imaging) which will be directly related to clinical/behavioral measures and self-report
questionnaires of depression and pain, combined with the use of advanced computational
analysis methods such as machine learning techniques of neuroimaging and clinical measures."
10911032,"Liver fibrosis represents the body’s response to chronic liver injury and appears to be similar
mechanistically to the fibrogenic response in other organs. The result of hepatic fibrogenesis is cirrhosis,
which results in many serious and life-threatening complications. The fibrogenic process is complicated,
yet integrated and tightly regulated. The pathobiology of fibrogenesis includes elements of increased
production of extracellular matrix proteins, tissue contraction, and ultimately, disruption of normal tissue
structure architecture. It has been well established over the last 2 decades that a key cellular effector of
this process in the liver is the hepatic stellate cell. Hepatic stellate cells exhibit a unique characteristic in
that after injury in that they become activated and transform into myofibroblasts. This myofibroblastic
transition is characterized not only by increased production of extracellular matrix (resulting in fibrosis),
but also the programmed expression of multiple different smooth muscle specific proteins, such as the
smooth muscle isoform of actin (smooth muscle  actin - also Acta2), the smooth muscle isoform of
heavy chain myosin, and others. Our hypothesis is that the myofibroblast (i.e., smooth muscle)
transition, through the actin cytoskeleton, is critical in hepatic fibrogenesis; therefore, manipulation of this
program in stellate cells and has the ability to inhibit extracellular matrix production and fibrosis both at
the cellular level and in the liver during injury.
 This proposal seeks to break new ground toward a deeper understanding of the molecular basis for
the myofibroblast transition during stellate cell activation after liver injury. We have found that the family
of transcription factors, including myocardin and myocardin related transcription factor, are upregulated
during the myofibroblast transition, and are critical regulators of the smooth muscle protein program
typical of activated stellate cells (myofibroblasts). We present novel preliminary data revealing that the
miR-143/145 complex, important in smooth muscle programming, is important in this process. Therefore,
the goals of this proposal are (1) to study multiple aspects of miR-143/145 molecular regulation and the
functional effects of miR-143/145 depletion in stellate cells and in whole liver after injury and (2) to
investigate the biological effects of myocardin, a key transcriptional regulator of the smooth muscle
program, in stellate cells, in vitro and in vivo. Because myofibroblasts are ubiquitous to many forms of
parenchymal organ wound healing, the proposed studies have substantial implications for wound healing
biology not only in the liver, but also in other organ systems.
 The proposed studies are highly innovative because we will elucidate basic mechanisms underlying
the stellate cell to myofibroblast transformation and thus the fibrogenic cascade. As such, targeted
approaches to interrupt this pathway will have a significant impact on Veterans with chronic liver
disease because the data will lead to novel therapeutics that may be used to treat (reduce or prevent)
liver fibrosis."
10935863,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and a rising cause of cancer mortality.
HCC related to metabolic stress is on the rise, with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) rapidly becoming the
dominant etiology. We hypothesize that stress-induced metabolic reprogramming via NRF2 and ATF6
alters, glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism to augment glycolysis and induce mitochondrial
dysfunction through STARD1 and SAB, which collaborates with genetic alterations to accelerate NASH
progression to HCC through a self-sustained downward spiral. Interference with key components of this
network may suppress HCC progression and can yield novel interceptive strategies. Our preliminary data
indicate that interactions between the cytosol and nucleus (AKT;NRF2), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; ATF6)
and mitochondria (STARD1+SAB) contribute synergistically to NASH-driven HCC. Elimination of any of these
components attenuates HCC and their activation exacerbates HCC progression in murine models. Together, our
outstanding team of investigators will address the pathological significance and mechanisms underlying the
crosstalk between these pathways via 3 projects: Project 1 will interrogate how the newly discovered NRF2-
FBP1 tug-of-war is regulated to support HCC progression. It will identify the first cells in which NRF2 and
AKT are activated to drive FBP1 degradation and the cues that trigger this switch. Lineage tracing will determine
whether NRF2-high HCC directly originates from FBP1-high senescent NASH hepatocytes and the role of diet-
induced DNA damage in hepatocyte senescence and mutagenesis will be elucidated. Project 2 will define how
ATF6 drives HCC in response to metabolic stress. It will uncover the mechanism by which ER stress and the
unfolded protein response transducer ATF6 promotes NASH progression to HCC, likely through NRF2 and FBP1
degradation, the reprogramming of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, and will test whether and how ATF6 ablation
or inhibition abrogate NASH-driven HCC. Project 3 will explore how metabolic stress and cholesterol trigger
mitochondrial dysfunction through STARD1 and SAB to drive HCC. Mitochondrial outer membrane proteins
STARD1 and SAB may contribute to NASH and HCC development through altered cholesterol trafficking and
bile acid synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction that triggers ROS production, resulting in NRF2 and ATF6
activating oxidative and/or ER stress. This PPG offers an unprecedented opportunity for advanced
understanding of NASH-driven HCC via proximal metabolic regulators and DNA damage controlled by NRF2,
ATF6, and STARD1/SAB. Extensive collaborative interactions and coordinated administrative resources (Core
A), shared use of dietary and transgenic mouse models, metabolic profiling/flux studies (Core 1) and extensive
“omic” and bioinformatic analyses (Core 2) will further enhance collaborations and ensure uniform success
throughout all projects. This P01 offers a unique translational opportunity to define how energy rich diets impact
regulators that promote NASH progression to HCC, generating new preventive and therapeutic strategies."

The All of Us Research Program (AoU) has created a national research dataset unprecedented in 
size, diversity, and scope to advance precision medicine. However, data utilization is not yet 
commensurate with the power and potential impact, and researchers utilizing the dataset are not 
yet representative of communities historically underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR). 
The AoU's innovative cloud-based, centralized data governance requires broad professional 
development training for researchers, with a focus on informatics literacy and technical resources 
to support analysis within the AoU Researcher Workbench (AoURW). The University of Arizona 
(UArizona)-Banner AoU team will address this challenge through four Aims derived from our 
extensive experience leading interdisciplinary scientific teams to utilize AoURW and creating 
programs to engage researchers from UBR communities. Aim 1: Establish an AoU Data Fellows 
program to train and mentor researchers from UBR communities in leveraging the AoURW. Data 
Fellows will subsequently engage in outreach within their own networks to encourage AoUfocused research projects and awareness. Aim 2: Advance and manage a biomedical informatics 
core dedicated to equipping UBR and nontraditional researchers to conduct research in the 
AoURW. Aim 3: Incentivize AoURW research through high priority driver projects and seed 
grants with a focus on UBR and early-career investigators and health equity research. Aim 4: Form 
an Advisory Council (AC) to oversee Aims 1-3 and create partnerships with scientific 
organizations to engage researchers and scale initiatives nationally. Aims 1-4 will cultivate an 
active, diverse, and sustainable pool of AoU-focused researchers empowered by our resources and 
AoURW’s directive to advance precision medicine for the benefit of all communities. We will 
engage researchers from UBR communities to utilize the AoURW using active engagement 
strategies based on the principles of community based participatory research and research capacity
building, while maintaining the flexibility to work with existing AoU partners and extend AoU
resources. Our UArizona-Banner AoU team will assess the impact of our activities, disseminate

that will leave a positive legacy for decades both locally and nationally. During the first 5 years 
of enrollment, the IPMC has drawn strength from our institutional differences, varied scientific 
interests and expertise, broad geographic catchment areas, and diverse patient populations. To 
date, we have enrolled a cohort of nearly 43,000 participants from Chicago and greater Illinois, 
accounting for nearly 10% of the core AoURP participants nationwide – exceeding all 
expectations for diversity through high enrollment (87%) of those underrepresented in

AoURP in Illinois has generated insights, knowledge, best practices, new ideas, and partners to 
continue and build upon our work in Chicago and throughout Illinois. This includes a recognition 
of the crucial role that authentic and longstanding engagement plays in developing inclusive

Racial and ethnic minorities and residents of rural communities (rural residents) experience the 
greatest health disparities. Health disparities, as defined by the World Health Organization, are 
plausibly avoidable differences in health outcomes closely linked with social, economic, and 
environmental disadvantages. Health disparities, which cost the U.S. economy more $1 trillion 
annually, are worsened by underrepresentation in biomedical research (UBR). The National 
Academy of Medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other authoritative bodies 
have issued reports and are promoting strategies to increase the participation of racial/ethnic 
minorities, rural residents, and other UBR populations in biomedical research as a necessary step 
to mitigate health disparities. To wit, this proposal aims to increase the participation of racial/ethnic 
minorities and rural residents in the largest precision medicine initiative in history by incorporating
the All of Us Research Program Heartland Consortium (AoURP-HC) as a Healthcare Provider 
Organization (HPO) into the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) All of Us Research Program 
(AoURP). The AoURP-HC is a partnership of academic medical centers, hospitals, and community 
organizations in the central United States that will work together to enroll Kansas, Missouri, 
Nebraska, and Iowa residents into the most ambitious precision medicine initiative in history. The 
AoURP-HC will engage with the NIH's AoURP to further the goal of enrolling one million 
individuals who reflect the diversity of the United States, focusing on racial/ethnic minority 
groups and rural residents who are historically among the most UBR. The disproportionate and 
calamitous impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minority groups and rural residents lends urgency 
to efforts to enrich the AoURP with UBR populations. Our team, while on the pandemic frontlines, 
observed the geographic and race/ethnicity-based disparities in the impact of COVID-19. For 
example, Gove County, Kansas, had the highest COVID-19 death rate in the US, and the rural 
town of Quinter, Iowa, lost 1 in 132 residents to COVID-19, compared to the national average of 
1 in 10,000 deaths.1 Race/ethnicity emerged as a significant determinant of COVID-19-related 
deaths in the US (after age 75 years³), with more than three-fold differences in adjusted mortality 
rates (per 100,000) among different racial/ethnic groups. This disproportionate COVID-19 
morbidity and mortality in UBR populations, underpinned by genetic, physiologic, environmental, 
occupational, and lifestyle factors, will be better elucidated by the AoURP.
The AoURP-HC aims to address the underrepresentation of the central U.S. in the AoURP by 
establishing a formal partnership among four academic medical centers, along with their affiliated 
hospitals and clinics. The proposed collaboration will pursue four objectives: (1) we deploy a 
metrics-driven campaign will aim to enroll >30,000 full participants in five years of whom 50% 
will be racial ethnic/minority groups and rural residents; (2) we will send electronic health 
records periodically by means of secured and standardized AoURP IT processes and procedures to 
the Data and Research Center; (3) we will work collaboratively with the national AoURP 
infrastructure, including HPOs, the Biobank, and the Consortium Steering Committee, to develop 
and implement AoURP research protocols; and (4) we will abide by AoURP policies, maintain 
fidelity to the AoURP core values, and actively participate in AoURP ancillary studies, task forces, 
and working groups. Pursuant to these objectives, we will implement a comprehensive participant 
engagement and retention plan that values the participants as partners and convene a Participant 
Advisory Board to design and implement program activities. Our targeted enrollment of UBR 
populations into the AoURP will enhance the geographic and ethnic diversity of the All of Us
cohort, enhance public participation in precision medicine research, and help to ensure the benefits 
of targeted therapies and personalized preventative strategies reach rural populations."
10911372,"Biomedical imaging technology has undergone rapid advancements over the last several decades, 
producing large volumes of multimodal imaging data that hold great promise as biomarkers for agingrelated diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Current imaging biomarkers are primarily based on specific 
extracted one-dimensional measures that may not fully capture the richness of imaging data. Utilizing 
three-dimensional (3D) or higher imaging information directly may facilitate the identification of more 
effective disease biomarkers to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, this also brings 
significant challenges, such as analyzing ir-regularly shaped 3D objects, managing high-dimensional and 
high-resolution data, addressing noisiness and complexity, quantifying uncertainty, and ensuring the 
interpretability of the results. Our multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary team of investigators will develop 
efficient statistical learning approaches and scalable computing tools to extract and assess biomarkers 
from large-scale brain imaging studies. We will also incorporate genetic and clinical information in 
constructing the biomarkers. Specifically, our proposal comprises five interrelated research aims carried 
out by investigators with complementary expertise from three institutions. Aim 1 focuses on developing an 
interpretable model for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with brain imaging pheno-types and 
non-visual contextual information. Aim 2 targets to develop novel nonparametric distributed learning 
methods for analyzing 3D brain imaging data using an innovative domain decomposition strategy to 
improve computing performance. Aim 3 quantifies the bias effect in image processing and develops 
inference methods to reveal the underlying signal from brain imaging data and identify significant brain 
regions among different diagnosis groups. Aims 4-5 aim to develop statistical methods for obtaining and 
evaluating imaging-adjusted biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis and assess the incremental 
value of imaging information over genetic biomarkers on diagnosis and prediction accuracy. The efficacy 
of the methods developed in this pro-posal will be tested by data collected from studies in Alzheimer’s 
disease and brain sciences. The proposed research will address critical gaps in current biomarker 
development and analysis by utilizing advanced sta-tistical learning approaches and computing tools to 
directly utilize the 3D or higher imaging information. This innovative approach holds the potential to provide 
more effective disease biomarkers, leading to improved accuracy in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment 
for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."
10907042,"The formation and retention of memories of our daily experiences depend on a brain region called the 
hippocampus. Among the extensive neuromodulatory inputs the hippocampus receives, cholinergic inputs 
from the basal forebrain are crucial for learning and memory. These same inputs elicit reduced neuronal 
response with aging, and degenerate in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite its critical 
role in memory formation and stability, how cholinergic modulation mediates memory functions through 
individual circuit elements in the hippocampus remains largely unknown. In CA 1, the major output of the 
hippocampus, acetylcholine receptors are expressed in multiple cell types and cellular compartments. 
Until now, it has been difficult to determine the contribution of individual elements to the overall network 
effects of acetylcholine. In this project, we will study the role of muscarinic cholinergic receptors located 
on the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region in the formation and long-term stability of Internally 
Generated Sequences (IGS), the sequences generated during locomotion while sensory cues are held 
constant and as animals perform memory tasks. We will use IGS as a representative of memory-related 
activity patterns to reveal how cholinergic activity modulates the formation of and the long timescale drift 
in the hippocampal code and in turn refines the behavior by activating cell-type-specific acetylcholine 
receptors. Our experimental approach is to manipulate the strength and locus of cholinergic modulation in 
CA1 while imaging large numbers of neurons in awake head-fixed mice engaged in a 
hippocampus-dependent memory task. Specifically, we will selectively modulate the CA1 pyramidal 
neurons with cell-type specific neuropharmacological tools. Integrating computational modeling with 
findings from experiments, we will elucidate possible plasticity and network mechanisms responsible for 
the observed neuronal dynamics. By combining experimental and computational approaches to elucidate 
the cholinergic control of plasticity over memory formation and stability across the cellular, circuit, and 
behavioral levels, we will contribute novel insights into the effects of a disruption in cholinergic signaling. 
Our results may indicate which physiological parameters could be altered to compensate for the loss of 
cholinergic signals, and lead to the development of new treatment options for memory disorders."

The survival of every multicellular organism relies on effective cell-cell communication. Despite the diversity of
signals that cells need to communicate to their neighbors, evolution appears to have settled on only a few
physical mechanisms for transferring information across membranes. One such mechanism is the
oligomerization, or clustering, of membrane-spanning receptor proteins, wherein the receipt of a signal on one
side of the membrane is converted into a biochemical response on the other side. The mechanisms and
regulation of oligomeric transitions remain poorly understood for most families of receptor proteins due to the
inherent experimental difficulty of detecting and probing these subtle transitions. My lab is interested in
harnessing the latest developments in optogenetics, single-molecule microscopy, genome editing, and high-
throughput sequencing to dissect the receptor clustering events that allow cells to “talk” to each other in a
systematic and quantitative way. The proposed research program will tackle the activation and regulation of Eph
receptors in human cells. Eph receptors constitute the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK’s)
and are linked to a broad range of biological processes in both health and disease, ranging from tissue patterning
and embryonic development to neurodegeneration and cancer. The mechanistic details behind Eph receptor
activation remain obscure, in large part because of the large number of receptor types that are often expressed
in a single cell and their apparent ability to from both homo- and hetero-oligomers of varying stoichiometries.
Over the next five years, we will develop a combined approach for precisely manipulating and detecting homo-
and hetero-oligomerization of Eph receptors, allowing us to directly determine the effects of cluster size and
composition on the downstream signaling outcomes. This approach will also allow us to reveal the cryptic roles
of heterodimers between Eph receptors of different types, including the two catalytically inactive members of the
family. Light-inducible optogenetic clustering in living cells will be cross-validated with in vitro enzymology and
direct observation of clustering in single-molecule tracking experiments, ensuring that we are faithfully
recapitulating the biologically relevant oligomeric transitions. In addition to its immediate significance to the Eph
receptor field, the proposed work will develop a biophysical framework for analyzing the signaling of other
receptor families at the cell-cell interface. Finally, the spatially defined and non-invasive nature of light means
that development of optically controlled receptors will serve as a powerful tool for the study of cell-cell signaling
at the organoid or organismal level."
10938880,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 60% of firearm-related deaths are suicides, and over half of suicide deaths involve firearms. Further nearly
half of firearm suicide decedents were intoxicated at the time of their death. Therefore, alcohol is a key modifiable
risk factor for reducing firearm suicide, which is essential to ameliorating the public health crises of suicide and
firearm violence. While alcohol and firearm access have been studied as distinct risk factors for suicide, the three
have yet to be integrated into a single coordinated line of research that leverages multiple methods to understand
their linkages. One challenge is the lethality of firearm suicide, which leaves few survivors to study. Many people
contemplate firearm suicide, however, and this group provides a key opportunity to understand people who die
by firearm suicide. Preliminary analyses with our existing survey data suggests about 10% of people have
contemplated firearm suicide, and 7% report firearm suicidal ideation and a binge drinking episode in the last
month. We also find reliable associations among past suicide attempts, current suicidal thoughts and behaviors,
and alcohol use problems that varies with the ‘intensity’ of gun ownership. That is, people with more experience
with firearms and who engaged in more gun carrying reported more suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with a
subgroup of high-risk gun owners who exhibit numerous risk factors for firearm suicide and violence including
problematic alcohol use. Further, timeline follow back studies of recent suicide attempts find the strongest risk
factor is recent alcohol use. We propose three aims focused on understanding firearm suicidal ideation and the
role of alcohol and firearm access. First, we will conduct a nationally representative survey using probability
sampling focused on suicide risk, alcohol use problems, and firearms to test new hypotheses and provide more
definitive findings on the intersection of alcohol use, firearm access, and suicide at the population level. Second,
we will build on these analyses by conducting focus groups and qualitative research of people who have seriously
considered suicide by firearm. We will use mixed methods to identify themes that characterize pathways to
firearm suicide (as well as safety towards help seeking) with an emphasis on the role of alcohol use among
people with a history of firearm suicidal ideation and problematic alcohol use. These findings will be used to
design and develop content for a process-orientated study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to
study the dynamics of firearm suicidality and alcohol use in real time. The EMA study will be conducted for 28
days among participants who report recent firearm suicidal ideation and problematic alcohol use and who own
or have access to a firearm. Key goals will be to determine the variability of firearm suicidal ideation and how
this covaries or is moderated by alcohol use and ease of access to firearms. We will also test potential directional
effects (e.g., firearm suicidal ideation  alcohol use  firearm access). The knowledge gained from this work
will greatly enhance our understanding of the intersection of suicide, alcohol use, and firearm access, in
particular, identifying key intervention points to develop strategies to reduce the hams of firearm suicide."

The goal of this proposal is to study and control rhythmic nephron induction for kidney replacement
tissues. Kidney organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) re-create an astonishing
cellular diversity comparable to the early fetal kidney. However, barriers remain to their implementation for
regenerative medicine, chiefly the staggering volume of properly ‘plumbed’ tissue that would be necessary for
functional replacement. This creates an urgent need to achieve scale-up of nephron generation. The kidney
achieves scale-up during its development through an exponential increase in the number of nephron-forming
‘niches’ associated with the branching tips of the future urinary collecting duct tree. However, organoids generate
nephrons in a single wave, failing to capture rhythmic, exponential nephron production from self-sustaining
niches. Our long-term goal is to construct ‘higher-order’ synthetic kidney tissues using human stem cell, cell
engineering, and assembly technologies that mimic the outcomes of morphogenesis. Our overall objective here
is to gain temporal control over rhythmic nephron formation. Achieving this will mark a transformative advance
toward creating replacement kidney tissue and in fundamental understanding of low nephron endowment, a risk
factor for hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Our central hypothesis is that the periodic avalanche-like
commitment of nephron progenitors to new nephrons is governed by a rhythmic ‘pace-maker’ across several
signaling pathways. We plan to achieve our objective through two specific aims. Firstly, we will determine
pace-making coordination across cell types in the mouse nephrogenic niche. We will expand from our
preliminary spatial RNA sequencing data that discovered rhythmic alternating phases of nephron progenitor
differentiation and renewal in each niche. This will define a spatiotemporally resolved map of cell-cell interactions
contributing to nephrogenesis pace-making. Second, we will synthetically engineer pace-making and the
nephrogenesis chain-reaction in human iPSC-derived organoids. We will program rhythmic nephrogenesis
in iPSC-derived nephron progenitors using optogenetics technology and by leveraging intrinsic molecular clock
dynamics. The proposed research is innovative because we co-opt our discovery of cyclical nephrogenesis
signaling for novel engineering control strategies, while creating tissues that are compatible with patient-derived
autologous cells for future transplantation. The proposed research will have significant positive impact in two
areas: 1) Scale-up of human kidney tissue will create a step-change in renal replacement technology beyond
dialysis, transplant, and “abiotic” filtration. 2) New discoveries in rhythmic nephron patterning will inform
actionable approaches to improve persistence of nephrogenesis and increase nephron endowment in neonates."

The goals of the Tufts IRACDA program, which began in 2019, are to provide a diverse pool of recent Ph.D.
scientists with comprehensive postdoctoral training that prepares them for impactful academic careers in the
biomedical sciences and to increase the involvement of under-represented groups in biomedical research. To
accomplish this, the program provides a unique, scaffolded four-year training experience, with postdocs
spending 75% of their time conducting research and the other 25% in career development activities, including
a mentored teaching experience at three minority-serving partner institutions in the Boston area - Bunker Hill
Community College, University of Massachusetts-Boston, and Suffolk University. The program will admit 4 new
scholars each year, for a steady-state total of 16 scholars supported by their research mentors for the first year
and IRACDA the next three. Tufts IRACDA training emphasizes foundational skills needed to establish an
independent and rigorous research program, obtain external funding, mentor early-career scientists, and
develop and deliver innovative courses that engage students from all backgrounds. An additional goal of Tufts
IRACDA is to enhance the classroom and research experiences of students at our partner institutions. Through
regular interactions with these students both in and out of the classroom, our scholars will encourage them to
seek training and research opportunities that prepare them for biomedical science careers. Tufts IRACDA will
also promote research collaborations between Tufts and partner faculty that will lead to joint publications, grant
applications, and the development of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) at the
partner schools to expose more partner students to the scientific process. To keep our programming current
and responsive to participant needs, we seek continuous feedback from our scholars, research mentors, and
partner institutions. In the most recent cycle, we identified areas for improvement through surveys and
interviews, and have developed new programming and partnerships that allow each scholar to better tailor
individualized training for the type of academic career they are pursuing. Program outcomes, including scholar
publications and placements, along with the impacts for our partner schools, are regularly monitored with the
assistance of an advisory committee and an external evaluation team, and program adjustments are
implemented to ensure that the outcomes match or exceed our targets for success. We have also initiated a
collaboration with 5 other IRACDA programs to develop a tool to better document partner impact and share
best practices. In summary, our proposed program will ensure that Tufts IRACDA scholars are well-prepared to
succeed as faculty at a variety of academic institutions, while making a strong contribution to the scientific
future of our nation and enhancing the diversity of the biomedical workforce."
10938232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary central nervous system cancer in adults, where
treatments are ineffective and often debilitating. Unlike many other peripheral solid tumors, GBM is highly
resistant to cancer immunotherapy. The absence of immune infiltrates in GBM results in an immunologically
“cold” tumor and intrinsic immune resistance mediated by GBM cells is an additional factor contributing to the
failure of immunotherapy in GBM thus far. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has recently shown
remarkable success in the treatment of hematologic cancers, and there have been attempts made to explore
CAR T cell strategies against GBM. However, CAR T cells for GBM face challenges including intratumor
heterogeneity, dynamic expression of target receptors, and often the inability of T cells to traffic to tumors to
mediate the desired antitumor effect. In contrast to the lack of T cell infiltrates, many solid tumors, especially
GBM, are abundant in immune suppressive myeloid cells including macrophages. Therefore, converting these
immune suppressive cells into tumoricidal phenotype represents a promising strategy for cell-based therapy.
There is now strong interest in generating CAR macrophages in which autologous macrophages are
transduced with CARs delivered by viral vectors ex vivo to enhance their effector functions. However, ex vivo
preparation of CAR macrophages is complex, time consuming, and due to the non-dividing nature of
macrophages, is often inefficient. We propose an innovative strategy that represents a revolutionary way to
produce CAR macrophages in vivo and offers a promising new approach for cell therapy against GBM. This
will be the first study to evaluate the feasibility of producing CAR macrophages in vivo using an mRNA delivery
platform and to assess the antitumor efficacy of CAR macrophages for GBM immunotherapy. We hypothesize
that generating CAR macrophages targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Variant III (EGFRvIII) in
vivo using mRNA-loaded exosomes will have significant activity against GBM. EGFRvIII is a mutant protein
that is expressed on the surface of 50% of GBM cells. Our previous study showed that we can efficiently
produce mRNA-loaded exosomes to restore protein expression in solid tumors in vivo. Furthermore, our
preliminary experiments showed that the exosomes loaded with EGFRvIII CAR mRNA can produce CAR
macrophages in vivo with enhanced effector functions. Our current study will test the overall hypothesis
through the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the dynamics and toxicity of CAR macrophage
production in vivo using CAR mRNA exosomes. In Aim 2, we will evaluate transcriptomic and functional
profiles of in vivo generated CAR macrophages. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the antitumor effect of in vivo
generated CAR macrophages as a monotherapy or in combination with other myeloid-directed therapy against
both murine and human EGFRvIII expressing GBMs. If successful, our proposed research can overcome a
major technical hurdle that has limited cell therapy in GBM and greatly expand its utility for cancer treatment."

Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune disease in which CD4 T cells play a central
role. Studying the epigenome of CD4 T cells in RRMS through the integration of genome-wide analysis of DNA
methylation, open chromatin, and histone modifications with GWAS variants and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
data has the potential to elucidate the molecular processes that potentiate disease activity. The studies proposed
in this application will examine the epigenomic landscape of CD4 T cells in a well characterized cohort of
individuals with RRMS, using longitudinal samples to allow an assessment of how the epigenome is altered in
the context of disease flare and remission. The central hypothesis is that differences in the epigenomic landscape
of CD4 T cells during flare and remission will identify factors that promote disease flares and the resulting
changes in T cell function. The studies in Specific Aim 1 will determine how the epigenomic and transcriptomic
landscapes of T cells change during disease flare compared to remission in a longitudinal RRMS cohort. We will
profile chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and the transcriptome (RNA-seq) in total CD4, memory CD4, Th17
and regulatory T cells (Tregs). ATAC-seq data will be analyzed using an analytic pipeline integrating capture Hi-
C data, transcription factor foot printing and MS genetic risk. The RNA-seq dataset will then be integrated to
identify gene expression changes related to epigenomic alterations during disease flare. Findings in the
longitudinal cohort will be validated in an independent cross-sectional cohort including individuals flaring and
individuals in remission. The studies in Specific Aim 2 will investigate the impact of differential chromatin
accessibility at the ZFP36L2 locus on CD4 T cell lineage and function. They will determine whether the changes
in chromatin accessibility at the ZFP36L2 locus during disease flare alter ZFP36L2 gene expression in all CD4
T cells or only specific T cell subsets using PrimeFlow. CRISPR editing to either open or close the chromatin at
the ZFP36L2 locus will be used to directly confirm the regulation of ZFP36L2 expression by the enhancer. The
effect of ZFP36L2 chromatin accessibility on CD4 T cells lineage and function will also be evaluated using
samples from RRMS subjects with open or closed chromatin at the ZFP36L2 locus. Collectively, these studies
will advance our understanding of how changes in chromatin accessibility in the context of disease activity
contribute to the pathogenicity of T cells in RRMS and may also reveal drivers of disease development."

Although extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is required for organ development and is a natural response in tissue
repair, excessive ECM deposition in response to continual stress, injury, or aging is known as fibrosis, which impairs organ
function and the potential for regenerative responses. Fibrosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and
contributes to up to 45% of all deaths in the US. 1-3 Fibrosis of the salivary gland occurs following radiation therapy for
head and neck cancers and in patients with Sjögren’s Disease; however, the mechanisms driving reversibility of salivary
gland fibrosis are not understood and are critical to understand for improved therapeutic development. While fibroblasts
and TGFβ signaling are known to be primary drivers of fibrosis, the inability to target cell-specific effects of TGFβ limits
the usefulness of TGFβ therapeutics due to its pleiotropic effects on immune function. In prior work, we used single-cell
RNA sequencing to identify a Pdgfra+, Pdgfrβ+ co-positive subpopulation as the primary fibrogenic cell type that
overproduces extracellular matrix in response to reversible salivary gland injury. As reduction or reversal of fibrosis could
restore function, the objectives of this proposal are to define the contribution of TGFβ modulation of PDGFRα+ stromal
fibroblasts to matrisome composition and organization that drives reversible and irreversible salivary gland fibrosis and to
test scaffold-mediated transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells for improved ability to remediate a fibrotic response.
We will address these outstanding questions in the field to better inform future therapeutic approaches to remediate or
reverse fibrosis: 1) How does the TGFβ-driven matrisome change in reversible vs irreversible fibrosis? 2) Can cell-specific
manipulation of TGFβ signaling in fibroblasts control fibrosis? 3) Can scaffold mediated delivery of mesenchymal stromal
cells and their exosomes remediate fibrosis and promote gland regeneration? We will apply transcriptomic, proteomic, and
quantitative histological approaches to reversible and irreversible models of salivary gland fibrosis and organoid models for
human cells to define the cell-type specific responses of fibroblasts to create matrisome changes during fibrosis progression
and recovery. These studies will significantly increase our understanding of the TGFβ-dependent mechanisms that drive
salivary gland fibrosis to inform improved regenerative medicine approaches and establish a foundation for testing novel
therapeutics in organoids and mouse models to modulate TGFβ and other effectors and matrisomal proteins in fibrotic
diseases."

Bordetella pertussis (Bp), a gram-negative bacterium is the causative agent of whooping cough or pertussis, an
acute disease primarily in infants and young children. Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis is resurging
in many countries including the USA. Bp infection in vaccinated individuals cause mild symptoms or are
asymptomatic. This results in severe underreporting of global pertussis incidence. Current acellular pertussis
vaccines (aPV) elicit suboptimal and short-lived immunity and fail to prevent the colonization of the nasal cavity.
These infected individuals serve as a reservoir for bacterial transmission. Since Bp is restricted to humans as
hosts and has no environmental or animal reservoir, it is critical to utilize model systems that resemble the
environment of the human respiratory tract. Traditionally, the focus of Bp research has been on studying its
interactions and pathogenesis in the context of lower respiratory tract and by utilizing animal models. The
mechanisms utilized by Bp to survive and establish persistent infection in the human nasal cavity are poorly
understood. We hypothesize that attachment to nasal epithelium followed by biofilm formation are key
determinants of long-term infection of Bp in the human nasopharynx. In this proposal, we will use primary well-
differentiated human nasal epithelial cultures (HNEC) grown at the air-liquid interface. These primary HNECs
produce mucus, are ciliated and mimic the human nasal environment. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine (i)
how Bp attaches, establishes colonizes and forms biofilms on HNEC; (ii) the role of known virulence factors in
facilitating HNEC infection and (iii) how Bp infection alters the cellular and morphological characteristics of
HNEC.
Infection often elicits a dynamic cascade of events resulting in the adaptation of both the host and the pathogen.
The crosstalk between Bp and the nasal cells following infection is yet to be investigated. We hypothesize that
infection of nasal cavity by Bp triggers transcriptional changes in both the bacterial and host cells resulting in
shaping of the infection process. In Specific Aim 2, we will use high throughput dual RNA sequencing technology
to analyze the changes in the transcriptome of both Bp and HNEC. With the proposed research, we will gain an
advanced understanding of host-pathogen interactions and identify the dynamic changes occurring in both the
host and bacterial transcriptome during infection."

Following a myocardial infarction, an intense inflammatory response occurs whose duration and magnitude are
modulated by CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express CD39, an ectonucleotidase that
degrades proinflammatory ATP and ADP. Immune responses are central to cardiac healing, and Tregs exert
critical modulatory functions. Levels of immune-suppressive ectonucleotidase CD39 on Tregs are genetically
controlled in humans by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, no studies have examined whether
differences in Treg CD39 activity impact cardiac inflammation resolution and healing following myocardial
infarction in humans. In alignment with NOT-ES-20-018 “Notice of Special interest: Promoting Fundamental and
Applied Research in Inflammation Resolution,” our overall experimental goal is to elucidate the impact of genetic
regulation of Treg CD39 expression on the resolution of cardiac inflammation following myocardial infarction.
Our recent publication demonstrates that post-myocardial infarction healing in mice devoid of CD39 expression
is dysfunctional, with increased fibrosis and worsening diastolic function. However, CD39 is expressed in several
immune cells and endothelial cells; therefore, in this model, no conclusions can be drawn regarding which CD39-
expressing cell subset is instrumental in regulating cardiac healing. Our critical data demonstrate that in humans,
the genotype at the ENTPD1 promoter SNP rs3814159 associates with the level of expression of CD39 on Tregs.
Given the evolving role of Tregs in modulating post-MI inflammation and healing, our central hypothesis is that
genetic polymorphisms resulting in decreased Treg CD39 activity convey a pro-inflammatory phenotype that fails
to resolve chronic inflammatory conditions. We will test this hypothesis by conducting functional genomic
experiments using novel murine experimental model systems and clinical studies, examining isolated cells and
patient biospecimens. The proposal consists of two Aims. In SA1, our investigative team will determine how
CD39 activity on T regulatory cells impacts cardiac inflammation resolution and myocardial healing following
myocardial infarction. This will be done using murine models of reduced and ablated expression of CD39 on
Tregs. In SA2, we will determine the impact of differences in CD39 expression on the inflammatory response
and resolution following myocardial infarction in humans. We have assembled a collaborative team with clinical
and experimental cardiovascular disease, genetics, and biostatistics expertise. Completing the proposed aims
will provide an understanding of the role of the genetically predetermined expression of CD39 on Tregs in cardiac
inflammation and inflammatory resolution. Translation to clinical practice will be facilitated by identifying
important biomarkers and novel targets, including CD39 and related pathways, for therapeutic intervention in
myocardial infarction."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The origin of this cooperative agreement announcement is from the development of the Retail
Food Safety Association Collaborative (Collaborative). The Collaborative was formed in 2019
after a series of discussions among the retail food regulatory associations Association of Food
and Drug Officials (AFDO), Conference for Food Protection (CFP), National Association of County
and City Health Officials (NACCHO), National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), FDA,
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the need to have a collaborative
approach toward retail food safety to fully leverage each organization working in this space to
maximize the effectiveness.
Over the last two years, the Collaborative began many foundational activities that were
designed to assist retail food regulatory programs and industry in a number of areas: reducing
foodborne illness by implementing effective intervention strategies designed to reduce the
occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors; implementing and achieving full conformance with
the VNRFRPS; promoting use of risk-based inspection methods to effectively identify the
occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors, conduct root cause analysis, assess gaps in
industry active managerial control (AMC), and promote regulatory compliance; promoting
adoption of the most recent version of the FDA Food Code; effectively responding to foodborne
illness outbreaks; and responding to emerging food safety trends. The program is also intended
to encourage the research, development, and implementation of industry food safety
management systems and the prerequisite food safety culture necessary to achieve AMC of
foodborne illness risk factors.
Under this cooperative agreement, Collaborative members intend to build on these foundational
activities through continued sharing of individual accomplishments. Each member has identified
activities that individually, and collaboratively we will continue to gain better understanding of
the retail food safety state regulatory program environment, reduce the occurrence of retail
foodborne illness risk factors, and improve communications and availability of resources for
state, local, territorial, and tribal food safety programs.
AFDO’s major proposed projects under this cooperative agreement include:
  Gaining a better understanding of the retail food safety state regulatory program
 environment through continuing surveys and interviews in targeted areas.
  Reducing the occurrence of retail foodborne illness risk factors by:
 o Identification of foodborne illness interventions used at the state level,
 categorizing, and evaluating the interventions for effectiveness
 o Addressing identified barriers to adoption of recent version of the Food Code
 o Promote and assess implementation of risk-based inspections
 o Develop and promote strategies to improve active managerial control and food
 safety culture in retail foods through owner, operator, and manager training
 o Collating multi-state inspectional data and analyzing for trends among brands and
 between states; and
 o Improve response to retail foodborne illness outbreaks including Illness mitigation
 through better coordination of tools, environmental sampling training, and
 promotion of the National Environmental Assessment System (NEARS).
  Improve communications and availability of resources for state, local, territorial, and tribal

 Antimicrobials are critical for medicine, but the problem of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) threatens the effectiveness of these valuable drugs. Widespread use of
antibiotics is the main driver of AMR. In human and animal health settings, this makes
infections difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. Tracking of antimicrobial use
(AU) is an essential strategy to combat AMR. There are no systematic, ongoing national-
or state-level programs to track AU in dogs and cats in the United States. Measurement
of AU is hampered by logistical challenges of accessing prescribing data within and
across the many diverse veterinary electronic health record (EHR) systems. Veterinary
medicine lacks standard diagnostic coding, as such codes are not required for billing nor
disease reporting. Often the details of the patient encounter (e.g., diagnosis, indication
for prescriptions) are recorded only in free-text fields of the EHR rather than in easily
searchable fields. Methodologies that overcome obstacles to data collection are a critical
need in the fight against AMR.
 The overarching goal of this project is to optimize long-term strategies for
collecting and reporting AU data from companion animal practices to understand
baseline prescribing behaviors and provide actionable targets for antimicrobial
stewardship (AS). Two practical, scalable, and sustainable approaches to track AU in
companion animal veterinary practices will be utilized. These include the use of point
prevalence surveys (PPS) and the Companion Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network
(CAVSNET). PPS have been used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
establish baseline national measures of AU in human hospital and long-term care
settings. This project will establish national estimates of AU prevalence in referral and
small animal general practices by conducting national PPS in veterinary teaching
hospitals and general and referral practices. CAVSNET is a secure passive surveillance
system for long-term tracking of companion animal health, disease, and treatment.
CAVSNET will gather AU data on a routine basis directly from EHR systems. With these
two complementary approaches, we will build a comprehensive national picture of AU
in dogs and cats."

(AYA) ages 10 to 24, however, comprise the only age group that has not seen improvements in HIV-related
mortality since then. Adolescence is a distinct developmental period, in which risk-taking and impulsive
decision-making are normative behaviors. Stigma, disclosure concerns, and medication toxicity impact HIV
health behaviors at a time when AYA may also experience their first sexual relationships. Differences in HIV
health outcomes by age are partly due to late diagnosis, as well as to challenges in accessing treatment and
prevention modalities requiring daily adherence. This problem is particularly acute in South Africa, which has
the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with one in three new infections there occurring among AYA. Recent
advances in long-acting HIV prevention and treatment formulations that avert the need to take a daily pill hold
major promise, particularly for AYA. With support to Dr. Neilan from an NICHD K08 HD094638 (2018-2023) as
well as from the Adolescent Medicine for HIV/AIDS Interventions Trials Network U24HD089880 (2017-2022),
we developed the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-Adolescent and Young Adult (CEPAC-
AYA) microsimulation model. We have conducted 12 model-based clinical and cost-effectiveness analyses
addressing key questions in AYA HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in the United States. In a new US-
South Africa collaboration, we now propose to adapt and expand the structure of this simulation model and
assemble necessary data inputs, and then to use the model to identify the most effective and cost-effective
approaches and monitoring strategies for the treatment and prevention of HIV among AYA in South Africa. We
have three specific aims:
 Aim 1. Develop new structure within the CEPAC-AYA model and derive data to permit modeling of
 long-acting ART and PrEP regimens for AYA in South Africa.
 Aim 2. Evaluate the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of new AYA-focused treatment
 interventions to decrease opportunistic infections and mortality among AYA in South Africa.
 Aim 3. Assess the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of new AYA-focused prevention
 interventions to reduce HIV incidence among AYA in South Africa.
The goal of this proposal is to evaluate context-specific, adolescent-tailored care strategies and to identify the
best use of limited resources to improve health outcomes for AYA affected by HIV in South Africa. As new
treatments and delivery systems emerge, the model will be poised to inform how to best deploy these
resources for this vulnerable population."

Goal: We will develop and validate 3D engineered muscular tissues (EMTs) as an enabling “clinical trial-on-a-
chip” platform to determine cardiac and skeletal muscle deficiencies in human Duchenne and Becker muscular
dystrophy (DMD/BMD), and test the efficacy of novel therapeutics. We leverage state-of-art techniques
developed by our team: (1) a method to differentiate and mature iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and skeletal
myoblasts. (2) phenotype-confirmed hiPSCs from DMD patients (3) 3D-tissue engineering technique using
decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) (4) Protocols to construct a multicellular architecture (5) non-invasive,
high-throughput screening system allowing parallel electrophysiological and contractile assessment. (6) Novel
antagonist of the cation channel – TRPC6 that displays in vivo potential in a severe mouse model of DMD. We
integrate these techniques and methods into an assay that recapitulates the major hallmarks of DMD, enabling
real-time assessment of treatment efficacy. To demonstrate the utility of our EMT assay as a “clinical trial-on-a-
chip,” the new TRPC6 blocker is tested through Phase I safety/toxicity, Phase II dosing/ efficacy in EMT from a
few DMD patients, and Phase III outcomes in EMTs from a larger heterogenous population of DMD/BMD
patients. Focus/Aim: The UG3 phase establishes protocols to engineer optimized, hiPSC-derived cardiac and
skeletal muscle tissues using our magnetic sensing platform and integrating this platform with our high-
throughput imaging capabilities. The developed platform will be used to characterize the functional phenotypes
of engineered muscle tissues generated from hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and skeletal myoblasts from
dystrophic patients or healthy controls. This will verify that the ‘clinical trial-on-a-chip’ assay possesses sufficient
sensitivity to recapitulate DMD phenotypes, stratify disease severity, and define contractility and
electrophysiological outcomes that can be used to inform therapy efficacy testing in the UH3 phase. The UH3
phase will use the EMT assay to simulate protocols for running a 3-phase clinical trial. The therapeutic to be
tested is BI 749327, a novel and promising selective and potent inhibitor of TRPC6 (Transient Receptor Potential-
Canonical channel 6). The drug is the first orally bioavailable TRPC6 blocker, and we have already reported
efficacy in pressure-load and renal fibrosis models in vivo. New data shows efficacy in DMD. In Aim 1, the
toxicity profile and dose range of BI 749327 is determined in healthy EMTs. In Aim 2, mechanical and electrical
effects of BI 749327 over a range of doses is applied to DMD-derived EMTs to identify an optimal dose and
pharmacodynamic profile to move forward to broader testing. In Aim 3, we will use the prior information to
perform a Phase 3-style study that will involve iPSC-derived EMTs from DMD patients with varying mutations
causing total dystrophin deletion, and from BMD patients that express mutant dystrophin resulting in varying
clinical phenotypes. The goal is to establish the clinical trial-on-a-chip to inform and support human DMD clinical
trial design, optimizing dosing and personalizing therapy for patients."
10906519,"By 2050, the proportion of the world’s population that is over 60 will nearly double from 12% to 22%,
representing nearly 2 billion older people worldwide. In response, the United Nations declared 2021–2030 to
be the Decade of Healthy Aging, aiming to improve the lives of older people. Thus, Long-Term Post-Acute Care
(LTPAC) systems that provide care for older adults are a significant global area of interest. Our definition of
LTPAC providers include home care and hospice, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. LTPAC systems
are essential because 70% of older adults will require long term care services during their life. As the world’s
population gets older, many challenges exist for providing safe, higher quality care for older adults at the
individual, institutional and community levels. One international strategy for improving quality of care in the
world’s LTPAC systems is the efficient and competent use of health information technology. To stimulate
research to address existing gaps, we will convene an International Summit on Innovation and Technology in
Care of Older People (IS-ITCOP) June 6-7, 2024. The purpose of this research development conference
grant is to convene national and international LTPAC experts to guide research development, co-design
research strategies, and methods for evaluating technology in LTPAC. Our specific aims: Specific Aim 1:
Identify emerging and established technology used in LTPAC. Specific Aim 2: Describe the barriers and
facilitators affecting technology adoption in LTPAC. Specific Aim 3: Examine how barriers in technology
adoption can influence disparities among patients in LTPAC. Specific Aim 4: Create a research agenda to
identify ways that governments, professional organizations, etc. can remove barriers and promote facilitators
for technology adoption, and thus lessen disparities in LTPAC. Our aims will be accomplished in a two-day
conference held at Columbia University School of Nursing in New York, NY and led by internationally
recognized health services researchers and policy influencers studying technology in LTPAC (Chair: Dr.
Gregory L. Alexander PhD, RN, Co-Chair: Ms. Anne Livingstone). An international community of 35
policymakers, administrators, clinicians, researchers, and leaders will be invited. The interdisciplinary
organizing committee will convene keynote speakers, lead discussions, identify and confirm speakers.
Keynotes and lead discussants will stimulate roundtable discourse in four critical areas identified by
international LTPAC experts regarding technology use, including 1) Emerging Models of Care, 2) Workforce of
the Future, 3) Transparency and Accountability in Quality, and 4) Security and Privacy. A product of the
conference will be a scholarly manuscript outlining a research agenda to advance scholarship in LTPAC
settings internationally. To evaluate the conference’s success, summative and formative evaluations will be
completed during and after the conference by both presenters, sponsors, and attendees. The evidence will
inform steps to optimally use and remove barriers for technology use in LTPAC settings."

The Chemical Screening and Optimization Facility (CSOF) fulfills a unique role by identifying, optimizing and conducting production identified small molecules for contraceptive and reproductive health related (e.g., infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, fibroids, endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, adenomyosis, gynecologic and/or pelvic pain, and vulvodynia, premature birth, placenta health, improving lactation quality and quantity, preeclampsia, perinatal microbiome, gestational diabetes, inflammation, bacterial infections, viral infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dyplasia, pre-term birth, fetal growth restriction, mastitis, Cushing's disease, Down Syndrome, Ricketts, Muscular Dystrophy, Rett syndrome, sepsis, or Autism) research. One approach is to conduct scalable quantity projects of identified small molecule(s) (e.g., natural product) and/or large molecule (e.g., polymer) that afford a contraceptive effect against a validated target or as a treatment for an identified reproductive health related indication.  This facility will also be responsible for the production of chemical material for preliminary in vivo testing. It is expected that multiple independent projects will be performed simultaneously by the CSOF. Appropriate oversight of these projects will be essential for their successful execution."
10938155,"Project Summary
Use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) can have positive and negative effects on public health.
Ideally, people who smoke would switch to ENDS, and vulnerable populations like youth would avoid ENDS
altogether. Yet, most adults who use ENDS also smoke, and ENDS have been the most popular nicotine
product among youth since 2014. Effective informational labels for the nicotine strength of ENDS could help to
address these problems. For smokers who want to switch to ENDS, easily selecting a product with sufficient
nicotine to facilitate a complete switch is critical. For youth, informative labels may deter ENDS uptake, use of
high-nicotine ENDS, and development of nicotine dependence. The FDA requires nicotine concentration labels
on ENDS, typically in mg/mL or percent, but neither youth nor adults understand these metrics. We previously
pilot tested new nicotine concentration labels that improved ENDS users' ability to interpret the strength and
addictiveness of nicotine in ENDS. Here, we propose to extend our work to develop two labels: 1) a nicotine
concentration label that could replace all current FDA-required ENDS nicotine concentration labels, and 2) a
novel, potentially more informative label for nicotine emissions (“flux”) from popular closed-system devices like
Vuse and JUUL. In Aim 1, we will refine our piloted nicotine concentration label by re-anchoring the nicotine
strength categories on the label (e.g., medium, high) to the nicotine content in cigarettes. We also will develop
nicotine flux labels for closed-system ENDS, which have fixed, calculatable nicotine emissions; are the most
popular device type; and are the only device type to receive FDA approval for sales in the United States. Flux,
the rate of nicotine emissions from ENDS, better approximates nicotine delivery than concentration alone. We
will employ qualitative methods (i.e., expert feedback, focus groups) to identify the optimal scaling for our
concentration label and to determine key features for inclusion on our flux labels. In Aim 2, we will compare the
mg/mL market label (the top-performing market label from our prior work), optimized nicotine concentration
label, and flux labels. We will survey 2,000 youth and adults who use ENDS, cigarettes, or no tobacco products
to compare the ability of our new labels to accurately convey ENDS nicotine strength relative to current market
labeling and to each other. We also will assess perceived addictiveness, perceived label utility, and product
use intentions. We expect the new concentration and flux labels to more accurately convey ENDS nicotine
strength than mg/mL alone. We also expect the new labels to better convey information about addictiveness, to
be rated as having more utility than mg/mL, to decrease use intentions among never users, and to increase
intentions to use ENDS in a quit smoking attempt. Project findings will provide the FDA a superior alternative to
current nicotine concentration labels for all ENDS and will indicate if nicotine flux labeling has added benefit for
the most popular ENDS device type: closed-system ENDS. In sum, the proposed project will increase public
understanding of nicotine concentrations of all ENDS and nicotine emissions from closed-system ENDS."
10938156,"Project Summary
Opioid overdoses continue to rise at an alarming rate in the US. Respiratory failure is the cause of death from
opioid overdose. Yet, the mechanisms by which respiratory depression and cessation of breathing occur are
poorly understood. Emerging evidence from our lab and others implicates mu opioid receptors expressed
throughout the brainstem control of breathing network, including areas in the dorsolateral pons and the
ventrolateral medulla. Recently, we have found that opioids selectively suppress an excitatory pontomedullary
circuit, which could disrupt the delicately balanced neurotransmission that is required for proper breathing.
However, opioid-sensitive neurons only account for approximately half of the pontomedullary respiratory
neurons. We propose that to fully understand the effect of opioids on breathing we must also consider the
activity of neurons that are not inhibited by opioids and continue to function unopposed. We know from
published and preliminary data that non-opioid-sensitive pontine neurons project to medullary respiratory
centers, but do not synapse onto excitatory neurons. In addition, most non-opioid-sensitive pontine neurons
are expiratory and continue to fire during opioid overdose. Thus, we hypothesize that expiratory, non-opioid-
sensitive pontine neurons contribute to breathing failure via tonic glutamatergic projections to inhibitory
neurons in the ventrolateral medulla. We will test this hypothesis in adult mice with fully developed respiratory
circuitry using cell-type and projection specific approaches at the cellular, circuit and in vivo level in three
specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the synaptic target of non-MOR-expressing dorsolateral pontine neurons
using optogenetics and ex vivo recordings of fluorescently labeled inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral
medulla. Aim 2 will determine the respiratory phenotype of opioid-insensitive, glutamatergic, medullary
projecting dorsolateral pontine neurons using single unit recording of optically-tagged neurons in a unique
arterially perfused mouse preparation that maintains an intact brainstem and “in vivo-like” respiratory cycle.
Aim 3 will use intersectional genetics to optically stimulate or inhibit medullary projecting, non-opioid-sensitive
dorsolateral pontine neurons in arterially perfused preparations and in vivo to determine the ability of these
neurons to promote or prevent apnea. Together, this R01 project will contribute to our long-term goal to
generate a more complete model of the brain’s control of breathing network under different influences, such as
opioids, and can be expanded upon in future studies based on this research."
10939099,"1 Legionella pneumophila is an opportunist pathogen that infects an immune-compromised host and causes
2 inflammatory pneumonia in the lungs termed as legionnaire’s disease. L. pneumophila infects alveolar
 3 macrophages within the lungs and using a type IV secretion system, discharges an array of more than 300
 4 proteins called effectors that interfere with the cell’s biochemical pathways to prepare a cozy niche for the
 5 bacterial replication. Several recent studies also indicate that L. pneumophila infections in primary mouse
 6 macrophages and protozoan cells manipulate host transcriptome and result in differential gene expression in the
 7 infected host cell to facilitate their survival and evasion of the immune mechanisms. However, the mechanisms
 8 involved in gene expression alterations are not clear and undefined. A comprehensive localization analysis of
 9 Legionella effectors using GFP-tag revealed that a few of these Legionella effectors translocate into the nucleus
10 of the cell. An effector protein with an objective localization into the nucleus to modulate gene expression of the
11 host is called nucleomodulin. Recent studies indicate that several bacterial pathogens produce nucleomodulins
12 that aid in survival and pathogenesis through transient or long-term epigenetic modifications. In our prior work,
13 we identified five Legionella nucleomodulins with unknown function and the purpose of this study is to elucidate
14 the role of the Legionella nucleomodulins in understanding the pathogenesis of L. pneumophilia.
15 To better understand the effect of Legionella nucleomodulins on the host cells and determine their function
16 during the growth of Legionella pneumophila, we examined the differential gene expression pattern by
17 performing RNA sequence analysis on RNA extracted from mammalian cells expressing Legionella
18 nucleomodulin. The pathways and genes identified through functional analysis of RNA-seq data support
19 epigenetic modifications of host cells through methylation and histone modifications. The first objective of this
20 study is to examine the DNA methylation pattern on macrophages infected with L. pneumophila using Bisulfite
21 sequencing and methylation assays in comparison to uninfected macrophages. The second objective examines
22 interaction of Legionella nucleomodulin with histone and non-histone proteins by using chromatin
23 immunoprecipitation sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation assays.
24 The proposed research aims to detect transcriptional responses of a cell to its environmental influence such
25 as infections and understand how bacterial nucleomodulins mediate regulatory control through epigenetic
26 changes during an infection by intracellular pathogens to trigger altered gene expression patterns in the host cell
27 and manipulate cellular processes. As these mechanisms are ambiguous, this study will contribute to better
28 understanding of bacterial nucleomodulins and their role in bacterial pathogenesis which can help in designing
29 new therapeutic approaches. Additionally, this project will expand research and education experience for
30 undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University."

Over the last twenty years, US obesity prevalence increased by over a third, with the prevalence of severe
obesity increasing by 96%. Nearly 3 in 4 adults are classified as overweight or obese, and 13% of these
adults have severe obesity. Over this same period, the prevalence of obesity among children and
adolescents increased by nearly 40%, and the prevalence of severe obesity increased by 70%.
Approximately 16% of children and adolescents are overweight and another 20% are obese. These
figures have led policymakers and public health officials to call obesity a national epidemic.
 Obesity is expensive in terms of lives lost and cost to the healthcare system. Severe obesity is
estimated to shorten life expectancy by up to 14 years, and the estimated annual medical cost of obesity
is nearly $200 million. Individuals with excess bodyweight are at elevated risk for the leading causes of
preventable, premature death, including heart disease, diabetes, and at least 13 different types of cancer.
Compared to healthy weight children, obese children are more likely to have elevated blood pressure,
display early signs of atherosclerosis, have a four times greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, are
more likely to develop cancer by age 30, and are more likely to die by age 30.
 To help address the obesity epidemic, the CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and
Obesity awards state and county health departments, land-grant universities, and community-focused
groups funds to support programs promoting physical activity and nutrition across the lifespan. To identify
the effects of federal funds for obesity prevention on weight-related health behaviors, the prevalence of
obesity, and the incidence of obesity-related chronic health conditions, our study will leverage variation
in which counties and states received awards, when they received the awards, how much funding they
received, and the demographic groups targeted by the awards. In doing so, our project will yield important
insights for public health officials looking to understand how to reduce the prevalence of obesity in their
own local settings."

Cellular metabolic and biosynthetic demands change throughout the cell cycle, which critically impacts cell
growth, proliferation, and human disease. Understanding how cellular metabolism is modulated in different cell
cycle phases is fundamental to understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cell growth and
proliferation. Yet, very little is known about how metabolism changes throughout the cell cycle and how these
changes mechanistically link to the cell cycle machinery. The master metabolic regulator Mechanistic Target of
Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase complex that integrates
upstream growth factor and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic cell growth. mTORC1 is activated in most, if
not all, proliferating eukaryotic cells, but the role of mTORC1 in controlling cellular metabolism has not been
studied in distinct cell cycle phases. Thus it is unknown whether the metabolic program induced downstream of
mTORC1 is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, or whether mTORC1 can play unique roles in
specific cell cycle phases. We tracked mTORC1 activity across the full cell cycle and found that mTORC1 is
acutely and differentially regulated, with its activity peaking in S/G2 and lowest in mitosis and G1. We
hypothesize that mTORC1 is a crucial effector through which the cell cycle orchestrates metabolic changes,
dynamically modulating metabolic pathways in a phase-specific manner to meet changing biosynthetic
requirements. In this planned research program, we will elucidate the cell cycle phase-specific functions of
mTORC1 by combining metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis with detailed mechanistic studies. Based on
our preliminary data, we anticipate that these studies will uncover new functions of mTORC1, along with new
regulatory mechanisms, that are not evident in studies on asynchronous cell populations, thus providing critical
new insights into the fundamental mechanisms that integrate cell cycle control with cellular metabolism."

Our goal is to build Sickle Cell Disease Pain Analgesia and Integrative Network (SCDPAIN) as an innovative,
dynamic and interactive platform that will advance the NCCIH's bold mission for research on pain mechanisms
in sickle cell disease (SCD). Pain is one of the major comorbidities of SCD leading to poor quality of life,
frequent opioid use and reduced survival. Compared to most other painful conditions, pain in SCD is unique
because of the unpredictable and recurrent episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises, in addition to
chronic pain which continuously affects the majority of individuals. Pain in SCD can start during infancy and
continue throughout life. Guided by an unmet need to address the morbidity associated with pain in SCD, our
network is committed to profoundly impacting the science of sickle cell pain through leading expertise in pain,
SCD pathobiology, end-organ damage and integrative interventions, assisted by cutting-edge technological
advancement through 3 specific aims: [#1] “Science without borders.” To develop a collaborative network of
multidisciplinary scientists, clinicians, analysts, and community partners to advance the understanding of SCD
pain mechanisms; [#2] “Promoting the future” for innovative, technically advanced, multidimensional,
multidisciplinary and holistic team science approaches; and [#3] “Hub to health,” multimodal dissemination
efforts to maximize access to SCDPAIN. To achieve these goals, we will establish 6 focused working groups
on, priority areas, pilot funding, sabbatical review, network foresight and review, annual review, and promotion
of diversity and equity. We propose 3 critical priority areas, [i] to determine the central mechanisms involved in
the persistence of pain and opioid use in SCD, [ii] study “interoception of sickle pain perception” and/or
improve SCD pain responses in the brain and other organs within animals and humans, and [iii] examine
chronic and acute pain and downstream complications and treatment side-effects requiring whole-person
approaches. Finally, we will maximize access to SCDPAIN via multimodal dissemination efforts to propel
scientific advancements in SCD. The MPI team has extensive experience in propelling SCD pain research
forward, bringing multidisciplinary teams together, and mentoring the next generation of pain scientists. In
addition, a team of 9 collaborators bring extensive, diverse and cutting-edge technology which will lead
research into a new era of mechanism-based translational understanding of sickle cell pain. Their passion for
successful mentoring and promoting diversity is poised to provide a continuum of success to the network. The
impact of SCDPAIN will be monumental in: [1] Building multidisciplinary research capacity to fulfill critical
unmet needs of SCD pain; [2] Incentivizing novel initiatives through Pilot funds leading to R-series, HEAL and
related Grants and [3] Catalyzing the future generation of scientists to accelerate SCD pain research.
SCDPAIN will lead to a transformative framework and excite experts and novice researchers for mechanism-
based, whole-person understanding of SCD pain mechanisms."
10939943,"Canonical Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in several vital processes, including neural tube and retinal
vascularization, as well as the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB).
Specifically, the Wnt signal triggered by Norrin has been identified as a key regulator of vascular development in
the vertebrate retina and is essential for regulating significant blood vessels in the ear. Norrin plays an essential
role in the development and maintenance of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye
responsible for vision. Mutations or abnormalities in the Norrin gene can lead to various retinal diseases, like
Norrie disease which is characterized by abnormal development of the retina and other structures in the eye.
When Frizzled receptor 4 (FZD4), the receptor of Norrin, is knocked out in mice, it leads to abnormal vascular
development in the retina. TSPAN12 interacts with FZD4 and Norrin and acts as co-receptor that enhances
FZD4-meidted Norrin signaling. To ensure the integrity of the BBB and BRB, the involvement of two related Wnt
signaling coreceptors, namely LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6, collaborate with Norrin or Wnt
to bind to the FZD, initiating the Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, disruptions in Norrin/FZD4 signaling in the
adult retina and cerebellum result in cell-autonomous changes in the BRB and BBB function, respectively,
indicating a necessity for Norrin/FZD4 signaling in the maintenance of barriers and underscores the remarkable
adaptability of the mature central nervous system's (CNS) vascular structure. Additionally, the integrity of the
BBB relies on the presence of Wnt7 and its co-receptors, RECK and GPR124. The combined action of these
signaling molecules and receptors is essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of the BBB and BRB.
Our main objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which Norrin, TSPAN12, RECK and GPR124
contribute to the ligand specific Wnt/-catenin signaling in retinal and CNS angiogenesis. To accomplish this, we
will use recombinant receptor complexes to determine their molecular mechanisms of action by biochemical and
biophysical approaches. Through our investigations, we seek to unravel the precise role of Norrin, Wnt7 and
their co-receptors in initiating signaling events. The results will have implications for the development of novel
therapeutic strategies targeting retinal diseases and the maintenance of barrier functions in the CNS."

The Translational Core for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Development (TCTDD) will enhance the research
programs of a growing number of R01 funded investigators engaged in basic science research by providing
powerful new data science and high throughput data analysis support. Currently, NEI R01 grants supported by
this P30 grant are engaged in basic biomedical research (T0 research) with explicitly stated goals of translation
of research findings for new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye diseases (T1 research). The
TCTDD core will provide Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) services for pre-processing, analysis and
visualization of basic research data (molecular, cellular and imaging) to provide deeper mechanistic insights and
synergistic opportunities for moving towards translational research (Aim 1). The TCTDD core will also provide
technology-driven, automated services to bolster the research throughput for generating high quality, rigorous
research data which will expand the breadth and depth of basic science research while accelerating related
translational research (Aim 2). The long-term goal is to accelerate discoveries that easily transit from bench-to-
bedside."
10911165,"Summary
This project is directed towards transforming the blood donor pool in Ghana from family replacement donations
(FRD) to voluntary collections. In line with WHO recommendations, the national blood policy in Ghana aims at
100% voluntary blood donation pool to secure and sustain an adequate and safe blood supply, since voluntary
blood donors are more likely to donate on a regular basis. The major challenge for blood transfusion services
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the juxtaposition of an increasing clinical demand for blood and a historically
insufficient supply of safe blood in the region. The inadequate and irregular supply of blood readily available for
emergency transfusions play a cardinal role in the high mortality rates in obstetric haemorrhage. We have
identified the system of blood donation in Ghana as the major barrier to providing adequate and regular blood
to meet the transfusion needs of the country. Currently, over 70% of blood collection in Ghana is obtained in a
Family Replacement Donor (FRD) system, which is associated with insufficient, unsustainable and relatively
unsafe supply of blood for emergencies. In contrast with an average rate of 31 per 1000 population in countries
with a 100% voluntary blood donor base, blood donation in Ghana remains at only 5 per 1000 population. As a
direct result, blood supply is characterized by chronic inadequacy with frequent critical shortages, and
represents a major developmental challenge. Our long-term goal is to secure a sustainable supply of adequate
and safe blood in Ghana by establishing a new paradigm of blood donation in the country focused on a
community-based volunteer system and nutritional donor enrichment. Anaemia accounts for up to 53% of
voluntary donor deferrals and is, therefore, a major focus of the current application. In addition, fears
associated with misconceptions about blood donation, and the lack of knowledge and information on blood
donation contribute to the low number of blood donation volunteers in Ghana. The targeting of communities to
donate blood not as individuals but as communities (communal collectivism), with a reciprocity model that
ensures blood is available for future use by their own communities offers an attractive strategy to recruit new
volunteers. Interventions based on communal collectivism and aided by communication strategies are
culturally appropriate in SSA but have not yet been explored for increasing blood donation rates. Additionally,
other modifiable causes of inadequate blood donation—motivation, access to donation facilities, nutrition—will
be targeted using improved communication, behavioural change methods, and iron supplementation to
improve overall donor recruitment and retention. We will evaluate the impact of increased availability of
volunteer community-sourced blood on reduction of haemorrhage-related maternal deaths in community
hospitals. Based on these ideas, we will test the OVERALL HYPOTHESIS “A community-based volunteer
and nutritional donor enrichment model towards recurring blood donors will help to overcome the
developmental challenge of blood availability in Ghana”."
10911166,"Increasing numbers of persons living with HIV (PLWH) are living to older ages. Older PLWH are at increased
risk for a wide spectrum of co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, frailty phenotype, and mental
health disorders. Practical primary care-based interventions are needed for older PLWH that target lifestyle
factors to reduce complications of aging and improve healthspan. Most PLWH engage in less physical activity
(PA) than is recommended by public health guidelines. Thus, increasing PA can lead to numerous mental and
physical health benefits among PLWH. Current studies in PLWH typically focus on the impact of supervised
exercise. However, there are many barriers to this type of PA. Lifestyle physical activity (LPA) programs that
focus on integrating PA, especially walking, into everyday life, may be more successful in producing a
sustained increase in PA. The long-term goal of this research is to develop an effective and efficient primary
care intervention that increases LPA among older PLWH. We leverage the Multiphase Optimization STrategy
(MOST) as a framework for developing, optimizing, and evaluating a multicomponent behavioral intervention.
MOST is comprised of three phases. First, in the preparation phase, an empirical and theory-driven conceptual
model is developed that identifies differentiable intervention components and specifies optimization criteria
(i.e., goal of intervention development). We have completed this phase. Second, in the optimization phase, the
impact of each intervention component on the desired outcome is empirically examined. The goal is to
determine which components to include in a final intervention package that is optimized for efficacy and
efficiency. The proposed study reflects the second phase, or an optimization trial. Finally, in the evaluation
phase, the optimized intervention package is evaluated for efficacy in a traditional RCT; this will be the next
step in this line of research following the currently proposed project. In this project, we will test the impact of
three separable intervention components on steps per day after 4 months of intervention. We will recruit 208
PLWH of age ≥50 year classified as low-active. All participants receive component ‘0’: brief advice to exercise
and a Fitbit activity tracker. We then test 3 additional components in a factorial design: 1) PA Coaching—
focused on goal-setting and self-monitoring; 2) Cognitive-Behavioral intervention for PA (CB-PA)—focused on
identifying values and addressing internal barriers to PA such as pain, depression, or fatigue; 3) Social Support
for PA (SS-PA)—a component which leverages the social functionality of the Fitbit app, promoting social
support and friendly competition. The primary outcome will be steps per day during Month 4. The observed
main and interaction effects for the 3 candidate components will guide selection of components to be included
in an optimized intervention that will be tested in a future RCT. We will also examine potential mediators for
each intervention component, as well as secondary outcomes including perceived physical health, mental
health, cardiovascular disease risk, and the frailty phenotype."

effectiveness. Population-level data on cancer recurrence are difficult to capture, and require evaluation of
multiple data sources to accurately identify cancer recurrences. The Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), a SEER
registry since 1973, is strongly positioned to identify recurrences in a population-based setting. The registry
data are linked to the Utah Population Database (UPDB), which includes electronic medical records (EMR),
statewide healthcare facility data (SHFD; inpatient, ambulatory surgery and emergency department), and
claims data (All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Medicare). We propose to assess the utility of using data
sources common across all state cancer registries and to investigate the added value of novel data linkages
available at the Utah Cancer Registry. We also propose to extend and validate a recently-developed algorithm
to identify individual level breast cancer recurrence to identify recurrence for other cancer types to estimate the
population-level burden of recurrence. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) Determine the predictive
performance to identify recurrence using data currently available to cancer registries for breast and
prostate cancer. These would include Commission on Cancer recurrence variables, electronic pathology
reports, and death certificates. 2) Estimate the improvements in predictive performance to identify
recurrence by inclusion of novel administrative data linkage for breast and prostate cancer. 3) Evaluate
the scalability and transportability of recurrence identifying algorithms across settings and
populations for research. We will validate the algorithms’ predictive performance by estimating positive and
negative predictive values among a racially and ethnically diverse collection of cancer cases from the Seattle-
Puget Sound SEER registry, including comparisons of performance across race/ethnicity, age, stage, and
rural/urban status. In addition, we will validate the breast recurrence identification algorithm recently developed
in the Seattle registry in the Utah breast cancer population. No algorithms currently exist to evaluate the data
sources individually and combined to identify recurrence events based on cancer registry and administrative
data. Our results will inform the predictive performance for routinely available data and the value added of
administrative data sources, which may be differentially complete and/or costly to procure. Our work will
establish a path forward for population-level tracking of cancer recurrence and facilitate prioritization of data
generation efforts and algorithms that can be customized based on the data available in different situations.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that
has significant attributable morbidity and mortality in critically ill Veterans. Analysis of Veterans Health
Administrative data reported that Veterans who develop AKI during a hospitalization are at substantial risk for
the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 1 year. AKI is also a major complication of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients and almost half of these patients who develop AKI do not recover to baseline
kidney function. Numerous therapeutic interventions have been evaluated in clinical trials to overcome this
significant clinical challenge, with none proven successful. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill this gap
in knowledge by discovering new targets that could be exploited for therapeutic interventions in AKI.
 The focus of this project on the lymphatic system, specifically lymphangiogenesis in the kidney, will
build upon the progress made during the previous funding cycle. Lymphatics aid in transport of inflammatory
cells, removal of cellular debris from the microenvironment of inflammation-induced injury, drainage of excess
fluid and ultimately facilitate tissue repair. While studies have highlighted the key role for lymphangiogenesis
in the heart, the role of the lymphatic system in the kidney in the pathogenesis of AKI and the AKI to CKD
transition is only now being recognized.
 Our recently work demonstrated that VEGF-C and VEGF-D, the major ligands in lymphangiogenesis,
are abundantly present in renal tubules at baseline and are secreted following injury. Lymphatic vessel
formation is robustly induced following kidney injury in multiple models of AKI. Our central hypothesis is that
inflammation associated lymphangiogenesis is beneficial in the pathogenesis of AKI and the transition of AKI
to CKD. We will test this overall hypothesis in three aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
inflammation associated lymphangiogenesis originates from preexisting lymphatic endothelial cells in the
kidney after AKI. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that an intact lymphatic network maintained by myeloid
lineage cells is required for preserving renal structure and function after AKI. In Aim 3, we will test the
hypothesis that LA is dependent on NF-κB expression in lymphatic endothelial cells following AKI and during
the AKI to CKD transition.
 These studies will have a significant impact both in uncovering mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis
and providing new insights into the dynamic function of lymphatics in the pathobiology of AKI. Upon successful
completion of the proposed aims, we will have comprehensively examined the role of lymphangiogenesis in
AKI and the AKI to CKD transition, and will also provide a novel platform that will facilitate translational
therapeutic efforts in the field."
10911046,"According to the US Department of Veterans Affairs, heart failure (HF) and associated complications
are one of the main reasons for hospital readmissions and death in the Veterans Healthcare System. In fact,
above 40 years of age, the lifetime risk of developing HF is 1 in 5. Readmissions for HF occur within 30 days
of discharge in 20% of patients older than 65 in the Medicare and Veterans. Together, these healthcare
systems incurred nearly $37.2 billion for HF care. A substantial number of patients develop severe left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) secondary to pressure overload (e.g., hypertension, aortic valve stenosis), and
experience episodic severe congestive HF, hospitalization, and increased mortality.
 The mechanisms of HF are complex and include local and systemic neurohormonal changes and
hemodynamic overload. RECK (Reversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein with Kazal motifs) is a unique
membrane-anchored protein that inhibits many of the mediators responsible for adverse cardiac remodeling,
including MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase), EGFR, and
inflammatory mediators. Our published reports demonstrated that angiotensin (Ang)-II, a critical mediator of
hypertension-induced adverse cardiac remodeling, suppresses RECK in vivo. Moreover, Ang-II suppressed
RECK and induced MMP activation and cardiac fibroblast migration in vitro, effects that were reversed by the
ectopic overexpression of RECK. Our preliminary data show that pressure overload (PO) by transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) suppresses RECK and increases MMP activation in a wild type mouse heart. While mice
with inducible cardiomyocyte-specific RECK gene deletion spontaneously develop cardiac hypertrophy and
fibrosis, and these effects are exacerbated by PO by TAC. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific RECK
overexpression inhibits PO-induced hypertrophy, fibrosis and contractile dysfunction. Importantly, RECK
expression is reduced in both hypertrophied (aortic stenosis) and failing human hearts of non-ischemic origin.
Based on these critical and novel preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that reversing RECK
suppression or enhancing its expression in the heart will blunt PO-induced adverse structural remodeling and
progression to HF by targeting pro-hypertrophic and pro-fibrotic mediators. Our long-term goals are to
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of myocardial hypertrophy and its
transition to HF, and to identify novel therapeutic target(s) for intervention and treatment. Our immediate
goals are to better characterize the cardioprotective role of RECK in inhibiting the pathogenesis of PO-induced
adverse cardiac remodeling and HF development, and to develop an interventional strategy to induce its
expression in the heart. To test our central hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed:
 In Aim 1, we will (a) Elucidate the impact of RECK deletion in a conditional cardiomyocyte-specific
manner on spontaneous development of myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction, and (b) determine
whether RECK deletion exacerbates PO-induced adverse remodeling. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
inducible cardiomyocyte-specific RECK overexpression will prevent the development of or reverse established
PO-induced adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, and progression to HF. In Aim 3, we will determine
whether ectopic overexpression of RECK using an AAV9-based gene therapeutic approach will prevent the
development of or reverse established PO-induced adverse cardiac remodeling and HF.
 Thus, our proposed genetic and gene therapeutic approaches will (i) delineate the fundamental
role of RECK in cardiac structure and function, (ii) characterize its role as a critical anti-hypertrophic
and anti-fibrotic mediator in PO, and (iii) demonstrate that its induction in the heart is a novel
therapeutic approach to blunt progression of adverse structural and functional remodeling to heart
failure."

10912430,"Project Summary
Cancer epigenetics is an emerging field of high significance. It has led to the identification of novel
therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Among chromatin remodeling complexes, driver mutations of the
MLL family histone methyltransferases are commonly found in cancer. They lead to epigenetic
aberrations that underlie cancer initiation, evolution, and metastasis. Understanding how the activity of
the MLL family enzymes on chromatin is regulated and how its dysregulation leads to malignancy will
shed light on disease mechanisms. We previously reconstituted a functionally active MLL1 core
complex in vitro and identified four MLL1 core complex components, i.e. ASH2L, RbBP5, WDR5 and
DPY30, which are essential for MLL1 enzymatic activity. Here we show that a novel function of ASH2L
in MLL1 regulation and a previously uncharacterized mode of action. We will use biochemical,
structural and epigenomic approaches to delineate how ASH2L confers new complexity to regulation of
H3K4 methylation and gene expression. We expect to establish a new paradigm on how epigenetic
heterogeneity is established by a well-defined MLL1 core complex, which also has general implications
for other chromatin modifying enzymes. Our study will ultimately benefit discovery of novel therapeutic
targets or biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This project matches the mission of National
Cancer Institute (NCI)."
10912575,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) continues to be a widespread problem with an estimated 29% of all Americans
ages 12 and up meeting DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis during their lifetime (13.9% within the past 12 months;
Grant et al., 2015). Although abstinence remains as the primary outcome for many treatment programs, such
definitions of “recovery” remain far too narrow. Recently, NIAAA disseminated a definition of recovery aimed at
addressing limitations of past research, stimulating new research, and better operationalizing recovery (NIAAA,
2020). Specifically, NIAAA defines recovery as “a process through which an individual pursues both remission
from AUD and cessation from heavy drinking.” They further go on to state that “an individual may be
considered recovered if both remission from AUD and cessation from heavy drinking are achieved and
maintained over time.” Although this new operational definition will help to organize the existing literature and
provide guidance for future research, several questions remain. First, categorization of recovery as initial,
early, sustained, and stable requires further research to establish whether such thresholds are meaningful in
both clinical practice and research. Second, the utility of heavy drinking thresholds to define recovery remains
questionable at best. Finally, the new definition does not provide a conceptual framework for which recovery is
a “process” requiring continual monitoring for clinical markers (clinical change points) that may impact recovery
status. The aim of the current application is to examine the utility and validity of this new definition within the
context of a novel theoretical model of AUD recovery. The proposed study will recruit participants seeking
treatment for AUD from the community. Participants will complete a structured clinical interview and provide
information on their current alcohol use and related behaviors. All participants will receive 12 weeks of AUD
psychotherapy and complete brief assessments at the end of each treatment session and biweekly during the
first 12-months post treatment. In addition, participants will complete in-person interviews at 3-month and 6-
month intervals post-treatment for the duration of the study (for up to 24-54 months post treatment depending
on time of enrollment). Findings from the proposed research have the potential to increase understanding of
the dynamic nature of recovery and thereby improve clinical decision-making and generate future research.
Specifically, our goal is to address the question of “Are the constructs of relapse, recurrence remission, or
recovery useful heuristics for clinical practice and research, and if so, how?” Identification of the processes
important for each type of change in clinical course may help in designing adaptive treatments that capitalize
on our current knowledge of the treatment literature. For example, people may need to use different strategies
(e.g., weighing pros/cons, substituting new behaviors) for different phases of recovery. To our knowledge, this
application is the first to test NIAAA’s new definition and the dynamic nature of recovery, as well as cognitive,
behavioral, and affective processes hypothesized to be important for initiating versus maintaining change."
10912579,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of the Silva Lab is to determine the molecular mechanism by which protein ubiquitination
controls protein synthesis and cellular survival in response to oxidative stress. Oxidizers are constantly produced
by a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources and translation is an essential cellular process that must be
finely reprogrammed when cells are challenged with oxidizers. Failure to reprogram protein expression,
accumulation of damaged proteins, and inadequate management of oxidizers are the underlying causes of a
variety of neurodegenerative diseases, tumor progression, and the process of aging. Understanding and
modulating stress defense pathways, such as translation, would provide new tools to promote healthier lives and
fight diseases. In eukaryotes, a variety of defense pathways is regulated by ubiquitin. Protein ubiquitination is a
prevalent post-translational modification initially characterized as the molecular marker for protein degradation.
We have recently identified a new role for a poly-ubiquitin variant (K63-linked) in the regulation of protein
synthesis during oxidative stress. Using molecular and proteomics approaches, our lab showed that ribosomes
are the main target of K63 ubiquitin, K63 ubiquitin is essential for cellular viability, and that specific enzymes are
involved in ribosomal ubiquitination and deubiquitination reactions. However, there is still a limited understanding
of how K63 ubiquitin impacts ribosome activity and the protein expression program. This MIRA award will support
the Silva Lab program of research, which will use a combination of large-scale, molecular, and computational
approaches to understand each one of the steps necessary for regulation of translation by K63 ubiquitin. These
steps include recognition of ribosome by ubiquitin enzymes, modification of individual ubiquitin sites, alteration
of ribosome 3D structure, reconfiguration of translation landscape, and determination of the fate of ubiquitinated
ribosomes. Defining the molecular mechanisms regulating such a fundamental biological process as protein
synthesis is key to enhancing cellular resistance to stress and reshaping our understanding of gene expression
control. This work will lead to an established and independent research program, future NIH research awards,
expanded collaboration network, and interdisciplinary research within the NIGMS mission."

The purpose of this Core is to provide bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data. Our Core will provide the
essential data analysis service to render this data accessible and interpretable to the members of this
consortium. The directors and staff of this Core have extensive experience in the analysis of genomic data, as
well as familiarity with the underlying biology of the associated projects. Specifically, we will process bulk,
single cell and spatial transcriptomic data using existing pipelines. Moreover, we have developed tools to
interpret transcriptomic profiles in terms of cell type and inflammatory signatures. We also have expertise in the
use of data integration tools to combine our transcriptomic data with genetic and lipidomic data. Finally, we will
provide tools for data visualization, such as an R Shiny server for viewing individual genes in two dimensional

10936902,"Title: In crystallo biomimetic oxygenase chemistry within peptidic frameworks
Abstract:
Mononuclear non-heme Fe and Cu sites in oxygenases functionalize the highly inert C–H bonds
of substrates involved in metabolism, natural product synthesis, and global biogeochemical
cycles, all of which directly impact human health. Despite the importance of these enzymes, the
structures and properties of many key enzymatic intermediates are not fully understood. Synthetic
analogs of the intermediates facilitate more in-depth studies, but current models have shown that
the protein environment, or lack thereof, significantly affects reactivity. Site-isolation, weak-field
ligands, and noncovalent secondary interactions are hallmarks of oxygenase active sites, but
these features are difficult to simultaneously replicate in synthetic systems. To address these
gaps, our laboratory has developed single-crystalline peptide assemblies (or “frameworks”) that
bind metals in their porous channels using amino acid residues. Our central hypothesis is that
usage of peptide-based coordinating groups allows direct comparisons between the model
system and the enzyme, while the crystalline matrix stabilizes reactive species for structure
determination by X-ray crystallography. We have reproduced the critical facial triad coordination
(2His/1-carboxylate) for non-heme Fe sites, from which we will explore the structures and
chemistry of the fleeting high-valent intermediates relevant to the enzyme mechanism. The Cu
versions of these frameworks are also appropriate models for the active site of particulate
methane monooxygenase (pMMO), whose active site has been long-debated and recently
postulated to be a single Cu site bound to a 2His/Asp ligand set. Given the modularity and ease
of peptide synthesis, we will tune the structures of these sites to obtain detailed structure-function
correlations that will illuminate how protein environments elicit remarkable inorganic reactivity.
The outcomes of this research are expected to fill in key gaps in the mechanism of these enzymes
and inform the design of mechanism-based therapeutics, as well as catalysts for pharmaceutical
synthesis, water remediation, and mitigation of climate change."

The global burden of disease caused by microbial pathogens is one of the largest challenges facing the
biomedical community, highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Threats of emerging infectious disease and
resistance to antimicrobial therapies highlight the growing need for vaccines and therapeutics, plus training
programs for scientists to ensure ongoing cutting-edge research will improve human health. The rationale for
this Training Program, active for 35 years, is the necessity for increased knowledge of the complex interactions
between pathogens, microbiota, and the host immune system. The multi-disciplinary Microbiology & Immunology
department is a rich environment where students learn to challenge established thinking and address scientific
challenges. We aim to train the best and brightest students and postdocs, with mentoring in the laboratories of
Program faculty to gain the skills needed to develop rigorous, impactful, well-funded research programs at the
leading-edge of research in host-microbial interactions. We provide a strong foundation in fundamental research
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host-microbe interactions, while
emphasizing translational research, human studies, and the problems that clinicians face in the treatment of
infectious disease. Additional key elements of the training program include rigorous coursework, trainee-invited
speakers, a departmental scientific conference for presentation and interaction, and a student-organized
scientific retreat for cohesion and scientific exchange. Trainees are involved in teaching activities and are
provided opportunities to become effective mentors and teachers, including a required TA-ship. Program
enhancements include added learning in critical concepts in responsible conduct of research and increased
emphasis on gaining knowledge in performing rigorous and reproducible research through formal courses taught
by Program faculty, and laboratory training. The training program has greatly expanded efforts in recruitment,
retention, and career development, with several initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels
of the Program. Graduate student trainees are appointed upon admission to Stanford for up to 2 years; postdocs
typically for 1 year; we are requesting renewal of 6 graduate and 2 postdoctoral slots per year for 5 additional
years of funding. Required trainees-advisor IDP meetings along with substantial events and resources in career
development facilitate transitions into the biomedical workforce; for the past 10 years we have exceeded our
goal of 95% retention of our trainees in STEM-related fields. The Program benefits from the exceptional
environment and we leverage substantial School of Medicine and University resources, programs, and
engagement. Students and postdocs are successful, publishing high-impact papers and finding leading positions
in all aspects of science, from research to teaching to consulting to policy. Over our history, we have trained
many who are now leaders in biomedical research and we hope to continue this important and highly successful
Training Program."
10909880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Worldwide, serious mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are major causes of
impairment and disability. In West Africa, the hardships of SMI are compounded by pervasive societal stigma,
scarce treatment options, systematic exclusion, neglect, and abuse. People with SMI in West Africa describe
the experience as akin to “receiving a death sentence.” West African mental healthcare systems have severely
constrained resources that contribute to a large treatment gap. Most people with SMI receive services from
traditional and faith healers who do not provide high quality care. Healers often use practices such as chaining,
seclusion, and forced fasting that often worsen the negative impacts of SMI. Given the shortage of skilled
mental health providers and the prevalence of healers, coupled with the established infrastructure healers have
in place (e.g., referral networks, “prayer camps”, community ties) global health leaders have argued that
healers and prayer camp settings may be leveraged as conduits for treatment, provided they receive
appropriate training and support to provide higher quality care. Our multinational research team has developed
M&M: a dual-pronged intervention package comprised of a mobile health program designed to train healers to
deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions while maintaining safety and patient dignity in practice (M-
Healer) combined with pharmacotherapy delivered directly to the patients at their prayer camps via visiting
nurse (Mobile Nurse). We have successfully completed usability, acceptability, feasibility and preliminary
clinical testing of the modular elements of the intervention at prayer camps, with very promising results. We
now propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated M&M intervention in a fully-powered trial and share
it widely through a new West African Digital Mental Health Alliance (WADMA), a mission centered network
designed to jumpstart digital mental health research and cross institutional collaboration though grant funded
studies, education, and integration of digital mental health tools in clinical practice. We aim to: 1. Evaluate the
effectiveness of the M&M intervention using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design; 2. Examine
mediators and moderators of M&M intervention effects; and 3. Use qualitative methods to inform M&M
intervention optimization and future implementation. Although focused on West Africa, the dual-pronged model
we are testing to address quality of care needs, the outcomes we will measure, and the methodological
lessons we will learn will all have translational implications for development and implementation of integrated
technology-assisted treatment support packages for paraprofessionals caring for people with SMI in the United
States."
10909882,"Relevance of Research Plan: One priority area for the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) is
to provide quick, effective, recovery-oriented treatments for depressive/anxiety disorders,
representing the most common and impairing psychiatric disorders in Veterans. Cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated reliable efficacy in treating depressive/anxiety
disorders and their related impairments. However, CBT is underutilized due in large part to the
complexity and number of disorder-specific treatments (DSTs) protocols across disorders, as
well as extensive training needed to apply them to different diagnoses and different
combinations of diagnostic comorbidities. Recently, Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT)
was developed as a transdiagnostic intervention to address each of the depressive/anxiety
disorders and their comorbidities in Veterans within a single treatment protocol. Initial studies of
TBT, including a funded CSR&D Career Development Award (CDA), demonstrate that the
treatment is efficacious in reducing psychiatric symptomatology and related impairments in
Veterans presenting with a wide range of diagnoses. Preliminary findings also support the ease
of dissemination and implementation of TBT by DVA providers. Although additional study is
needed with larger samples and improved comparison groups, the transdiagnostic approach in
TBT may address many of the current limitations of the DSTs discussed above. Primary Aims
in Research Plan: The proposed study aims to test the non-inferiority of TBT and DSTs in
improving psychiatric symptomatology and related impairments. It is hypothesized that TBT will
result non-inferior improvements in psychiatric symptomatology and related impairments
compared to the DST comparison groups. A secondary aim is to compare the feasibility and
acceptability of TBT and DSTs. Participant population: The participants of the proposed study
will include 216 Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder
(MDD), and/or panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG). General inclusion criteria involve: 1) a
diagnosis of a PTSD, MDD, or PD/AG; and 2) a willingness and competence to provide
informed consent for research participation. Procedures to be used: A randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with TBT and DSTs conditions will be completed. Participation in the RCT will involve
completion of: 1) consent documentation, 2) intake assessment, 3) random assignment to
treatment condition, 4) weekly 45-60-minute appointments of psychotherapy for 12 weeks, and
5) self-report assessments of psychiatric symptomatology and impairment at intake, mid-
treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Process variables also will be investigated.
Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: Upon investigation with supported efficacy
and non-inferiority as compared to DSTs, TBT will represent an excellent treatment option within
the DVA in terms of providing a single protocol that is easy to disseminate to and implement by
providers as well as being efficacious in addressing psychiatric symptomatology and related
impairments in Veterans with various depressive/anxiety disorders and related comorbidities."
10935523,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 3 - Care Integration for Patients Receiving Post-Acute Care
and Hospice
This Project focuses on care integration for patients with cancer who are treated in post-acute (skilled nursing
facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and home health) and hospice settings. Care for patients with cancer
at the end-of-life is often fragmented and not patient-centered, particularly among marginalized populations.
Less is known about the coordination and quality of post-acute care for patients undergoing complex cancer
surgeries and hospitalizations for disease- and treatment-related complications. There has been substantial
consolidation in post-acute care and hospice settings, including a marked increase in the prevalence of for-
profit chains. Structural integration across sectors (e.g., with systems/hospitals) could increase other forms of
integration, such as: functional (e.g., policies and protocols for coordination of care across settings), normative
(e.g., common culture), interpersonal (e.g., collaboration and teamwork within and across organizations), and
clinical process integration (e.g., activities integrating services across settings). Alternatively, such structural
integration could increase incentives for referrals to lower-quality facilities, service or staffing reductions, or
employment of less skilled clinical staff. Working with Projects 1, 2, and 4 and the Cores, the team will conduct
case studies and interviews of clinicians within health systems and their hospitals and practices as well as
clinicians and staff in post-acute care and hospice settings to evaluate how structural features (e.g. co-location,
referral patterns, geographic reach) relate to these other non-structural forms of integration. The team will
survey medical and nursing directors, clinicians, and staff from a random sample of post-acute and hospice
facilities that do not have ownership arrangements with health systems to measure non-structural forms of
integration outside of health systems. The team will use administrative data from Medicare, Medicaid, and
commercial insurers to describe key outcomes, such as utilization (e.g. readmissions), spending, and high
quality and equitable care (e.g., post-operative complications, patient/family experiences), and to examine
associations between integration types and outcomes overall and for marginalized populations. The aims are:
Aim 1: Adapt an existing framework to describe key forms of integration (i.e., structural, functional, normative,
interpersonal, and process) for the care of oncology patients in post-acute care and hospice settings and
identify mechanisms through which forms of care integration may produce improved outcomes and more
equitable care for patients using post-acute and hospice care. Aim 2: Measure care integration in post-acute
care and hospice settings and assess relationships among different forms of care integration. Determine how
these relationships vary by agency and market factors. Aim 3: Assess the association of integration in post-
acute care and hospice care settings with utilization, spending, and high-quality and equitable care for patients
with cancer, and assess mechanisms through which integration improves or worsens overall outcomes and
equitable care for marginalized subgroups."
10935524,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 4 - Care Integration for Patients with Cancer Using Specialty
Pharmacies
This project aims to examine the integration of specialty pharmacies into systems/hospitals and independent
practices and its impact on patients’ use of and adherence to orally-administered anticancer and supportive
care drugs. Health care systems and independent practices have increasingly opened their own specialty
pharmacies or are increasingly contracting with off-site contract pharmacy services—forms of structural
integration. Alternatively, health systems or practices may work with specialty pharmacies that are completely
independent. This Project will examine the extent to which pharmacy services are integrated into practices (in
the presence and absence of structural integration) and the role of specialty pharmacies in working with
oncologists and patients to ensure that patients can access, initiate, and adhere to prescribed oral anticancer
medications and supportive care medications. This Project also will work closely with Project 1 to consider the
impact of hospital 340B discounts on structural integration as systems open on-site pharmacies or contract
with off-site pharmacy services. Working with Projects 1, 2, and 3 and the Cores, the team will conduct case
studies to adapt an existing conceptual framework of integration to oncology care relevant to this setting. The
team will survey leaders, managers, clinicians, and staff in systems, practices, and specialty pharmacies
(including in-house and independent specialty pharmacies). The team will use administrative data from
Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers to describe key outcomes, including the proportion of patients
filling oral anticancer drugs, time from visit to orally-administered anticancer medication fill among those who
initiate treatment, and medication adherence among those who initiate treatment. We will assess the
association of various forms of integration on these outcomes. The aims mirror the overall Project aims:
Aim 1: Adapt an existing conceptual framework to describe key forms of integration (i.e., structural, functional,
normative, interpersonal, process) for pharmacy services for patients with cancer who may benefit from oral
anticancer medications. Identify mechanisms through which forms of care integration may produce better
outcomes and more equitable care.
Aim 2: Measure care integration in practice sites and specialty pharmacies and assess relationships among
different forms of integration. Determine if and how integration varies by practice characteristics (e.g., 340B
discounts, proportion of marginalized patients) and market factors (e.g., competition, payer mix).
Aim 3. Assess the association of practice and specialty pharmacy integration with medication use outcomes
and assess mechanisms through which integration improves or worsens outcomes and equitable care for
marginalized subgroups based on race and ethnicity and residence in rural or high deprivation areas.
Assessing the association between specialty pharmacy integration and patient medication use outcomes will
inform policies and practices that improve patient care and outcomes."

10936160,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Biochemistry Core supports projects associated with the Center for Pediatric Research by providing
consultation and technical support for protein-protein interaction screening with BioID-based methods, as well
as multi-analyte detection. The Core will continue to perform BioID and similar methods as a cutting-edge
approach to screen for protein-protein interactions. The Core will continue to provide technical abilities and
services for multi-analyte detection and quantification of proteins. The Core will also aid in the preparation of
manuscripts and funding applications as they relate to the services provided. By providing these services in
house, the Core will directly interface with the investigators during experimental design, protocol establishment,
troubleshooting and execution as well as organize any further analysis outside of the Core. The purpose of the
Biochemistry Core is to support the goals of its users, namely independent scientists studying the basis of
pediatric health and disease and uncovering novel approaches to treatment. Through this purpose the Core will
continue to not only propel the work of Center and other independent scientists forward but will do so in a
sustainable manner for decades to come."
11041830,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception m order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women . A ne,., long-acting formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety arc well recognized.

The Eunice KenJ1edy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is tl1e number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese  woman that does not increase the risk of  VTE.  One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill,"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting inject able form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTC especially for obese women In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will  be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).

The proposed study will be conducted m \\Omen of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics , the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, and safety of this new contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of inject ion. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2"
10938800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With aging of the U.S. population, the burden of osteoporotic fractures will increase well beyond the current
estimate of 2 million per year and $17 billion cost. The 10-year absolute risk of fracture for those aged 75-84 is
24% in women and 14% in men. PFAS are chemicals that are stable in the environment and can bioaccumulate
in human tissue. Biomonitoring studies document PFAS exposure in >98% of the U.S. population, with up to 200
million Americans exposed to PFAS through their drinking water. PFAS have been isolated in human bone and
may be linked to osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture; these concerning findings need to be verified in
additional cohorts. Rigorous epidemiologic studies are critically needed to understand the impact of PFAS on
bone health, especially those that include racially diverse populations. Our overarching hypothesis is that PFAS
concentrations are associated with increased bone loss and fracture risk. We will leverage existing samples and
data from the two largest prospective US osteoporosis cohort studies to perform an in-depth study of serum
PFAS, bone loss, and fractures that will include long-term follow-up of up to 20 years using: 1) The Osteoporotic
Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study and 2) the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). Additionally, we will confirm
findings in the Health Aging and Body Composition Study (HABC), a racially diverse cohort of older adults. Aim
1: Using efficient case-cohort study designs, investigate the prospective association between serum PFAS and
incident fractures in 1321 MrOS men and 1578 SOF women who will be sex matched with 1500 randomly
selected persons from each respective cohort. PFAS will be analyzed in serum. We will confirm findings in a
third case-cohort selected from the racially diverse HABC study (479 incident fractures and a sex- and race-
matched cohort of 480 randomly selected participants). Aim 2: Evaluate the prospective association between
serum PFAS and rate of loss of total hip bone mineral density (BMD) separately in men and women from the
three subcohorts. Aim 3: Utilize markers of bone metabolism and structure to provide novel insights into the
cellular and structural mechanisms by which PFAS may adversely affect bone. #3a: Evaluate the association
between serum PFAS and markers of bone formation (PINP) and bone resorption (CTX) separately in men and
women from the cohorts. #3b: In a substudy using data already available in MrOS, evaluate the association
between serum PFAS and bone structure (HR-pQCT). #3c: Also, in an exploratory sub-Aim, apply mediation
analyses using a counterfactual framework-based approach to estimate the extent to which PFAS’s influence on
bone loss might be mediated via biomarkers of bone metabolism (serum PINP, CTX). Aim 4: Leverage rich data
on urine Cd exposure in this study population to investigate mixtures of PFAS and Cd in the preceding analyses.
We have an excellent opportunity to capitalize on pre-existing data and biospecimens to conduct a rigorous
evaluation of the associations between PFAS and fracture risk, bone mineral density, and bone turnover in a
diverse study population."
10932131,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, glioma, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis devastate the lives of millions of patients and their families. Despite decades of research
costing billions of dollars, these and other brain diseases still lack accurate diagnostic tools, effective disease-
modifying therapies, adequate symptomatic managements, or even well-defined mechanistic causes. These
failures stand out particularly in light of incredible advances in basic scientific knowledge. Thus, there is a
critical need for clinicians to be involved in basic research on human brain disease since they are well suited to
identify new approaches. The University of Iowa Clinical Neuroscientist Training Program (CNS-TP) is
designed as an efficient pathway to train outstanding neurology, neurosurgery and neuropathology residents in
basic research, with the goal of increasing the percentage of trainees who continue in a long career as
productive clinician-scientists."
10932502,"Because of a lack of safe, effective and specific treatments for disorders of water balance, the ultimate goal of
our work is to identify novel intracellular pathways by which plasma membrane accumulation of the aquaporin 2
water channel (AQP2) in kidney principal cells can be normalized in the absence of a properly functioning
vasopressin receptor (V2R) signaling pathway. The overall objective of this proposal is to dissect newly-
identified aquaporin 2 (AQP2) trafficking and regulatory pathways in order to provide actionable, basic
information that can be translated into cell-specific clinical advances for the treatment of these conditions.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by renal insensitivity to VP, and results in excessive urine
production, whereas water retention, often a result of inappropriate VP secretion, occurs in conditions such as
congestive heart failure. Aim 1 addresses the hypothesis that AQP2 itself directs its intracellular trafficking
itinerary as an “active” cargo protein rather than a passive bystander. We propose that AQP2 “catalyzes”
compartment-specific actin remodeling via direct and indirect interactions with different cohorts of actin-
regulatory proteins. These include actin itself, the Arp2/3 actin remodeling complex during exocytosis, and the
actin binding protein ezrin during endocytosis. Aim 2 will identify the cellular crosstalk mechanism(s) by which a
tug-of-war between the vasopressin receptor (VP/V2R - positive action) and epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGF/EGFR - negative effect) regulate AQP2 trafficking and water balance. We will first explore how EGF and
other EGFR ligands inhibit the antidiuretic effect of VP by receptor activation and downstream signaling. Then
we will ask how inhibition of the EGFR pathway results in VP-independent AQP2 phosphorylation and membrane
accumulation by activating a non-canonical kinase, P90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Techniques central to the
proposed work include the molecular characterization of protein interactions, advanced super resolution
microscopy and live cell imaging, enzyme activity assays, expression of modified proteins in cultured epithelial
cells, and whole animal physiology. Understanding novel cellular mechanisms of AQP2 regulation and defining
more specific participants in intracellular signaling will open unexplored avenues of research into the regulation
of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We expect that our data will allow the development of more selective and
cell specific pharmacological strategies to regulate AQP2 trafficking in water balance disorders."
10932503,"SUMMARY
Lysosomal function is crucial for cell homeostasis, autophagy, nutrient sensing, apoptosis and tissue remodeling.
In lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), characterized by genetic defects leading to anomalous accumulation of
metabolites in lysosomes, cells are affected by lysosomal malfunction frequently leading to cell death. Cystinosis
is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from defects in the cystine transporter cystinosin (CTNS). Increased
levels of intra-lysosomal cystine lead to cell malfunction and progressive tissue deterioration, which is especially
manifested in kidneys. As with most LSDs, this leads to a slow but irreversible deterioration, organ dysfunction
and early death. Patients with nephropathic cystinosis develop proximal tubule cell dedifferentiation, Fanconi
syndrome and progressive renal injury, which are not corrected by the current therapy, cysteamine. Thus, cell
malfunction and tissue failure occur despite cystine depletion, suggesting that cystine accumulation is not the
only cause of all the defects observed in cystinosis. We recently revealed a defective mechanism of chaperone-
mediated autophagy (CMA) in cystinosis. Defective CMA is directly linked to human disease, including kidney
pathologies and neurological disorders. CMA defects in cystinosis are caused by mislocalization and
downregulation of the only lysosomal CMA receptor, LAMP2A. Defective CMA activity correlates with high
susceptibility to cell death in cystinosis. Importantly, the defect was not rescued by cystine depleting therapies
supporting that it is independent of lysosomal overload. Our data highlight that CMA impairment is an important
contributor to the pathogenesis of cystinosis and underline the need for new treatments to complement cystine-
depletion therapies. Our research plan aims to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to
abnormal CMA activity in cystinosis. We also propose translational approaches that utilize small-molecule
activators of CMA to improve cellular function in cystinosis. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To elucidate the
molecular basis of the regulation of LAMP2A function in cystinosis. To this end, we will study the interplay
between the CTNS protein and the CMA receptor LAMP2A and elucidate the mechanisms that mediate LAMP2A
trafficking and destabilization at the lysosomal membrane in cystinosis. Aim 2: To determine the molecular basis
of the regulation of CMA activity in cystinosis. We will study the mechanisms mediated by CTNS to regulate
CMA function and will test the hypothesis that the rescue of CMA activity improves the function of proximal tubule
cells from cystinotic patients. Aim 3: To utilize small-molecule CMA activators, in vivo, to improve renal function
in cystinotic mice. We will correct cellular and renal function in cystinotic mice using CMA activators, alone, or in
combination with cysteamine. Our research is highly significant because it aims to elucidate molecular
mechanisms associated with a devastating human pathology and will help develop new therapies for the
treatment of cystinosis and other human diseases."
10905610,"SUMMARY
Neurons use local translation to preserve the health of axons, dendrites, and synapses that are far from the
soma. Local translation allows them to respond to local needs. While studying the local synthesis of PINK1 in
axons and dendrites, we discovered that the PINK1 mRNA was transported into axons and dendrites by
“hitchhiking” on mitochondria. The association of the PINK1 mRNA with mitochondria was mediated by
synaptojanin2 and synaptojanin2 binding protein (SYNJ2BP). Synaptojanin2, like synaptojanin1, is an inositol
lipid phosphatase, but also contains a predicted RNA-Recognition Motif (RRM); mutation of the RRM in
synaptojanin2 prevents its ability to localize the PINK1 transcript to mitochondria. We know that synaptojanin2
can bind additional mRNA species, not just PINK1, including many for mitochondrial proteins. Thus
synaptojanin2 represents an important addition to the roster of mechanisms that can transport neuronal
mRNA. We therefore propose to study the broad significance of the synaptojanin2/SYNJ2BP mechanism for
mRNA transport in neurons and for the function of neuronal mitochondria. To this end, we have made both
mouse and human iPSC lines with mutations in the RRM of synaptojanin2 (SYNJAAA). In AIM 1 we will catalog
the neuronal mRNA species bound to the RRM of synaptojanin2 and determine the extent to which it is
required for their transport into axons and dendrites. In AIM 2 we will catalog the mRNA present on neuronal
mitochondria. We will determine to what extent synaptojanin2 and SYNJ2BP are needed for this localization.
We will also catalog the mRNA species present in synaptosomes from control and SYNJAAA mice to determine
which presynaptic mRNAs require binding to synaptojanin2 to reach the synapse. In AIM3 we examine the
functional consequences of mutations in the RRM of synaptojanin2 for the protein content of synapses. the
morphology and functioning of neuronal mitochondria, and the health and survival of neurons."
10905770,"Project Summary/Abstract
Early life adversity, including childhood maltreatment and other traumas, is a major risk factor for a host of
health conditions, including psychiatric disorders, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Health
behaviors, such as diet, sleep, and activity, are linked to childhood adversity and can further contribute to risk
for these conditions. These effects compound over time and poor health outcomes are most evident in adults
when biological effects of stress and health behaviors combine with age-related decline to produce frank
disease. There is now evidence that these processes begin early in life and that some of the health outcomes
can be observed in childhood. Converging evidence from animal models and recent human studies indicate
that mitochondria play a key role in coordinating the stress response and in the aging process. Here we
hypothesize that early stress alters mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial function and that this may be a
mechanism of risk for stress- and age-related disorders. The proposed study leverages data and specimens
available in a longitudinal developmental study of childhood maltreatment that includes rich data on exposures,
biomarkers of aging, and health outcomes. Results of this study are expected to provide insight into the
biological mechanisms of adversity-related risk for accelerated aging and risk for disease, and provide targets
for new treatment and prevention approaches."
10905897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Some of the most important unanswered questions in health and aging relate to the influence of early life
and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of these factors is limited by the dearth of longitudinal,
intergenerational microdata containing health information. Our broad research objective is to build an
unparalleled public resource to study the longitudinal and intergenerational determinants of health and aging,
containing unprecedented sample sizes for understudied populations such as minorities and women.
 We propose to enhance and expand the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-
dataset (LIFE-M), which integrates millions of birth, marriage, and death records with decennial censuses over
four generations from the late 19th to the 20th century. Our specific aims are to:
(1) Expand LIFE-M's geographic coverage by linking vital records for seven additional states, so that the covered
 states represent 28% of the U.S. population in 1940, including 28% of both the Black and White populations.
(2) Enhance LIFE-M by adding non-vital records, including (a) the Social Security Death Index and Numerical
 Identification Files, (b) the 1930 and 1950 Censuses, and (c) World War I draft and World War II enlistment
records.
(3) Enhance LIFE-M's health information by digitizing millions of causes of death for LIFE-M individuals.
(4) Publicly disseminate the new data through Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research
 (ICPSR), along with variable descriptions, documentation, user guides, and trained machine-learning
 models. Data releases will also include variables to integrate LIFE-M with other historical data infrastructure.
Expanding and enhancing the LIFE-M infrastructure will facilitate path-breaking research on the role of early-life
conditions on longevity, aging, causes of death, and life-course transitions for family networks across four
generations. It will also allow research to understand heterogeneity in these relationships across geographic
space and the role of moderating and mediating forces, such as rapid industrialization and urbanization, the
expansion of public health and hospital infrastructure and policy, economic collapse, and war.
 The proposed work addresses a core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA:
expanding and enhancing LIFE-M data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and
consequences of changes in social, demographic, economic, and health characteristics of the older population
and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on
the health, well-being, and functioning of individuals over their life-course."
10907455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing evidence suggests that frailty—a common problem of old age characterized by reduced physiologic
reserve and inability to tolerate acute stressors—may determine inter-individual variability in outcomes after drug
therapy and surgical procedures among older adults. While this understanding supports the idea of personalizing
treatments based on a patient's frailty level, there is little empirical evidence on how to use frailty information to
maximize benefits or avoid harms in older patients. There is a pressing need to understand how frailty affects
the outcomes of various medical and surgical treatments. The candidate is a geriatrician and epidemiologist
who has established a robust patient-oriented research program on frailty, geriatric pharmacoepidemiology, and
prediction of functional outcomes after surgery at Hebrew SeniorLife Marcus Institute for Aging Research. He is
also a dedicated mentor of trainees and junior faculty, who have published a number of peer-reviewed papers
and have successfully competed for training and career development awards in aging research. The candidate's
research program has a long-term objective to improve care of older adults with frailty by generating high-quality
evidence, training future clinicians and researchers, and changing health systems and policy. Toward this goal,
his current NIA-funded research focuses on use of a frailty index for Medicare data to determine who should be
treated with a drug therapy or a surgical procedure and who should not due to lack of benefit or increased
likelihood of harm. This K24 Mid-career Investigator Award proposal will allow the candidate to develop a formal
mentoring program, expand his research, and become a more effective mentor and leader. The specific aims
are to: 1) develop a mentoring program in frailty research for early-stage and new investigators from diverse
clinical and research backgrounds; 2) conduct high-quality research to determine heterogeneity of treatment
effects by frailty for a broad range of medical and surgical interventions; and 3) acquire new research skills in
implementation science and enhance capacity in mentorship and leadership within and outside geriatrics. The
outstanding collaborative environment of Hebrew SeniorLife and other Harvard-affiliated institutions will provide
resources (e.g., various data sources, including Medicare data, computing environment, and career development
training courses) and support (e.g., data scientists and research methodology experts) needed to accomplish
the proposed activities. The advancement of the candidate's mentoring and research program, supported by
this K24 award, will foster growth of well-trained clinician investigators in aging research and accelerate adoption
of personalized medicine for older adults across medical and surgical specialties based on a patient's frailty level."

The Yale Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Training Program requests five years of support for an
innovative, multi-disciplinary and translational training program at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) and
Yale Cancer Center (YCC). Currently, Yale only has one T32 training grant in cancer research, and it focuses
on cancer biology training for basic scientists. Given the long history of successful CPC research and training
by Yale faculty, and a critical need to train outstanding CPC scientists to advance our fight against cancer, we
are excited to re-establish a CPC Training Program at Yale. Our Yale CPC Training Program will leverage
strength from a Pre-Doctoral Program within YSPH, and a Post-Doctoral Program within YCC that draws from
many disciplines but is administratively housed within YSPH. The Yale Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC)
Training Program aims to educate, train and mentor pre- and post-doctoral fellows in five thematic areas
critical to CPC: cancer etiology, cancer outcomes, lifestyle behavioral interventions, implementation science
and community-engaged research. These five areas were selected because they are critical domains in the
spectrum of CPC research, they leverage strengths of our faculty, and they will ensure that T32 trainees with
diverse interests will achieve pivotal growth through the program and become leaders in novel, impactful CPC
research. Fellows will also directly participate and interact with the seven YCC Research Programs and 14
YCC Disease-Aligned Research Teams, which are composed of scientists and clinicians conducting cancer
research and delivering cancer care. Fellows will work with 22 Yale CPC Training Program Primary Faculty
members, who collectively have expertise in our five thematic areas. The Primary Faculty members come from
13 different departments across Yale, and have trained 50 pre-doctoral and 126 post-doctoral fellows over the
last ten years, with a strong majority working in cancer-related careers. The 22 Primary Faculty currently have
more than a combined $25M of research funds. Our training program will include a comprehensive mentoring
program, participation in active CPC research internships/rotations through the five thematic areas, a
structured CPC Fellows Seminar Course, and additional integration with resources from Yale. Our program will
select the most highly qualified and diverse candidates who wish to pursue a career in cancer prevention and
control, and numerous procedures have been put in place to ensure the recruitment, quality mentorship, and
retention of under-represented minority fellows. At the conclusion of their training, it is our goal that individuals
supported by this T32 will have developed the knowledge and skills necessary to function independently, and
that they will develop and carry out innovative, impactful studies filling key gaps in CPC research, potentially
changing the standard of care and impacting policy. Ultimately, public health will benefit through the
preparation of an exceptional cadre of investigators committed to careers in cancer prevention and control."
10907462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although cochlear implantation (CI) is the most effective method for managing severe to profound sensorineural
hearing loss, children with CI as a group perform at about 15th percentile of their normal-hearing peers on
language measures. Most intriguingly, their language outcomes are highly variable at the individual level,
despite implantation at a young age. Using pre-surgical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, done
as part of the routine clinical evaluation, as well as AI-enabled analytical methods, our research will construct
neural predictive models to forecast individual-level language outcomes in English- and Spanish-learning
children up to 4 years after surgery. The clinical utility of these models will also be evaluated by investigating
the extent to which the models' prediction is associated with the degree to which a child responds to a program
of intensive communication treatment. We hypothesize that during the 4 years immediately after surgery,
young children with CI follow three stages of language development: 1) global attention to spoken language as
the child acclimatizes to electric auditory input about language, 2) encoding of phonological patterns with
sufficient information to develop auditory-based lexical representations, and 3) development of spoken
language syntax to communicate orally in longer utterances. We also hypothesize that the integrity of brain
networks associated with higher-order cognitive, auditory and syntactic processing differentially contributes to
language outcomes across these three stages in monolingual English-learning children with CI (Aim 1). We
further hypothesize that these networks are largely invariant for typologically similar languages during the first
stage, but that the contribution of the auditory network would be prolonged and require higher-order cognitive
networks to an even greater extent to language outcomes for Spanish-English bilingual children with CI (Aim 2).
As part of our current R21 project, we have developed a standardized clinical evaluation and follow-up protocol
across different CI centers that will facilitate the investigations required to achieve Aims 1 and 2. Aim 3
concerns the interaction between neural prediction of outcomes and behavioral treatment. The main CI center
of this project will enroll monolingual English-learning children for an intensive, Parent-Implemented
Communication Treatment (PICT) program, which is the only treatment program to date whose effectiveness
has been supported by a randomized controlled trial. We will evaluate whether neural prediction of language
outcomes is inversely related to the degree of language gains from PICT. Specifically, we hypothesize that the
more severe the predicted language impairment based on our neural predictive algorithms, the more the child
could benefit from PICT. Our translational research program will advance the field of communication disorders
in technological, theoretical and clinical innovations. It will be among the first to demonstrate that a predict-to-
prescribe approach to holistically treat hearing loss is feasible, cost-effective and can lead to optimization of
language outcomes of all children with CI."

This is a new application for a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Institutional Research
Training Grant (T32) to train post-doctoral trainees in the field of oncopathology, defined broadly as research
that seeks to improve our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and pathobiology, and in doing so provide the
basis for the development of new approaches that improve cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment.
The overall goal of the Oncopathology Training Program (OTP) is to provide research training opportunities
across the full spectrum of oncopathology research, from basic study of cancer pathogenesis using the tools of
cell and molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, animal modeling, and bioinformatics, to translational
research that involves the development and deployment of biomarker tests and the use of digital and
computational pathology, approaches that are increasingly important in cancer research. The training program
is designed to benefit the research career development of M.D. and M.D./Ph.D. trainees subsequent to their
training in clinical and/or anatomic pathology, and Ph.D. trainees with educational backgrounds in
computational fields interested in the emerging area of computational pathology. Support is requested for 4
postdoctoral trainees in years 1-2, and 5 trainees in years 3-5. The training program includes structured
elements such as individual development plans, mentored research experiences, and customizable didactic
training opportunities as well as workshops in grant writing, manuscript composition, and lab management.
Each trainee will have Postdoctoral Advisory Committee comprised of the Program Director, primary research
mentor, and one or more senior cancer researchers with relevant expertise that will review trainee progress,
provide advice and constructive criticism, and serve as a review committee for external fellowship proposals.
The OTP faculty includes 24 highly accomplished investigators, with extensive mentoring track records and
substantial extramural grant support, who constitute a highly collaborative mentoring community whose
expertise span a wide-range of multidisciplinary, oncopathology-relevant areas, including animal modeling of
cancer, cancer immunology, cancer genomics, computational pathology and tissue imaging, cancer
diagnostics, and translational cancer informatics. The OTP will also take advantage of the extensive
complement of scientific and educational resources that are available at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
(BWH), Harvard Medical School (HMS). and Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), including the NCI-funded
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center."

Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, is
the most consequential policy change for maternal and child health in a generation. At the time of submitting this
grant, abortion had been banned or severely restricted in sixteen states, and efforts to impose additional bans
and restrictions are in process in other states. Existing data limit more detailed analysis of who has abortions
and the potential consequences of Dobbs for maternal and child health. The overarching goal of this exploratory
proposal is to use a unique and powerful data resource to characterize the underreporting of abortion, develop
new methods to improve estimates of abortion incidence, and facilitate more research on the consequences of
Dobbs in national survey data. Our specific aims are to (1) document the individual-level determinants of abortion
underreporting in surveys by comparing abortions measured in medical records to survey responses for the
same individuals using a unique sample of study participants; (2) examine how abortion reporting in surveys
changed after the Dobbs decision; and (3) explore the potential to improve national and subgroup estimates
regarding the incidence of abortion in national surveys using evidence from aims (1) and (2). Achieving these
aims will allow researchers to refine national survey estimates of abortion and understand the broader context
in which these decisions occur. The proposed research will also inform a broader and deeper understanding of
the disproportionate incidence of abortion bans or restrictions in the aftermath of Dobbs. The data underlying
this proposal have already been collected and cleaned, making the proposed research highly cost effective."

10908250,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the most common oral cancer, notoriously recurs, leading to poor survival.
Invasion of cancer cells is essential for recurrence and progression, emphasizing the importance of investigating
mechanisms of invasion in order to improve patient survival. We recently identified a mechanism in which SCC
co-opts adjacent non-cancerous epithelium, referred to as cancer-associated keratinocytes (CAKs), to enhance
lateral invasion, which was associated with recurrence. Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1), a tumor
suppressor, is downregulated in SCC to promote lateral invasion and formation of satellite lesions. In a feedback
loop, SCC-secreted transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) suppresses DMBT1 in CAKs; this causes CAKs to
release cytokines that enhance invasion of tumor cells away from the tumor bulk. The objective of the proposed
study is to understand how TGFβ suppresses DMBT1 in CAKs and why it does so. Interestingly, DMBT1 is also
an anti-microbial protein; preliminary data show that downregulation of DMBT1 in CAKs increases susceptibility
to Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease. There is a strong correlation between
SCC and dysbiosis in the oral microbiome. Multiple studies have shown that P. gingivalis enhances SCC
invasion, but none have examined the ability of P. gingivalis to enhance SCC invasion via CAKs. Normal
keratinocytes infected with P. gingivalis secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. The overall hypothesis is that
SCC-mediated suppression of DMBT1 in CAKs via TGFβ facilitates bacterial entry into CAKs, thereby
enhancing release of cytokines that promote invasion of SCC. To test this hypothesis, we propose two aims:
Aim #1: Characterize the molecular mechanism by which TGFβ suppresses DMBT1 in CAKs; and Aim #2:
Investigate the impact of DMBT1 suppression in CAKs on bacterial entry, release of pro-invasive cytokines, and
SCC invasion. To understand the mechanism of DMBT1 suppression in CAKs, we will use in genetic and
pharmacological approaches in cell lines. To understand the significance of DMBT1 suppression in CAKs on
SCC invasion, we will use high-throughput proteomics to investigate the secretome of CAKs, and genetic and
pharmacologic approaches to establish the role of these cytokines in invasion using in in vitro and in vivo models,
including Dmbt1-/- mice. Overall, this project will investigate the mechanism by which SCC co-opts CAKs to
promote the release of cytokines that enhance tumor invasion; this could provide therapeutic targets to prevent
SCC recurrence and improve survival."
10908596,"Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing
abnormal, often repetitive, movements or postures. DYT1 early-onset generalized dystonia is the most
common type among the genetic dystonias. Most of the individuals affected by DYT1 dystonia share a
trinucleotide deletion (ΔGAG) located in exon 5 of DYT1 or TOR1A gene, leading to a loss of a glutamate
amino acid residue for torsinA (torsinA∆E). The symptoms start from limbs and then become generalized.
Affected individuals could be seriously disabled and need to use a wheelchair. Conditional knockout of torsinA
in mice points to the involvement of multiple brain regions and cell types in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia.
These and other pathophysiological studies of DYT1 and other dystonias so far support a circuit or network
model of dystonia pathogenesis. However, which brain region and neuronal types play a critical role in
pathogenesis is unclear. Alterations of both the striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic systems appear to play a
critical role in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia. Dopaminergic modulation of striatal cholinergic
interneurons (ChIs) is altered in multiple dystonia models that include DYT1 dystonia. Whether torsinA∆E in
striatal ChIs has the cell-autonomous effect on striatal cholinergic dysfunction is not known. Preliminary studies
of conditional knockin (KI) mouse models of DYT1 dystonia revealed dopaminergic and striatal medium spiny
neurons (MSNs), but not ChIs, play a vital role in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. However, how torsinA∆E
in MSNs and dopaminergic neurons lead to dystonia is unknown. These unknowns impede the progress in
developing effective treatment for DYT1 patients, especially gene-based targeted therapy with CRISPR,
antisense oligonucleotides, or small hairpin RNA. The broad, long-term objective of our research is 1) to
determine the functional role of torsinA and the mechanism by which torsinA∆E leads to early-onset dystonia, 2)
to develop novel and effective therapeutic treatment. The specific goal of this application is to generate and
analyze five lines of conditional KI mice to understand the role of the striatal dopaminergic system and MSNs
in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia. We hypothesize that torsinA∆E in dopaminergic neurons and MSNs, but
not ChIs, leads to abnormal firing of these neurons, decreased D1R and D2R in MSNs, altered striatal
dopamine release, impaired corticostriatal LTD, altered direct and indirect pathways, and ultimately sustained
muscle contractions and co-contractions that are characteristic of dystonia. Aim 1 will generate conditional
MSN KI mice restricted to direct pathway, indirect pathway, or both and determine their phenotype. In Aim 2,
we will introduce torsinA∆E specifically in dopaminergic neurons or ChIs and determine their dystonia-related
phenotypes. The successful completion of the proposed research will significantly increase our understanding
of the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia and aid the development of novel targeted treatments for dystonia
patients."

 Myosin Binding Protein-C (MyBP-C) comprises a family of accessory proteins that directly interact with
both thick myosin and thin actin filaments. Three distinct isoforms have been characterized, including the
cardiac (c), slow (s) skeletal and fast (f) skeletal. During the last forty years, numerous studies have focused on
the biology of cMyBP-C primarily due to its high mutational prevalence in heart disease. On the contrary, the
regulation and roles of the skeletal isoforms have been mainly inferred due to the structural similarity they
share with cMyBP-C. Our group has been studying the biology of sMyBP-C aiming to understand its regulation,
roles, and disease association. Our findings are highly novel and intriguing. First, we found that MYBPC1, the
gene that encodes sMyBP-C, is heavily spliced giving rise to multiple variants that can be co-expressed in the
same muscle and myofiber. Second, the presence of alternatively spliced insertions affects the ability of the
NH2 and COOH termini to bind actin and myosin, and regulate the formation of actomyosin crossbridges in
vitro. Third, the NH2-terminus of sMyBP-C undergoes extensive PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation,
which is altered in disease. Fourth, sMyBP-C has both structural and regulatory roles with its structural role in
the organization and maintenance of thick myosin filaments preceding its regulatory role in modulating cross-
bridge cycling. Fifth, four novel, dominant, missense mutations located in the NH2-terminal M-motif of sMyBP-C
co-segregate with of a new myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, facial and body
deformities, and high-frequency irregular tremor. Molecular modeling and biochemical studies indicated that
the four myopathic mutations differentially affect the ability of the NH2-terminus of sMyBP-C to bind myosin,
and the structure and stability of the M-motif. We therefore hypothesize that the four MYBPC1 mutations may
differentially alter the biochemical and biophysical properties of sMyBP-C compromising its structural and
regulatory roles, yet elicit similar myopathic phenotypes. We further propose that mutant sMyBP-C results in
the formation of abnormal and deregulated cross-bridges, which in addition to causing a deficit in force
production underlying muscle weakness, act as the primary pacemaker of the observed tremor. The goal of our
proposal is to comprehensively study the pathogenesis of this novel form of MYBPC1-associated myopathy
using a combination of sophisticated in vitro approaches (Aim 1) and novel preclinical models (Aims 2 & 3).
The proposed studies are highly significant in terms of discovery science as we will mechanistically examine
the etiologies of this myopathy, and impactful in terms of translational/clinical research for accurate disease
diagnosis as well as appropriate and effective treatment design."

The basal ganglia are an intricately interconnected group of subcortical brain regions that are critical for the
motivation, selection, initiation, and execution of actions. Consistent with these roles, basal ganglia dysfunction
is linked to debilitating psychomotor disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, dystonia,
addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette’s syndrome. The importance of the basal ganglia in
health and disease, together with the on-going development and evolution of approaches to probe their roles
and interactions, have motivated diverse research communities focused on these structures. Despite growing
interest in basal ganglia research, before the inaugural Basal Ganglia Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in
2014, the only conference focused on the basal ganglia was the triennial meeting of the International Basal
Ganglia Society (IBAGS), which is usually held outside the USA. Moreover, IBAGS meetings follow a typical
symposium format, which contrasts markedly with the interactive, discussion-oriented format of a GRC. Since
2016, the Basal Ganglia GRC has incorporated a 1.5-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized
exclusively by and for pre- and post-doctoral trainees. Beginning with the 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS,
these are now regular biennial meetings. The programs for the 2024 Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS were designed
by an interdisciplinary committee representing basic and clinical research in the field. A deliberate effort was
made to include new speakers and topics that were not included in the 2022 meeting, with the overarching theme
Basal Ganglia: From Cell Types to Function. Topics include decision making, cellular plasticity in the basal
ganglia, interactions within and beyond basal ganglia circuits, new computational models, and clinically relevant
freezing of gait.
The 2024 Basal Ganglia GRC and GRS have 3 specific aims: 1) move basal ganglia research forward by
featuring cutting-edge research in an interactive environment that encourages questions and discussion,
challenges current thinking, identifies open questions, and provides opportunities new collaborations; 2) model
diversity in basal ganglia research with respect to scientific approach and topics, gender balance, career stage,
and minority representation; and 3) provide opportunities for leadership, education, and mentoring for early
career scientists. Successful completion of these aims will advance basal ganglia research by encouraging new
ideas and collaborations, highlighting diversity in the field, and inspiring the next generation of scientists. This
should accelerate the pace of discovery and translation to the clinic, consistent with the mission of NIH."

Funds are requested to provide partial support for the 68th Annual Conference of Coccidioidomycosis
Study Group (CSG) to be held on April 5-6, 2024, hosted by the University of Texas at San Antonio. The
meeting will be held at the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, Texas. CSG prides itself on bringing an
abundance of coccidioidomycosis researchers together to share the latest research being conducted in
the various laboratories, provide opportunities for collaboration, and promote the development of junior
trainees. Researchers, physicians, veterinarians, other healthcare providers, epidemiologists, and
various trainees (students/residents/fellows/postdocs) from over 30 laboratories have attended annually.
In the past, the meeting sites were rotated among institutions in Arizona and California. For the first time,
the CSG conference will be hosted in Texas, where coccidioidomycosis is also recognized as endemic.
A growing number of medical mycologists has supported this meeting, leading to its longevity and
significance over the past 67 years of the CSG. Although the meeting format has evolved over the years,
the current format has focused on oral and poster presentations by trainees regarding their most exciting
and impactful research data. The small group setting provides a welcoming environment that successfully
promotes discussion and constructive feedback for trainees. The program includes seven scientific
sections with 39 slots for trainees’ oral presentations, a poster section, a keynote speaker, a business
hour, and a banquet. The small group setting in the planned program and attendance by both the PIs
and trainees is excellent for networking and promoting the development of the trainees. Dr. Jennifer
Lodge, a renowned medical mycologist and VPR at Duke University, has accepted our invitation to be
the 2024 keynote speaker. We request 12 travel awards ($500 each) for trainees, presenting in person
and support for live-streaming to encourage more scientists to attend the meeting. The recipients will be
selected on the basis of their application for need of travel support, giving a presentation in the meeting,
and the merit of their research. We will also consider a higher priority for women and minority trainees.
Our specific aims are: 1) To bring Coccidioides researchers and medical mycologists from clinical and
academic institutes together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees
and established researchers to present their recent work and 2) To promote the development of
young/early career scientists in medical mycology, specifically, the coccidioidomycosis field. This meeting
is a mentoring tool to facilitate a career path that will incorporate the study of coccidioidomycosis. With
its focus on coccidioidomycosis, the proposed CSG meeting will synergize with NIAID’s mission by bringing
together researchers investigating coccidioidomycosis and Coccidioides in an ideal setting to promote
cross-disciplinary discussions."

Cells shape and reshape themselves as they accomplish diverse functions in vivo. These cell shape changes
result from physical and chemical feedback loops at multiple scales. At the biochemical scale, spatiotemporally
varying signaling cascades control cytoskeletal polymerization that pushes on the plasma membrane from the
inside, inducing cell morphology change at the scale of micrometers. Cell morphology in turn feedbacks to alter
intracellular signaling, via mechanisms such as surface curvature-sensing proteins in the plasma membrane.
Understanding these feedbacks across scales is particularly critical since they are a target for pharmaceutical
intervention. Scientists have developed a wealth of techniques for interrogating the biochemical and genetic
basis of cell function. However, disentangling the many feedback loops coupling cell morphology, intracellular
organization, and spatiotemporally varying biochemical pathways, such as intracellular signaling, remains ex-
perimentally challenging. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy can visualize these feedbacks in action, but imaging
across scales produces enormous and detailed datasets that are impossible to make sense of without dedicated
computational pipelines. We will develop algorithms for cell biology rooted in computational geometry. Using
computational geometry approaches will allow us to draw from decades of math and computer science research
to work in biologically relevant geometries, increasing accuracy and easing interpretation. We propose to develop
essential algorithms to reconstruct plasma membrane organization from 3D microscopy images and track its
movements across time. We will also measure the organizational rules that couple plasma membrane shape
and dynamics to spatiotemporally varying biochemical pathways on the cell surface. Finally, we will focus on
understanding feedbacks related to intracellular organization throughout the cell, not just on the plasma mem-
brane, by broadening the computational approaches we developed for the plasma membrane to other geome-
tries. The computational methods that we are proposing to develop will aid in further opening up to scientific
investigation the many feedback loops and physical interactions of the meso-scale world of subcellular organi-
zation."
10929515,"Project Summary. Black Americans in the US fare worse across nearly every health indicator compared to 
White individuals. In Philadelphia, the location of this study, these health disparities culminate in a stark 
longevity gap, with average life expectancies in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods being 20 years lower 
than in nearby affluent, predominantly White neighborhoods. The fundamental cause of these racial health 
disparities is structural racism, which operates via interconnected, mutually reinforcing social and economic 
pathways. Notably, long-standing, systematic disinvestment has resulted in highly segregated Black 
neighborhoods with dilapidated environmental conditions and severe economic insecurity within Black 
households, leading to a “feedback loop of concentrated racial disadvantage,” which is strongly tied to poor 
health. To date, most interventions have focused on individual-level behaviors or single social determinants of 
health. However, by failing to address the multiple mechanisms that generate persistent health disadvantages 
for Black Americans, existing interventions have had limited impact. We propose to develop and test a 
radically different approach in which we intervene on multiple upstream drivers of health in unison to 
more substantially and durably improve health among Black Americans. This new approach is motivated 
by the insight that overcoming centuries of structural racism will require significant concentrated investment in 
the structures that have left Black people and their neighborhoods in peril. Specifically, we will conduct a 
cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a suite of place-based and financial-wellbeing interventions at the 
community, organization, and individual/household levels that address the social determinants of racial health 
disparities. At the community level, we address underinvestment in Black neighborhoods by implementing 
vacant lot greening, abandoned house remediation, tree planting, and trash cleanup. At the organization 
level, we partner with community-based financial empowerment providers to develop cross-organizational 
infrastructure to increase reach and maximize efficiency. At the individual/household levels, we increase 
access to public benefits, financial counseling and tax preparation services, and emergency cash assistance. 
We will test this “big push” intervention in 60 Black neighborhoods, with a total of 720 adults. We hypothesize 
that this “big push” intervention will have significant impact on overall health and wellbeing, blood pressure, 
psychosocial distress, food insecurity, social connectedness, and violence. This proposal is innovative 
because when implemented simultaneously in targeted geographic areas, the suite of interventions 
will address the multiple mechanisms by which structural racism harms Black health. The positive 
health impacts will be multiplied and longer-lasting what would be achieved by implementing any individual 
component. The results of the proposed research are expected to have significant public health impact as it will 
provide timely and scalable evidence of new strategies to more effectively reduce racial disparities in health."

Cells are in a constant battle to maintain homeostasis and respond to stress. Autophagy is a conserved
eukaryotic pathway that responds to cellular stresses. Autophagy identifies and encapsulates cellular debris
in an autophagosome, which is ultimately fused with the lysosome for degradation. Studies have shown that
the final step of autophagy, termed autolysosomal fusion, requires several factors. This includes membrane
effector proteins, Rabs and Atg8 homologs, multifunctional scaffolding proteins and specialized lipid
headgroups (e.g. PI3P). The assembly of proteins ‘hubs’ often promote cellular processes and are required
for function. The Homotypic fusion and vacuole Protein Sorting (HOPS) complex, Ectopic P-Granules 5
Autophagy Tethering Factor (EPG-5), and Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family M member 1
(PLEKHM1) are scaffolding proteins present at the final steps of autophagy. Mutations in these multifunctional
scaffolds lead to poor cellular health and have been implicated in several human diseases, specifically defects
in these proteins lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the importance of the final stages of autophagy,
we currently lack fundamental information on how these interaction hubs tether and organize sites of
autolysosomal fusion.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to resolve the protein interaction network that drive autolysosomal
tethering. We are initiating both in vitro and in vivo techniques to discovery the molecular interactions that
drive autolysosomal tethering. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis will serve as our main tool to
determine how the human HOPS complex engages with autophagy adaptor PLEKHM1 at the membrane
surface. These studies have the potential to reveal the molecular interactions which drive the formation of the
autolysosomal interface and generate specificity within the autophagy pathway. In tandem, we will utilize cryo-
focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling along with in situ cryo-electron tomography methods to examine
autolysosomal tethering in the native cellular environment. To accomplish this, we will focus on EPG-5, a
scaffold that binds to both lysosome and autophagosome directly (via protein-protein interactions with Rab7
and Atg8 homologs, respectively). EPG-5 is an ideal target for in situ studies given its large size (300 kDa)
and distinct shape. By using cell biological techniques, we will enrich autolysosomal tethering events and
perform cryo-FIB milling. These innovative approaches have the potential to discover the cellular context of
autolysosomal fusion at resolutions (<20Å) not possible by traditional techniques. Taken together, our work
will provide to a deeper understanding at both an atomic level and contextual level. Long term, we hope our
data contributes to novel therapeutic approaches to treat membrane tethering defects to improve human
health. Moreover, the principles we discover could lay a foundation for understanding organelle tethering
events throughout eukaryotic biology."

 Though the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin regulates all DNA-dependent processes,
determining chromatin mechanisms and functions in cells is challenging. One well-described 3D chromatin
structure is the topologically associated domain (TAD). TADs are chromatin loop domains created by cohesin
through a process called loop extrusion. TADs are strongly implicated in transcriptional regulation and have
recently been linked to DNA replication and repair. However, significant questions about the underlying
mechanisms of TADs remain, and even less is known about the mechanisms and functions of loop domains
created by other extruding complexes such as condensin. At the local scale, the pattern of interactions
between nucleosomes on the DNA strand determines the 3D arrangement of the chromatin fiber. Chromatin
fiber compaction is hypothesized to be a major form of gene regulation, however, obtaining sufficient resolution
to determine fiber structure in cells has been a major barrier. As a result, little is known about chromatin fiber
function in cells. To address these gaps, the Swygert lab uses high-resolution genomics, microscopy, and
biochemistry in a quiescent budding yeast model. Quiescence is a reversible state in which the cell exits the
cell cycle, and is essential for stem cell maintenance and implicated in cancer recurrence. As the hallmarks of
quiescent cells are global transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation, they are an excellent model
for uncovering the functions of chromatin structural dynamics. In quiescent yeast, condensin binds coding gene
promoters throughout the genome, forming chromatin loop domains that resemble TADs. At the same time,
histone deacetylation drives the compaction of chromatin fibers. Disruption of either structure leads to the mis-
activation of up to 40% of all genes. Over the next five years, the Swygert lab will expand current projects
examining 3D chromatin structural mechanisms in quiescent cells. A strength of the lab is the ability to resolve
and perturb functional chromatin fiber structure genome-wide. They will use genomics and single-molecule
biophysics to uncover how condensin relocates during quiescence entry and how chromatin obstacles such as
fiber compaction affect loop extrusion. They will also determine the essential roles of HMG proteins that bend
DNA at sharp angles during quiescence entry. Finally, they will examine how quiescent chromatin structure,
which takes a week to assemble during quiescence entry, is disassembled within minutes during quiescence
exit. These studies will form the foundation of a unique and independent research program in which
complementary genomics and biochemical methods are used in the context of yeast quiescence to uncover 3D
chromatin structure and function and all scales. As the mechanisms underlying chromatin condensation in
quiescent yeast are conserved in quiescent human cells, their results will inform both basic chromatin
mechanisms and quiescence-specific mechanisms relevant to human health."

therapeutic approaches in multi-institutional clinical trials to improve the outcomes of blood and bone marrow
transplantation and other cellular therapies for patients facing life-threatening blood disorders.” Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is an NCl-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center with one of the largest
BMT programs in the country. The BMT program at MSK, founded in 1973 and divided into pediatric and adult
services, is a FACT-accredited program for both hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and immune effector cell
(IEC) therapy. MSK has been a Core Clinical Center (CCC) of the BMT CTN since its inception. Dr. Perales
(Service Chief, Adult BMT; PI, MSK BMT CTN), Dr. Giralt (Deputy Head, Division of Hematologic Oncology; Co-
I), Dr. Boelens (Service Chief, Pediatric BMT and Cell Therapy; Co-I), and all members of the Adult and Pediatric
BMT and Cellular Therapy Services consider participation in the BMT CTN an integral part of their mission. In
this proposal, we detail our ongoing commitment to the success of the Network through an oversight structure
that includes a BMT CTN MSK Executive Committee, a BMT CTN Protocol Management Team, and a BMT CTN
Internal Advisory Board, which leverage senior leadership of the Division of Hematologic Oncology and Pediatric
BMT Service as well as outstanding scientists and investigators at MSK. As part of our continued commitment
to Network leadership, we propose a multicenter phase II clinical trial in adults and children with severe sickle
cell disease (SCD), in which we will evaluate a pharmacologic immunosuppressive strategy prior to reduced
toxicity myeloablative mismatched unrelated (MMUD) HCT, using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY)-
based graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. The trial will employ a novel platform to mitigate the risk of
graft failure in a patient population at high risk for allograft rejection and treatment-related complications, as well
as pharmacokinetic-based models to guide individualized dosing of fludarabine, busulfan, and rabbit ATG for
optimal drug exposure. We propose 3 specific aims: (1) Demonstrate MSK has the clinical and translational
expertise, novel cell and gene therapy capabilities, and early- and late-phase trial experience to fulfill the
obligations of a BMT CTN CCC and advance the Network’s mission and goals; (2) Complete a phase II study in
which patients with severe SCD will receive an HCT from an MMUD donor with PTCY-based GvHD prophylaxis
(the primary endpoint will be to estimate primary graft failure at 1-year post-HCT); and (3) Describe how MSK’s
operational and scientific approaches to conducting HCT trials will support the mission and activities of the BMT
CTN. The proposed study is highly relevant to the BMT CTN, as it addresses an unmet need for a well-tolerated
alternative donor platform with stable engraftment in patients with SCD, and is in line with the goal of the BMT
CTN to prioritize clinical studies that advance HCT approaches for non-malignant blood diseases."

The primary focus of research in my laboratory centers on unraveling the causal relationship
between common genetic variants in humans and susceptibility to complex diseases. We aim to
understand how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), often residing in the non-coding portion
of the genome, influence cellular physiology, the determination of cell fate, and the alterations in
cell state. We employ a unique human-specific genetic framework, utilizing induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) and genome editing techniques to investigate non-coding regions of the
genome whose functions are not yet defined. SNPs frequently exhibit correlations with
neighboring variants, forming clusters known as haplotypes through a phenomenon called linkage
disequilibrium. Haplotypes are shared within the same ancestral group and exhibit significant
variations across different genetic ancestries. This genomic diversity translates into varying
degrees of correlation between genetic variants and the risk of developing complex diseases
across diverse ancestries. While this genomic diversity is deeply rooted in human evolutionary
history, our understanding of its functional implications at the cellular level remains incomplete.
The elucidation of haplotypes function and the effect of their diversity are crucial to uncover
unexplored biological processes impacted by the non-coding genome and for enhancing the
accuracy of predicting complex disease risk within different populations. In this proposal, we
outline a research strategy to investigate human-specific haplotype diversity and its cellular
consequences across diverse cell types. Our overarching goal is to determine the physiological
significance of haplotype diversity in cell fate determination and the maintenance of cell states,
shedding light on haplotype functionality and its role in disease susceptibility. By examining the
impact of ancestrally diverse haplotypes at the cellular level, this proposal aims to identify critical
factors contributing to ethnicity-based disease risk and cell-type-specific vulnerabilities. We will
employ human iPSCs obtained from diverse ancestral backgrounds, induce differentiation into
various cell types, perform haplotype editing, and utilize a wide range of assays to evaluate how
diversity at specific genomic loci influences cell fate determination and the maintenance of cell
states in response to various stimuli. The tools we develop will serve as a versatile platform for
investigating non-coding genetic risk factors in various complex diseases, expediting the
translation of functional genomics findings into advancements in human health."
10940030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clinical recommendations for the management of diseases are mostly based on the average treatment effects
observed in randomized controlled trials. However, the beneficial effects of most treatments vary across
individuals. Identifying the factors contributing to treatment response heterogeneity is crucial for improving
mechanistic understanding of treatment-disease interactions and optimizing patient outcomes. Recent
advances in high-throughput technologies in biology and the development of large-scale databases provide an
unprecedented opportunity for a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying inter-individual
variations in treatment responses. Several methods, including subgroup analyses and summary score-based
analyses, have been used to assess treatment response heterogeneity. To handle the high dimensionality of
covariates, machine learning methods have also been developed to assess treatment heterogeneity. However,
despite tremendous advancements in machine learning, two key limitations have hindered a large-scale
deployment of the current methods to discover markers underpinning treatment heterogeneity from big data.
First, the current approaches can fail to uncover strong but unexpected predictors of treatment response
heterogeneity. A key problem is that counterfactual treatment responses for an individual under two possible
strategies cannot be directly identified. To make progress, a common approach is to compare the average
observed treatment responses across subgroups of individuals, defined either based on one or multiple clinical
variables. Nonetheless, such approaches can fail to uncover true signatures for treatment heterogeneity.
Second, the current methods for predicting treatment heterogeneity often result in models with limited
generalizability. A key reason is that participants in the source population data (on which models are
developed) are not a random sample from the target population (on which models will be deployed). When the
source population data are not representative of the target population and treatment responses vary across
factors that influence participation, algorithms that can tailor the model for use in the new target population will
require cutting-edge tools in data science. To address these challenges, we propose novel causal machine
learning methods that will enable the identification of markers (and their complex relationships) for individual
treatment responses, with algorithms adaptable to a new target population. This project will combine
theoretical developments with large-scale simulation studies and empirical evaluations on treatment for
patients with stable coronary artery diseases. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip
investigators with powerful methods to unlock the full potential of big data, advance our understanding of
mechanisms for treatment response heterogeneity, and ultimately improve strategies for preventing and
managing a wide range of health conditions and diseases."
10940054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is the only curative therapy for many diseases, but low HSC
numbers and their tendency to differentiate in vitro are limiting factors for the more widespread application of this
life-saving therapy. Knowing how HSCs decide between self-renewal and differentiation is critical to develop
efficient culture systems that manipulate HSC fate decisions to either expand or differentiate HSCs into specific
mature blood cells for transplantation. However, HSC decision-making processes are incompletely understood
and our ability to expand HSCs is limited. HSC self-renewal and differentiation are regulated by the symmetric
and asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants (CFD) during division. After asymmetric segregation of
CFDs, only one daughter retains HSC properties, while symmetric segregation of CFDs can create two HSCs.
An exciting prediction of this model is, that factors promoting symmetric segregation of CFD during division
expand HSCs. However, identifying these factors has been hampered because of major technical challenges
including: 1) HSCs are rare and divide infrequently, making transient events like divisions hard to capture in fixed
samples, and 2) cell fate acquisition after HSC division takes many days. Understanding how the segregation of
CFD influences cell fate acquisition thus requires precise quantifications of living HSCs over many days with
single-cell resolution. To address this challenge, we developed novel long-term live-cell imaging tools, that allow
us to track and quantify single HSC behaviors and marker expression over several weeks and cell generations.
This allowed us to visualize for the first time that lysosomes are asymmetrically segregated during HSC divisions
and act as CFD to instruct later changes in metabolism and differentiation in HSC daughter cells. Here, we
propose to leverage this novel technology to identify factors regulating lysosome segregation and to investigate
how RhoGTPases, which are known polarity proteins in invertebrates, regulate lysosome segregation, and HSC
self-renewal and differentiation. Studies of non-dividing cells showed that Tubulin, Actin and Vimentin filaments
of the cytoskeleton regulate lysosome motility. However, which of these filaments regulates lysosome motility
during HSC division remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we will study lysosomal motility and
segregation in dividing HSCs using our live-cell imaging tools. We will assess the polarization and colocalization
of lysosomes with Tubulin, Actin and Vimentin filaments and functionally interrogate how pharmacological and
genetic manipulation of known cytoskeletal transport mechanisms and polarity regulators, such as CDC42, affect
lysosomal segregation and daughter cell fate acquisition. Our preliminary data, show that lysosome segregation
is regulated via ARP2/3-mediated actin nucleation, which lies downstream of the Integrin/Focal Adhesion Kinase
(FAK). We also provide evidence that the RhoGTPases CDC42 and RAC have opposing roles and act as
negative and positive regulators of asymmetric lysosome segregation, respectively. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that HSCs regulate lysosome segregation through the Integrin-FAK-ARP2/3 pathway."

 My laboratory combines mechanistic cell biology with synthetic biology, focusing on understanding
cellular behaviors like recognition and communication. We aim to advance the applications of engineered
multicellular systems, particularly in engineered T cells targeting solid tumors. Our research has a foundation on
two main questions.
 1) How can we engineer highly specific cellular recognition? We seek to understand the limits and
synergies of strategies for enhancing cellular specificity. Through a comparative analysis of synthetic circuits,
we will explore mechanisms such multi-step signaling, and molecular titration to optimize T cell discrimination of
tumors from bystander tissue based on antigen density. We also aim to uncover general principles for
engineering gene expression systems and its relationship with genome organization. This may lead to general
rules to engineer robust circuit behavior that could help in therapeutics.
 2) how does multicellular organization affect cellular recognition? In addressing the complexity and
heterogeneity of tumors, we aim for a quantitative understanding of how tissue architecture impacts T cell activity.
Using an engineered spheroid platform, our research will focus into how variation in antigen density in solid
tumors influence the antigen density sensing T cell activity. We anticipate extending this research to include
factors like tumor inhibitory signals, inter T cell communication and the role of chemokine secretion, on T cell
trafficking and tumor infiltration. The fundamental idea in this project is to control the composition and spatial
organization of a spheroid and to study how these properties affect the activity of engineered T cells.
In summary, our group will apply principles of molecular recognition and novel methods in cell and tissue
engineering to understand and control cellular behavior. By systematically deconstructing the problem of how T
cells recognize tumors from bystander tissue based on antigen density and studying the influence of tumor
organization to the immune response, we aim to layout fundamental rules to engineering recognition at the
cellular level and improve therapeutic cells."
10940639,"Healthy adolescent brain maturation involves several highly coordinated processes including extensive and
dynamic reorganization of structural and functional networks and neuropil contraction. However, excessive
neuropil contraction, and impaired network reorganization may result in dysconnectivity in structural, diffusion,
and functional networks that may explain why more than 50% of psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence.
This is particularly notable in first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (familial
high risk for schizophrenia (FHR)) possibly due to additional familial risk. Prior studies on adolescents have
examined gray matter (GM) metrics (e.g., volumes) to index neuropil changes and have studied one modality of
network, e.g., structural, or functional to elucidate network pathology. However, GM metrics do not specifically
index neuropil (cortical regions rich in synapses, dendrites, axonal endings, interneurons, glia, and unmyelinated
axons with few cell bodies). Similarly, examining individual network modality (monoplex network) does not reflect
concomitant changes in other network modalities. Therefore, we propose to examine neuropil growth/contraction
using 3D whole-brain phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). To elucidate alterations in
multiple modalities of networks, we will use a novel multiplex network analysis that provides composite metrics
of dysconnectivity in multiple network layers that may be closer to the ‘ground-truth’ of network pathology since
networks in the brain tissue are essentially multiplex in nature. Our goal is to longitudinally examine neuropil
growth/contraction and multiplex network dysconnectivity in relation to categorical (axis I disorders) and
dimensional (severity of cognitive/social deficits, and psychopathology) outcomes using an accelerated cohort
design on 210 subjects between the ages encompassing onset of puberty and 18 years equally distributed for
the FHR status. Our proposal is strongly supported by convergent preliminary data that show greater psychiatric
morbidity, GM loss in the fronto-temporal network (FTN) regions and altered structural, diffusion, and functional
networks among adolescent FHR persons, and impairments in selected multiplex network metrics suggesting
multiplex network dysconnectivity. We will use ultra-high field neuroimaging at 7 Tesla to obtain high resolution
MP2RAGE, 3D whole-brain 31P MRS with superior spectral resolution, diffusion weighted imaging with Neurite
Orientation Dispersion Density Imaging (NODDI) modeling, and resting fMRI, and collect psychopathological,
cognitive, and social function data at baseline, 1, and 2-years to characterize longitudinal trajectory of neuropil

dimensional outcomes. We will build an integrated model of multiplex network features and neuropil growth/
contraction to predict categorical and dimensional outcomes to improve predictive accuracy of categorical and
dimensional outcomes (aim 3). We will recapitulate our results on ABCD data with available phenotypes. Thus,

10940204,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The SE-BMT Consortium, formerly the UF Consortium, has expanded its network to include the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This extended collaboration among Emory's Winship Cancer Institute (Emory),
UAB, and the University of Florida (UF) will develop and activate phase 2 and 3 clinical trials utilizing
hematopoietic stem cell and novel adoptive cell-based therapies via the BMT CTN. Benefitting from historical
collaboration and interlinked geographic regions, the institutions have emphasized enhancing accessibility for
rural and under-represented minority (URM) patients. The SE-BMTC institutions have accrued 685 subjects onto
BMT CTN studies with robust capabilities for subject enrollment, biospecimen collection, data capture, and data
quality control. The SE-BMT Consortium has integrated UAB and UF pediatrics and plans to increase recruitment
from Emory pediatrics. To continue BMT CTN participation, the SE-BMTC will pursue three aims:
 1. Design and develop innovative clinical trials through the BMT CTN steering committee, employing stem
 cell and cell-based therapies to address the medical needs of patients with cancer, hemoglobinopathies,
 and marrow failure states.
 2. Efficiently recruit a diverse patient cohort in the southeast U.S. for enrollment to BMT CTN clinical trials
 and contribute samples and data to the BMT CTN biorepository for correlative studies and future research.
 3. Foster career growth for a diverse group of cell therapy and stem cell transplant physicians, furthering
 careers of Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and promoting community outreach and engagement across the
Southeast.
To realize these objectives, experienced transplant/cell therapy physicians from each consortium location will
work together to streamline and harmonize local clinical research into the BMT CTN. The SE-BMT Consortium
leverages each center's strengths: Emory will spearhead URM and rural patient recruitment due to its large rural
patient base and clinical setup. UF will offer its proficiency in transplant and cellular immunotherapy research,
contributing to preclinical development and translational studies. UAB will contribute its track record of expertise
in clinical trial design and enrolling under-represented minority patients. Every team encompasses members
from benign hematology and pediatric transplant programs, facilitating outreach and clinical trial enrollment into
these populations. Regular communication, including teleconferences among lead investigators and staff,
bolstered by annual consortium gatherings, will facilitate joint initiatives and decision-making. The Emory, UF,
and UAB research teams within the SE-BMT Consortium are committed to the BMT CTN's objectives, ensuring
continuing advancements in determining the best approaches for hematopoietic stem cell and effector cell
therapies for patients."
10940882,"Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop diabetes at an earlier age and at a much higher rate than able
bodied individuals (AB). Those with SCI and T2D are at much higher risk of developing cardiovascular
complications. In addition to severe insulin resistance due to muscle atrophy and enhanced adiposity after SCI,
affected patients have impaired prandial insulin secretion along with autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
Yet, the optimal strategies to prevent or treat diabetes and obesity and related complications after SCI remains
unknown. Numerous therapeutic options based on glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism
(agonists and co-agonists) are approved or in the pipeline for treatment of diabetes and obesity in AB patients
based on our understanding about their effectiveness and tolerability in this population. Among them,
semaglutide (SGT), which is the most potent GLP-1R agonist (GLP-1RA) in glycemic improvement and weight
loss, has shown to reduce cardiovascular death by ~25% in AB population. Our preliminary data demonstrate
that patients with SCI are treated with GLP-1RA at a 10-times lower rate than AB population. The cause for
this health disparity in diabetes management is unknown but could be partly due to the lack of insights into
anti-diabetic effectiveness and safety of GLP-1RAs in this high-risk population.
Our central hypothesis is that administration of semaglutide (SGT) in SCI population with T2D improves
glycemic tolerance and β-cell function (Aim1) and improves insulin sensitivity along with reduced fat mass but
preserved lean mass along with weight loss (Aim2). In Aim1, glucose tolerance, glucose fluxes, and β-cell
function during a meal tolerance test (MTT) combined with tracer infusion before and after 24 weeks of SGT
vs. placebo will be measured. In Aim 2, we will measure hepatic, muscle, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity
using a 2-step (90 min/step) euglycemic insulin (15 and 80 mU/m2/min) clamp combined with tracer infusion
before and after 24 weeks of SGT vs. placebo. We will also explore potential changes in total fat/lean mass,
liver fat and fibrosis. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study.
This is a phase 4, single center, double-blind randomized, and placebo-controlled study. We will use approved
formulary medications according to their package inserts. All studies will be conducted at the Bartter Clinical
Research Unit, STVHCS (Director, Salehi, PI) or Texas Diabetes Institute, UHS (Director, DeFronzo, Co-I).
The SCI subjects (N=37; 18-70 yr of age, >1-year post-SCI, BMI > 22 kg/m2) with T2D treated with metformin
will be enrolled and randomized after completion of baseline studies. The established SCI cohort of patients
from STVHCS (N ~450) and UTHSA (N ~ 200) are available to be enrolled in the present study.
Gaining insight on the safety profile and mitigatory effect of GLP-1R activation on pathogenic factors that are
involved with glucose abnormalities after SCI, can facilitate the development and utilization of GLP-1R agonists
and co-agonists for treatment of diabetes and obesity in this population, improving health equity."
10911185,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a neuroinflammatory disease that is a
leading cause of blindness in the elderly. While the involvement of photoreceptors in AMD has
been well established, our research will study the less understood role that inflammation plays in
the development of AMD. Our proposal will address this knowledge gap and yield a detailed
understanding of inflammation-associated AMD pathogenesis in humans, in addition to the
identification of potential therapeutic targets and treatments for AMD. Our access to human tissue
with advanced neovascular AMD from the Yale Rapid Autopsy Service and single-cell RNA
sequencing expertise will allow us to perform studies that profile the transcriptome in activated
innate immune cells. Our preliminary data indicate that the critical inflammatory pathways reside
in microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages. Our overarching hypothesis is that functional
changes in the innate system influence neovascularization in AMD, and these changes may be
targeted to halt disease progression. To explore this hypothesis, we propose the following two
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform highly parallel single-nucleus transcriptional profiling with
a novel enrichment technique for glia from human eyes with exudative AMD. The primary goal is
to define and interrogate the molecular signature of microglia and macrophages. Our preliminary
data revealed activated microglia in AMD with secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine
interleukin-1b. We hypothesize that there is as upregulation of inflammatory molecules, which is
associated with choroidal neovascularization in AMD. In Aim 2, we will target the pro-
inflammatory cytokines that regulate activation of reactive Müller glia in AMD to identify targetable
pathways to reverse the chronic inflammation in disease. Based on preliminary data, our targets
will include the IL-1b, IL-10, and IL-17 pathways as well as additional ones identified in Aim 1. We
hypothesize that inflammatory molecules are critical for the transformation of homeostatic Müller
glia to a reactive, pro-angiogenic state in AMD. The proposed research plan will provide
unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms of AMD progression and has significant
potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug discovery. We anticipate that our work will
lead to the development of the first effective therapeutic approaches targeting inflammation,
thereby improving the quality of life for individuals suffering from neovascular AMD."
10911186,"Abstract
Over the last decade, genomic studies have revealed the landscape of mutations that appear in Acute Myeloid
Leukemias (AML). In each case, one of these mutations represents the initiating even for that tumor. Initiating
mutations can create a fitness advantage when they occur in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC),
resulting in clonal hematopoeisis, a state that increases the likelihood of leukemic transformation. Although we
have characterized some consequences of these initiating mutations, including transcriptional changes and
focal hypomethylation phenotypes for the DNMT3A mutations, our understanding of how these changes
promote AML is largely incomplete. Since these initiating events occur in every cell of the tumor, unlike later-
acquired subclonal events, they also are attractive targets for therapy. Thus, the first goal of this research
program is to define the molecular mechanisms by which initiating mutations cause AML, and to use
this information to develop novel, molecularly-targeted therapies. My role will be to distill large genomic
and epigenomic datasets into intuitive, comprehensible models, generating testable hypotheses about the
process of cellular transformation into AML. Doing so will require creative algorithmic development and
statistical modeling, areas of bioinformatics in which I am proficient. This knowledge can then guide us in
prioritizing targets and approaches for novel therapeutics.
A second theme of our research program is to identify the reasons for progression of AMLs with ""missing""
mutations. Most initiating mutations are insufficient to produce overt AML on their own, but about 5% of AML
cases appear to have no clear cooperating mutations. We will therefore use new technologies and
analytical approaches to search the ""dark matter"" of the genome for AML-relevant genomic and
epigenomic changes, using long-read sequencing to query previously unresolvable portions of the genome,
whole genome sequencing to explore non-coding regions and structural variation, and algorithmic development
to reveal difficult to ascertain events in AML.
Because of my interdisciplinary background, I have expertise in designing algorithms and statistical models, as
well as a deep understanding of the biology of AML. My training, experience, and record of productive and
impactful research make me uniquely suited to push the informatics and analysis aspects of this research
program forward."
10911188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is associated with increased risk of at least 13 cancers. Of all cancers attributable to excess adiposity,
colorectum and liver account for 55% of cancer among men and 48% among women, excluding reproductive
cancers. Although most epidemiologic studies of obesity as a cancer risk factor evaluated body mass index
(BMI), accumulating evidence for colorectal and liver cancers implicates viscerally located adiposity (and its
closely related glycemic metabolic dysregulation) as the likely direct causal component. How visceral adiposity
mechanistically predisposes its proximal organs to cancer is largely unknown. Inflammation undoubtedly plays
a role in development and progression of malignancies, including colorectal and liver cancers; however, the
large body of evidence for general inflammation processes and systemic markers like C-reactive protein (CRP)
in relation to digestive cancers are underwhelming, possibly because most are non-specific to high-risk
metabolically unhealthy obesity per se. Thus, distilling the inflammatory pathways and markers to identify those
most reflective of the metabolically unhealthy obese state has immense potential to uncover key mechanisms
and inform powerful broad-spectrum strategies for prevention. Techniques to obtain precise measures to
characterize metabolically unhealthy obesity are often prohibitively costly and logistically infeasible in the
context of large population-based studies. Therefore, we propose an innovative approach to address these
gaps by (i) deriving novel proteomic-based inflammation signatures of metabolically unhealthy obesity
(“Inflammotypes”) in cohorts with visceral adipose tissue quantified via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) and traits of glycemic metabolic function; then (ii) prospectively investigating these novel Inflammotypes
in longitudinal cohorts with stored blood samples in relation to incident colorectal and liver cancer risk. We will
characterize Inflammotypes via state-of-the-art Olink proteomic panel (384 inflammation-related proteins) to
describe metabolically unhealthy obesity (i.e., higher visceral adiposity, with homeostatic model assessment
for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], or lipoprotein insulin resistance score [LPIR]).
Machine learning analyses to identify the Inflammotypes will be replicated in an external cohort. We will then
investigate the relationship between proteomic Inflammotypes with long-term risk of incident colorectal (1000
cases/1000 controls) and liver cancer (500 cases/500 controls), combining longitudinal cohorts with stored
baseline bloods and long-term follow-up (median ranges 6.1-16.7 years). Based on compelling preliminary
data, we hypothesize the combination of greater visceral adipose tissue and glycemic metabolic dysregulation
are associated with abnormal profiles of circulating proteins, and that these novel Inflammotypes are
independently predictive of long-term colorectal and liver cancer risks. These aims are closely aligned with the
goals of the Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Program, including enhancing identification of high-risk
individuals, risk prediction, and elucidation of potential preventive and therapeutic targets."

10911892,"Project I. Systems Analysis of Tumor-Stroma Interactions in Brain Metastasis
Experimental Lead: Massagué
Computational Lead: Pe’er
PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to apply systems-level computational approaches to mouse models and clinical
samples to unravel strategies that metastatic cancer cells employ to colonize the brain. Brain metastasis is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in breast and lung cancer patients. The Massagué Lab pioneered studies
to identify mediators of brain metastasis and relevant cell-cell interactions, and are subjecting this problem to
systems-level analysis with the Pe’er Lab. We recently found that brain metastatic lesions of triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), HER2+ breast cancer (HER2BC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in mouse models
and patient samples display remarkable differences in the spatial relationship between cancer cells and the host
tissue. TNBC and LUAD cells spread along brain capillaries via L1CAM, forming perivascular colony networks
that intermingle with microglia and astrocytes. In sharp contrast, HER2BC cells colonize the brain by forming
compact spheroidal colonies that exclude brain parenchymal cells. High expression of specific extracellular
matrix proteins by HER2BC cells drives this spheroidal growth. Notably, the perivascular and spheroidal colonies
trigger distinct disease-associated microglia (DAM) innate immunity stages previously defined in Alzheimer’s
disease. Aim 1 is to elucidate the DAM regulatory mechanisms in metastasis-associated microglia. We
will resolve transcriptional regulation of the homeostasis-to-DAM transition in brain metastasis by analyzing
single-cell multiomic profiles of metastasis-associated microglia. We will dissect how cancer cells trigger and
modulate DAM responses by testing the hypothesis that HER2BC apoptosis triggers stage 2 DAM, whereas
enhanced survival of TNBC retains stage 1 DAM. We will identify drivers of TNBC-intrinsic resistance to
apoptosis by computationally guided search for autocrine pro-survival signaling in TNBC cells. We will determine
how stage 1 DAM supports tumor growth. We will seek to connect metastasis-associated microglia to activated
microglia states across contexts by supervised gene set analysis. Aim 2 is to define spatiotemporal
progression and multicellular communication in brain metastasis by a systems-level analysis. We and
others have shown the engagement of multiple cell types besides microglia to support brain metastasis. These
interactions call for a comprehensive interrogation of the various ensembles of multicellular communication that
shape brain metastasis. We will leverage our LUAD-to-brain metastasis models to study “what” cell types and
programs constitute multicellular communication ensembles. We will analyze intact metastatic colonies to learn
“where” the cells are localized and which programs are differentially expressed. We will unravel “how” the cells
and programs shape metastasis by computationally inferring the formation and impact of multicellular ensembles
from snapshots of metastatic colonies. We will perturb the inferred ensembles to test therapeutic intervention
paradigms. The resulting knowledge, enriched with the input of the CSBC Research Center immunologists and
physicians, will ultimately guide the development of therapeutic interventions to target brain metastases.

metastases
Experimental Lead: Rudensky
Computational Lead: Leslie
Experimental Co-Lead: Ganesh
PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most common cancer in the US and worldwide. Despite major
advances in treatment of some cancer afforded by immunotherapy, mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) CRC,
which accounts for the vast majority (85%) of cases, fails to respond with ~15% 5-year survival rate. We
hypothesize that this failure is due to the activity of CRC-promoting local circuits of immune and stromal
accessory cells, in which suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells and non-inflammatory tissue-supporting Th17
cells serve as essential components. We also propose that the architecture and cellular composition of these T
cell circuits are distinct in primary CRC and in proximal lymph node and distal liver metastases. In this project,
we will dissect the dynamics of the main immunomodulatory cells states including Treg and Th17 cell and their
interactions with cellular components (“immunomodulatory neighborhoods”) in primary tumors and lymph node
and liver metastases in the same pMMR CRC patients alongside a novel mouse genetic model of spontaneously
metastasizing pMMR CRC (Aim 1). Our perturbation studies will elucidate roles of these key immunomodulatory
cells and their partners in metastatic disease progression and resistance to immunotherapy (Aim 2) and examine
the impact of key immune cell-derived factors on cancer cells in human primary and metastatic CRC organoids
(Aim 3). We will employ cutting edge “omics” analyses at a single cell resolution combined with spatial
transcriptomics and highly multiplexed optical imaging and microscopy and flow cytometry coupled to
experimental perturbations iteratively with novel computational modeling and analyses to deconstruct archetypal
T cell-based cell circuits in CRC and conserved chromatin states and gene regulatory programs of their cellular
constituents. These studies will enable better mechanistic understanding of emergence of pro-metastatic cell
states in pMMR CRC and inform development of orthogonal rational combination immunotherapies for this
disease and elucidate the therapeutic actionability of targeting immune-epithelial circuits in preventing and
treating metastasis in patients with advanced CRC.

This five-year K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Rucinski with the
mentorship and training to become an independent investigator focused on research that optimizes the health
and well-being of women and girls at high risk of HIV acquisition and transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Training
is at the foundation of this proposal and comprises mentorship with expert and multi-disciplinary
implementation science (IS) researchers, didactic coursework, experiential learning, meetings with key
HIV and
stakeholders and community leaders, and rigorous mentored research. The following training objectives will be
accomplished during this award: (1) Obtain scientific expertise in the concepts, theories, tools and methods used
to advance HIV-related IS research and practice; (2) Develop comprehensive skills in qualitative research
methods to support the application of mixed-methods approaches for HIV-related IS research; and (3) Acquire
content expertise in adolescent health and development to inform the tailoring, adaptation, and testing of
developmentally appropriate sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents and young adults.
Supported by these objectives, the proposed mentored research project
will generate a tailored packaged of
implementation strategies to strengthen contextually appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs for
adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 living with HIV in Dar es Salaam. In Tanzania, a quarter
of all new annual HIV infections are among AGYW. Despite efforts to decrease incident infections, the number
of AGYW living with HIV in southern and eastern Africa continues to rise and increasingly, the burden is among
those with sexually acquired HIV
. Further, more than half of the 130,000 AGYW living with HIV in Tanzania are
virally unsuppressed, increasing their risk for onward HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality. Few evidence-
based interventions exist to improve retention in care and viral suppression for adolescents, and even fewer
have been implemented at scale. Peer support models known as “teen clubs” have been prioritized by PEPFAR
and the Government of Tanzania for scale up. Yet evidence to support the feasibility, acceptability, and
effectiveness of this intervention is mixed, and implementation research is needed to close the evidence to
practice gap. Guided by a community-driven implementation planning framework and the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we propose the following aims in Dar es Salaam: (1)
Examine the social, structural, and clinic-level factors associated with retention in care and HIV viral
suppression among AGYW participating in the DREAMS prevention program who were newly infected or
diagnosed with HIV; (2) Refine a tailored package of implementation strategies to optimize a peer-support model
for HIV treatment; and (3) Pilot the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a tailored package
of implementation strategies for AGYW living with HIV. Findings will form the foundation for a R01-level
randomized hybrid effectiveness trial and will facilitate Dr. Rucinski’s transition to independence."

10911772,"Background Heart failure (HF) represents a major health burden, with 80% of the HF health care costs
attributable to hospitalizations. Reducing HF readmissions is a major VA strategic goal. Our pilot study
demonstrated that multivariate physiological telemetry using a small wearable sensor has a high
compliance rate and provides accurate early detection of impending readmission for HF exacerbation.
We now propose to implement non-invasive remote monitoring at 5 VA medical centers.
Significance/Impact Despite treatment advances, hospitalizations for HF exacerbation remain
prevalent and costly. Accurate and timely detection of incipient HF exacerbation may be one path to
reducing HF readmissions.
Innovation The study will develop an implementation strategy for noninvasive remote monitoring with
predictive analytics and an algorithmic treatment response to clinical alerts coming from the analytical
platform. The result will be a reliable link between the clinical alert and an intervention that can affect
the clinical outcome of the patient. Algorithmic response to the device alert will be a subject of ongoing
validation and update as part of the learning health-care system concept. This will allow for integration
with the electronic health record, optimization and standardization of the response process and
decrease alert fatigue. Furthermore, we will evaluate patient and provider attitudes toward using remote
monitoring to guide HF therapy, as well as the impact of this approach on key clinical outcomes.
Specific Aims Aim 1. Implement remote monitoring into the clinical workflow of HF care.
Aim 1a. Design implementation strategies for non-invasive remote monitoring and algorithmic
response to clinical alerts generated by the predictive analytics platform.
Aim 1b. Evaluate implementation outcomes, including clinician and patient perceptions and adoption
of the use of ambulatory remote monitoring data.
Aim 2. Conduct a feasibility study of non-invasive remote monitoring in chronic HF.
Aim 2a. Define key characteristics that will inform design of a pivotal trial of non-invasive remote
monitoring aimed at reducing rehospitalization and improving quality of life in HF.
Aim 2b. Identify costs associated with implementation and non-invasive remote monitoring in HF.
Methodology We will design implementation processes using the i-PARiHS framework and three
implementation phases: 1) implementation intervention planning; 2) formative evaluation of pilot
implementation at 2 vanguard sites; and 3) Implementation fidelity monitoring. We will enroll 240
patients hospitalized for HF exacerbation at 5 participating VA centers. All study subjects will receive
the monitoring kit, which will be used for 90 days after discharge. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
an intervention arm, where clinicians will be notified of clinical alerts and will follow response algorithm
to modify HF treatment or recommend urgent clinic visit/emergency room visit, and to the control arm,
where information from the sensors will be collected, but clinical alerts will not be generated or
communicated to providers. Study outcomes will include the proportion of randomized patients who
meet the algorithm’s criteria for at least one alert, the proportion of time the remote monitor is in use
and functioning properly, HF hospitalization rate, hospital stay length, and health-related quality of life.
Next Steps This work will inform design of a pivotal trial of non-invasive remote monitoring aimed at
reducing rehospitalization and improving quality of life in HF. Implementation strategies developed in
this study may be used not only for implementation of the monitoring approach tested, but also for other
remote monitoring strategies in HF and additional chronic health conditions."

10912715,"Development of patient-specific mathematical models for the transport of solute molecules in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along the spinal canal
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is predominantly secreted from the blood plasma and continuously bathes and
circulates around the external surfaces of the brain and spinal cord. It maintains the electrolytic balance of the
central nervous system (CNS), and serves as a medium for the supply of nutrients to neuronal and glial cells and
the removal of waste products of cellular metabolism. It also transports hormones, neurotransmitters, and other
neuropeptides throughout the CNS. The deregulation of the CSF circulation may compromise the transport of these
solutes and the normal physiologic functions of the CNS contributing to the development of some cognitive and
neurological diseases. CSF also provides a conduit for the delivery of potent analgesics and chemotherapy to the
CNS, a drug delivery procedure often referred to as intrathecal or intraspinal drug delivery (ITDD). To date, there is
no comprehensive methodology capable of predicting the patient-specific, long-term, motion of the CSF and the
transport of solute molecules along the spinal canal. Thus, the main objective of this proposal is to develop a
comprehensive modeling methodology capable of predicting the long-term transport of solute molecules along the
spinal canal in each patient-specific anatomy and physiological conditions. The modeling approach combines the
use of two time-scales asymptotic analysis of the Eulerian velocity field of the CSF in the spinal canal with in-vitro
experimentation and detailed in-vivo validation with patient-specific radiological measurements. The proposed
methodology is valid for a wide range of molecular diffusivities and accounts for convective effects of the CSF,
including “shear-enhanced diffusion”, “steady-streaming”, and “Stokes drift”, to determine the long-time Lagrangian
transport of the solute in the subarachnoid space (SAS) of the spinal canal. The expected outcomes of the proposed
research are twofold: 1) it will provide a detailed understanding of the mechanisms regulating the transport of all
important molecules key to the functioning of the CNS and 2) it will also provide the methodology necessary to
optimize ITDD protocols."

analysis of the function of these microbes beyond basic genomic characterization. Next-generation sequencers
have transformed microbiome research but have proven insufficient to understand the biologic relevance of
this microbial genetic information in the skin. The acne microbiome has been partially characterized but
without understanding of how products of these diverse organisms influence the pathophysiology of acne. The
Core Director, Core Associate Director, and staff of this core have extensive experience in the generation and
analysis of metagenomic data and have successfully developed a panel of functional screens to enable
analysis of how target cells respond to the metabolic products of microbe. This requires expertise in the study
of C. acnes, the predominant bacterial species in acne that is anaerobic and fastidious, thus requiring expertise
for isolation and culture. C. acnes produces a range of fermentation metabolites and other products that can
alter host immune responses and the growth of other organisms. This core will produce libraries of bacterial
organisms from the skin, perform metagenomic analysis from skin swabs, and functionally screen libraries for
their capacity to alter the immune response of fibroblasts, keratinocytes and immunocytes relevant to the skin
of acne subjects, and analyze these observations to generate hypothesis for further testing. The core will also
work closely with the transcriptomics core and lipidomic screens at UCLA to further integrate data for validation
and discovery. This ability will transform the utility of the data to members of the CORT."

The NEI funded P30 University of Michigan Vision Research Center provides priority access to resources and
services to NEI-R01 funded investigators in five areas representing critical needs that are beyond the
resources of individual laboratories. These areas include: Advanced Statistical Analysis, Instrument
Fabrication, Visual Functional Assessment, Molecular Biology Instrumentation and Stem Cell Biology Facilities,
and Morphology and Imaging. The services also help provide other researchers, especially those preparing
NEI R01 proposals, those with other NEI research awards, and those collaborating with NEI-funded
researchers to generate critical preliminary data to apply for NEI R01 awards. The Cores, with available time,
can also be used by other individuals involved in vision research or new investigators to encourage pursuit of
novel vision-related research.
The University of Michigan Vision Research Center (UMVRC) is directed by David A. Antonetti, Ph.D.,
Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Roger W. Kittendorf Research Professor of Ophthalmology
and Visual Sciences and Scientific Director of the Kellogg Eye Center. Dr. Antonetti has had continuous NEI
support for 24 years to explore the mechanisms of retinal vascular permeability in diabetic retinopathy and
other blinding eye diseases, develop novel therapies to regulate signaling pathways that control vascular
permeability and explore methods for restoration of vascular function. Dr. Antonetti has recently accepted the
role of PI and Director of the P30 Vision Research Center. As Director of the Administrative Core, Dr. Antonetti
will be responsible for ensuring that Vision Research Center activities are appropriate to the needs of vision
researchers, and that they are run efficiently and according to appropriate priorities. Dr. Antonetti will work
closely with Departmental financial officers to ensure responsible oversight of Core expenditures and budget.
Dr. Antonetti will review the Center’s website information, organize and run quarterly meetings of the UMVRC
Executive Committee to discuss Core operations and services and he will prepare, analyze, and report the
results of surveys and questionnaires designed to ensure that Core resources and services are appropriate to
the needs of vision scientists and are operated in an effective and efficient manner. Finally, Dr. Antonetti will
ensure progress reports are prepared and provided to the NIH in a timely manner. He is assisted by a
Research Program Manager and Grant Administrator in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual
Sciences.
Overall supervision of the Vision Research Center is under the direction of the PI and the UMVRC Executive
Committee, which meets quarterly. This committee consists of the PI, who serves as Chair as well as the
Scientific Director for Research in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, and the 5 Core
Directors and 5 co-Directors. The quarterly meetings are designed to review Core activity, the overall research
environment, the quality of services and resources and degree of client satisfaction. The meetings also provide
an opportunity to address any problems and consider new opportunities of the Vision Research Center to
advance or improve services and attract new investigators and projects into vision research. In this manner the
UMVRC greatly advances the efforts of participating investigators to accomplish the mission of the NEI to
understand mechanisms of vision, explore underlying pathology of vision loss and to develop novel therapeutic
approaches to cure or prevent blinding eye disease and improve the visual health of the country."

10937797,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated pathological alterations are universally present in individuals with Down
syndrome (DS) by 40 years of age, and the majority of people (88%) with DS are negatively affected by AD at
65 years of age. Because of this high disease burden, effective treatments for AD would be particularly beneficial
to the DS population, but the complex molecular events that underlie the pathogenesis of AD in DS (AD-DS)—
the key to developing targeted therapies—remain poorly understood. In the proposed research, we will use
CRISPR technology to engineer mutant mice to probe the regulatory roles of MS4A proteins on TREM2 and
microglial activation, which are known to play important roles in the development of AD in both DS and the
general population. TREM2 is a transmembrane protein that is expressed in microglia, and TREM2 functions as
a pattern recognition receptor that detects and binds to Aβ oligomers and induces an innate immune response.
Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) inhibits Aβ oligomerization and disaggregates preformed Aβ oligomers and
protofibrils, thus inhibiting Aβ fibrillization, and consequently, Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is blocked. Experimental
support for this cascade has been obtained in mouse models, and different levels of TREM2 in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) are known to be associated with different disease states in patients with AD. MS4A proteins are
considered among the most important regulators of TREM2 and microglial activation, and MS4A mutations are
closely associated with different levels of TREM2 in CSF and activation of microglia l cells. However, the
functional relationships among TREM2, MS4As, and microglial activation were established mainly through
genome-wide association studies. Presently, in vivo data on how TREM2 and microglial activation are regulated
by MS4As and the consequence in AD-DS are lacking. To fill this important knowledge gap, we plan to examine
Ms4a-mediated regulation of TREM2 in AD-DS in vivo in two engineered mouse models. Afterward, we will
pursue the following phenotyping experiments for each aim: (a) analysis of TREM2 levels in CSF; (b) analysis
of the activation of microglial cells; (c) measurement of the levels of Aβ in mouse brain tissue; (d) examination
of AD-associated neuropathology; and (e) analysis of cognitive deficits. Attainment of these objectives will allow
us to directly test the hypothesis that Ms4a-mediated TREM2 regulation and microglial activation play an
important role in AD-DS for the first time by using our mutant mice. Furthermore, achievement of our goals will
open up a major area for new AD research, with promise for those with or without DS, and bring us closer to
developing effective treatments for AD and other medical conditions associated with TREM2, MS4A, and
microglia."
10938863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human gammaherpesviruses (gHVs) Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus are
DNA tumor viruses that establish a lifelong infection. These viruses are strongly associated with pathogenic
outcomes in immune suppression, including the AIDS defining malignancies Kaposi's sarcoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. A major challenge of the gHVs is that these viruses present a lifelong risk for viral
reemergence and pathogenesis, especially in the context of acquired or medically-induced
immunosuppression. Lifelong infection is further confounded by the limited therapeutic interventions against
gHV diseases. To date, the best defense against gHV-induced disease is an intact immune system. Despite
this correlation, there remain major knowledge gaps in our understanding of: 1) protective aspects of
successful vaccination to gHV infection, and 2) consequence of vaccination on the composition and frequency
of infected cells, either before or after established infection. In this R01 application, we seek to investigate how
vaccination alters gHV infection, using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gHV68), a mouse model of gHV
infection, that facilitates study of infection and associated responses from primary infection through lifelong
latency and re-emergence of lytic infection. We recently undertook studies to characterize how latency is
regulated by viral and host factors at the single-cell level, identifying that the latent pool is heterogeneous
based on expression of the latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), and that the proportion of LANA+
latently-infected cells is subject to regulation. These studies further identified that CD8 T cells, and the cytokine
interferon-gamma, limit LANA+ latently-infected B cells, and that vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine is
capable of profoundly restricting LANA+ latent B cell infection in an interferon-gamma-independent manner.
We now seek to investigate the role of myeloid cells in infection and vaccination on gHV infection both in vitro
and in vivo. We will make use of vaccination protocols with defined differences in efficacy to identify the critical
features using single cell analysis and high dimensional methods to distinguish the features of vaccine efficacy.
We hypothesize that vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine induces: 1) local and systemic myeloid
reprogramming, which 2) redirects gHV myeloid infection into an immune-susceptible myeloid target.
We will test this in three aims. First, we will analyze the impact of vaccination on local and systemic myeloid
cells. Second, define how vaccination affects primary gHV infection of myeloid cells. Third, dissect how viral
tropism is influenced by vaccine-induced effector mechanisms. By analyzing specific viral and host processes
in the context of vaccines with varying efficacy, this proposal seeks to investigate myeloid reprogramming as a
necessary, and therapeutically viable, target for vaccination against gHV latency."
10909886,"Project Summary: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers delayed molecular secondary injury cascades, including
chronic neuroinflammation, that contribute to progressive tissue loss and neurological impairments, including
cognitive deficits. Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe TBI
and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological impairments. Thus, targeting
microglial activation may offer novel therapeutic targets for TBI patients. Our previous studies have probed the
development of dysfunctional microglia after TBI and shown that: 1) pro-inflammatory microglia are chronically
activated up to one year following experimental TBI, contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline; 2)
NADPH oxidase (NOX2) plays a critical role for chronic microglial-mediated neurotoxicity; 3) temporary depletion
of brain microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor (PLX5622) causes microglial reprograming and phenotypic shift from
a chronic pro-inflammatory profile to more restorative phenotypes that express reduced inflammatory markers,
including NOX2 , and attenuate long-term motor and cognitive deficits. In the present proposal, we aim to utilize
the groundbreaking single-cell RNA-seq analyses to investigate the unique microglial subsets present following
specific targeted deletion of NOX2. Furthermore, we will investigate the transcriptional signatures of the
microglial subsets that modulate neurorestorative properties in the chronically injured brain. Importantly, this
proposal will investigate the role of NOX2 in non-microglia macrophage-like cells, including border-associated
macrophages (BAMs) and circulating monocytes, in mediating neuroinflammatory responses and neurological
decline, following TBI. Specific aims include: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms of repopulation-induced microglial
reprograming associated with attenuated pro-inflammatory, neurotoxic phenotypes after TBI; 2) To determine
the role of microglial NOX2 in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration after TBI; 3) To address the role of BAM
NOX2 in in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration after TBI; and 4) To evaluate the role of circulating monocytes
NOX2 in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration after TBI. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive
microglia and non-microglia macrophage-like cells to polarize towards a neurorestorative state will be crucial to
unlock the endogenous potential of microglia/macrophages to promote repair during the chronic phase of
recovery after TBI."
10909976,"Project Summary
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in women and negatively impact activities of daily living
and quality of life, resulting in medical and psychological morbidity and enormous economic burden. Because
of the deleterious consequences of LUTS on women, understanding optimal bladder health is essential. Given
the complexity and heterogeneity of women with urinary symptoms, transdisciplinary research is needed to
screen for risk factors for the development of bladder symptoms, protective factors that facilitate optimized
bladder health, and mechanisms to target for prevention programs to disrupt causal pathways to bladder
symptoms To date, the literature on LUTS has mostly focused on non-Hispanic White women with health
insurance who present with symptoms and are already engaged with the healthcare system. Thus, extant
prevention and treatment approaches are not generalizable to vulnerable populations like minority and
underserved women. Significant gaps remain in understanding bladder health for minority and underserved
women, where significant health disparities exist. Well-designed longitudinal cohort studies of urinary
symptoms in diverse samples in which racial/ethnic minorities are well represented are severely lacking.
Consistent with the PLUS Research Consortium, our objective is to move beyond the absence of symptoms and
optimize bladder health as “a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being related to bladder
function.” Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to assess the influence of biological, psychosocial
(mind/behavior), interpersonal, institutional, environmental, and societal factors on bladder health among
diverse women using qualitative and quantitative approaches within the PLUS framework. The mixed-
methods approach of this project includes: Specific Aim 1. Conduct a longitudinal, observational study of
bladder health in a diverse cohort of adolescent and adult women with respect to race/ethnicity, age, income,
education, health literacy, insurance status, sexual orientation, and employment, Specific Aim 2. Determine
factors and behaviors that influence bladder health in diverse women, and Specific Aim 3. Create a screening
tool for bladder health that is reliable and valid across diverse women. We hypothesize that social
determinants of health, implicit bias, and discrimination will be significantly related to the trajectory of
bladder health and engagement with the healthcare system over time for LUTS. We also hypothesize that the
screener we develop will assess bladder health in all women (including diverse populations in which
disparities exist) and will identify women at risk for future bladder symptoms with high reliability, validity,
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and minimal burden to the respondent. The impact of this U01 will be
the curation of a novel knowledge base on risk and protective factors in diverse populations of women."

epidemiology, longitudinal cohort studies, prevention science, public health, health education, cross cultural
research, qualitative research, primary care (Pediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynecology), clinical care of women with
LUTS, and are world renown for population-based microbiome research. We boast a history of strong
leadership and critical contributions to the foundational work of the Consortium, including leadership in the
development and validation of instruments for BH and qualitative research on the Study of Habits, Attitudes,
Realities and Experiences (SHARE) and related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB). UC San Diego is a
well-established research institution, funded by the National Institutes of Health, including a sponsored Clinical
& Translational Science Award which provides a full spectrum of resources and personnel for the conduct of
basic science, translational, epidemiologic, behavioral, and clinical research across the full age spectrum
among racially and ethnically diverse communities. In addition to the foundational work of validating the
bladder health instrument (BHI) for use in a culturally diverse population, our proposal incorporates cutting
edge translational research aimed at identifying a healthy urogenital microbiome. The unique strengths of our
application include: a) robust contributions to the foundational work of the Consortium including two team
members actively engaged in the design of the planned longitudinal cohort study; b) a history of strong
recruitment and retention of ethnically diverse participants for qualitative (SHARE), quantitative clinical trials
and longitudinal cohort studies; c) a conceptual model centered around the notion that BH may be mediated
through societal, institutional, interpersonal, behavioral and biologic factors via the urogenital microbiome; d) a
feasibility pilot study of collection and analysis of voided urine specimens from a longitudinal cohort, which will
foster investigations of prevention studies that manipulate the urogenital microbiome (directly or indirectly)
through changes in modifiable risk factors across the PLUS conceptual framework; and e) the development of
new measures for use in linguistically and culturally diverse populations starting with an adapted and validated
Hispanic (English and Spanish language) BHI and KAB questionnaire."
10909978,"ABSTRACT:
 This application in response to RFA-DA-19-002 proposes a phased plan that will fast track the IND
development of a next-generation medication for opioid use disorders (OUD). The small-molecule compounds
proposed for development are targeted to the nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP) and have shown promising
efficacy in reducing oxycodone intake in nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) trained to self-administer
oxycodone with efficacies similar to that of buprenorphine. But unlike buprenorphine, the NOP-targeted
agonist lead compounds show no reinforcing effects by themselves, in monkeys. Also unlike buprenorphine
and methadone, currently used for treating OUDs, NOP-targeted lead compounds do not produce physical
dependence, tolerance, or respiratory depression, upon repeated administration. For the non-medical
prescription opioid addiction, methadone and buprenorphine, both approved for illicit opioid (heroin) addiction
treatment, are used. However, methadone, a mu opioid receptor (MOP) full agonist has significant abuse
liability and causes withdrawal after chronic use, reliance on methadone clinics, and risk of drug overdose-
induced respiratory depression. Buprenorphine (Bup), a MOP partial agonist and kappa opioid receptor (KOP)
antagonist, produces limited respiratory depression; however, clinical studies indicate that it is less effective
than methadone in reducing drug use, craving and relapse. Agonists targeted to the nociceptin/orphanin FQ
peptide (NOP) receptor, the fourth opioid receptor subtype, modulate the pharmacology of MOP agonists and
opioids, particularly in pain and reward circuitries. Our preliminary data shows that small-molecule NOP
agonists reduce morphine-induced reward in rodents and this is further confirmed in our preliminary data in
nonhuman primates, demonstrating promising anti-rewarding properties of a NOP/MOP partial agonist in
decreasing oxycodone self-administration without producing dependence or respiratory depression. Together
our data thus far suggests that the NOP agonists are a promising new approach to treat illicit and
prescription opioid use disorders and may offer an alternative to buprenorphine use.
 In the UG3 phase of this project, we propose to conduct non-GLP ADME-tox and efficacy confirmation,
and additional lead optimization if warranted, with the goal/milestone being the nomination of a `IND
candidate' and backup candidates, for IND-enabling studies and an IND filing (in the UH3phase)."
10910097,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the conserved mechanism that underlies the development
of different types of chronic pain and identify a tractable target with broad implications for therapy. Despite diverse
pathological triggers and different upstream signaling pathways, nociceptive activity-induced functional and
structural plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn serves as the common neural substrate for the different types of
chronic pain. However, it remains unclear which molecular mechanisms orchestrate structural and functional
plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn and whether these mechanisms are conserved across the different types of
chronic pain. Rho GTPases (e.g., Rac1 and RhoA) play essential roles in dendritic spine morphogenesis and
synaptic plasticity by controlling actin cytoskeleton organization. In particular, Rac1 promotes the formation,
growth, and stabilization of spines and synapses. We previously identified Tiam1 as a critical regulator of Rac1-
dependent spine morphogenesis in brain development. Tiam1 is activated by synaptic NMDARs and TrkB
receptors and mediates their effects on actin and spine remodeling. During the pain processing, NMDARs and
TrkB receptors-mediated central sensitization in the spinal dorsal horn are critically involved in chronic pain
hypersensitivity, and Rac1-dependent increases in the size and density of dendritic spines account for the long-
term nature of chronic pain. Our preliminary studies found that Tiam1 was activated in the spinal dorsal horn
under neuropathic pain conditions and modulated synaptic remodeling by promoting peripheral nerve injury-
induced actin polymerization and synaptic NMDAR stabilization. Moreover, Tiam1 deletion from excitatory
neurons or spinal dorsal horn neurons prevented chronic pain development triggered by peripheral nerve injury,
chemotherapy, diabetes, and inflammation. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that Tiam1 links
nociceptive activity-activated NMDARs and TrkB receptors to Rac1 signaling, orchestrating synaptic structural
plasticity via actin cytoskeleton reorganization and functional plasticity via synaptic NMDAR stabilization in
excitatory neuron populations in the spinal dorsal horn, which serves as a conserved mechanism underlying the
development of different types of chronic pain and can be targeted for therapeutic chronic pain intervention. We
will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Identify Tiam1’s convergent function in different types of chronic
pain; 2) Elucidate the mechanisms by which Tiam1 contributes to different types of chronic pain; 3) Validate
spinal Tiam1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic pain. At the completion of this project, we will
uncover a conserved mechanism that underlies the development of different types of chronic pain and identify a
novel therapeutic target that could be translated into the clinic to treat chronic pain with broad implications."
10909928,"Project Summary
 Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being widely used to measure
functional connectivity and dynamics of large-scale brain networks in both healthy subjects and patient groups,
despite the neural bases of rsfMRI-based connectivity/dynamics measures remain largely unclear. Converging
evidence has suggested the contributions from arousal-related factors given large rsfMRI changes seen across
distinct brain states, however, a systemic understanding of the role of arousal factors in rsfMRI research is
missing. The lack of this knowledge hampers the correct interpretation and proper use of rsfMRI-based
measures of brain connectivity and dynamics. To bridge this critical gap, the major goal of this application is to
develop an arousal measure based on spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics and then use it to elucidate and control for
the influences of the arousal on rsfMRI-based measures of brain connectivity and dynamics. The research
objective will be achieved through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to map spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics associated
with a recently discovered event of arousal modulation and utilize this information to improve fMRI-based
arousal measure. The working hypothesis is that transient arousal modulations are associated with a specific
sequence of fMRI activations, and this spatiotemporal dynamic can be utilized to greatly improve fMRI-based
arousal measurements. Aim 2 is to assess the contribution of arousal-related fMRI changes to the relationship
between rsfMRI connectivity and non-neuronal signals, including physiological signals and head motions. It is
hypothesized that the arousal modulation mediates spurious relationships between rsfMRI connectivity and the
non-neuronal noise. In Aim 3, the contributions of arousal factors to rsfMRI-based quantifications of brain
dynamics and their correlations with behavioral measures will be assessed. The working hypothesis is that the
arousal effects on rsfMRI dynamics can be decomposed into the “state” and “trait” effects that have preferential
impacts on the sensory/motor brain areas and higher-order cognitive networks respectively. The arousal “trait”
related to intrinsic individual difference in arousal regulation mediates a part of correlations between certain
aspects of rsfMRI dynamics and human behavior. The proposed research is innovative because it will combine
local experiments and big data analyses to systemically study the direct effect of arousal modulations on rsfMRI
connectivity and dynamics, as well as indirect effects of mediating their correlations with physiology and
behavior. It will also focus on spatiotemporal brain dynamics at transient arousal modulations and utilize this
information for an fMRI-based arousal measure. The impact of this research is significant because a clear
understanding of the effects of the arousal on rsfMRI-based connectivity/dynamics measures is critical for
proper interpretation and correct use of these metrics. An accurate fMRI-based arousal measure is not only
important for controlling the arousal effects and thus improve rsfMRI-based quantifications but also for future
neuroimaging studies that are interested in the arousal and its role in various brain diseases."

This proposal requests support for a five-year program of training and research to better understand how
distinct brain circuits can be mapped and selectively stimulated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
treat different symptoms of major depression.
In the proposed training plan, I will build upon my previous psychiatric and computational experience to
perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. My career development plan
includes training in brain circuit mapping, neuromodulation, biostatistics/data science, psychiatric phenotyping,
clinical trials, and general translational research.
TMS is an effective treatment for major depression which is capable of modulating specific brain circuits.
However, efficacy varies greatly across patients and the mechanisms are not well-understood. Recent work
from our lab shows that the efficacy of TMS can be improved by stimulating specific targets based on their
connectivity profile. Additionally, different TMS targets can modulate different brain networks which may be
involved in different symptoms of depression. The brain circuit connected to each stimulation site can be
mapped by using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), either at the group level or the individual level. A general
estimated map of stimulation site connectivity can be generated from the human connectome, a normative
wiring diagram of the human brain based on fcMRI of a thousand healthy controls. A more precise map of
connectivity can be generated based on subject-specific fcMRI data.
This proposal aims to personalize TMS targets based on symptoms, emotional task performance, and
brain connectivity. In my preliminary data, this approach yielded distinct circuits responsible for improvement
in “dysphoric” versus “anxiosomatic” symptom clusters. However, these results are limited by retrospective
nature, reliance on subjective symptom scales, and reliance on group-based connectivity. In this proposal, I will
address these limitations by confirming our results in a prospective randomized trial, incorporating task-based
behavioral metrics, and incorporating subject-specific connectivity.
More broadly, this research aims to develop a model for mapping specific circuits associated with distinct
symptom clusters that can be modulated with therapeutic brain stimulation. This will lay the foundation for
personalized approaches to transdiagnostic neuromodulation in clinical psychiatry."
10909931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how germline variation in the immunoglobulin (IG) heavy
(IGH) and light chain (kappa, IGK; lambda, IGL) loci in the human population impacts the development of the
functional antibody (Ab) response in health and disease. However, there is growing appreciation for the fact that
IG polymorphism contributes to variability in the Ab repertoire, indicating that the integration of IG genetic data
in basic and biomedical research can inform our understanding of how IG gene regulation, as well as Ab
repertoire dynamics, function in various clinical contexts. A critical barrier to progress has been that existing
genomic resources for the IG loci are incomplete and poorly represent diversity across human populations,
particularly those from non-European ancestries. Evidence continues to accumulate in support of the notion that
the IG regions are among the most structurally complex and polymorphic regions of the human genome, enriched
for large structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs), resulting in extreme interindividual
haplotype variation. These complexities have long made the IG loci difficult to study using standard high-
throughput methods, with direct negative impacts on genetic disease association studies and, more recently, the
analysis of adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data. As a result, knowledge of human
IG germline diversity, particularly in populations underrepresented in genomics databases, and its contribution
to disease lags far behind that of other well-studied immune loci. This highlights a direct need for publicly
available, well-characterized IG haplotype references and accurate variant catalogues from diverse ethnic
backgrounds to facilitate the design and integration of more accurate genotyping tools, analysis pipelines, and
their interpretation. To meet these needs, we have developed this renewal proposal, which will build the most
comprehensive IG genomic dataset to date, with transformative potential impact for the fields of B cell
immunology and immunogenetics. The resource generated will: (i) shed light on the extent of IG diversity
worldwide; (ii) establish a framework for linking genetic data to expressed antibody repertoire variation to inform
our understanding of V(D)J recombination and seed models of antibody repertoire dynamics; and (iii)
substantially augment key databases and research initiatives pushing the frontiers of genomics and immunology
research. This renewal project will seamlessly build and expand upon the foundational IG genomics data
generated in our initial proposal and continue to establish desperately needed genomic resources for the human
IG loci, particularly in underrepresented populations and cohorts of immediate biomedical relevance, which will
serve the immunology and larger genomics communities for years to come."
10910053,"SUMMARY
 Krabbe disease (KD) is caused by the deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed lysosomal enzyme
galactosylceramidase (GALC) which is responsible for the degradation of galactosylceramides and
galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Because the synthetic pathway conducing to psychosine is not affected in
KD, psychosine is continuously produced and accumulated in the Krabbe nervous system. Toxic levels of
psychosine are considered the main pathogenic trigger of disease. Currently, the standard of care for KD is
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is only applicable to asymptomatic or early symptomatic
infantile KD cases and only protracts disease. Pre-clinical gene therapy studies using adeno-associated viral
(AAV) vectors have shown great promise and in fact, AAV gene therapy applied early in life increases survival,
improves quality of life, and decreases neuropathology in twitcher (twi) mice, the natural model for KD. Based
on these important successes, AAV-based gene therapy clinical trials are being started only for infantile KD.
However, despite the prevention of significant disease-related deficits, HSCT and pre-clinical AAV-gene
therapy trials show varied long-term efficacy and resurgence of neurological disease.
 Thus, the status of gene therapy for KD, the limitations of HSCT to treat primarily presymptomatic infantile
KD and the fact that juvenile and adult onset KD patients, which encompass a significant fraction of Krabbe
patients, largely remain without any treatment, highlight the need to develop additional strategies to sustain
long-term protection for KD patients. The use of substrate reduction therapies (SRT) strategies, singly or
combined with current and new therapies for KD, is one potential way to achieve this. In this application we will
use two small new compounds which selectively inhibit ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT) and acid
ceramidase (ACD), enzymes that mediate the production of psychosine via galactosylation of ceramides and
sphingosine (CGT) and deacylation of galactosylceramide (ACD). Based on the premise that reducing
psychosine synthesis will prevent/reduce psychosine-related pathology at early postnatal development of the
mammalian brain, we will test the efficacy of SRT of CGT and ACD to enhance HSCT and AAV-GALC gene
therapy in the mouse model of infantile KD (twitcher mouse) and the efficacy of single treatment with
CGT or ACD inhibitors to ameliorate/prevent disease in a new model of adult-onset KD."
10933166,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Consistent with recent NCI priorities, there is an urgent need for new investigators to develop skills to broaden
the translation of established and emerging cancer prevention and control strategies. Transdisciplinary learning
experiences in Behavioral Oncology must evolve to include health equity, technology, policy, data science,
cancer care delivery, community engagement, dissemination, and implementation science to enhance impact
on patients and communities. Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) is uniquely positioned to train the next generation
of Behavioral Oncology scientists as the only NCI Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in a state with the
nation’s second highest cancer burden. This renewal builds upon a 20-year history of highly successful
postdoctoral Behavioral Oncology training. Among trainees from the recently funded cycle who have completed
training, 92% have continued in cancer research careers; of those, 58% hold tenure track faculty positions. In
addition, an impressive 42% of trainees received NIH funding as a direct result of participating in our T32 grant
writing seminar. Notably, during the current funding period (2019-2024), 53% of trainees admitted and enrolled
(excluding 3 trainees who had completed their first year as part of the R25T and therefore were not recruited in
this T32) were from underrepresented groups (as defined by the NIH), reflecting our intentional and ongoing
efforts to ensure a diverse group of independent investigators. In this renewal, our T32 program will retain
components of mentoring, structured learning activities, and immersion within the cancer center that have been
key to our success, while adding novel components that address the changing landscape of Behavioral
Oncology. Innovations include a conceptual framework that further guides our use of empirically supported
strategies to enhance trainee success and the addition of new mentors and training opportunities to align with
the abovementioned priority areas. Our T32 program has four goals: 1) Train 15 full-time postdoctoral fellows
committed to research in Behavioral Oncology, of whom at least 30% will be from groups underrepresented in
cancer research; 2) Implement a comprehensive structured training program in Behavioral Oncology rooted in
health equity; 3) Engage mentors to improve trainee experiences using empirically supported mentoring
strategies; and 4) Evaluate training program efforts to continually assess impact and inform modifications. T32
program activities are supported by a strong institutional commitment and a robust infrastructure to support
Behavioral Oncology research and training (e.g., a state-of-the art cancer prevention lab, a cancer analytics
platform of patient self-reported data and clinical data). In summary, trainees of the T32 Behavioral Oncology
Program are expected to go on to successful research careers with a transdisciplinary, translational, and health
equity focus."
10933173,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The Interdisciplinary Training Program in Immunology (ITPI), currently in its 45th year
of funding, represents the primary support for graduate students in Immunology at the University of Chicago.
The program is embodied by the Committee on Immunology, an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental
academic unit that serves as the scientific community for immunology graduate students, postdocs, and faculty
at the University. The ITPI supports eight training slots and features 34 distinguished faculty selected for their
outstanding research and training records, their well-funded laboratories, and their dynamic involvement in all
aspects of graduate education. Their research spans a broad spectrum of modern areas of immunology including
cellular and molecular immunology, biochemistry, genomics, and microbiome studies, with a proven record of
interdisciplinary collaborations. New strength stems from the recent implementation of the Computational &
Systems Immunology (CSI) specialty track for Immunology trainees seeking the advanced conceptual and
technical training needed to tackle immunological questions using quantitative and systems-level genomic
approaches. This initiative is buoyed by our recent recruitment of eight junior faculty who are emerging leaders
in three priority areas, including CSI, human immunology, and molecular engineering, as well as the development
of two new specialized graduate courses in data sciences tailored specifically for Immunology trainees. All
students in the ITPI receive advanced training through courses focused on the critical analysis of primary
literature and experimental design, with special emphasis on bioinformatics skills, rigor and reproducibility, and
the responsible conduct of research. The comprehensive training includes a weekly Seminar Series, Work-in-
Progress forum, and Journal Club, as well as unique scientific events such as the Joint Immunology Retreat and
the T32 Career Perspectives in Immunology virtual event, which both stem from a joint partnership with
Washington University in St. Louis. Career development is enhanced through MyChoice, an institutional program
enabling trainees to further develop academic skills and gain exposure to a broad array of research-intensive
career paths. The Biological Sciences Division provides strong institutional support, as shown by sustained
financial and administrative support, the operation of cutting-edge core facilities, and the implementation of major
initiatives such as the Duchossois Family Institute, which aims to harness the power of the microbiome and
immunity for human health. The ITPI is continuously and rigorously evaluated with respect to organization,
process, objectives, and outcomes. This is one of the most outstanding and competitive training programs in the
country, as shown by the diverse nature of the student body, the high retention and completion rates of our
trainees, their impressive publication record (average of five publications per trainee, including many first-author
publications in high-impact journals (IF>20), and their success in securing independent careers in research-
intensive and research-related areas."
10937675,"Abstract/Project Summary
Germline genetics research often relies heavily on large-scale hypothesis testing to detect associations
between complex traits and their risk mutations. Traditionally, the statistical methods that we and others have
developed for these settings have focused on powerful approaches that test global null hypotheses - identifying
the existence of any signal in a set of individual tests. In recent years though, researchers have also
increasingly emphasized novel study designs that are more suitable for another class of tests known as
composite null hypothesis tests. Roughly speaking, the goal of a composite null hypothesis test is to identify
the existence of multiple, as opposed to at least one, signal in a set of individual tests. However, the lack of
validated variants identified by composite null analyses belies the high popularity of such studies, suggesting a
lack of suitable quantitative approaches. The central goal of this proposal is to develop high-dimensional
composite null hypothesis testing approaches that (a) provide interpretable results addressing the scientific
question of interest and (b) offer robust performance over varied genome-wide settings. Specifically, one study
design of interest is (i) pleiotropy studies. A common goal in performing pleiotropy analysis is to identify
variants linked to multiple diseases simultaneously, which may, for example, suggest new indications for
existing therapies. Many existing pleiotropy approaches test global nulls, which are still applicable but often
less pertinent. Another related study type is (ii) mediation analysis. When testing for genetic mediation, interest
lies in the simultaneous associations of a variant to a mediator and the mediator to an outcome. Thus, a
composite null approach that identifies at least two associations is more suitable for this type of investigation.
Additionally, (iii) replication studies are ubiquitous in genetics research and require more than one association
to declare a successful replicated effect. We will develop approaches that leverage our existing empirical
Bayes tools to perform composite null inference in (i)-(iii). Different models will be proposed to address unique
statistical challenges such as the within-set correlation that arises in (ii) and directionality restrictions in (iii).
Extensive simulation studies and real data examples will be used to illustrate (a) and (b), as well as
demonstrate advantages over global null interpretations. Successful completion of this work will result in novel,
interpretable, and robust strategies to perform large-scale pleiotropy, mediation, replication, and other
translational genetics studies across a variety of phenotypes. We will also develop well-documented, publicly
available software packages to share this methodology with the research community. Summary data from
analysis of varied phenotypes will be released."

Abnormal nuclear shape is a diagnostic marker of disease progression and contributes to cellular dysfunction.
Perturbations to major nuclear rigidity components, chromatin or lamins, results in a weaker nucleus that is
deformed by external and/or internal forces to produce nuclear blebs and ruptures causing cellular dysfunction.
Previously, we revealed that, independent of lamins, chromatin compaction via histone modification state (eu-
/heterochromatin) determines nuclear mechanics, shape, rupture, and function. Changes in heterochromatin
subtypes, transcription activity, and mitotic segregation are well-known to occur in diseases presenting abnormal
nuclear morphology. The overall goal of my research program is to identify how nuclear rigidity, shape, and
rupture are controlled to maintain proper genomic and cellular function. The central hypothesis is that chromatin
rigidity via heterochromatin subtypes, chromatin motion via transcription activity, and chromatin organization
during mitotic segregation drive the mechanisms underlying nuclear physical properties. This hypothesis
addresses three knowledge gaps. First, what are the specific components that provide heterochromatin rigidity?
Heterochromatin is composed of subtypes, constitutive vs. facultative, and their specific histone modifications
that facilitate chromatin compaction and may have distinct impacts on rigidity. Second, is there another
contributor to nuclear deformation? While actin compression and contraction provide an external nuclear
deformation, transcription-driven chromatin motion represents a potential new internal nuclear deformation.
Third, is there an alternative mechanism to cause abnormal nuclear shape? Mitotic segregation error represents
a potential new mechanism of abnormal nuclear shape and rupture through chromatin disorganization during
nuclear reformation. We are qualified to determine nuclear rigidity using our lab’s innovative micromanipulation
single nucleus force-extension technique that has the unique ability to separate chromatin and lamin rigidity
contributions. We will couple this with measuring nuclear shape/blebbing and rupture through tracking NLS-GFP
via live cell microscopy. Our preliminary data show that heterochromatin histone modifications have distinct
effects on nuclear shape while transcription inhibition suppresses nuclear blebbing and rupture independent of
nuclear rigidity. Our preliminary data also show that miotic segregation errors cause both abnormal nuclear
morphology and rupture. This work will provide a deeper understanding of the established interphase blebbing
pathway by determining heterochromatin subtypes’ distinct physical contributions and a new contributor in
transcription-driven deformation. This proposal will also identify a new mechanism for abnormal shape via mitotic
segregation error. Identifying the role of heterochromatin subtypes, transcription activity, and mitotic segregation
error to nuclear rigidity, shape, and rupture will enlighten the underlying causes of abnormal nuclear morphology
and provide therapeutic targets for restoring nuclear shape and function in human disease."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic degenerative cell disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to
progressive progressive loss of overworked pancreatic islet beta cells. Recent work from our laboratories has
shown that hyperactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress in beta cells due to upstream
may be a critical early event in the development of T2D. We have developed and are refining novel small
molecule pharmacological reagents that allow us to manipulate critical components of the UPR—called KIRAs
that maintain desirable (adaptive) outputs of the UPR while quelling undesirable (maladaptive) outputs
including insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, consequently leading to apoptosis and diabetes. We show
that first generation versions of KIRAs we developed against a kinase/RNase target called IRE1α can
efficaciously prevent and even reverse diabetes in leptin deficient ob/ob mice. Here, we plan a medicinal
chemistry campaign using several strategies to optimize KIRAs on three scaffolds towards the clinic. In this
collaborative grant we will capitalize on the complementary expertise of the investigators to optimize these
KIRA lead molecules for potency, selectivity, drug-likeness (including oral bioavailability) and conduct critical
proof-of-concept studies using reductionist chemical genetic systems, ob/ob and HFD-fed mice, and human
islets, and perform key IND-enabling steps needed to advance these candidates further into the clinic for
eventually treating human patients with T2D."
10905904,"Abstract
 Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases, accounting for more than
half-million deaths worldwide each year. To date, there exist no effective medical interventions; thereby, posing
a serious threat to public health.
 ALD represents a broad-spectrum hepatic disorder from alcoholic fatty liver (AFL), alcoholic steatohepatitis
(ASH) to cirrhosis, the development of which is largely determined by the duration, quantity, and pattern of
substance abuse. AFL, the 1st stage of ALD, is characterized by the massive accumulation of macrovesicular
lipid droplets in hepatocytes without histological features of inflammation. AFL develops as soon as 2 weeks of
alcohol abuse and can also undergo a rapid and complete resolution upon abstinence. However, if abstinence
cannot be achieved, AFL, in turn, serves as the foundation for the development of advanced stages of ALD such
as ASH and cirrhosis, which are associated with extremely high mortality and morbidity rate as well as poor
reversibility even with long-term abstinence. With the opportunity to efficiently mitigate the disease burden of
ALD, AFL represents an attractive therapeutic target. To this end, furthering our understanding of AFL
pathophysiology serves as a critical milestone.
 In this study, we established a novel in vitro study model of AFL with a highly physiological culture system
of terminally differentiated human hepatocyte (HH), then applied for the elucidation of hepatocyte-intrinsic
response to the metabolic stress inflicted by AFL. Cellular response to metabolic stress is a coordinated
adaptation process obligatory for homeostatic maintenance; thus, the failure leads to cell injury. While the
induction of transcriptome changes is an undoubtedly important process in stress response, the synthesis of
respective proteins is ultimately required to execute the designated gene functions. Consequently, we conducted
an integrative analysis of polysome profiling and mRNA-sequencing to elucidate the concordance between
transcriptome change and mRNAs translated by ribosomes. Our analysis revealed that AFL induces a significant
dysregulation of translatome, suggesting that the transcriptome change is discordantly processed at the protein
translation machinery. This observation led to our hypothesis that “AFL dysregulation of translatome results in a
global alteration of the proteome, which acts in concert to impair the stress response and leads to the cytotoxicity.”
 Accordingly, this exploratory proposal is designed to elucidate the mechanism and significance of
translatome alteration as the critical pathophysiology of AFL through the following specific aims: Aim 1:
Determine the molecular mechanism of dysregulated translatome in HH of AFL, and Aim 2: Define the correlation
between transcriptome, translatome and quantitative proteomics of AFL HH. The successful completion of the
proposed studies will provide unique and novel insights on AFL pathophysiology and a framework for further
investigation with in vivo models as well as translational studies involving clinical specimens."
10907467,"The Center of Regenerative Medicine (CRM) at Washington University in St. Louis proposes an
interdisciplinary postdoctoral training program in regenerative medicine. Breakthroughs in various
bioengineering and stem cell technologies over the past decade have provided unprecedented opportunities
for the development of new regenerative technologies, yet there is a lack of individuals who have received
formal interdisciplinary training. This program will be used to develop an integrated training structure that
provides a unique, multidisciplinary experience for postdoctoral fellows in one of four research thrusts: 1)
Development in the context of regeneration; 2) Cell fate engineering; 3) Biomaterials for cell and tissue
engineering; and 4) Molecules, genes, and cells as regenerative therapeutics. The program involves over 40
faculty from 20 separate departments and divisions across Washington University. Trainees will be guided by
a mentoring committee, and an integral aspect of this training program will be the creation of a formal training
plan for each individual trainee, based on a self-assessment of skills and career goals (the Individual
Development Plan). Interdisciplinary training will be supplemented by workshops in complementary areas,
including statistical analysis, writing, and mandatory training in research ethics. We will also take advantage of
several long-standing and successful initiatives at Washington University to enhance the recruitment of
underrepresented minorities as part of this post-doctoral training program. Our primary goal is to develop
highly trained individuals who can produce impactful interdisciplinary research in regenerative medicine."
10907596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder that imposes a significant burden on
public health. The most recent large-scale genetic study of BP identified 64 associated genetic loci, providing
initial insights in BP pathogenesis. Yet, genetic discovery in BP lags behind other key psychiatric disorders. The
reported genetic loci only capture a small proportion of the total BP genetic liability, with many more variants
across the common and rare allele frequency spectrum remaining to be discovered. In addition, the previous
studied samples were of European ancestry, leaving population specific BP variants uncovered and uncertainty
in how the BP genetic findings generalize to other populations, exacerbating healthcare disparities, and these
studies rarely employed “deep” phenotyping or assessed relevant environmental risk factors. This proposal
brings together an international collaboration of leading investigators from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea,
Singapore, India, and Pakistan to form the Asian Bipolar Genetics Network (A-BIG-NET) and carry out a large-
scale genetic study of BP in East and South Asia. A-BIG-NET will generate a BP genetic resource of 27,500
cases and 16,000 controls with rich phenotypic information, measures of key environmental stressors and
genetic data from 4x low-pass whole genome sequencing (4xWGS). This will complement a schizophrenia
genetics resource of 22,778 cases and 35,362 controls of Asian ancestry previously assembled by leaders of
this network that will be available for cross-disorder comparisons. Studying BP genetics in Asia is important to
the world and the U.S., as Asia constitutes 57% of the world population, and Asian American comprises 6.6% of
the U.S. population (21.4 million). The five countries in A-BIG-NET cover 35% of all Asian populations. The
specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) recruit and deeply phenotype 17,500 BP cases, with a focus on BP-I to
maximize homogeneity, and 14,000 controls from four Asian countries; 2) carry out 4xWGS on all recruited
samples plus 10,000 BP-I cases and 2,000 controls collected by a previous study using similar procedures in
Pakistan; and 3) carry out a range of analyses to discover new genetic associations with BP-I across the allelic
spectrum in East and South Asian populations, examine the comparative genetic architecture of BP-I across
major world populations and with other major neuropsychiatric disorders, and perform a novel statistical fine-
mapping analysis that leverages the multi-ancestry genomic diversity and pleiotropy across psychiatric disorders
to identify putative causal variants. Aim 3 will also explore the genetic “validity” of various BP-I subtypes and fit
models with joint genetic and environmental risk factors. This proposal will dramatically increase the worldwide
diversity of genetics data on BP, an important step to accelerate gene discovery in this disorder and advance
global mental health equity."
10907602,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with different subtypes likely arising from distinct precursor cells in the normal breast. What remains unknown is how we can target distinct precancerous cell types to prevent or intercept breast cancers in high-risk populations in a personalized manner. We previously combined detailed single-cell analyses of histologically normal breast tissues from patients with inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to identify aberrant cell types enriched in these cancer-prone tissues. This proposal seeks to develop models to identify new targets for breast cancer prevention in diverse high-risk states, and to help determine who would benefit from these interventions. This will be performed by combining advances in organoid culturing with single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, and multiplexed immunofluorescence studies. First, organoids will be generated from the breast tissue of patients at increased risk of developing breast cancer based on the presence of imaging-based markers, focusing on background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on MRI as an indicator of global risk of developing invasive cancer. Tissue-based and organoid-based techniques will be used to determine the cell types enriched and pathways deregulated in this disease state. Second, the tissue environment of women with DCIS in the setting of BPE who demonstrate response and nonresponse to endocrine therapies (in Project 4) will be evaluated. Third, high-risk states including young women who developed triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 40 will be evaluated for potential cancer prevention targets and deregulated pathways at the tissue level, including by the development of T cell-organoid co-culture systems to model immune surveillance. Finally, candidate prevention/ intervention strategies will be assessed in patient-derived organoid models of high-risk tissues to identify potential compounds for a future adaptive platform trial for breast cancer prevention (Project 4 aim 4). The project lead, Dr. Rosenbluth, is a breast medical oncologist with a research background in cell and cancer biology and with expertise in 3D culture models of cancer prevention. An expert team has been assembled for this project including Dr. Laura Esserman, an internationally recognized expert in breast cancer research, Dr. Laura van 't Veer, world renowned molecular biologist and inventor of MammaPrint, and Dr. Funmi Olopade, a leader in clinical cancer genetics and breast cancer prevention, as well as additional collaborators and experts in aspects of breast cancer research and in adaptive platform trials."

The goal of the KIDney Single cell and Spatial Molecular Atlas Project (KIDSSMAP) is to create an anatomical
and molecular “metaverse” of the human kidney. KIDSSMAP will accomplish this by generating multiscalar,
multidimensional and multimodal maps of the adult non-diseased human kidney at a single cell resolution. This
work will build on and extend the existing efforts of the investigative team through the first phase of HuBMAP.
We will specifically focus on micro functional tissue units (FTUs) and structures that are along the cortico-
medullary axis of the kidney. The technologies generating data include paired single nucleus chromatin
accessibility and RNA expression (snRNA/ATAC-seq -cell type and state diversity), smFISH and DART-FISH
(targeted high resolution spatial interrogation of 30-1000 transcripts), spatial transcriptomics (untargeted
genome wide spatial mapping of dissociative technologies), CODEX (multiplexed spatial protein interrogation
to bridge with RNA technologies and 3D IF technologies), 3D multiplexed immunofluorescence (3D IF-
subcellular resolution to define neighborhoods in microFTUs), lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM-
anatomical maps at mesoscale of key and 3D maps of neurovascular associations with FTUs) and Scattering
Raman Spectroscopy (SRS-2D, 3D label free volumetric mapping at subcellular scale). The maps generated
will define quantitative metrics of cell diversity, spatial defined neighborhoods across wide scales for different
types of analytes interrogated by a diverse set of single call based and spatial technologies encompassing
chromatin states, gene expression, protein, extracellular matrix, metabolites and lipids ranging from subcellular
to volumetric meso and anatomic scale. These will be further augmented by characterizing biologically diverse
(sex, age, race) samples. These tasks will be accomplished through a KIDney Organ Specific Project
(KIDOSP) and a KIDney Data Analysis Center (KIDDAC), with their outputs, milestones and delivery to the
HIVE centrally managed. KIDSSMAP is formed by the alliance of investigators who have extensive expertise in
kidney tissue interrogation, spatial mapping and data integration. The investigators have a track record of
contributing to large consortia such as HuBMAP and KPMP through fruitful and collaborative interactions. By
mapping the human kidney with its diverse functional units at high resolution and large scale, KDSSMAP will
generate a valuable resource for the community to understand kidney health and disease."
10908326,"PNETs are cancers that arise from hormone-producing cells of the pancreas. They are usually diagnosed in late stages, with few treatments available. PNETs are the second most common pancreatic cancer and are rapidly increasing in incidence. Black pNET patients have worse survival and higher rates of cancer spread associated with smaller tumors than White patients. These clinical disparities suggest a biologic difference between these two patient groups. Guidelines for treating pNETs are mostly based on data from White patients and may not apply to Black patients. Differences in cancer biology between racial groups that affect disease severity has been discovered in other cancers. Notably, there are differences in epigenetic modifications between different ethnic and racial groups. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including DNA methylation (whereby chemical groups are added to DNA to alter the generation of gene product), is an important mechanism by which environmental factors, lifestyle, and stress can affect an individual’s genes. pNETs are known to have high rates of epigenetic dysregulation. However, nothing is known about the differences in the (epi)genetics of pNETs between Black and White patients, as Black patients represent under 1% of patients included in genetic studies of pNETs. Other key differences may exist between how tumor from different patient populations interact with the normal tissue environment or the patient’s immune system. The goal of this project is to investigate the causes of the clinical outcomes differences between Black and White patients with pNETs. These differences may be at the (epi)genetic level, how the tumor interacts with surrounding cells, or environmentally influenced. The proposed research will compare the genomes and gene regulation systems between the two patient groups to find what is driving the clinical differences seen at a cellular level. This will demonstrate if the clinical outcome differences could be due to how the body keeps the tumor at bay and determine what key stressors exist today in the Black pNET patient population in the Deep South. While this study is aimed at understanding the ways in which epigenetic and gene expression changes affect pNETs in Black patients, the findings will profoundly impact the direction of both pNET treatment and research for the entire patient population."

Patients diagnosed with Stage I pancreatic cancer have a much better outcome than most
patients who present with advanced disease. The Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) study
currently follows a familial/genetic “high-risk” cohort of ~1500 patients undergo regular pancreatic
surveillance. Recent results from the CAPS program indicate that most patients who maintain regular
surveillance are down-staged, many are diagnosed with Stage I pancreatic cancer and achieve
long-term survival. Circulating tumor marker tests are not currently used for pancreas surveillance,
but we propose to evaluate blood tests for patients undergoing pancreatic surveillance. We
will evaluate the use of tumor marker gene tests to better define an individual’s tumor marker normal
reference range. We will evaluate the use of plasma MR spectroscopy as a diagnostic test that
utilizes artificial-intelligence methods to detect subtle circulating metabolic changes associated with
having pancreatic cancer. We will also determine if blood biomarker changes occur before the
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in our cohort. The addition of annual blood tests to pancreatic
surveillance is expected to improve the detection of early-stage pancreatic cancer. We will continue
to evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients in our cohort and bank biospecimens for future
biomarker studies."

Genetic discovery for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lags behind that in other areas of medicine, where the
identification of mutations responsible for familial forms of major disorders has yielded extraordinary biological
insights. However, recent successes in gene identification from both rare and common variant analyses indicate
what the field needs to do to catch up: expand the size, diversity and scope of genetic studies. Indeed, NIMH
recognized this need, issuing PAR-20-027, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in Ancestrally Diverse
Populations.” In response to this call, we will create the Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness
Association Studies (PUMAS) Project, an international collaboration of investigators from the US, South America
and Africa with the strongest track record of large-scale psychiatric genetic research in Latino and African
populations, along with several of the field’s leaders in genetic data generation and analysis. PUMAS will be well
powered to discover new genes for schizophrenia and bipolar; it will dramatically increase the diversity of genetic
discovery efforts, an important step towards reducing health disparities; and it will expand the scope of psychiatric
genomics by generating low-pass whole genome sequencing for 120,000 samples (which we will analyze
together with 22,500 samples already sequenced by our team). Through these efforts we will also discover
similarities and differences in genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and
environments. The Aims of the PUMAS project are to: 1) Build the PUMAS sample bank of schizophrenia cases,
bipolar cases and controls from Africa and from admixed populations in the Americas, achieving a total sample
of 183,500 (88,600 cases and 94,900 matched population controls) by recruiting 17,000 new cases and 16,500
controls. 2) Generate low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and variant calls on 40,000 cases of
schizophrenia, 40,000 cases of bipolar disorder and 40,000 matched controls from African, Native American and
admixed ancestries b) perform extensive sample and variant quality control. 3) a) Systematically analyze the
combined dataset to power discovery of the genetic basis of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries
and down the allele frequency spectrum; and b) through portals and browsers, share the data and results of the
genetic studies with the world. The PUMAS 120,000 sample WGS dataset, together with data for 22,500
previously sequenced admixed (AA+EA) samples, provides sufficient statistical power for genetic discovery for
SZ, BP, and combined across diverse ancestries. Our study will identify new genes and loci, increase the
precision of fine-mapping of known loci, and form the foundational knowledge base for polygenic risk scores
(PRS) of global value."

There are approximately 25 million Americans that suffer from Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, about 35 million
Americans >20 years old are diagnosed with prediabetes. More than one-third of Americans are also obese,
an incidence that has nearly tripled from 1960 to 2010. Recent studies have shown that the gut-brain axis
places a critical role in digestive and metabolic diseases. Further, direct communication between the sensory
neurons in the gut and neural reward circuits in the brain plays a crucial role in detecting chemical cues such
as hormones, satiety signals, or small molecule metabolites produced by bacteria in the gut. Chemicals in the
small intestine are detected by specialized epithelial cells that transduce chemical signals into neuronal activity
that can be interpreted by the central nervous system. An ingestible device that supersedes chemical cues and
stimulates sensory neurons directly using electronic pulses could mimic the chemical milieu in the gut that is
associated with healthy metabolic and digestive states. Spatiotemporal control of intraluminal sensory nerve
stimulation in the gut could with help us understand the link between chemical signaling in the digestive system
and neural circuits in the brain that are modulated by the gut-brain axis. Here we propose an ingestible
electronic device with flexible electrodes that can pace sensory nerve activity in the gut of a pig model.
Physiological responses will be measured, and brain activity will be monitored using fMRI. Initially, this project
will validate this proof-of-concept using tethered electrodes in porcine subjects. Specifically, sensory neurons
in the gut will be paced using biomimetic waveforms that will simulate fed or fasted states in porcine subjects
while brain activity will be measured simultaneously using fMRI. These results will help us understand the
connection between gustatory signaling, sensory nerve activity, and neural reward circuits in the brain such as
satiety. In the future, we will design a fully autonomous smart pill with an on-board power supply and circuitry
that selectively and non-invasively stimulate or block the activity of sensory neurons in the gut of human
subjects. If successfully, this smart pill could serve as a low-risk device-based approach to help understand
and potentially treat digestive and metabolic disorders of the gut-brain axis such as obesity and diabetes."

 Marijuana is now the most commonly used illicit drug in pregnancy. The main psychoactive compound of
marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can access and bind to cannabinoid receptors in the placenta
and fetal brain. Preliminary data suggest that prenatal cannabinoid exposure results in epigenetic changes in
the placenta and brains of exposed offspring. This is concerning because the placenta plays a key role in fetal
growth and development by mediating fetal nutrition, oxygenation, inflammatory signaling, and transmission of
maternal environmental exposures. Compromises to placental function can adversely affect brain development.
Epigenetic responses to maternal marijuana use likely result in molecular alterations in gene regulation of
offspring developmental trajectories towards neurodevelopmental morbidity, including addiction, autism
spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive disabilities. Specifically, prenatal THC
exposure is known to alter reward processing, by histone modification of ventral striatal dopaminergic signaling,
affecting addiction vulnerability. However, a mechanistic link between maternal THC use and its impact on
offspring epigenetic regulation of neurodevelopment is impeded by the lack of in vivo longitudinal assessment
secondary to the limitations of current imaging capabilities and feasibility of tissue sampling. We propose to
address this problem by defining a trajectory of perturbed epigenetic regulation following in utero THC exposure
across fetal and early childhood brain and behavioral development. To this end, we will employ three innovative
and complementary approaches using our novel, non-human primate model of chronic maternal THC use: 1)
first-in-kind, longitudinal in vivo imaging of placental and fetal epigenetic regulation and development, 2)
extensive postnatal assessment of infant cognition and behavior, and 3) sophisticated tissue studies confirming
the role of epigenetic modifications in the imaging and behavioral studies. In summary, our study will interrogate
the previously inaccessible mechanistic links underlying the impact of maternal marijuana use on fetal origins of
health, disease and addiction risk. The successful completion of our study will result in 1) new insights into the
impact of maternal THC use on the developing fetal and infant brain, 2) the impact of THC-induced epigenetic
alterations on trajectories of offspring neurodevelopment and behavioral regulation 3) the creation of a
comprehensive, longitudinal in vivo map of offspring epigenetic regulation of neurodevelopment from fetal life to
early childhood, and 4) characterization of ex vivo epigenetic and transcriptomic assessments that can be used
as a reference for other drugs of abuse and environmental exposures. This study has the potential for immediate
translational impact, given the high prevalence of prenatal and postnatal marijuana use and limited data on
longer-term offspring outcomes and contribution to drug addiction. The study’s ultimate goal is to provide
appropriate guidance for women using marijuana who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are lactating, and
for clinicians to consider early intervention and screening of offspring exposed prenatally to marijuana."
10908443,"The multi-layered epidermis provides an essential barrier against water loss, physical insults, and infection. Its
proper function requires that architectural features be polarized along its entire apical to basal axis. Contributing
to the inherent tissue polarity of the epidermis are seven desmosomal cadherins, intercellular adhesion
molecules that provide mechanical integrity to tissues by anchoring intermediate filaments to the plasma
membrane. Of these, desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) appeared late in evolution along with expansion of epidermal
functions to meet the challenges of life on land. We showed that Dsg1, which is first expressed as cells commit
to differentiate and transit into the suprabasal layers, acts as a scaffold that engages the actin cytoskeleton and
signaling mediators necessary for tissue morphogenesis and terminal differentiation. To achieve these functions
Dsg1 must be properly routed by intracellular trafficking machinery to its final address at the plasma membrane.
Its failure to accumulate on the plasma membrane disrupts organismal homeostasis in patients with the systemic
inflammatory disorder, Severe dermatitis, Allergies and Metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome, a syndrome we
helped identify. We identified two critical elements of the trafficking machinery required for Dsg1 function-- a
specific dynein microtubule motor complex and an endosomal sorting complex called the retromer, best known
to be involved in neurodegenerative
the
amount,
disorders. that in keratinocytes committing to differentiate,
 retromer/dynein machinery ensures Dsg1 gets to the right plasma membrane “address” and in the right
to mediate a switch from EGFR signaling to actin remodeling
We hypothesize
that drives changes in cell mechanics and
signaling necessary for morphogenesis and immune regulation. We will use optical imaging, biochemistry, and
genetic interference in human 2D and 3D organotypic cultures, human patient materials, and knockout mouse
models to: 1) Define how the retromer and dynein trafficking machinery ensures Dsg1's functional placement on
the plasma membrane necessary to promote the epithelial basal to suprabasal transition, and evaluate the utility
of retromer chaperones as a therapeutic strategy to enhance epidermal stratification and differentiation in vitro
and in vivo; 2) Determine how Dsg1 coordinates a switch from EGFR signaling to actin remodeling by engaging
the actin nucleation promoting factors N-WASP and Arp2/3 to drive cell mechanics necessary for stratification in
vitro and in vivo; and 3) Address the extent to which Dsg1 governs redistribution of actin remodeling factors to
control epidermal immune regulation and expression of IL-23, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that increases in SAM
syndrome caused by loss of Dsg1 function. These studies will establish how Dsg1 coordinates rearrangements
of the cytoskeleton with the biochemical program of differentiation while keeping inflammatory cytokines in check.
Understanding how Dsg1 dynamics and downstream signaling are impacted in skin disorders will be essential
for developing new ways to repair and strengthen physical and immune barriers of epithelia."

Neurotrauma, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI), impacts over 60 million people
per year globally with an estimated fiscal burden of $400 B/year. The National Neurotrauma Society (NNS) is
committed to the promotion of neurotrauma research by enhancing communication, providing a forum for
scientific exchange, and increasing national and international support for neurotrauma research and clinical
advances. Every year, the society holds a symposium to meet this goal and provide a forum for researchers,
clinicians, and trainees from around the world to meet and discuss the latest breakthroughs to improve the
lives of individuals living with TBI and SCI related disability. The 41st Annual Neurotrauma Symposium,
jointly sponsored by the NNS and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of
Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Section on Neurotrauma and Critical Care will be held in San
Francisco, CA, June 9 - June 14, 2024. This meeting will focus on showcasing the latest technological
innovations in the neurotrauma field while celebrating the foundational biomedical research that continues to
influence emerging knowledge and tools to improve neurotrauma research and clinical care. Broad objectives of
the Symposium include: 1) updating attendees on current and timely topics in basic and clinical neurotrauma,
2) facilitating exchange of information among participants, 3) building new scientific collaborations, with a
foundation in rigor, reproducibility, transparency, and translation, and 4) fostering active engagement of
trainees and young investigators through our travel awards, poster competition, data blitz oral presentations,
workshops and activities developed and supported by the Training, Education and Mentoring (TEAM)
Committee. NIH funding for previous NNS Symposia has provided invaluable support for scientific sessions
and for enhancing our ability to reach graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, residents, and young
investigators. NIH support helps the NNS to provide travel awards to continue to promote trainee attendance,
including underrepresented minorities (URM), women, and persons with disabilities. This application seeks
funding to support 30 pre-and-postdoctoral trainees to present their ongoing work, attend scientific sessions,
and to network with peers and faculty. Of the 30 trainees, at least 10 will meet the NIH definition of persons
underrepresented in the biomedical workforce, including URMs, women, and individuals with disabilities as the
society strives to continue to promote and retain diversity. In addition, we request support for programming for
trainee and young investigator development sessions, sponsored by the TEAM Committee. Finally, we request
support to continue our unique Local Scholars Program (LSP), successfully initiated in 2022, which provides
support for undergraduate students who come from under- served backgrounds and who attend local
universities to attend the NNS Symposium, and receive specific training to promote interest in careers in
neurotrauma and neuroscience research."

The next Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Optogenetic Approaches to Understanding Neural Circuits
and Behavior will convene in Lucca (Barga), Italy, on July 21-26, 2024. This will be the fourth time that this
international conference brings together the diverse community of scientists using optogenetics to interrogate
brain function with the overall goal of fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment for scientific
exchange. The optogenetics community is comprised of tool developers and users, experimentalists and
theorists, bioengineers, clinicians, and basic scientists. The optogenetics toolbox has rapidly expanded and
allows researchers to alter activity in genetically defined cell types and pathways, to mimic neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators and monitor the activity of intracellular processes. While such rapid progress in the field
has brought a wealth of tools and techniques into the hands of researchers, the field faces the challenge of
defining best practices and rigorous standards to ensure proper experimental study design and data
interpretation. These issues are of paramount importance as the field witnesses a transition from bench to
bedside with the translation of optogenetic tools to treat human disease. The Optogenetics GRC places as
much value on encouraging speakers to discuss details regarding techniques and implementation as it does on
highlighting exciting study outcomes. The major aims of the conference are to (1) expose participants to
emerging optogenetic tools, gene targeting approaches, and optical innovations, (2) highlight innovative
applications and translation of optogenetic approaches, (3) feature recent research innovations from junior
scientists, (4) support networking opportunities to enhance trainee learning, mentorship, inclusion, and
professional development. To meet these goals, the conference will feature a diverse platform of scientific
sessions that include keynote speakers and established investigators as well as junior investigators in the
earliest stages of their careers. Beyond the scientific sessions, the meeting will include dedicated mentoring
activities for junior investigators and a GRC Power Hour to discuss issues facing women and
underrepresented groups. The GRC will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which provides a
unique opportunity for junior investigators to engage in scientific discussion before attending the GRC."

This competitive renewal application proposes to continue our program to provide comprehensive, integrated 
training in dental and craniofacial research at the University of Iowa (UI) to a cohort of basic, clinical, and 
translational researchers and dental scholars. It will provide dentists and non-dentists with a 
comprehensive skillset to meet the challenges of oral health research in academia for the 21st century. 
Outstanding interdisciplinary didactic training and rigorous research mentoring will emphasize ongoing review 
and critique. The proposed program builds on 37 years of research training success, with several major 
enhancements listed briefly below. The program addresses 7 major research training areas: 1) Craniofacial, 
Oral Biology, Genetics, and Dental Development; 2) Bioengineering, Tissue Engineering, Stem Cells, 
Biomaterials, and Materials; 3) Immunology, Inflammation, Microbiology, Caries, and Microbiome; 4) Oral 
Cancer; 5) Public Health, Epidemiology, and Behavioral Sciences; 6) Oral Health Policy; and 7) Clinical, 
Translational, and Big Data Research, reflecting the strengths of the College of Dentistry, UI health science 
colleges, and collaborative institutes and centers. Trainees in the proposed program will pursue a PhD in Oral 
Science (or in one of the 13 other affiliated PhD programs) or a post-doctoral fellowship. In addition, trainees 
now will be able to obtain a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching, Biostatistics, or Translational and Clinical 
Investigation or an MS in Dental Public Health. The T90 will support 4 non-dentist predocs and 2 dentists for 
the PhD (3 years each) and 1 non-dentist postdoc (2 years). The R90 component reflects the importance 
international dentists have in U.S. oral health research programs and will support 2 dentists for the PhD (3 
years each). A group of 28 experienced program faculty from a variety of disciplines is available to mentor 
trainees. The success of our program over the past 4+ years is seen in 5 trainees receiving F- or K-awards 
since 2019 and trainees’ successful career placement. To build on this success, we propose several 
improvements/new major components of this Oral Health Research Institutional Training Program. The 
successful Grant-Writing Workshop Series has been updated and enhanced. Additionally, we propose several 
new programs, including ones in Research Rigor, Research Leadership Development, and Interdisciplinary 
Faculty Mentoring. Training will be supervised by the experienced Director and Associate Director and 
implemented in concert with a Faculty Leadership Team. Several committees will support the program:
internal and external advisory committees, importantly a Committee on Recruitment and Diversity, and other 
component-specific committees. In summary, the program brings together productive, well-funded mentors 
with pre- and post-doctoral trainees in an environment with a strong institutional commitment, outstanding 
interdisciplinary research training in relevant disciplines, and excellent educational and research facilities. The 
outcome will be a cadre of oral health researchers ready to function at the cutting edge of their disciplines."
10938682,"SUMMARY
 Alveolar tissues must maintain proper cellular organization to perform vital functions such as gas-
exchange at homeostasis and during repair. In human lungs, type-1 alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), a key cell
type that serves as a barrier and facilitates gas exchange, are extremely thin, large, and estimated to cover
95% of the surface. Aging, genetic alterations, metabolic dysregulation, and environmental exposures, all are
well recognized etiological factors in fatal lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, are
known to impair replenishment of AT1 cells after injury. Significant progress has been made in understanding
the pathways controlling differentiation of type-2 alveolar epithelial cell (AT2) into AT1s after injury. Currently
we lack a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating proper establishment and
maintenance of AT1 cellular organization (ex: thickness, area) during repair after injury and how they intersect
with age-related genetic alterations and cellular dysfunction remain elusive.
 Here, we identified MAPT (microtubule associated protein, also known as Tau) as a key regulator that
is essential for AT2 to AT1 cell differentiation and AT1 cellular organization. Significantly, this co-insides with
recent genome-wide association studies that identified potential risk variants in MAPT in COPD and
pulmonary fibrosis patients. Using genetic loss of function and dysfunctional Tau mutants, our preliminary
data suggested a key role for Tau in AT1 cellular organization by regulating microtubule bundles and
mitochondrial dynamics during lung repair in young and aged lungs. We hypothesize that Tau mediated
microtubule bundling and mitochondrial dynamics control proper differentiation of AT2s into large
and thin AT1 cells and that Tau mutations or its age-associated abnormal phosphorylation impairs
mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and function during alveolar repair after injury.
 The major goals of this proposal are: In Aim1, we will test the requirement of Tau and consequences
of expression of a human relevant pathological form of Tau in alveolar stem cell mediated regeneration. In
Aim2, we will test the hypothesis that genetic loss or age associated dysfunctional Tau impairs alveolar
epithelial cell microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial remodeling, and function. We will use genetic loss of
function, tubulin and mitochondrial reporter mouse models, confocal and electron microscopy, pulmonary
function tests, RNA-seq, co-cultures, live imaging, metabolic assays to assess cellular organization,
microtubule and mitochondrial dynamics during lung regeneration in young and aged mice following Tau
modulation. The outcomes from the proposed studies will have broader impact on lung regenerative medicine
and will form the basis for development of therapeutics to lung diseases."

Violence is the leading cause of mortality among US children. In Chicago, violence disproportionately affects
children of color on the South and West sides, with studies documenting community violence exposure as high
as 85% in some neighborhoods. Research also shows that social, economic, and health inequities, such as
poverty and lack of access to quality health and educational resources, increase the risk of violence. Sustained
community violence exposure has a detrimental impact on youth’s overall well-being, reducing school
engagement, encouraging maladaptive behaviors, and eroding mental health. Therefore, it is critical to develop
and implement violence prevention interventions that address the social, economic, educational, and health
factors that exacerbate youth involvement in community violence. Such efforts must reach across all levels of
the social-ecological model, moving beyond individual and interpersonal focused interventions to address the
upstream structural factors that impact violence. Research shows that community health workers (CHWs) can
apply their expertise to prevent violence by serving as a nexus between families and social and health
services. Also, legal assistance can be used to address structural inequities that contribute to community
violence, as seen in medical-legal partnerships. Thus, this project’s objective is to evaluate a novel youth
violence prevention program that combines CHWs and legal assistance to address structural inequities—
Community Health Advocates in Mitigating and Preventing Violence (CHAMP-V) with and without Legal Aid
Wraparound (LAW). We hypothesize that community health advocacy and legal advocacy can work
synergistically to reduce violent behavior and improve educational outcomes by holistically addressing social,
economic, education, and health-related needs of middle school youth and their families. To test this
hypothesis, we will conduct a cluster randomized trial comparing the two intervention groups. In Aim 1, we will
adapt the CHW and legal aid interventions to ensure relevance to school settings using a community-driven
approach that engages parents/guardians and school principals/staff through focus groups and interviews. Aim
2 will evaluate the effectiveness of CHAMP-V versus CHAMP-V+LAW on violence-related and educational
outcomes, using primary survey data as well as administrative data from the Chicago Police Department and
Chicago Public Schools. Aim 3 will examine implementation factors and mechanisms by which the
interventions promote change in social, economic, educational, and health needs that impact youth violence,
using service delivery logs and interviews. Results from this study will provide rigorous evidence about the
effect of CHW and legal advocacy strategies to prevent community violence for middle school youth and their
families, while offering a scalable approach that targets all levels of the social-ecological model. Further, by
addressing structural causes of violence, such programs are vital to help interrupt the cycle of stress, trauma,
and violence that contribute to racial health, education, and mortality disparities in communities."

The Zhu lab uses synthetic chemistry to answer questions related to post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
proteins, specifically, O-glycosylation and Tyrosine sulfation. Co-localization of Tyrosine sulfation and O-
glycosylation on Serine/Threonine (CSOG) is an emerging global PTM pattern. CSOG exists in a variety of
proteins, like G-protein coupled receptors, proteins of the hemostatic system, pathogen encoded proteins, and
adhesion molecules. CSOG plays critical roles in modulating the binding/signaling networks through those
proteins and their binding ligands/proteins. However, detailed information about how the cells or biological
systems use fine-tuning CSOG structures to modulate corresponding binding/signaling pathways is lacking. One
of the main gaps for studying the relationship is the lack of structure-defined molecules bearing CSOG. To fill up
the gap, a generalized strategy is needed to synthesize those molecules so we can get access to the massive,
diversified structures of CSOG. Then we can map out the relationship between the fine-tuning structures of
CSOG and their corresponding binding/signaling pathways. We can also use these structure-defined molecules
to develop reliable methods for characterizing CSOG from different proteins. Furthermore, we can combine
synthetic chemistry and computational chemistry to develop robust computational chemistry methods for
predicting meaningful bindings and designing probes/molecules to target certain specific bindings.
Our lab currently focuses on applying site-selective sulfation in chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycopeptides to
provide a generalized strategy for the access to the complex molecules with CSOG. Towards this goal, our lab
developed a Ag2O promoted method for large-scale synthesis of the two critical intermediates, GalN3-α-Fmoc-
Ser/Thr, for future synthesis of all the needed 16 glyco-amino acids. We have achieved the synthesis of core 2
containing glyco-amino acid in gram scale. For site-selective sulfation, we developed 2-Cl-trityl protecting group
as a new way for doing site-selective sulfation. For enzymatic extension of O-glycans on sulfoglycopeptides, our
initial attempt demonstrated that the enzyme worked on the sulfoglycopeptide even with protecting groups on
the sulfate groups. We expect to generalize this strategy to synthesize libraries of sulfoglycopeptides in this
proposal.
This MIRA funding will support us to use our generalized synthetic strategy to initiate the following major projects:
(1) Build compound libraries to map out the complex network between COSG patterns and corresponding
binding/signaling pathways; (2) Use structure-defined molecules with CSOG to develop reliable methods to
characterize CSOG structures from different proteins; (3) Use our binding data and computational methods to
develop robust computational chemistry methods to predict meaningful binding and design probes/molecules to
target specific bindings."

The systemic amyloidoses are a family of non-cerebral, protein misfolding disorders in which amyloidogenic
precursor proteins aggregate into well-ordered amyloid fibrils that deposit in the extracellular space of organs
and tissues. Progressive fibril deposition leads to progressive organ dysfunction, severe morbidity, and death.
Current treatment modalities focus on inhibiting the synthesis of amyloidogenic precursor proteins resulting in
prolonged patient survival but are not curative. Unfortunately, these therapeutic approaches are susceptible to
refractory amyloidogenic protein synthesis and do not address the removal of preexisting protein deposits
which cause the organ dysfunction and morbidity. It is well established that amyloid burden inversely correlates
with disease outcomes; therefore, curative interventions will likely involve combinatorial approaches targeting
both precursor protein production and the removal of amyloid deposits. Several immunotherapeutic
approaches (i.e., antibody-based therapeutics) have been designed to stimulate immune-mediated clearance
of amyloid, but these therapies have yet to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. However, such therapeutics
would not be necessary if the body was capable of naturally removing amyloid deposits. Here, we take a step
back to address the underlying question as to why amyloid fibrils are not typically removed by the body.
Recently, we demonstrated that collagen-1 is capable of inhibiting macrophage uptake of amyloid and that in
patients diagnosed with various types of amyloidosis, collagen-1 colocalizes with amyloid fibrils in vivo.
Together, these data and additional preliminary data support our hypothesis that amyloid-associated
collagen prevents recognition of tissue amyloid by the immune system thereby hindering amyloid
clearance. We propose three specific aims to investigate the process of collagen-mediated amyloid protection
and assess potential therapeutic strategies. Preliminary data indicate that blocking the CD36 scavenger
receptor inhibits macrophage uptake of amyloid akin to collagen mediated inhibition. Therefore, in Aim 1 we
will interrogate the CD36-amyloid-collagen relationship through cellular knockout approaches. We will also
determine if other amyloid associated proteins can limit macrophage uptake of amyloid. Next in Aims 2 and 3
we propose two distinct approaches to locally degrade collagen within amyloid masses. In Aim 2 we will deliver
matrix metalloproteinases to amyloidogenic regions by coupling MMP-1 and/or MMP-9 to our amyloid binding
peptides. In Aim 3, we seek to immunoform amyloidogenic regions and stimulate cells within the amyloid
environment to locally express collagen degrading enzymes and immune activating proteins. We will fuse
proteins proven to induce MMP expression and immune activation (e.g., C3a, C5a, or Substance P) to the p5R
amyloid binding peptide. We will determine the ability of both peptide fusion strategies to induce collagen
degradation within amyloid lesions and immune activation. Overall, our goal is to interrogate how collagen
limits immune cell functions and enhance amyloid clearance by locally degrading amyloid-associated collagen."

Every day, adult humans create and destroy tens of billions of cells. We know that imbalances in tissue
homeostasis can lead to too many new cells, such as in tumorigenesis, and disruptions in dying cell clearance
can cause inflammation, tissue damage, and autoimmune conditions. In species with the ability to regenerate
from acute injury, waves of cell death are observed and are thought trigger appropriate levels of proliferation
and inflammation. While decades of work have elucidated the pathways of cell death and corpse clearance
during animal development, together called efferocytosis, relatively little is known about the dynamics of cell
corpses in adult tissues or how efferocytosis machinery may function in the regeneration process. Major
outstanding questions include: are cell corpses digested in place, or are they physically removed from
tissues?; what cells do the engulfing in a given context?; and what happens to tissue turnover and
regeneration when engulfment genes are disrupted?
To uncover mechanisms of cell corpse clearance in adult regenerative animals, we utilize the complementary
advantages of two model systems: planarians and zebrafish. The freshwater planarian, a flatworm from the
phylum Platyhelminthes, has significant advantages to studying gene function in adult stem cell biology and
regeneration in vivo. On the other hand, zebrafish are one of the best genetic models of regeneration and
provide direct vertebrate relevance and the ability to watch cellular processes using transgenic lines. When
combined, planarians and zebrafish can be used for gene discovery and genetic mechanisms of regeneration.
In the current proposal, we developed a way to selectively kill off multiple cell types in planarians and can
observe those cells transit from the periphery of the animal and be excreted through the gut. In our supporting
data, we show that the gene engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) is required to clear cell corpses, but we do
not understand how or through what cell types. Further, we developed a model of spinal cord regeneration
using zebrafish, and show that multiple elmo genes are expressed in phagocytic immune cells as well as cell
types in the spinal cord. Building on these data, in AIM 1, we will test how different cell types in planarians use
the ELMO pathway to clear cell corpses in several contexts. In AIM 2, we will identify feedback signals from
dying cells to stem cells and test how ELMO functions during regeneration. In AIM 3, we will use our zebrafish
model of spinal cord regeneration to test how the ELMO pathway functions in cell corpse clearance and
regenerative outcomes. Given that the ELMO pathway is highly conserved, our work will illuminate
fundamental aspects of how defects in cell clearance influence regeneration outcomes and stem cell
proliferation control, which will have high relevance to multiple human diseases."

Synapses, the connections between neurons, play a crucial role in determining circuit connectivity and function.
Visualizing their structure and dynamics is challenging due to the vast number of synapses and the complex
interactions between them. Prior studies have explored some aspects of synaptic plasticity, primarily focusing
on postsynaptic neurons and utilizing imaging techniques to observe dendritic spines, which are widely
recognized as key synaptic structures. Nevertheless, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of
how these changes are linked to their specific input sources, leaving the identity of these synapses largely
uncharted. To overcome this limitation, researchers have developed dual-component synapse detectors, like the
neurexin-neuroligin complex and split fluorescent proteins. However, split fluorescent proteins have limitations,
such as slow maturation and irreversible associations, hindering real-time synaptic observation. To address
these challenges, we developed a reversible fluorescent sensor technology using dimerization-dependent
fluorescent proteins (ddFPs) named SynapShot. These ddFPs emit fluorescence only when they heterodimerize,
which happens quickly and reversibly. With this technique, we successfully monitored synaptic dynamics in real
time, including synaptic formation and elimination, as indicated by changes in dendritic spine size. We also
distinguished connections from one postsynaptic neuron to multiple presynaptic neurons. In this proposal, we
will further explore the uncharted territory of synaptic dynamics in both local and long-range circuits in in vivo
setups. In the first aim, we will investigate the functional implications of synaptic labeling detected by the
SynapShot. Synaptic plasticity will be tested in single dendritic spines to demonstrate the ability of tracking
structural changes in real-time. In the second aim, we will explore inhibitory synaptic connections, especially
those involving genetically-defined interneuron cell types, using the SynapShot method. In the third aim, we will
employ synapShot to observe synaptic changes during the acquisition of a new learning task, study dendritic
integration dynamics, and examine the rules governing connections among engram neurons. In summary,
SynapShot provides a means to observe bidirectional changes in synaptic contacts both in vitro and in vivo and
can differentiate distinct populations of synapses when used in dual-colored configurations. This platform
contributes to understanding the relationship between time-dependent synaptic structure changes and various
brain functions and diseases. The successful completion of this project promises to be a valuable asset in
advancing the field of neural circuit research."

Emerging and rapidly progressing technologies can now measure the molecular phenotypes of genes,
transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and gut microbiota. These omics data provide an unprecedented level
of granularity into both clinical and biological measurements, showing great promise to understand
biological mechanisms governing human health and disease, and to uncover the underlying hetero-
geneities that contribute to disease manifestations. However, many statistical methods used for analysis
of omics data only establish associations. These associations may merely represent correlates or con-
sequences of disease processes, and thus may not reveal disease mechanisms or guide therapeutics
and clinical care. On the other hand, existing causal inference methods are not adequately equipped
to handle the high dimensionality, correlation, and complexity of omics data. The goal of this project
is to develop new statistical methods for causal inference that integrate large-scale omics data and im-
plement them in user-friendly open-source software. We will develop a new framework that broadens
the scope of mediation analysis to jointly analyze high-dimensional omics mediators, through novel ap-
plications of two powerful ideas in statistics and machine learning: sufﬁcient dimension reduction and
variational autoencoders. The proposed framework can identify a disentangled representation of key
mediation pathways, effectively distilling vital signals from large-scale omics mediators. Moreover, we
will develop robust and scalable multivariable Mendelian randomization methods for large-scale omics
measures, and then extend these methods to identify shared risk pathways across multiple outcomes.
Lastly, we will introduce a novel framework for testing the pairwise causal directions between two omics
modalities (e.g., microbiome and metabolites) by leveraging the asymmetry in temporally-ordered data.
To maximize the impact of the proposed methods, we will develop and maintain open-source software
for our methods, and integrate our proposed Mendelian randomization methods into two state-of-the-art
platforms (MR-Base and MendelianRandomization). This project aims to address the need for robust,
rigorous, and computationally efﬁcient causal inference in large-scale omics data, and ultimately trans-
form the potential of massive biomedical data into trustworthy, actionable, and generalizable knowledge
to solve public health challenges."

BRONX-EINSTEIN TRAINING IN TEACHING AND RESEARCH (BETTR) – IRACDA program facilitates
Einstein's mission to support training in teaching and research at the undergraduate level and to encourage
students from diverse backgrounds to pursue a career in science. The goals of the BETTR program are to train
highly qualified scholars in teaching, science and career strategies to allow them to become successful
scientist-educators. We will accomplish this through our ongoing highly collaborative program with our partner
Hispanic/Minority-serving institutions and enhance research collaborations, revitalize the science curriculum of
the partner institutions and, thereby attract and encourage underrepresented minority undergraduates to
pursue science careers. Our BETTR program is a four-year postdoctoral program, which couples training in
independent research at Einstein with training in innovative teaching techniques and mentored teaching at our
two neighboring partner institutions in the Bronx, each minority-serving. Our program consists of 8 scholars in
cadres of 2-3 in each year where 3 years are funded by the IRACDA program, and one year by the research
mentor. At the start of the program, scholars will develop “roadmap for success”, which is an individual 3-year
plan with goals and yearly expectations to achieve a career in academia. In year one of the BETTR program,
scholars will be immersed at Einstein establishing their research project in the laboratory of their research
mentor. During the second year, scholars will take a pedagogy course and have a formal teaching shadowing
experience at both Hostos and Lehman. During the third and fourth years in the program, scholars will develop
teaching skills at both of our partner institutions while developing curricula, and preparing for an independent
career in academia. Scholars will work to achieve research excellence by actively pursuing their own research
projects, presenting at scientific conferences, and attending research-focused workshops, all of which
culminate in the submission of a career development grant application. Scholars will share their research
expertise at Hostos and Lehman through mentoring undergraduate students. In parallel, scholars are expected
to gain teaching skills aligned with the learning styles of minority populations in urban settings. In addition,
research collaborations at all three institutions will be facilitated through our joint Master's program and
collaborative opportunities for both students and faculty. Throughout the program, scholars will be involved in
research skill development, grant writing, and career development activities to prepare them to be outstanding
scientist educators to future generations. Over the last ten years, we have made significant strides in
increasing the number of underrepresented minorities at Einstein, of students from Lehman doing research at
Einstein and anticipate additional increases in these numbers through our new joint Master's program with
Lehman. Our scholars also obtain positions in academia at higher levels compared to other fellows at Einstein.
With our new plan, we anticipate that there will be increases in all of these outcomes in the next project period."
10940801,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal will exploit the unique and latent features of radical-mediated migrations to underpin new synthetic
transformations designed to facilitate the discovery and manufacture of medicines. Using this approach, we aim
to make significant advances in olefin difunctionalizations and stereoselective α-functionalizations of carbonyls.
These reaction classes have enormous potential in pharmaceutical synthesis, but technical complications with
their transition-metal catalysts have restricted the products they can directly access. To address these limitations,
we will develop new conceptual platforms that promote these transformations and are compatible with
medicinally valuable motifs that have heretofore presented challenges. In the context of olefin alkyl–arylation
and amino–arylation, we have shown that a radical-migration-based design affords clear improvements over
established strategies. Using this approach, our alkyl–arylation protocol enables (1) the use of mono- to
tetrasubstituted olefins without activating or directing groups, (2) alkylation with diversifiable partners, (3) the
formation of quaternary benzylic centers, (4) the broad use of N-rich heteroaromatic groups, and (5) good
diastereocontrol. All five of these key outcomes are nearly unprecedented in metal-catalyzed alkyl–arylations of
unbiased olefins, and they result directly from the method’s radical-migration-based design. Amino–arylation
features similar advantages. Future work will comprehensively demonstrate the utility of these methods, develop
more accessible reagents, and the introduce a further suite of amino–functionalization reactions. We will also
translate this open-shell approach to the stereoselective α-functionalization of carbonyls. In this setting, we will
develop and implement simple ‘chiral chaperones’ that are well-poised to deliver aromatics and other key
functional groups to the α-position of carbonyl compounds after a radical-generation step. Since these
transformations have struggled to introduce N-rich heteroaryl groups stereoselectively – a task for which radical-
mediated migrations hold particular promise – this approach will unlock access to a broad range of stereodefined
carbonyls bearing these privileged pharmacophores, in addition to α- and β-amino acids."

 The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computa-
tional tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of human microbiome and shotgun metagenomic data motivated by
important biological questions and experiments. As we move to the next phase of microbiome research, it has become
increasingly evident that lack of methods suitable for analyzing such large-scale microbiome data has emerged as a
bottleneck to effectively understand the functions and dynamics of microbiota. There is a pressing need to develop
statistical and computational methods for large-scale shotgun metagenomics data analysis in order to accelerate in-
novations in microbiome data science. This project aims at narrowing this gap by developing new statistical models,
novel inference procedures, and fast computational algorithms. The speciﬁc aims of the current project focus on two
important aspects of microbiome data analysis: (1) developing new statistical methods and fast computational algo-
rithms for phylogenomic-based analysis of metagenomic sequencing data in large-scale human microbiome studies;
(2) developing statistical methods and inference procedures for quantifying and comparing the potential energy land-
scape and stability of microbial communities. Under each of these two broad aims, several related statistical methods
will be developed to address the key questions of how to perform phylogenomics-based microbiome analysis and how
to quantify and link microbial community stability to disease risk and progression. These problems are all motivated by
the PI's close collaborations with Penn investigators on metagenomic studies of Crohn disease, childhood obesity and
disease progression among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)). Speciﬁcally, this project will develop meth-
ods for phylogenomics-based association analysis using a set of universal marker genes, phylogenetic-Ising models
and change-point phylogenetic-Ising models for assessing the microbial community energy landscape and stability,
and time-invariant Ising models for understand consensus taxon-taxon interactions based on longitudinal microbiome
studies. The new methods can be applied to both 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing data and will
ideally facilitate the identiﬁcations of microbial composition, community stability and microbial networks underlying var-
ious complex human diseases and biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and
efﬁciencies of these methods and compare them with existing methods. Finally, this project will develop practical and
feasible computer programs for the implementation of the proposed methods, and for the evaluation of the performance
of these methods through extensive simulations and analysis of various on-going microbiome studies through the PI's
collaborations with Penn physicians and biologists. All programs developed under this grant and detailed documenta-
tion will be incorporated into our current software and made available free-of-charge to interested researchers."
10911171,"My laboratory has pioneered new research directions in environmental carcinogenesis for the
past 25 years. We identified new targets for chemical carcinogens, new functions for “old” tumor
suppressor genes, and elucidated the first mechanism by which environmental exposures during
development could reprogram the epigenome to increase cancer risk in adulthood. It is my goal
to continue to advance the field of cancer research by tackling challenging questions, rather than
performing incremental research, which while safe, does little to “move the needle”. My objective
for obtaining this R35 Outstanding Investigator Award is to focus my efforts on an exciting new
discovery, which represents a paradigm shift in how we look at chromatin remodeler defects in
cancer. As an unexpected off-shoot of our research on how environmental carcinogens reprogram
the epigenome, we discovered a new function for the cell’s epigenetic machinery, and a new way
for defects in chromatin remodeler genes to drive cancer. The Overarching Hypothesis for this
R35 application is that the coding machinery known for “reading, writing and erasing”
epigenetic methyl marks on chromatin plays a second, equally important but heretofore
unappreciated, coding function “reading, writing and erasing” methyl marks on the
cytoskeleton. We reported (Park et al Cell 2016), and support with additional Preliminary Data,
that many chromatin remodelers are actually dual-function proteins, participating in both the
Histone Code of chromatin, and the Tubulin Code of microtubules. This insight sets the stage for
a new paradigm, wherein the cell’s methylation machinery serves two coding functions, one on
chromatin and one on the cytoskeleton. It opens new frontiers for understanding how cells utilize
and regulate one machinery with two distinct, but equally important coding functions. This is of
special importance for cancer research, as we have been blind to the fact that defects in chromatin
remodeler genes can directly impact the cytoskeleton, for example, via mitotic spindle defects
that drive genomic instability and cytoskeletal defects that alter mobility to promote metastasis.
The experiments proposed in this application are designed to open new doors for understanding
the impact of chromatin remodeler defects in cancer, and for the development of therapies with
efficacy against both the epigenetic and cytoskeletal alterations caused by defects in genes that
encode dual-function chromatin-cytoskeleton remodelers."
10911173,"Black women experience much higher breast cancer mortality than any other race/ethnic group in the US.
Despite extensive investigation, the known causes to date do not adequately explain this mortality gap. Largely
missing in the disparities literature is a rigorous examination of systemic racism – i.e., how exposure to an
overarching environment of systemic racism (SR) might impact breast cancer outcomes in Black women.
Multiple lines of evidence, when considered together, indicate this exposure merits investigation. SR (e.g.,
perceived discrimination, residential segregation) is associated with a range of adverse health effects in
Blacks, and chronic psychosocial stress due to SR can become embodied via hyperactivation of the
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to inflammatory, metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation.
Thus, we hypothesize that exposure to SR leads to alterations in key biological pathways, which in turn
contribute to excess breast cancer mortality in Black women. No empirical study has directly tested this
hypothesis in a single cohort. To address this gap, we will generate a new prospective cohort with 2,498
incident breast cancer and 2,678 sub-cohort random sample from two parent cohorts -- the REasons for
Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) and Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS)
cohorts. Both parent cohorts over sampled Blacks and include participants from southern states with a history
of SR and obtained extensive baseline and biomarker data, enabling us to measure biomarkers of
inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. We will newly assess measures of SR at the structural and
interpersonal levels and characterize epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Our study will conduct the first
thorough prospective evaluation of the distinct influence of SR, above and beyond other racially pattered risk
factors, on breast cancer disparities in a large, diverse cohort. By quantifying the distinct impact of SR on
breast cancer mortality, and identifying pathways and biomarkers that mediate this association, our study will
help improve the poor accuracy of breast cancer prognostic models in Black women, and inform primary
prevention strategies focused on mitigating SR to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer mortality"
10910992,"Background. The MISSION Act incurs unprecedented challenges to care coordination due to greater use of
community care (CC). Yet VA lacks data on patients' experience of coordination, which hinders improvement
efforts. This prospective survey study focuses on VA primary care patients with common chronic medical
conditions that require care coordination [diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)]. It will compare patients' experience of specialty care coordination with VA vs. CC,
examine how patients' and clinicians' experiences of coordination relate, and examine the association of
patients' experience of coordination to important outcomes.
Significance. This project addresses HSR&D priority: MISSION Act, coordination of VA and non-VA care. It
will examine how coordination, as experienced by Veterans, relates to both antecedents and outcomes in VA
and CC. These data are novel, important to VA's mission to ensure high quality care within VA and for CC, and
will be actionable by operational partners while advancing the science of care coordination.
Innovation. The surveys measure specialty care coordination directly, i.e. as experienced, by the three main
stakeholders (“triad”) in specialty care coordination: patient, PCP and specialist. Direct assessment of
coordination (rather than of satisfaction) provides specific, actionable information about what needs to improve.
The triad approach permits comprehensive assessment by those who most directly experience the effects of
efforts organize care. It also enables us to examine how stakeholder experiences inter-relate.
Specific Aims.
AIM 1. Compare patients' overall experience of coordination in VA vs. CC.
 H1a. Scores for overall coordination will be better in VA vs CC.
 H1b. The gap in coordination scores for high- vs. low-complexity patients will be less in VA vs. CC.
AIM 2. Examine how patients' overall experience of coordination correlates with those of PCPs and specialists.
 H2a. In VA, patients' scores for overall experience will correlate most strongly with scale scores for PCPs
and specialists on clarity and agreement on roles and responsibilities.
 H2b. In CC, patients' scores for overall experience will correlate most strongly with the scale scores for
PCPs and specialists that measure adequacy of data transfer.
AIM 3. Examine the association of patients' overall experience of coordination with selected outcomes: test
duplication, medication problems, A1C control (in diabetes), self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction.
 H3a. Each outcome is better in VA vs. CC.
 H3b. Better coordination as experienced by patients is associated with fewer duplicated tests and
 medication problems, and better A1C control (in diabetes), self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction.
Methodology. VA primary care patients with referrals to VA or CC specialty care for diabetes, CHF, or COPD
will be included. Clinicians of patient survey respondents will be included. Surveys will be used to measure
coordination, medication problems, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. Test duplication and A1C control will be from
VA databases. Hierarchical regression models will control for the nesting of patients within facility complexity
levels, and system-level comparisons will account for selection bias with propensity score weighting.
Implementation/ Next Steps. Bi-annual reports for operational partners will include actionable and evidence-
based recommendations about clinical or policy interventions that could address any shortcomings we find. We
will apply for project funding to examine hypotheses generated by the proposed work. These may include
studies to examine, for example, best practices to coordinate from the patient and/or clinician perspective,
reasons for any observed facility effects, or prospective studies on coordination and other outcomes."
10911094,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Military spouses in relationships with a heavy drinking service member partner report high levels of depression
symptoms, drinking, and social impairment, and a heightened risk for domestic violence compared to spouses
who are not in a relationship with a heavy drinking partner, and these consequences are compounded when
both partners drink heavily. Yet, spouses often do not seek care for their own or their partner’s problems due to
multiple barriers preventing pursuit of care. Military spouses and partners —termed “concerned partners”
(CPs)—may be an important gateway for motivating service members to seek care. However, CPs may first
need to reduce their own drinking and improve their communication to effectively support and encourage
changes for their service member partner. The proposed study builds off our pilot work with Partners Connect,
a 4-session web-based intervention (WBI) for military CPs. In Aim 1, we propose a Sequential Multiple
Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to evaluate the efficacy of an adaptive CP intervention on CP
drinking and SM help-seeking. In Aim 2, we will examine how and for whom the adaptive intervention is most
efficacious by looking at moderators and mediators of service-member help-seeking and supplementing these
quantitative analyses with qualitative CP and service member interviews on the reasons and drivers of service
member help-seeking. We will conduct a two-stage SMART design. In stage one, we will randomize CPs to
either Partners Connect or communication resources from the Gottman Institute website. CPs will be
considered a ‘”responder” at stage one if their service member completes their personalized normative
feedback (PNF) session. CPs who are non-responders to stage one (service member has not completed PNF)
will be re-randomized to receive additional communication interventions in stage two. The purpose of the stage
two randomization is to test what helps stage one non-responders. We expect that by further treating those
that do not respond initially to Partners Connect, we can improve CP communication and drinking, and
ultimately help service members access a brief, effective PNF intervention for their drinking. Our goal is to
reduce health disparities in the military by first intervening with the service member’s spouse and improving
their outcomes to better equip them to engage their service member in services. In doing so, we develop a
model that increases treatment accessibility and appeal among a group that may not otherwise seek care. The
optimal package for CPs is the one that improves the CP’s drinking, mental health, and communication and
that ultimately engages the service member in PNF. Thus, Partners Connect is a novel “two-in-one”
intervention that fills service gaps for CPs and service members."

Detection and identification of the astronomical number of volatile chemicals that we perceive as odors
depends upon the monogenic and monoallelic expression of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in olfactory sensory
neurons (OSNs). An intricate network of OSN-specific interchromosomal interactions coordinates the
transcriptional activation of only 1 OR allele out of >2000 OR alleles distributed across 18 different
chromosomes. Genomic interactions between silent OR genes assemble heterochromatic multi-chromosomal
compartments that keep OR genes transcriptionally inactive, whereas genomic interactions between intergenic
OR enhancers result in a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub that activates singular OR transcription. Here, we
propose to combine Dip-C, a variation of single cell HiC, with viral-based cell tagging technologies, towards the
identification of genome folding intermediates across OSN differentiation lineages. This “cradle to crate”
genomic analysis will follow individual OSN progenitors and their barcoded progeny, allowing a complete
cartography of genomic interactions made by every OR allele en route to transcriptional activation. Single
molecule DNA FISH experiments will complement the proposed genomic studies, providing high resolution
insight to the genomic choreography that orchestrates singular OR gene choice during development. Finally,
we seek to explore how the trajectories of OSN genomic folding become altered and eventually disrupted in a
humanized model for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Olfactory dysfunction, hyposmia, and anosmia constitute well-
established prodromal symptoms of AD, but the molecular etiology of this intriguing connection is not known.
Using a humanized model for AD we discovered that interchromosomal OR compartments dissipate prior to
the onset of neurodegeneration, resulting in strong downregulation of OR transcription. Thus, we propose to
apply our single cell interrogation of genome folding transition in the context of AD and to establish the
baseline of nuclear architecture in human OSNs. Deciphering how OR compartments assemble in health, and
how they become disrupted in disease, may provide the basis for novel prognostic and diagnostic tools for AD,
and molecular assays for in vivo screening of AD therapeutics."

Chronic HIV infection is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In sub-Saharan Africa)—a
region that may account for half of the global burden of CVD attributable to HIV—hypertension is the most
important driver of CVD risk. Profound barriers to effective hypertension management exist, including limited
knowledge, inconsistent BP measurement, and poor access to medications. HIV care innovations such as
access to no-cost antiretroviral therapy, differentiated service delivery and use of PLHIV peers in care models
may improve care of comorbid conditions such as hypertension. The overarching goal of PULESA-UGANDA
study is to improve the BP treatment cascade for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in urban and peri-urban
Uganda in a scalable and sustainable manner. This hybrid IS Type 3 study proposes to first explore
current practice, routines, barriers, and facilitators of evidence–based BP care in HIV clinical settings
in Kampala and Wakiso districts (Aim 1). Then, using a human-centered design approach, a design team of
key stakeholders will use data from the formative assessment to develop a multi-component
implementation strategy (HTN-PLUS) to improve uptake and adherence to evidence-based BP
treatments, contextually adapted to these Ugandan HIV clinics (Sub-aim 1.1). The design team will adapt
differentiated service delivery models, use of hypertensive PLHIV peer champions, and methods of BP
monitoring that address specific barriers and facilitators of BP care. In a stepped-wedge cluster randomized
trial of 16 clinics from Kampala and Wakiso, we will determine the effectiveness of implementation
strategies to improve BP cascade metrics (Aim 2). Clinics will be randomized to receive free and
consistent access to diagnostic equipment and evidence-based antihypertensive drugs (HTN-BASIC) with and
without the multi-component implementation strategy developed in sub-aim 1 (HTN-PLUS). The primary
effectiveness outcome will be % of patients with hypertension diagnosis who are controlled (<140mmHg
systolic). We hypothesize that the HTN-BASIC intervention will increase control from 25% at baseline to 35%,
and that HTN-PLUS will further increase control to 40%. We will conduct an extensive mixed-methods process
evaluation. We will assess scalability as our main implementation outcome, and will also assess acceptability,
adoption, and implementation climate. Finally, we will evaluate the economic and financial sustainability of
the integrated care strategies in a cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective that will include
household out-of-pocket expenditures. The primary outcome of this aim will be incremental cost per BP-
controlled patient. This study will provide much needed evidence to SSA government stakeholders for a
strategy to preserve the health gains of HIV treatment by preventing death and disability from CVD.
Importantly, it will offer economic evidence of the scalability, sustainability, and equity of a model of HIV-
hypertension management integration."

This is a proposal to continue the evolution of postdoctoral training in clinical pharmacology as a collaborative
program in pediatric and adult therapeutics in the joint program between Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) with
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The goal is to realize one key objective of the NIGMS-NICHD
collaboration in clinical pharmacology as a leading joint program training clinician investigators to translate novel
discoveries into therapeutic paradigms that transform disease management for children and adults. The program
is designed for eight postdoctoral fellows, including MDs and MD-PhDs, and PharmDs, focused on human
pharmacology and therapeutics. While training integrates therapeutics across the developmental continuum for
fellows, half pursue careers in pediatric and half in adult clinical pharmacology to address shortages in these
communities of practice nationally. The program, which is two years with the potential to extend for a third year,
expands a well-established curriculum of didactic coursework, conferences, and rotations (20% effort) and
research (80% effort). The breadth of pediatric and adult clinical pharmacology is delivered using a framework
built on the TJU Training Program in Human Investigation (former NIH K30 Program). Courses cover clinical
pharmacology, clinical trials design, statistics, pharmacoepidemiology, pharmacometrics, drug development,
ethics, management, leadership, grant writing and presentation skills. Advanced training in academic and
industrial pharmacometrics is an elective offering. Conferences include journal club in human therapeutics,
research ethics, and seminars in human therapeutics. Rotations provide experience in the critical analysis of
the scientific literature on the editorial board of the Annals of Internal Medicine; critical review of pediatric
(CHOP) and adult (TJU) human subjects research on institutional review boards (IRBs); clinical trial execution
in the TJU Clinical Research Unit; special issues in pediatric therapeutics on the CHOP formulary and
investigational new drug (IND) committees, or analytic method development to support trainee pharmacokinetic
studies. Fellows customize their education by selecting electives congruent with career aspirations, including
drug development at Merck and/or rotation at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The majority of fellows’
time is focused on independent, hypothesis-driven research. Opportunities in pediatric and adult experimental
therapeutics are offered by 54 preceptors representing 9 broad areas of distinction, including cancer,
cardiopulmonary medicine, neurosciences, virology and immunology, connective tissue biology, pediatric
oncology, systems and clinical pharmacology, gastroenterology, and pediatric therapeutics. Preceptors are
selected based on their productive research programs related to therapeutics, training success, and commitment
to train fellows. This program will continue to build upon an exemplary record of recruiting qualified diverse
trainees who have been uniformly successful in academia, the biopharmaceutical industry, and FDA."

Experimental Lead: Cheng
Computational Lead: Leslie
Experimental Co-Investigator: Li
PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent approval of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in multiple cancer types has revolutionized cancer care,
but only a small fraction of patients achieve a durable complete response. Hence, there is an urgent need for
novel immunotherapy-based therapeutic strategies to enhance response and offer long-term survival benefits.
We hypothesize that induction of immunogenic cancer cell death is one of such strategy. Necroptosis and
pyroptosis, two forms of programmed necrosis, are pro-inflammatory and probably immunogenic. By contrast,
mitochondrial apoptosis is generally considered immunologically silent. The BCL-2 family proteins are central
regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis. BAX and BAK, once activated by BH3-only molecules, trigger
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which releases cytochrome c to activate the
apoptosome and caspases. Recent paradigm-shifting discoveries have shown that BAX/BAK activation in the
absence of caspases can trigger the release of mitochondrial DNA to the cytosol through a process called
“mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization” (MIMP), which activates the cGAS/STING pathway and type I
interferon response. These findings indicate that this form of BAX/BAK-dependent, caspase-independent cell
death, which we termed “mimptosis”, is highly inflammatory. Here, we engineer models of inducible cell death in
murine melanoma and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC) to compare the immune response to apoptosis, mimptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis in vivo. Our
goal is to identify the most immunogenic cell death that not only kills cancer cells but also instructs the immune
system to enhance ICB response and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms using a comprehensive
systems biology approach. In Aim 1, we will characterize the impact of different kinds of engineered
immunogenic cell death (ICD) on tumor-immune ecosystem dynamics melanoma using integrated single-cell
multiome, paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and multiplexed immunofluorescence.
Computational modeling will define immune cell gene expression and regulatory programs in response to ICD
to inform therapeutic strategies to improve ICB. In Aim 2, we will determine whether and how immunogenic cell
abrogates tumor progression and metastasis and generates immunological memory against tumor rechallenge
in GEMMs of ccRCC. A comprehensive multidimensional assessment and computational modeling of tumor-
immune ecosystem evolution, T cell epigenetic and functional states, and TCR repertoire in response to different
types of cell death will unravel mechanisms that promote anti-tumor immunity. TCGA analysis revealed that low
expression of apoptosome components, APAF1 and Caspase-9, is associated with better survival outcomes,
suggesting that caspase-independent mimptosis may activate anti-tumor immunity and confer survival benefits
in ccRCC. We will assess this hypothesis by performing single-nucleus multiome and MxIF in patient ccRCC
samples to characterize tumor-immune cross-talk comparing ccRCC with low vs high apoptosome expression."

Project Summary
Bacterial symbionts are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and are responsible for some of the most
radical lifestyles in the natural world. For example, microbial symbiosis enables hydrothermal
vent ecosystems to subsist on inorganic energy and carbon sources and plant-feeding insect
communities to thrive on nitrogen-deficient diets. Often living with one partner inside the other,
these associations require complex cellular mechanisms to ensure that conflict does not arise
between host and symbiont. Reliable transmission mechanisms to reach new hosts are vital to
stabilizing associations over evolutionary time. However, very little is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying these processes because the majority of endosymbionts are
unculturable, and often the hosts are as well. Here, I propose to use ​Drosophila​ fruit flies and
their ​Wolbachia​ endosymbionts as models for understanding host-symbiont interactions and the
molecular mechanisms mediating symbiont transmission. ​Wolbachia ​is one of the most
abundant intracellular symbionts in nature by virtue of its ability to associate with the host
germline and manipulate host reproduction for vertical transmission. It is also occasionally
beneficial to its hosts by promoting pathogen resistance and performing necessary cellular
tasks. These traits make this bacterium useful for applications in disease vector control. While
Wolbachia i​ s faithfully inherited through the germline in all associations examined to date,
horizontal transmission between contemporary hosts, of the same and different species, is
common throughout their evolutionary history and can be recapitulated in the lab. During the
K99 funding period, I will use the ​D. melanogaster​-​Wolbachia ​system to characterize and
identify the genes/pathways necessary for endosymbiont transmission within and between cells.
This will be accomplished in two aims: In Aim 1, I will use ​Wolbachia​-infected ​Drosophila c​ ell
lines to explore the functional mechanisms and evolutionary outcomes of mixed strain
infections. In Aim 2, I will characterize the symbiont and host linker proteins ​Wolbachia ​uses for
KHC-dependent microtubule-based motility. I will use the results of this work during the R00

10912718,"With an estimated 190,000 new diagnoses in 2020, Prostate Cancer (PC) is the second most frequent tumor
diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in America. Approximately one in three
men over the age of 50 shows histological evidence of this tumor, however only one in ten will be diagnosed
with clinically signiﬁcant PC. Therapeutic options for localized PC are effective, however, metastatic PC is a yet
incurable disease because standard of care anti-androgen therapy invariably results in incurable disease relapse. PTEN-TP53 loss is a most signiﬁcant event of human lethal metastatic PC as summarized by the PCF/SU2C International Prostate Cancer Dream Team (Armenia et al., 2018) and conﬁrmed by two decades of
functional PC modeling in mouse.
The central goal of this project is to understand what causes PTEN-mutant indolent prostate cancer (PC) to
metastasize to different parts of the body and kill the patient. While the PCF/SU2C report signiﬁcant association of PTEN loss with loss of TP53, the deﬁnition of further genes that are signiﬁcantly co-mutated with PTEN
has remained a problem. Importantly, such genes could point to pathways and principles that drive metastasis
and/ or therapy resistance. We aim to solve this problem by combining single cell analysis of patient metastatic
rapid autopsy samples with functional genetics and 3D whole organ imaging of lethal metastasis in mouse.
We use a highly ﬂexible genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of lethal, endogenous metastatic prostate
cancer, termed RapidCaP. Spontaneous progression to lethal metastasis is seen in ~70% of Pten/Trp53-mutant RapidCaP, suggesting a critical stochastic pioneer event that switches a Pten/ Trp53 null tumor cell from
indolence to metastatic escape, similar to a critical pioneering event that causes relapse after castration therapy. However, classical approaches can only capture and reveal the time and physical nature of these pioneering events when already thousands or millions of cells are involved.
In Aim 1, we reveal, isolate, and analyze single pioneer cells in space and time. We combine RapidCaP with
serial two photon tomography (STPT), which allows us to image whole organs at single cell resolution and
construct a 3D map of the time course of escape from indolence and of metastatic relapse after therapy. This
guides our isolation of cell types that then serve as validated proxies for pioneer cells of escape or relapse.
Through Aim 2, we solve the PTEN co-mutation impasse and deﬁne genes co-deleted with PTEN through single cell whole genome analysis of human rapid autopsy samples. We prioritize candidates based on comprehensive functional molecular probing of already isolated pioneer cells in vitro. Through Aim 3, we develop two
new modeling platforms for more ﬂexible validation of candidate genes and principles behind escape from indolence and relapse from castration therapy."

The Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource (PMSR) provides a comprehensive set of proteomics and
metabolomics assays to the Wistar Cancer Center, Fox Chase Cancer Center at Temple University, and Sidney
Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University as a primary goal. Resources of the PMSR are also
available to investigators in other Cancer Centers and academic institutions as a secondary goal. Dr. Tang’s
role as the PMSR Managing Director is to support NCI-funded cancer research projects by providing expert
consultation and state-of-the-art technologies that operate at maximum performance at affordable costs to
cancer investigators and other biomedical researchers. The Managing Director will assist in experimental
design, perform MS data analyses as needed, and assist in the biological interpretation of results. The Managing
Director will also devote substantial effort to optimizing and implementing new methods, update analytical and
data analyses methods, and update instrumentation to ensure each project is performed using state-of-the-art
methodologies. This is critical because instrumentation, software, and analytical strategies continue to evolve
rapidly, and most current and anticipated future projects involve very challenging proteomics and metabolomics
problems. Proteomics projects will include: 1) in-depth, global quantitative comparisons of exosomes,
secretomes, cell lysates, tissues and biological fluids; 2) quantitative comparisons of post-translational
modifications; and 3) LC-MS/MS analysis of isolated protein complexes with and without chemical crosslinking.
Quantitative data will be obtained either using label-free quantitation of integrated MS ion currents, or using
stable isotopes such as SILAC or TMT isobaric tag labeling. Metabolomics projects will include quantifying the
steady state levels of polar metabolites, lipids and fatty acids, and 13C isotope tracer analysis. Representative
specific plans for future development of new analytical approaches include: 1) improving characterization of
protein palmitoylation with identification of specific modification sites; 2) de novo peptide sequencing for
identification of HLA peptides; 3) an alternate approach to ubiquitome enrichment; and 4) absolute quantitation
of gut metabolites. In addition, Dr. Tang will implement additional new or improved methods that are likely to be
needed in future cancer projects. These proteomics and metabolomics analyses will contribute to critical data
required to identify biomolecular targets, as well as generate hypotheses that are vital for the success of the
cancer-related projects described in this application."
10910101,"Summary/Abstract
In the U.S., 2.7 million individuals are estimated to have chronic HCV infection which includes nearly 1.3 million
individuals in correctional facilities. Injection drug use remains the most common route of HCV transmission
and in a recent New Orleans, Louisiana sample, 77% of people who inject drugs (PWID) had acquired HCV in
the past. Moreover, it is estimated that 89% of PWID have experienced incarceration. HCV coinfection with
HIV is also particularly common with approximately 25% of people living with HIV (PLWH) also coinfected with
HCV. Furthermore, about 80% of PLWH who inject drugs also have HCV. As HIV-related morbidity and
mortality have declined among PLWH in the ART era, HCV, a leading cause of liver cancer and liver failure,
has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially among PWID. PWID and PLWH are
disproportionately represented in incarcerated populations.
The purpose of this research proposal is to investigate the impact of HCV treatment of HIV/HCV coinfected
and HCV monoinfected incarcerated persons on HCV elimination. Of particular importance is understanding
why safe, curative treatment has not reached most of the incarcerated HCV infected persons who largely are
unaware of their infected status. The high cost of HCV treatment is a major reason for this knowledge gap.
High treatment prices provide an enormous incentive for states to shroud the epidemiology and treatment of
HCV. Subtle and even overt barriers to testing and treatment are sustained to diminish the net economic
impact. Accordingly, relative to HIV, little HCV testing and treatment has occurred in correctional facilities in the
U.S. Louisiana removed the cost of medications as a factor by establishing an alternative payment strategy
with the goal of treating 80% of HCV infected persons by 2024 in their HCV Elimination Program. Under the
program, Louisiana pays the same amount for HCV medications no matter how many persons are treated.
Thus, now for the first time, we have the opportunity to investigate rigorously the burden of HCV in the
correctional system in a U.S. state, the dynamics of incarceration, and the resulting prevalence of infection.
We want to apply this new knowledge to estimating the potential impact of treatment on community HCV
transmission and mortality. In the next cycle, we propose research to achieve these aims: (1) To characterize
the dynamics of HCV infection in the correctional system among HIV/HCV coinfected and HCV monoinfected
incarcerated persons; (2) To assess treatment impact as the trajectory of decline in HCV viremia among HCV
antibody positive incarcerated persons and whether this trajectory differs between those with and without HIV;
(3) To disentangle the impact of the correctional HCV treatment program on HCV viremic decline, and to
assess the impact of scale-up of correctional treatment programs on HCV incidence and mortality in Louisiana
and elsewhere."

This application is for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award entitled “Uncovering
the genomic regulatory network of myofibroblast differentiation in systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung
disease”, submitted by Dr. Eleanor Valenzi, an Assistant Professor of Medicine within the Division of Pulmonary,
Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. The short-term goals detailed in this submission
are designed to help the applicant achieve her long-term objective of becoming an independent physician-
scientist and leader in the field of autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD) research. These short-term goals
include (1) advancing knowledge of computational and molecular biology (2) expansion of technical and analytic
tools to effectively perform translational ILD research, and (3) development of leadership skills to obtain
academic independence. This work will be completed in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care
Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, a rich research environment with a strong commitment to and proven
track record of fostering the development of physician-scientists. The central objective of this research proposal
is to investigate the gene regulatory networks driving myofibroblast differentiation in systemic sclerosis-
associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), as myofibroblasts are the key effector cell in fibrosis and no
treatments currently exist to target these cells. Interstitial lung disease is the leading cause of death in systemic
sclerosis, the rheumatic disease with the highest case mortality. The applicant’s prior published work identified
the transcriptome of the SSc-ILD pathogenic myofibroblasts in explanted lung tissues, however the specific gene
regulatory networks driving differentiation of resident fibroblasts to pathogenic myofibroblasts remain unknown.
Additional preliminary data implicates resident pulmonary fibroblasts as the primary source of myofibroblasts,
and the RUNX2/3 transcription factors (TFs) as putative positive regulators of myofibroblast differentiation. The
primary hypothesis is that RUNX2 and RUNX3, in association with specific composite motif TF partners, promote
myofibroblast differentiation and the aberrant myofibroblast phenotype in SSc-ILD. With this proposal, the
applicant will expand on her prior work with the following specific aims: (1) define the epigenetic and
transcriptional programs essential to myofibroblast differentiation, (2) reconstruct the regulatory network of
RUNX2/3 in myofibroblasts, and (3) determine the mechanism by which RUNX2/3 regulate the critical
myofibroblast effector functions of extracellular matrix expression and contractility. This proposal will determine
the SSc-ILD myofibroblast RUNX2/3 gene regulatory program and establish a pipeline for downstream
investigation of the critical implicated transcription factors and the mechanisms by which they regulate the
myofibroblast phenotype."

including expertise in myocardial and vascular biology, lung and pulmonary vascular disorders, genetics,
proteomics and biomarkers, computational medicine, imaging, clinical trials and clinical implementation and
safety research. The environment provides many opportunities for trainees by virtue of superb centers, core
facilities and programs in which faculty participate such as NHLBI supported clinical trials, the Armstrong Institute
for Patient Safety and Quality and a Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation. Two research tracts
are proposed including training for physician scientists (M.D. or M.D., Ph.D.) in A. Laboratory research for
physician scientists with an emphasis on translational research. B. Clinical investigation supported by the
Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation, which may include clinical implementation research which
is vitally important in critical care fields. Each of four trainees in the program will have an individual development
plan program that is created in consultation with a Steering Committee, a primary mentor and mentorship
team. The proposal incorporates strategies to enhance recruitment of underrepresented minority and ethnic
groups with leadership from a member of the Pediatric Department diversity committee, and training in the
responsible conduct of research. At the conclusion of the program, the trainees will be well prepared to transition
towards positions in academic pediatric cardiology and intensive care fields developing funded independent
research careers."

The goal of our Clinical Validation Center (CVC) is to advance and validate blood-based detection of colorectal
advanced adenoma. Whereas blood-based testing for invasive colorectal cancer is progressing, with multiple
companies pursuing products, the ability of blood-based testing to detect advanced adenomas, the pre-
malignant lesions closest to invasive cancer, is uncertain. To optimally impact colorectal cancer incidence,
blood-based biomarkers cannot just detect cancer, they should also have sufficient sensitivity to identify
subjects with advanced adenomas. For our CVC, we organized and assembled a network of highly skilled
clinical centers including a focus on minority populations, to prospectively collect well-characterized, high-
quality blood specimens from a large number of subjects with advanced adenoma prior to undergoing
polypectomy and serially post-polypectomy. From the same clinical centers, we will collect blood specimens
from control subjects. Specimens will be collected and processed using standard protocols, and relevant
demographic and clinical variables will be captured to facilitate biomarker validation studies. Specifically, we
will use these well-characterized specimens to validate our data on the utility of original, innovative techniques
for molecular detection of advanced adenomas including RealSeqS in combination with custom machine
learning algorithms such as SignaL. We propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a phase
2 case-control study to validate our novel methods for advanced adenoma detection. We will prospectively
recruit patients with advanced adenoma (N=400) and site-specific control subjects (N=400) for comparison to
the case subjects. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize serial blood specimens systematically collected post-
polypectomy from our case subjects to determine whether our novel molecular detection techniques can be
used to predict likelihood of recurrence and potentially guide surveillance colonoscopy exams. Advanced
adenomas are the important, next frontier in non-invasive colorectal cancer screening, and our CVC is
equipped to profoundly advance blood-based detection of advanced adenoma."

Research Plan: Worldwide, one in 8 adults has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which results in disturbed
sleep, daytime sleepiness, and increases the risk for many health issues including cognitive impairment, heart
attacks and strokes. Unfortunately, half of OSA patients are unable to use continuous positive airway pressure
therapy, and due to limited alternative options, most remain untreated. But OSA is a heterogenous condition,
and mechanisms underlying OSA in individual patients (“endotypes”) can now be quantified, allowing targeted
manipulation and providing a clear avenue to develop OSA drug therapy as an alternative for such patients.
Ventilatory instability (“high loop gain”) contributes to OSA pathogenesis in one third of patients. The PI’s data
suggests that acetazolamide—a safe, low-cost ($0.66/day), once daily drug which lowers loop gain—can
markedly improve OSA and its sequelae in some patients, and may be particularly beneficial for patients with a
high loop gain endotype. However, prior studies generally did not measure loop gain and data on clinically
important outcomes are scarce. To define better acetazolamide’s value for patient-care, the PI will conduct a
randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, testing if 4 weeks of acetazolamide in general OSA patients
improves OSA severity (aim 1) and clinically important outcomes (aim 2), and assess predictors/mechanisms
(including loop gain) of changes in these outcomes (aim 3) to help identify likely responders more precisely.
Career Development Plan: The PI, Dr Chris Schmickl MD/PhD, has a strong background in epidemiology,
biostatistics and clinical sleep medicine. This K23 award will provide him with the protected time and training to
achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist, translating physiological insights
into precision pharmacotherapy for patients with OSA who are unable to use current therapies.
To achieve this long-term goal Dr Schmickl will develop advanced skills in three key domains which perfectly
align with the expertise of his diverse and outstanding mentor/advisor team from UC San Diego: 1) OSA patho-
physiology (Drs Malhotra/Owens/Nemati); 2) Designing/executing clinical trials (Dr Jain); and 3) Assessing
clinically important outcomes (Drs Banks/Taub). Based on a gap analysis, a comprehensive training plan was
designed which carefully balances hands-on research experiences with complementary coursework, and
emphasizes the importance of a responsible conduct of research. Clear objectives and milestones have been
defined to track progress during the award. The acquired data and skills will allow the PI to expand on this
work with an R01 studying the long-term effects of acetazolamide (and/or other interventions) in patho-
physiologically defined subgroups of likely responders. More broadly, this award will enable him to develop
novel, high-impact, precision interventions for the many currently untreated OSA patients, thereby joining the
NHLBI mission to enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives."
10911147,"Experience in contemporary military operations suggests that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature injury
of modern wars making our troops a high-risk population for TBI. Among the 327,388 OEF/OIF veterans using
VA services in 2009, 6.7% were diagnosed with TBI of which 73% of those were diagnosed with posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). However, to date there is no approved treatment for TBI, in part due to an incomplete
understanding of the pathobiology underlying TBI. Compelling experimental data demonstrate that mitochondrial
dysfunction is a pivotal link in the neuropathological sequelae of brain injury. This premise comes from our
published work (and that of others) demonstrating that loss of mitochondrial homeostasis and increased
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production occurs following TBI. Protecting or restoring
mitochondrial function by therapeutically targeting mitochondrial impairment improves neuronal function after
TBI. Here, we propose a novel approach of activating mitochondrial biogenesis (MB), a necessary process in
mitochondrial dynamics, after TBI using pharmacological intervention. Through MB, dysfunctional mitochondria
are replaced via signaling networks involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-
alpha (PGC-1α) as a master regulator. Activation of MB can be an important intervention to modulate
mitochondrial dynamics and prevent metabolic disruption after TBI. Recently, two drugs formoterol and
lasmiditan have been screened by us and our collaborators and found to induce PGC-1α via activation of two
independent receptors, β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) and 5-hydroxytryptamine1F (5-HT1F) respectively. We
hypothesize that MB activation at the optimized drug dosage will improve mitochondrial function,
mitigate pathology and restore cognitive function following TBI. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim
1, we will examine the temporal and spatial aspects of MB after TBI in the injured cortex and hippocampus by
analyzing molecular markers of MB. We will also refine and establish the dose-response and therapeutic
window of intervention for formoterol and lasmiditan treatment to optimize MB after TBI. In this Aim, we will also
test the hypothesis that treatment with MB activators promotes cognitive recovery following TBI at the optimal
therapeutic regime. In Specific Aim 2, we will assess cell- and tissue-specific changes in energy homeostasis
following TBI and MB activation therapy using bioenergetic and metabolomic approaches and a novel
approach to isolate synaptic mitochondria. We will also examine the underlying metabolic mechanisms of TBI
and MB activation using in vivo and ex vivo 13C-labeled tracing followed by advanced stable isotope-resolved
metabolomic analysis. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3 we will assess the specificity of MB activators on induction of
MB after TBI. Using 5-HT1F/β2AR KO mice, we hypothesize that functional benefit is dependent on the
specific receptor signaling leading to activation of MB. Overall, we hypothesize that optimizing the therapeutic
window and dose response of these MB activators after TBI will lead to improved bioenergetic homeostasis
and neurocognitive performance after TBI."

10939051,"PROJECT SUMARY / ABSTRACT
In general, enzymes are very precise at catalyzing a specific canonical reaction that fits within a particular
metabolic network. Still, no enzyme is a perfect catalyst. The inherent flexibility of proteins makes it difficult
for enzymes to distinguish their canonical substrate from structurally related compounds. Thus, many
enzymes act on unintended substrates (i.e., substrate promiscuity). Substrate promiscuities result in the
formation of unintended or damaged metabolites (i.e., metabolite damage) that can be a useless drain on
metabolism, and may be inhibitory and/or reactive, sometimes leading to toxicity. Accordingly, metabolite
damage repair enzymes exist for the specific purpose of counteracting metabolite damage, often by
converting a damaged metabolite to a canonical one. The physiological importance of metabolite damage
and its repair has been revealed over the past ~15 years as a handful of metabolic diseases in humans were
discovered to be caused by disruption of metabolite damage repair genes, many of which are highly
conserved across the three domains of life. The proposed project will address metabolite damage repair
associated to the TCA cycle – a universal core metabolic pathway that is involved in energy conversion and
is a source of chemical building blocks that supplies much of metabolism. The TCA cycle is a hotspot for
metabolite damage due to high carbon flux through the pathway and chemical intermediates that are
structurally similar organic acids, which can engage in promiscuous side reactions catalyzed by the abundant
cycle enzymes. I have identified and characterized several highly conserved metabolite damage control
systems related to vitamin, cofactor, and amino acid metabolism, and my training has empowered me with a
unique skillset and perspective that is allowing me to make similar discoveries related to the TCA cycle. One
enzyme that I have identified is particularly intriguing. A prevalent side-reaction of the TCA cycle enzyme
succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes malate to enol-oxaloacetate (OAA), a metabolically inactive form of OAA
that is a potent inhibitor of the TCA cycle. Our results provide strong evidence this side reaction is one of the
most prevalent promiscuous reactions in nature, and that enol-OAA is a potent inhibitor of the TCA cycle.
We identified a universally conserved enzyme, OAT1, that removes the inhibitor, and show that bacterial
cells lacking OAT1 have a severely attenuated TCA cycle. The proposed work will integrate biochemical,
genetic, and metabolomics/ fluxomics approaches to determine how OAT1 impacts the physiological and
metabolic states of prokaryotic and single and multicellular eukaryotic model organisms. Completing this
project will lead to the detailed characterization of a previously unrecognized but critical aspect of the TCA
cycle, ultimately redefining one of the most universal core metabolic pathways in biology. This work will also
provide insights into mitochondrial metabolism and physiology that will impact human health and disease,
and deliver a metabolite damage repair enzyme for use in optimizing synthetic biology platforms."
10939062,"Summary
Due to advances in neonatal care, most preterm infants no longer develop cerebral palsy from hypoxic-ischemic
white matter injury (WMI). However, up to 50% develop gray matter associated cognitive and learning
disabilities by school age that persist throughout life. These developmental disabilities are commonly associated
with a systemic hypoxia (Hx) episode arising from lung immaturity, acute respiratory failure or other common
complications of prematurity. We have developed a preterm-equivalent mouse model which delivers a single
mild clinically relevant episode of Hx at P2. Our preliminary findings support that Hx impairs learning and memory
by disrupting hippocampal: (1) neuronal structural complexity; (2) gene expression; (3) synaptic plasticity/intrinsic
excitability; and (4) fear-conditioning responses in juvenile mice exposed to Hx. We hypothesize that neonatal
Hx is sufficient to persistently disrupt neuronal maturation without causing significant neuronal loss or white
matter injury (WMI). In aim 1, we will determine if Hx disrupts hippocampal maturation independent of acute or
delayed cerebral inflammation, neuronal degeneration or WMI. We will determine how Hx disrupts CA1 neuronal
dendritic arbor maturation and spine density using innovative super-resolution light microscopy integrated with
analysis of synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP) and intrinsic excitability. We will determine if these
changes occur independently of hippocampal neuronal or glial cell death. Since WMI is common in preterm
infants, we will determine if CA1 neuronal dysmaturation occurs independently of WMI. Aim 2 will build upon
preliminary data showing that Hx causes persistent gene transcriptional changes in mouse hippocampus at P16
and P30. The hippocampal response to Hx involved regulators of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission,
synaptic plasticity and epigenetic regulators, all integral to learning and memory. To define novel molecular
mechanisms of hippocampal dysmaturation, we will take an unbiased approach using single nucleus RNAseq to
determine cell type-specific early and late gene expression changes arising from Hx at P2. In aim 3, we
hypothesize that disturbances in synaptic transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses disrupt hippocampus-dependent
memory mechanisms in young adult mice exposed to Hx as neonates at P2. We will determine the effects of Hx
on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity and on the subunit composition of glutamate receptors that regulate
learning and memory in neonates. We have identified that Hx disrupts the action of several key modulators of
excitatory synaptic activity. We will focus on the synaptic potassium channel SK2, which acts as a negative
feedback regulator to limit synaptic depolarization by NMDAR and AMPAR. To further define a mechanistic role
for glutamatergic synaptic activity in disrupted LTP, we will determine if an allosteric AMPA receptor agonist
(ampakine) delivered in vivo will strengthen synaptic transmission/LTP in vitro. Neurobehavioral testing using
hippocampal memory paradigms will facilitate our long-term objective to develop rational therapies to prevent
or reverse the chronic effects of Hx on maturation of hippocampal learning and memory mechanisms."

 Mid-cycle gonadotropin-induced ovulation, a pivotal event in female reproductive physiology, shares
many features with an acute inflammatory response, notably marked by a substantial influx of leukocytes into
the dominant follicle. Despite this, the precise impact of leukocytes on the ovulatory process remains largely
uncharted territory. This knowledge gap serves as the foundation of the proposed study, which endeavors to
elucidate the role of leukocytes in facilitating ovulation and luteinization in the human ovary. Our preliminary
findings, derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis using follicular aspirates obtained
from in vitro fertilization patients (due to male factor or egg donation), have revealed the presence of ten
distinct leukocyte subpopulations. Furthermore, based on the single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we found that
inflammatory cytokines are exclusively expressed in leukocytes, while the expression of their corresponding
receptors is abundantly detected in follicular (granulosa and theca) cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that these
cytokines and their receptors play a pivotal role in ovulatory changes, including steroid hormone and
prostaglandin production, as well as cell metabolic shifts in the human periovulatory follicle. In Specific Aim 1,
we will comprehensively delve into characterizing the expression profile of these cytokines and their
corresponding receptors in dominant follicles throughout the ovulatory period, analyzing samples obtained from
regularly cycling women before and at defined hours after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration
to understand spatiotemporal dynamics of leukocyte-derived cytokines and their corresponding receptors. Also,
we will determine the regulatory mechanisms by which hCG increases the expression of the receptors for the
leukocyte-derived cytokines using primary human granulosa/lutein cells (hGLCs). Specific Aim 2 focuses on
elucidating the impact of these leukocyte-derived cytokines and their corresponding receptors in granulosa
cells on the ovulatory process. By treating hGLCs with hCG, cytokines, and/or receptor antagonists, we aim to
uncover the underlying signaling pathways and associated functional changes facilitating ovulation and luteal
formation in the human ovary. The implications of this proposed study extend beyond advancing our
understanding of normal ovulation; it also holds significant promise for addressing female infertility caused by
inflammation-related ovarian conditions. By shedding light on these intricate mechanisms, our research has the
potential to provide invaluable insights into the development of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at
improving women’s reproductive health and fertility."

Molecular tools that can precisely modulate gene expression provide unique opportunities to both study the
relationships between genotype and phenotype, as well as correct the pathologies caused by dysregulated gene
expression. However, restricting the activity of these tools to the appropriate times or cell types remains a major
hurdle to their effectiveness at interrogating biology and their safety in therapeutic settings. Our research
program’s main goal is to elucidate the design principles for synthetic signaling systems that enable precision
control of gene expression and, in doing so, to create fundamental insights into the mechanistic basis of natural
signal transduction.
 Our work spans 3 methods of modulating expression and in each case seeks to overcome a major
engineering challenge by generating novel fundamental insights into the transduction mechanism through a
combination of high-throughput screening and machine learning. The first are Cas9-based synthetic
transcription factors, which enable targeted changes to the transcription of a gene. We plan to restrict their
activity via fusion to nuclear receptors that will make their nuclear localization, and hence regulation, conditional
on a chemical inducer. We aim to elucidate how the structure of nuclear receptors encodes their nuclear
trafficking kinetics and dynamic range, and then use these insights to design controls systems that can rapidly
implement strong regulation in response to a non-toxic chemical cue.
 The second are ribozyme-based tools that regulate expression at the RNA level through splicing or trans-
cleavage. We plan to make their activity contingent on the presence of either native mRNAs, through template
dependent splicing, or chemicals, using aptazymes. We aim to understand how changes to the sequence, and
resulting structure, of these RNA devices alter their capacity to transduce their triggers into catalysis. The
resulting insights will be used to identify a combination of mutations that can overcome the low catalytic
efficiencies often associated with these tools.
 The third are chemicals that activate human G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to modulate
expression of the genes they regulate. We plan to identify plant metabolites that act as selective agonists by
developing a high-throughput screen that enables massively parallel characterization of GPCR-ligand
interactions. We aim to elucidate the design principles for functional expression of human GPCRs in yeast and
use the resulting biosensors to reveal the ligand features necessary for selective activation of GPCRs.
 Overall, this research will create novel tools to enable precision control of gene expression and generate
fundamental insights into how molecular architecture, structure, and ligand specificity impact signal
transduction. Thus, it both aligns with the NIGMS mission and fills the need for “transcriptional control tools”
recently identified in the NIGMS NOSI: Synthetic Biology for Biomedical Applications (NOT-EB-23-002)."

animation” ex vivo. Our approach is inspired by the hibernating and freeze-tolerant animals in nature. We aim to embrace
and control the ice formation to achieve high subzero storage temperatures in the presence of extracellular ice, and storage
durations of weeks to ultimately months. It is our hypothesis that the presence of ice in a non-injurious frozen state
enables storage at lower temperatures (down to -30°C) and consequently a deeper metabolic stasis for weeks, while also
enabling scale-up to human organs. In the previous funding period, we developed a new method to use ice nucleating
bacteria to tightly control ice formation temperature and developed a partial freezing protocol down to -15°C that can
store rat livers up to 5 days with ex vivo function, and also established a proof-of-concept in human livers. In this
competing renewal application, we propose to build on our success and reach preservation temperatures down to -30°C,
thus achieving suspended animation for weeks. We propose (i) to control ice formation in liver, which our prior studies
demonstrated to be a key barrier; (ii) to develop targeted approaches to improve preservation of endothelium, which are at
the interface of tissue and ice and are the first point of injury, and (iii) to develop a choreographed metabolic protocol to
maximize ATP recovery and improve viability of the grafts for transplant."
10932144,"Germline cancer genetic testing has become a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction
and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas
in the US, and <20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer complete
genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and
uptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes. Our
research has shown that providing remote services increases uptake of genetic testing in community practices
increases uptake of genetic testing. Preliminary data from our ongoing NIH-funded RESPECT study has
revealed high interest in a web-based eHealth alternative to traditional pre-test counseling and no significant no
differences in pre- and post-disclosure outcomes when the web-based eHealth intervention is utilized as
compared to participants who received traditional pre-test genetic counselor. To address the clinically significant
need for alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of cancer genetic testing, while maintaining
adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes, we propose to recruit a nationally diverse “real-
world” sample of 1000 patients who have access barriers to genetic testing and to conduct a Hybrid Type 1
effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate web-based eHealth delivery alternatives for genetic education
and testing. We hypothesize that our theoretically and stakeholder informed eHealth delivery alternatives can
provide equal or better uptake of testing and outcomes of genetic testing as compared to the traditional model
of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor. We will partner with several cancer advocacy groups
(ASCO, breastcancer.org, Cancer Support Community, Pennsylvania Prostate Cancer Coalition) to recruit
patients to this randomized non-inferiority study using a modified 2x2 design (Aims 1-2). In Arm 1, traditional
pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling will be provided remotely through the national Penn
Telegenetics Program and compared to delivery arms where patients can complete pre-test and/or disclosure of
results through a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention, either in place of, or as an adjunct to traditional
genetic counseling. Concurrently, we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research)-informed process evaluation to understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes
and facilitators and barriers to future implementation and sustainability of this novel eHealth alternative delivery
model for genetic services both within and beyond cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a rigorously
developed theoretically and stake-holder informed eHealth delivery alternative provided through a centralized
Telegenetics Program has the potential to provide equal or improved patient outcomes, while reducing genetic
provider time and providing access to services in community practices where access to genetic services has
been limited, providing opportunities to realize the promise of precision medicine in oncology."

The Binational Early Asthma and Microbiome Study (BEAMS) Program Project is designed to investigate the
role of prenatal and early life microbial exposures on risk for asthma-related outcomes in children born in Tucson,
Arizona and in Nogales, Mexico. Accomplishing this binational research agenda requires an infrastructure that
will effectively administer the grant, coordinate all efforts, foster communication and assist with dissemination of
information. The goal of the Administrative Core (Core A) is to provide a central resource for
administering the BEAMS Program Project by implementing a management structure that will allow
investigators from all projects and cores to focus on the scientific effort. Core A will provide high level
coordination of transdisciplinary scientific groups to ensure BEAMS program synergy and will assist with the
organizational needs of all BEAMS components to assure that critical program milestones are met. The specific
aims of the Administrative Core are to: 1) Manage the day-to-day administrative details and programmatic
needs of the BEAMS program by providing fiscal management, administering subcontracts, assuring that
regulatory requirements in the US and Mexico are met, and monitoring of progress with program objectives; 2)
Create an infrastructure to facilitate communication between the projects, cores and investigators, and of the
Program Directors (PD) with NIH, and provide for conflict resolution should it be necessary; and 3) Assist with
dissemination of research findings in a timely fashion to the scientific community, both locally and nationally, and
provide information to the public, including study participants. To these tasks, the Core A project management
staff brings decades of experience in successful organization and management of complex multi-component
projects under the direction of Dr. Fernando Martinez, the Core Director. For Project 1 and Core B, the
Administrative Core will facilitate activities related to the initiation of the birth cohort, including travel of
investigators, scheduling of meetings with the binational team, training of research staff and assuring that
regulatory requirements are met for transport of specimens across the border and binational human subjects
research. For Project 2, Core A will facilitate coordination of subcontracts and meetings with the investigators
at UCSF. For Project 3, Core A will assure all university regulations pertaining to research with animals are
met. It will also provide administrative support for data management and analysis in Core D with its personnel
from different units and institutions. Finally, Core A will maintain contact with members of the Advisory Board
and organize the Board’s annual meetings. Through these efforts, Core A will create and maintain the
administrative infrastructure to ensure successful completion of this transdisciplinary, binational program."

The MarkVCID consortium was established in 2016 to pursue the initial stages of multi-site validation of 7
imaging-based and 4 fluid-based candidate biomarkers for small vessel vascular contributions to cognitive
impairment and dementia (VCID). As one of the 7 participating sites, our team at the University of Southern
California (USC) has analyzed and optimized candidate VCID biomarkers during the UH2 phase (years 1-2),
and participated in the consortium-wide program of biomarker scaling-up, multi-site protocol implementation,
and initial multi-site validation during the UH3 phase (years 3-5). USC has led the consortium wide
development and implementation of the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) biomarker kit
which is based on an FDA approved device that allows in vivo and completely noninvasive imaging of retinal
capillaries with a spatial resolution of ~10 microns. We have also participated in the validation of the other 6
MRI based candidate biomarkers, while contributing blood samples for the validation of the 3 plasma-based
candidate biomarkers. The primary objective of the next 5 years is to carry out comprehensive multi-site clinical
validation of candidate VCID biomarkers in longitudinal studies of diverse populations that are typical in clinical
settings in the US. Capitalizing on the high racial diversity in Los Angeles, we plan to enroll a multiethnic
longitudinal cohort of at least 200 subjects that are enriched for small vessel VCID, including 100 Latinx
subjects from the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES), 50 African Americans (AAs) enrolled in the African
American Eye Disease Study (AFEDS), and 50 Caucasian participants from the Clinical Core of the USC
ADRC. We have performed pilot studies in both Latinx and AA subjects (two largest minority groups in the US)
using MarkVCID protocols to show the feasibility for conducting such studies in a multiethnic cohort. We have
also built a multiethnic team of investigators, technical staff, research coordinators, and community outreach
staff to streamline enrollment, achieve the recruitment milestones and perform longitudinal follow-up studies.
Our team includes established expertise, equipment and infrastructure for OCTA, MRI, fluid biomarker and
clinical/cognitive evaluation of VCID, as well as a proven track record in the sharing of de-identified clinical
data through the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) for the second phase of MarkVCID project."

The CISNET Breast Working Group (BWG) proposes innovative modeling research focused on new precision
oncology paradigms that are expected to re-define breast cancer control best practices. We selected
significant topics where modeling is suited to fill evidence gaps and facilitate clinical and policy translation.
Unique components of our approach include modeling of absolute risk of disease accounting for multiple risk
factors, addressing important comorbidities—specifically type 2 diabetes—that affect both disease risk and
survival, exploring emerging biomarker-based approaches for screening, providing guidance regarding
precision systemic treatments and their impact on quality of life in survivors, and investigating race disparities.
The specific aims are to: 1) Evaluate the impact of novel precision screening approaches; 2) Evaluate the
impact of precision treatment paradigms in the adjuvant, neo-adjuvant, and metastatic setting; 3) Synthesize
Aims 1 and 2 to quantify the contributions of precision screening and precision treatment to US breast cancer
mortality reductions; and 4) Provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce race disparities by quantifying
multiple risk, screening, treatment, and survival factors that impact disparities. This scope of work would not be
feasible without the availability of six distinctive BWG models: Dana Farber (D), Erasmus (E), Georgetown-
Einstein (GE), MD Anderson (M), Stanford (S) and Wisconsin-Harvard (W). The aims encompass multiple RFA
priority areas, and we have set aside Rapid Response funds to address remaining priority areas, support
cross-cancer CISNET collaborations, and foster junior career enhancement. Each aim includes three or more
model groups selected for their unique structure and includes outside collaborators and junior investigators.
The models will share common inputs and provide a standard set of outcomes for benefits (e.g., distant
recurrences and deaths avoided, mortality reductions, distant disease-free survival, and life years and quality-
adjusted life years), harms (e.g., false positives and benign biopsies, interval cancers, advanced stage
diagnoses, overdiagnosis and treatment impact on quality of life), and costs. Continuously funded for the past
19 years, the modeling teams have published 204 research papers informing public health policy decisions and
trained 13 junior investigators. For this proposal, the BWG will partner with the American Cancer Society, the
American College of Radiology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Breast Cancer Surveillance
Consortium, and others. An experienced Coordinating Center provides the infrastructure to support the project
goals including resource sharing and model accessibility. The exceptional environment provides
unprecedented synergy and leveraging of resources to address new research questions and support career
development that would not otherwise be possible. Overall, this research will advance modeling research and
guide breast cancer control policy."

incarcerated, transition to a 2-year associates granting school (BCCC), be provided skills and methods
development while at BCCC, participate in a 10-week STEM research internship at Howard in the summer in
between years 1 and 2, then transition to a 4-year school, upon completing their associates degree at BCCC.
We plan to start a 5-participant cohort each year of the 5-year funding period. The program will address the
following, which is explained in detail within the proposal: 1. Skills development will be gained via the
Leadership, College & Professional Readiness, and SAT portions of the P2P program and Intro to Research
Workshops will be implemented during the community college time span. 2. Research Experience will be
obtained via a 10-week internship with one of nearly 20 collaborating investigators at Howard University and
scholars will attend a national meeting to present their work. 3. Curriculum and Methods To provide
supplemental instruction for gateway courses, development will include a molecular techniques course
incorporated into General Biology (BCCC BTC 105 - Techniques and Instrumentation for Biotechnology) 4. A.
Recruitment Plan: We will do a multitude of activities detailed in the proposal but briefly, P2P already works
with over 100 individuals per year in their actively running program. Priority will be given to select the top five
people of the P2P program. Other recruitment will be done as well, such as placing ads on local hip-hop and
top 40 radio stations and utilizing connections already in place with community organizations and government
(MD-DOC) partners. 4. B. Retention Plan: We will provide incentives: 60% tuition scholarships, yearly stipends,
paid internships, and mentoring opportunities to give back. The goal of the P2P-B2B program is to create
synergies between prisons and 2- and 4- year colleges in Baltimore (creating a prison-to-college pipeline) and
to increase the transition to BS/BA degrees from AA degrees. Partners & PDs/PIs: 1. Howard University
College of Medicine (Dr. Andrisse, lead-PI), 2. Baltimore City Community College (Dr. Schaumloffel, Co-PI), 3.
Prison to Professionals (Ms. Skudrzyk, PD). Cross-Disciplinary Perspective: Interdisciplinary approaches
are often needed to push the frontiers of research and education. Dr. Andrisse and P2P know first-hand the
vast amount of talent and potential that is being missed out on in the currently and formerly incarcerated
population. These men and women are primarily people of color and thus have two significant indicators of
underrepresentation in the sciences and education. Thus, this project is taking the highly innovative
approach to intersect the worlds of research, education, and incarceration by creating a
ground-breaking prison-to-college-and-STEM pipeline."
10907450,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this proposed program is to develop an innovative, end-user informed HIV pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) product as an Acceptable Multi-user Biodegradable Extended Release
(AMBER) implant. The implant technology addresses multiple challenges with current PrEP drug delivery
systems (DDS) by offering beneficial attributes: user-independence and discretion of use, zero-order
(sustained) release, long-term protection (≤1 year), retrievability and biodegradation of the polymeric
implant. We propose to engineer the implant to be retrievable throughout the drug delivery period, in the
case of adverse reactions or an end-user’s wish to discontinue. Otherwise, the AMBER implant will remain
in-place and biodegrade after drug depletion. Uniquely, the AMBER implant decouples drug delivery features
from biodegradation properties, which enables zero-order kinetics of drug release. The AMBER program
addresses the goals of this National Institutes of Health (NIH) opportunity (RFA-AI-19-063) for the
development of new and innovative sustained/extended release (SER) DDS for HIV PrEP with novel (non-
tenofovir based) antivirals (ARV). We will inform implant development by eliciting preference insights from
diverse gender, sexual orientation, and ethnic/racial minority populations in two priority geographical areas
under “Ending the HIV Epidemic” initiative in the United States. We propose three specific aims: (1) develop
the AMBER implant with polymers optimized for high durability and bioerosion profiles; (2) formulate selected
ARVs and evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of lead AMBER implants in preclinical studies;
(3) identify Preferred User Characteristics (PUCs), inform technology development and future deployment of
AMBER into practice by conducting iterative socio-behavioral research with Young MSM, cis- and trans-
gender women in California and Alabama. We will strive to align PUC and key modifiable attributes during
product development: sustained (≤1 year) delivery of novel ARV, polymers designed to optimize
biodegradation timescales, incorporation of end-user acceptability information into a Target Product Profile
(TPP), and evaluation of efficacy in nonhuman primate model. The AMBER program is milestone-driven and
provides defined deliverables to product development efforts to support future needs in clinical translation."

10907573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Just as gene and protein expression are common characteristics to identify a cell, lineage is an important aspect
of cell identity. In the past, lineage tracing has been used to determine what cells arise from a specific cell type,
as defined by the expression of a cell-type-specific gene; however, the establishment of single-cell genomics
techniques has ushered in lineage tracing at single-cell resolution. New technologies for lineage tracing can track
the progeny of single cells, regardless of their initial gene expression. The Morris lab has developed a single-cell
lineage tracing (scLT) method, called CellTagging. CellTagging demonstrated the ability of scLT approaches to
identify similarities in cells based on lineage and offer mechanistic insights to cell reprogramming. CellTagging
and other virus-based scLT technologies still present limitations, though, in that they require multiple
transductions to increase lineage resolution, and may fail to capture biologically relevant bifurcation events due
to cell labeling at discrete time points. These technologies are also subject to transgene silencing in certain cell
models, such as iPSC-derived organoids, rendering them ineffective for use in many models of development
and disease. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to develop new scLT tools that can be applied without
repeated manipulation of cells and be used in iPSC differentiation and reprogramming systems without silencing
hindering the readout of lineage information. Here, I propose to utilize a CRISPR-Cas12a-guided cytidine
deaminase as a method to continuously record heritable lineage data through targeted cytidine to
thymine editing. I have developed and validated the ability of a novel CRISPR-Cas12a-guided cytidine
deaminase to accrue base edits on a targeted synthetic DNA region over time in vitro and recovered these
synthetic sequences via single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). These two outcomes are a promising proof-
of-concept that scLT can be performed with these accrued single base edits. Here, I propose to (1) increase the
resolution of CellTagging to capture bifurcation events, using this novel DNA editor to constantly edit single
bases in a targeted editing region (TER) and dispense with the need for multiple transductions, and (2) integrate
this base editor system into a safe harbor locus within an iPSC line to shield the transgenic components of the
technology from silencing, validating this approach in kidney organoid differentiation. My proposed developments
of the CellTagging technology increase the potential for discovery because they can be broadly applied to model
systems that are either not amenable to multiple manipulations or are prone to transgene silencing. By making
all plasmids, cell lines, protocols, and analysis tools for these systems publicly available, I aim to provide a
valuable resource across several areas of cell biology. These resources will provide an experimental toolkit for
anyone working with in vitro developmental, reprogramming, and disease models to interrogate single-cell
lineage at high resolution."

antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial
pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human
and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary
clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US.
veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and
cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical
AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in
collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest
AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data
collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore
will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program.
Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured
text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis.
We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State
University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll
additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals,
and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a
more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a
deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage
we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of
sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and
deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of
AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in
an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an
web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and
analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US."

Human milk confers numerous infant health benefits, yet the compositional elements responsible for these
benefits and the fundamental molecular mechanisms shaping the unique milk “recipe” for each infant remains
lacking. Genomic advances pioneered to probe the cellular and molecular biology of other human tissues
provide powerful strategies to understand biological systems, but are underutilized in milk research.. It is time
for a new era of human milk research focused on deep interrogation of maternal mammary cell genomics, in
interaction with maternal clinical and behavioral factors, in shaping milk composition. Furthermore, the scope of
normal variation in milk composition is yet to be established. Outlining the scope of normative variation in milk
is key to next-generation human milk fortification techniques to support the nutritional needs of preterm infants
and other clinical populations of interest. The primary objective of the proposed project is to generate a
systems-level view of human milk in the context of healthy mothers and their term infants. As such, the
proposed work is directly responsive to NIH/NICHD RFA-022-020, “Human Milk as a Biological System”. The
study leverages existing data, milk, and fecal specimens from a richly phenotyped cohort of 400 mother-infant
dyads, and is based on compelling preliminary data identifying novel genetic sequence variation shaping milk
gene expression, and relationships of milk metabolomic, lipidomic, and microbiomic variation to infant growth
and cognition. Specific Aim 1: to identify maternal genetic and clinical factors that shape human milk gene
expression. We will identify novel genetic determinants of the milk transcriptome and assess potential
modification of these genetic associations by gestational weight gain, diet, and other clinical factors. Single-cell
RNA-sequencing will provide additional necessary information for characterization of the cell type composition
within human milk. Specific Aim 2: to describe key features of the normative human milk biosystem and their
interactions with one another. The project expands on existing milk omics data from the cohort, including milk
microbiomes, oligosaccharides, metabolomics, and lipidomics, to be integrated with the genomic data
produced under Aim 1. Established and novel machine learning techniques will be used to characterize
interaction networks and correlational structures among these key features of human milk. Specific Aim 3: to
establish how the milk biosystem is related to variation in infant gut microbiomes and health. Milk multi-‘omic
networks will be aligned with infant growth, body composition, and gut microbiome variation from birth to 6
months in the 400 infant offspring from the above cohort. Statistical and machine learning techniques will
define the scope of milk system variation consistent with normal infant growth and gut microbiome
development. For a subset of 150 infants, we will also incorporate innovative early life cognitive assessments
for exploratory analyses. Finally, we will develop an online portal for visualizing the resulting data, enabling
other researchers to investigate specific features and relationships of interest."
10907748,"ABSTRACT
The neuron is the basic cellular unit of the brain. For neurons to work properly, they must be plastic and
constantly capable of changing in response to stimuli, forming and stabilizing new connections. This
process requires proteins to be added to the new synaptic contact, and this in turn results from the targeting
of mRNA to these sites of activity, as we have shown in our previous work. This is the molecular basis of
learning and memory since the synapse is stabilized by the production of proteins in response to
stimulation that is important for its function and structural integrity. How this mRNA is regulated in
neurons to make the right protein at the right place and time has been the subject of our investigations
over the years of this funding. This proposal exploits the tools we developed during the last funding period
to address how mRNA is regulated in dendrites. We have expended considerable effort in the generation
of genetically engineered mice wherein the loci of three neuronally expressed genes important for learning
and memory have been tagged with stem loops that, when expressed in the mRNA bind to fluorescent
proteins. The single mRNAs expressed from these genes can be imaged in living cells and extended into
live tissues. We have taken care to verify that the tagging is neutral: it does not alter the behavior or affect
memory formation in the mice. One of these tags is for Arc, an immediate early gene in response to
neuronal stimulation important for consolidating long term memory. Unlike the constitutive -actin
mRNA, which we showed sits at the place where it was last stimulated for hours, Arc mRNA localizes
only for a few minutes, and degrades soon after. The current proposal reports on the progress to solving
how transiently localized mRNAs can impact long term changes at the stimulated spines. The surprise
was that Arc undergoes cycles of localization and translation in response to a single stimulus. Even more
incredible is that the translation occurs spatially at the same spot, so the mRNA in the next cycle finds the
site of previous localization and builds up a continuous “hotspot” of localized protein synthesis. This in
contrast to the β-actin mRNA, which persists at the stimulated site, awaiting the next signal, wherein it
will initiate another round of proteins. Because β-actin is a structural protein, the synaptic contact is built
up with rounds of translation, consistent with a learning and memory paradigm that relies on repetitive
stimulation. The current proposal is directed towards understanding the kinetics of translation hotspots,
and their spatial overlap for different mRNAs with distinct roles in plasticity. We crossed the β-actin and
Arc mice to homozygosity where both mRNAs were individually detectable by different colored
fluorochromes in the same neuron. We have learned from this mouse that the two mRNAs were handled
differently by the neuron, and traveled in independent “granules”, likely resulting from differences in their
associated proteins. For instance, β-actin mRNA bound the zipcode binding protein, ZBP1 (IMP1)
whereas Arc mRNA instead bound the protein FMRP. Further progress will elucidate the protein
composition of each granule in more detail. We have made two more mice during the last funding period:
a GCN4 epitope tagged (“Suntag”) Arc mouse that will allow us to see the translation sites of Arc protein
using a fluorescent single chain antibody in living cells and tissues (we developed this tag previously),
and a CaMKII mouse where the mRNA is distinguishable from either β-actin mRNA or Arc mRNA by
hybrid fluorescent tags. This allows us now to contrast how the neuron handles each mRNA, for example
in its localization and translation. Over the last funding period, an unexpected result was that the CaMKII
mRNA localized in the spines, unlike either Arc or β-actin mRNA, that stayed at the base of the spines.
This indicated that subtleties in the localization of these mRNAs may underlie a physiological purpose.
We intend to investigate this by determining the sequences that likely direct this mRNA into the spines.
Ultimately, we intend to find the proteins bound specifically to these mRNAs and how they might affect
the regulation of their respective mRNAs. This will use the technologies of RNA editing and proximity
labeling, which will allow us to interrogate the associated RNAs and proteins that make each species of
mRNA granule unique."
10908587,"Project Summary
Tooth loss from trauma or disease remains a significant world-wide concern due to poor esthetics and loss of
function. Addressing this issue is not trivial because regeneration of alveolar bone and oral tissue is not
predictable, partially due to the complexity of the process. Bone regeneration of these defects remains
unpredictable and understanding the physiological mechanisms that guide bone marrow biology and
inflammatory resolution will increase the therapeutic reliability of these regenerative techniques in the future.
We have observed a previously unknown role for Growth Arrest Specific 6 (GAS6) in controlling alveolar bone
and soft tissue regeneration following extraction. GAS6-deficient mice showed markedly worse healing
following extraction, which was associated with aberrant bone and immune phenotypes. The primary goal for
this K99/R00 proposal is to test the critical role of GAS6 in oral tissue healing. Two specific aims are proposed
based on our previous observations. We hypothesize that GAS6 acts directly on mesenchymal stem cells to
prime them towards a osteoblastic phenotype. This hypothesis will be tested through measurement of healing
following extraction in mice with mesenchymal stem cells deficient in GAS6 signaling, along with associated
experiments on primary cells derived from patients following extraction. We also hypothesize that increased
neutrophil infiltrate in GAS6-deificiency impedes soft tissue healing. We will employ conditional knockout
models of neutrophils and neutrophil functions to test this hypothesis. The K99 portion will be dedicated to
developing new tools for studying tissue and immune cell-specific GAS6 signaling and building upon my prior
work in osteoblast biology, while the R00 portion will deploy these tools to study inflammation and connect
alveolar regeneration with GAS6 signaling. This award will provide a significant contribution to the
understanding of the physiology of healing in the oral cavity while providing significant training to the candidate
in the use of genetic mouse models and immunology, ultimately leading to an independent career as a dental
clinician-scientist specializing in treatment of systemically compromised patients."

The need to provide safe and cost-effective measures to prevent Cancer is self-explanatory. The University of
Wisconsin (UWISC) as the Lead Academic Organization (LAO) together with our collaborating institutions

National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), as a Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials
Network (CP-CTNET) site funded as a UG1 Consortium as described in RFA-CA-18-031. Our overarching goal
is to evaluate the effects of novel preventive agents/interventions on pertinent biological endpoints in order to
efficiently determine their appropriateness for further testing and potential viability toward becoming
recommended societal interventions to lessen the burden of cancer. We will pursue this overarching goal via
the following specific aims: (1) Efficiently design, conduct and perform Phase 0, 1, 2 Chemoprevention Clinical
Trials of novel and/or re-purposed immunologic-based or molecular targeted agents, assessing their effects upon
relevant biological (biomarkers/clinical effects) endpoints. (2) Build upon existing consortium infrastructure to
complete Aim 1 via intra- or inter-consortium (CP-CTNET) multi-institutional collaborations in concert with
NCI/DCP contributing three to four new Phase 0, 1 or 2 clinical trials and accrual of ≥ 40-50 subjects per year.
We are well positioned to successfully achieve the above aims due to our combined experience with prevention
agent development (consortium members currently hold >90 DCP sponsored R, U or PREVENT awards) and
our consortium's staffing, organization, and management which results in the timely development, performance
and completion of impactful, multi-institutional early phase cancer prevention trials. Our enhanced consortium
consists of >10 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, institutions providing access to robust numbers of at-risk
patients (e.g. Mayo Clinics, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance) and expanded access to at-risk under-represented
minorities and special populations (e.g. University of Puerto Rico, Alaska Native Medical Center). Supported by
the Carbone Cancer Center, the University of Wisconsin CP-CTNet site is determined to contribute to advancing
the field of Cancer prevention through performance of early phase prevention trials."

 This application seeks support for a FASEB (Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology)
Science Research Conference, entitled: “Nuclear Bodies: Hubs of Gene Expression.” The meeting will be
held July 24-28, 2024 at Niagara Falls, NY. This conference builds directly on momentum from a
predecessor FASEB meeting, held in 2022. Nuclear bodies are subcellular structures composed of
proteins and RNAs that typically occupy the spaces between interphase chromosomes. They have been
implicated in many aspects of gene expression at the post-transcriptional stages. Following the 2022
meeting, there has been increased attention on the relationship between nuclear bodies and human
disease, particularly cancer- and this topic will be a major focus of the meeting. In addition, the
biophysical phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation was found to be a major dynamic feature of
nuclear bodies and this will be a second major theme of the meeting. The program has 41 confirmed
speakers, of whom half did not attend the first meeting. As before, approximately one third of the
confirmed speakers are early career scientists (defined as graduate student, post-doctoral fellow or
Assistant Professor). The program includes a Keynote Lecture on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in cell
biology, along with a Career Development and Mentoring session. Additional speaker invitations will be
made this autumn and subsequently from the submitted abstracts. The anticipated number of
participants is 75-80. The organizers will be approaching numerous companies and foundations for
additional support, together with funds being provided by FASEB, as described in the budget section of
the application. Similar to the 2022 meeting, a scientific report (FASEB J. 36(11):e2258. doi:
10.1096/fj.202201455R) on the conference will be published."
10938959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The traditional view of cellular metabolism is that metabolic reactions exist to maximize catabolic (energy
generation) or anabolic (growth) states. Over the past decade, we and others have begun to appreciate that
metabolism also regulates chromatin function, as chemicals that modify DNA and histones are derived from
intermediates of cellular metabolism. Furthermore, certain metabolites non-canonically function as substrates,
co-factors, and/or inhibitors of enzymes that modify chromatin. Collectively, this prior work supports a
framework in which fluctuations in metabolites influence the deposition and removal of chromatin modifications.
Indeed, numerous recent studies have shown that metabolites can influence cell fate via effects on chromatin
organization. However, given the broad array of cellular metabolites and recent evidence that some metabolic
enzymes can localize to the nucleus, this field is in its infancy. My research seeks to understand how changes
in intra- and extracellular metabolites affect chromatin biology. For this MIRA R35, we will focus on polyamines,
positively charged metabolites present at high concentrations in eukaryotic cells but whose effect on chromatin
has been largely unexplored. Substantial work has shown that polyamines are critical for cell growth, survival,
and proliferation and that polyamines interact with negatively charged macromolecules such as DNA and RNA.
Moreover, interactions between polyamines and DNA can alter chromatin accessibility and increase
transcriptional efficiency in vitro, but whether and how this occurs in vivo is unknown. Inhibition of polyamine
biosynthesis has been known to lead to terminal differentiation of untransformed progenitors. However, the role
of polyamines in cell fate and their interactions with chromatin remain unknown, largely due to prioritization of
transcription factors as regulators of cell fate and the lack of tools to study metabolism at a cellular or subcellular
level. Using new methods developed by our group, we recently discovered that polyamines concentrate in the
nucleus, where they localize to chromatin subdomains, suggesting their interaction with specific chromatin
regions. These findings lead us to hypothesize that polyamines increase chromatin accessibility at nuclear
subdomains, thus impacting cell fate and chromatin homeostasis. Within this framework, we propose that
polyamines act in concert with transcription factors to influence large-scale chromatin dynamics during cell fate
decisions. We will explore how polyamines impact cell differentiation and reprogramming, DNA replication
dynamics, replicative stress, nuclear structure, and chromatin landscape. Results from this study will help
explain how polyamines regulate chromatin function, in alignment with multiple NIGMS priority areas, to better
understand chromatin modification and epigenetic mechanisms. Support from this MIRA R35 will also further
my independent research program in investigating the relationship between cellular metabolism and chromatin
biology."
10938434,"Project Summary
Many tissues in adult mammals are incapable of regeneration after injury because the parenchymal cells
that provide the specialized tissue functions lack sufficient self-renewal capacity. When parenchymal cells
cannot facilitate tissue regeneration, non-functional fibrotic scarring occurs. In the select tissues that can
regenerate, such as the liver, resident parenchymal cells enter states of high self-renewal upon injury to
enable parenchymal repair and recovery of organ function. Mammalian neonates have parenchymal repair
capacity in most tissues too because newborn immature parenchymal cells maintain elevated levels of self-
renewal, but these cells rapidly become quiescent during postnatal development and lose repair
competency. Based on these insights, an important question remains as to whether parenchymal repair can
be induced in adult tissue injuries simply by enhancing the self-renewal capacity of certain adult parenchymal
cells. Addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for
limiting the injury-induced self-renewal in adult parenchymal cells will be required to answer this question.
Thus, this project is focused on dissecting molecular mechanisms responsible for self-renewal deficiencies in
adult parenchymal cells following injury and testing strategies for improving adult wound healing outcomes by
regulating these processes. We will address fundamental knowledge gaps in parenchymal repair using the
mouse central nervous system (CNS) as a model organ system and focus on one important quiescent
parenchymal cell population in the CNS, astrocytes, for detailed study. As part of this work, we will explore 3
separate but complementary initiatives and use an experimental toolkit of modular biomaterials, in vitro
astrocyte cultures, and mouse spinal cord injury models. In initiative 1, we will dissect the mitotic and anti-
mitotic growth factor signaling that regulates parenchymal repair and we will incorporate injectable
biomaterial coacervates to precisely deliver molecular regulators of this signaling in vivo. In initiative 2, we will
identify metabolic fuels necessary for sustaining parenchymal cell self-renewal after injury and use injectable
glyco-nucleoside copolymer hydrogels to permit prolonged delivery of optimized metabolic fuels to injury
lesions. In initiative 3, we will dissect non-cell autonomous regulation of parenchymal cell self-renewal by
recruited lesion cells by using injectable biomaterials to locally dysregulate these natural injury-induced cell-
cell interactions. Collectively, the three initiatives will shed new light on the molecular requirements for
enhancing parenchymal repair in adult tissue injury and will transform our understanding of wound healing that
will be applicable to many organ systems."
10940779,"Complementary Biotherapeutic Delivery Platforms for Enabling Gene Re-delivery
Project Summary
Facing the universal challenge of re-delivering Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), our project endeavors to
pioneer delivery-focused solutions in gene therapy. The core obstacle stems from the host immune system's
robust reactions to the vector and cytotoxic responses to its transduced cells & transgenes, highlighting a
pressing need for innovative delivery strategies that engage and modulate the corresponding immune
responses. Our approach is multifaceted, comprising three distinct delivery platforms, each addressing unique
aspects of the antigen-processing machinery and focusing on overcoming specific biological barriers for
delivering the “updated” instructions for modulated immune responses. (1) Targeted Cell Delivery of Regulatory
T Cell (Treg): While Tregs represent a novel avenue for cell-based therapies, their non-specific delivery can
lead to undesired immunosuppression. The first challenge involves directing Treg cells to immunogenic cell
death sites caused by transgene persistence. Our strategy to overcome this is to engineer Chimeric Antigen
Receptors (CAR) to enhance Treg navigation and delivery of Tregs to transgene persistence sites, enabling
rescued and sustained transgene gene expression. (2) Targeted Delivery System for IgG-Protease: The
second program targets the selective removal of antigen-specific IgG, specifically for neutralizing antibodies
that hinder AAV gene delivery vectors. IgG degrading protease is an effective way of eliminating pre-existing
naturalizing antibodies. However, non-specific delivery of IgG will lead to systematic disarming of our immune
defense. We are developing antigen/antibody-fused IgG protease to deliver a protease selectively, ensuring
that only unwanted, harmful immunogenic antibodies are present. (3) Targeted Lipid Nanoparticles for Cell-
Specific RNA-Delivery: The third program addresses the significant challenge of achieving cell-specific RNA
delivery for inducing tolerogenic antigen processing. mRNA delivery is a highly effective method for in vivo
antigen production, and siRNA delivery is a highly effective immune modulation method. However, non-specific
delivery of RNA at the wrong microenvironment might trigger immunogenic instead of tolerogenic responses.
By focusing on precision delivery to the antigen-presenting cells and their surroundings, we aim to synthesize
and formulate novel lipid nanoparticle formulations for achieving cell-type specific RNA delivery for better
controlling the intended tolerogenic response for AAV vectors. By addressing these challenges and pioneering
advanced delivery and targeting strategies, our research seeks to unravel the fundamental intricate between
the biological barriers in delivery to the immune system and re-enabling viral gene delivery vectors, paving the
way for transformative advancements in gene therapy and improved human health."

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is initiated by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and further characterized
by lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and varying degrees of fibrosis that can lead to cirrhosis, liver
failure and cancer. Despite its high prevalence and clinical importance, there are currently no approved
therapies. As steatosis is a key driver for the pathogenesis of NASH, there is clearly a need to identify novel
signaling molecules and pathways regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and evaluate their therapeutic potential
in NASH animal models. We identified an adipose-enriched adipokine. our preliminary data show that
recombinant protein of this adipokine induces gene expression program of mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty
acid oxidation and represses program of de novo lipogenesis in the liver, leading to a rapid and robust
resolution of liver steatosis and NASH. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether this adipokine will resolve NASH
and other metabolic comorbidities in two NASH mouse models. In Aim 2, we will investigate the in vivo
mechanism underlying the resolution of NASH by this adipokine. In Aim 3, we will identify the receptor targeted
by this adipokine and perform global phosphoproteomic studies."
10940736,"SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to develop strategies for the eradication of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in AML
patients who have received initial therapy with venetoclax and azacitidine (ven/aza). As demonstrated
previously, almost all AML patients treated with ven/aza will eventually relapse. Thus, providing improved
therapeutic regimens is an urgent unmet need. Our previous studies have demonstrated that more than one
subtype of LIC can exist simultaneously in the same patient. Importantly, different LIC subtypes can demonstrate
highly variable responses to therapy, including resistance to ven/aza. Thus, LIC heterogeneity may be a
prevalent feature of AML biology, and as such poses a significant challenge in designing optimal therapies that
effectively eradicate them. Consequently, a major goal of this project is to characterize and target ven/aza
resistant LICs. Our preliminary data indicate that reliance on uptake of calcium into mitochondria is a distinct
feature and vulnerability of ven/aza resistant AML cells. Thus, we have investigated the role of the calcium
uniporter, MCU, as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings show that both genetic and pharmacological
inhibition of MCU is highly cytotoxic to ven/aza resistant LICs. Importantly, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells do not share this extensive reliance upon MCU for mitochondrial metabolism and survival. Thus, this axis
appears to represent a unique feature of ven/aza-resistant LIC and in turn, an attractive opportunity for
therapeutic intervention. To translate this strategy to clinical practice, we have leveraged a recent finding that
shows the well characterized chemotherapy agent, mitoxantrone (mitox), is a strong inhibitor of MCU.
Intriguingly, we demonstrate that mitox is effective in suppressing mitochondrial calcium uptake and downstream
metabolism at doses 10-100 fold lower than used for conventional chemotherapy purposes. Indeed, at doses
as low as 10nM, we observe potent eradication of ven/aza resistant LICs, with no evidence of DNA damage, and
no discernable effect on the growth of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Based on these findings, our
goals are to: 1) perform preclinical modeling studies as a prelude to clinical investigation and to better understand
the mitox mechanism of action, 2) conduct a clinical trial using lower-dose mitox in combination with ven/aza as
a strategy to target drug-resistant LICs and thereby increase remission duration, and 3) to perform a detailed in
vivo analysis of LIC subtypes in patients undergoing ven/aza/mitox therapy to better define the role of
mitochondrial calcium uptake and any other molecular events that contribute to therapy resistance in the
heterogenous LIC compartment. Taken together, the proposed studies will provide a comprehensive evaluation
of mitox as a clinical strategy to augment ven/aza therapy and will determine the prevalence and role of calcium
uptake in the biology of drug resistant LICs."
10940877,"Over 4 million adults are living with a total knee replacement (TKR); however, most do not achieve
recommended physical activity levels. To date, physical activity interventions for adults with TKR have primarily
been intensive, in-person, and costly interventions. However, given the barriers associated with these intensive
programs (e.g., time and travel burdens), scalable approaches for increasing physical activity in this population
are needed to address high rates of inactivity, and related risk of chronic disease and mortality. Fully-
automated Internet programs have potential for increasing physical activity but have rarely been tested in
adults with TKR. Further, it is unknown whether this intervention approach can be scalable and effective in this
population or whether additional enhancements to the program are needed. We propose to use the Multiphase
Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to identify the optimal intervention components within a scalable,
internet-based physical activity program for adults who are ≥12 months post-TKR. Participants will be recruited
nationwide to participate, and all will receive the core Energize! Exercise Program, a 6-month fully automated
program. Energize! provides a platform for participants to plan and report exercise daily, watch and complete
behavioral video lessons and related homework assignments, and receive brief automated feedback on activity
levels. In addition to Energize!, participants will be randomized to receive 0-4 non-automated supplemental
components, which were selected based upon prior research and guided by the Self-Determination Theory
(SDT) and Supportive Accountability: 1) phone coaching, 2) progress reports sent to physicians/surgeons, 3)
tailored modules specific to adults with TKR, and 4) individualized human feedback (delivered electronically)
on submitted homework assignments. The primary aim is to identify which supplemental intervention
components contribute to the greatest increases in physical activity (total moderate-to-vigorous intensity
physical activity [MVPA] and percent meeting guidelines [≥150 min/week of MVPA]) at 6 and 12 months.
Secondary aims include assessing the effect of the intervention components on pain and physical function and
examining how the core and supplemental intervention components mediate changes in physical activity via
targeted mechanisms: program adherence, SDT targets (autonomy, competence, relatedness), and supportive
accountability. The overarching goal of this study is to build an optimized physical activity intervention for
adults with TKR using the supplemental non-automated components that were found to contribute significantly
to increases in physical activity. Once developed, this optimized intervention can be fully tested in a future trial.
Study findings have the potential to impact clinical practice, as this would represent a translatable model that
could be scaled within healthcare systems for adults with TKR."
10940937,"The goal of our proposed research program is to develop new spectroscopic methods capable of
providing enhanced insight into protein structure and dynamics within complex environments that
impact human health. We will apply these methods to study structural changes induced by
protein-protein and protein-surface interactions under conditions that are not accessible by other
experimental approaches. Our first research direction focuses on advancing the use of unnatural
amino acids (UAAs) beyond probes of local environment by taking advantage of the unique
spectral features provided by two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy to measure
vibrational couplings between UAA labels. These couplings depend sensitively on the distance
and relative orientation between UAA vibrational modes and thus can be used to map protein
structure. We will select UAAs modified with functional groups that have vibrational modes within
a biologically transparent region of the infrared spectrum, allowing us to probe the structure of
protein complexes and aggregates in biological media. We will use the Alzheimer’s β-amyloid
(Aβ) protein, the most studied self-assembling protein, in cerebrospinal fluid as a prototypical
system to develop and refine our approach into a broadly applicable method that will enable the
study of dynamic protein interactions that result in formation of protein complexes and aggregates
involved in a range of diseases. The Aβ studies will also allow us to bridge the gap between in
vitro aggregation studies and ex vivo fibril structures and gain unprecedented new insight into
physiologically relevant self-assembly pathways in Alzheimer’s disease. Our second research
direction aims to understand, for the first time, the detailed residue-level changes to protein
structure that occur when proteins interact with nanoparticle (NP) surfaces. NPs are ubiquitous in
our lives and are increasingly being considered for biomedical applications. However, the effect
of nanomaterials on living systems remains unclear. One concern is that proteins readily adsorb
onto the surfaces of NPs, which can result in changes to protein structure and thus function. Our
initial studies will examine the differing effects of NPs on the secondary structure of model
peptides and lysozyme, first with metallic NPs as a model system to understand the effects of NP
size and concentration, and then with silica NPs to examine the role of surface chemistry in
affecting structural changes. Machine learning-based approaches to enhance the sensitivity of
2D IR spectroscopy to site-specific labels will be developed to further improve structural
resolution. Ultimately, these studies will be expanded to understand the interactions between a
broader range of both nanomaterials and proteins in biologically relevant media."
10940492,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The mechanisms by which mammalian cells sense phosphate availability to maintain homoestasis of this critical
nutrient are unknown. Phosphate is indispensable for many biological functions including DNA and RNA
synthesis, bone formation, and preservation of energy as high energy phosphates. Consequently, serious
complications develop during phosphate deficiency, e. g. rhabdomyolysis, and during phosphate excess, e. g.
cardiovascular disease and vascular calcification. Genetic mutations that lead to massive phosphate excess are
associated with a premature aging syndrome. A hallmark of vascular calcification is induction of the sodium-
coupled phosphate transporter SLC20A1/PiT1, and SLC20A1 is also induced in aggressive cancers. SLC20A1
is 1) widely expressed, 2) provides phosphate for basic cellular functions, and is 3) massively upregulated in
phosphate-starved cells. To interrogate the mechanisms underlying SLC20A1 regulation and more broadly
phosphate homeostasis and sensing, we performed a set of complementary CRISPR-based genome-wide loss-
of-function genetic screens in phosphate-replete and in phosphate-starved cultured mammalian cells. We found
that proteostasis plays a crucial role in the regulation of SLC20A1 protein abundance through regulation of
protein degradation, recycling, and synthesis. We hypothesize that phosphate starvation is detected by thus far
unidentified phosphate sensing machinery, which leads to coordinated regulation of SLC20A1 degradation,
recycling, and synthesis resulting in increased SLC20A1 protein abundance. We will examine this hypothesis
through three independent yet synergistic projects. In Project 1, we will examine the mechanisms governing
SLC20A1 internalization and degradation. Interestingly, loss of one of our candidate negative regulators of
SLC20A1 degradation leads to a premature aging syndrome that closely resembles genetic syndromes with
phosphate excess. Therefore, we will examine if decreased SLC20A1 internalization and degradation with
dysregulated cellular phosphate uptake also leads to a premature aging phenotype. In Project 2, we will examine
the mechanisms for SLC20A1 recycling to the plasma membrane, which will also be informative for many other
proteins as this process is generally not well understood. In Project 3, we will examine the role of protein
synthesis in the regulation of SLC20A1 protein abundance. Each Project is designed to also identify members
of the underlying phosphate sensing machinery. Our ultimate goal is identification of novel pharmacological
targets for the treatment of hypo- and hyperphosphatemic patients, which makes these studies highly clinically
relevant."
10940795,"Abstract
The current drug discovery pipeline is flooded with challenging molecules, characterized by poor aqueous
solubility and/or low permeability. This necessitates the use of “enabling” formulation strategies, which are
specifically designed formulations to overcome the drug’s challenging properties, reducing attrition and enabling
the successful drug development and commercialization. However, the present formulation development
process is through trial-and-error and relies heavily on costly animal experiments. Consequently, the capacity of
the drug development process is highly limited, leading to early elimination of numerous otherwise promising
drug candidates. The ability to design formulations rationally and predict bioavailability accurately will greatly
save time and resource in drug development. This will allow more potent drug candidates to succeed through
development. Such advancements will not only enable more life-saving drugs to reach the market, but also
alleviate the financial burden on patients due to reduced drug development cost. Nonetheless, two main
processes involved in drug absorption remain poorly understood: the particle drifting effect, which determines
the extent to which submicron and micron sized drug particles and complexes facilitate absorption, and de-
supersaturation kinetics, which governs the rate at which the drug precipitates from solution, rendering it
unavailable for absorption. Several key unanswered questions are: 1. What are the key factors affecting these
two processes in vivo? 2. How can these processes be accurately predicted? 3. To what extent do these
processes influence drug absorption from different formulations, such as amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs)
and lipid-based formulations (LBFs)? Over the past few years, my group has systematically investigated the
particle drifting effect and de-supersaturation kinetics in vitro. I also have extensive expertise in ASDs, an
enabling formulation where the particle drifting effect and/or de-supersaturation dominate drug absorption. These
endeavors have positioned me well to provide mechanistic and quantitative insights of the complex drug
absorption process. To solve these unanswered questions, three research areas are proposed: 1. Systematically
evaluate the particle drifting effect in vitro and in vivo, develop mass transport models, and utilize physiologically-
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to predict drug absorption from ASDs; 2. Examine key factors affecting
de-supersaturation kinetics in vivo, develop suitable in vitro surrogate tests and kinetic models to predict de-
supersaturation in vivo; 3. Evaluate the particle drifting effect and de-supersaturation kinetics in LBFs, and
promote permeation enhancement and lymphatic uptake using suitable lipid excipients. Successful completion
of this proposal will contribute to model-based oral formulation development and more accurate bioavailability
prediction. These outcomes will enable more drug candidates to proceed through the development process,
reduce the need of animal pharmacokinetic studies, lower drug development cost, and ultimately save more
patients’ lives."
10940915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most studies in the field of feeding regulation have primarily concentrated on the impact of energy
homeostasis on feeding behavior, with less attention to the hormones and neural mechanisms governing
nutrient-specific feeding. Leveraging the genetic advantages and well-characterized nervous and gut
systems of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we aim to explore the neuronal mechanisms that underlie
nutrient-specific feeding regulation. Our preliminary findings highlight a specific group of Dh31R+/AstC+
neurons as target neurons for the gut-derived peptide Diuretic hormone 31 (Dh31) in regulating protein
consumption. Additionally, we have identified another subset of gut cells that are responsive to sucrose
intake and the essential role of its receptor in suppressing sucrose feeding. This proposal aims to investigate
the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying the regulation of dietary protein and sucrose consumption,
with a particular focus on how gut-derived peptide hormones, triggered by specific nutrient intake, activate
neural targets in the brain to govern nutrient- specific feeding regulation. Furthermore, we propose
identifying the central neural hub where various nutrient- specific feeding circuits converge to modulate food
intake. The proposed experiments include characterizing the neural substrate of the gut hormone Dh31
responsible for suppressing protein feeding (Aim 1), elucidating the satiety signal for sucrose and
understanding the neural mechanism governing sucrose feeding regulation (Aim 2), and identifying the
central hub that integrates signals for both protein and sucrose to regulate overall food intake (Aim 3). The
expected mechanistic insights from this research will illuminate the processes through which diverse
macronutrient signals influence feeding behavior, highlighting the interplay between gut-derived signals and
neural pathways."
10910990,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting nearly
1% of Veterans. Early and aggressive treatment of RA improves likelihood of remission and
reduces disability. Therefore, biomarkers identifying patients with high likelihood of developing
disease could stratify individuals who would benefit from early interventions aimed at preventing
disease and reducing disability. Such biomarkers may also provide insight into disease
mechanisms.
 Our overarching goal is to determine the role of human and microbial sRNAs in the
development of RA. The rationale for the proposed research is that sRNAs are powerful gene
regulators and markers of disease. We have found that circulating human and microbial sRNAs
are altered in established RA patients compared to control subjects, are associated with disease
measures and can alter inflammatory cellular pathways.
 Building on preliminary data, we will define circulating human (Aim 1) and microbial (Aim
2) sRNAs that predict development of RA and change between preclinical and clinical RA in
discovery and validation cohorts and identify the function of predictive sRNAs. Aim 3 will
determine if microbiome alterations in new-onset untreated RA are reflected in alterations in
plasma microbial sRNAs.
 The proposed research is significant because it will help us to identify patients with high
likelihood of developing RA, enabling us to identify individuals who would benefit from early
interventions aimed at preventing disease and reducing disability. The proposal is innovative
because it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of markers and mechanisms
underlying development of RA and our understanding of how the human microbiota can influence
immune function. The study is high impact because it could identify fundamental, targetable
mechanisms underlying developing RA and could lead to targeted sRNA therapeutics."

10911936,"Project 1: Summary/Abstract
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is one of the most common sarcomas and is a considerable therapeutic challenge
because 50% of patients develop metastases for which current chemotherapy provides clinical benefit to only a
small minority. We have shown that most LMS have chromosomal instability (CIN), which results in part from
defects in homologous recombination and from ubiquitous TP53 and RB1 inactivation. Our recent studies show
that these CIN aberrations are associated with hyper-dependency on DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK), which –
along with ATM and ATR – is a member of the PI3K-like kinase family of DNA damage response (DDR) enzymes.
DNA-PK is a key repair mechanism for double-strand DNA damage, thereby maintaining CIN below genotoxic
thresholds.
In Project 1, we wish to develop therapies that maximize intrinsic LMS genotoxic stress, particularly be targeting
DNA-PK and by discovering more selective ways to target the DNA-PK pathway. To this end, Aim 1 determines
whether relevant biomarkers (biochemical DNA-PK pathway activation, DNA damage response, and genomic
evidence of CIN) are found homogeneously within a metastasis and in different metastases from a given patient.
Aim 1 also determines whether partially vs. completely inactivating TP53 mutations have differing impact on LMS
CIN and DNA-PK activation levels and therefore differing predictive relevance with respect to therapies targeting
DNA-PK and DNA integrity. By determining if assays of DNA-PK activation and DNA damage are effectively
demonstrated by LMS IHC and genomic profiles, Aim 1 shows whether these assays can be used as robust and
reproducible correlative science assessments for our subsequent (Aim 3b) clinical trial combining low-dose
doxorubicin and DNA-PK inhibition. Aim 2 provides biologic insights needed to achieve efficacy and selectivity
for DNA-PK inhibition and other DDR-targeted therapies in LMS. These in vitro studies include DDR CRISPR-i
and CRISPR-a screens, which are performed with/without DNA-PKi, PARPi and doxorubicin treatment. The
CRISPR screens aim to discover DNA-PK inhibitor synthetic lethals and resistance mechanisms, and the biologic
insights from these screens are enhanced by performing RNAseq and phosphoproteome profiles in the same
LMS conditions, and by characterizing LMS cells with acquired resistance to DNA-PKi or doxorubicin. Aim 3 is
the clinical translation for Project 1, which encompasses in vitro, and murine preclinical validations and an initial
clinical trial of doxorubicin coupled with DNA-PK inhibition. Here we test the hypothesis that a very low dose of
doxorubicin sensitizes LMS cells to DNA-PKi, thereby converting CIN into a liability while minimizing
nonneoplastic cell toxicity."
