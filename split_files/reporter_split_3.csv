10653128,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the disease
tuberculosis (TB), is estimated to infect one-fourth of the world's population, resulting in approximately
1.6 million deaths each year. The emergence of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mtb strains
and the variable efficacy of the currently used vaccine, M. bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), are
barriers to the global control of TB. Thus, there is a critical need to better understand the mechanisms
of TB immunopathogenesis, as such mechanisms can be targeted to improve host control of Mtb
infection. The tubercle granuloma is long been considered a hallmark of TB. Our published data
suggest that the presence of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT)-containing
granulomas is indicative of protective granulomas that mediate Mtb control during TB latency. In
contrast, infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as neutrophils producing
proinflammatory molecules are characteristic of non-protective granulomas during pulmonary TB.
MDSCs are induced during pulmonary TB in humans, nonhuman primates (NHPs) and mice and
suppress protective T cell responses. Our new data show a protective role for the proinflammatory
cytokine, Interleukin (IL)-17 in dampening lung MDSC accumulation and limiting T cell suppression
in the lung during TB. Additionally, we show that the MDSC-derived proinflammatory proteins,
S100A8/A9 heterodimers are induced upon Mtb infection in humans, NHPs and mice. Furthermore,
S100A8/A9-expressing myeloid cells accumulate within the tubercle granuloma and amplify lung
MDSC accumulation to mediate Mtb susceptibility. In the current proposal, using mouse and NHP
models of TB, we will elucidate the mechanism(s) which regulate and promote MDSC accumulation
during TB, and characterize whether MDSCs and their pathways can be targeted as host-directed
therapeutics (HDTs) for TB. In Specific Aim 1, using gene deficient and conditional gene deficient
mouse models we will determine the IL-17-dependent pathways that limit MDSC accumulation during
TB. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of S100A8/A9 proteins in driving MDSC accumulation
and susceptibility to TB, and also determine whether blocking S100A8/A9 signaling will limit TB
relapse. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate if MDSC depletion can prevent TB progression in
nonhuman primates (NHPs). At the completion of the aims proposed here, we will have considerably
expanded our understanding of the Mtb-specific signaling pathways and factors that positively
(S100A8/A9 pathways) and negatively (IL-17 dependent pathways) regulate MDSC accumulation
during TB. Additionally, our translational studies in NHPs will enable the use of HDTs to limit MDSCs
during TB."

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, affect an estimated 3.1
million U.S. adults. IBD pathophysiology is complex and involves genetic, environmental, and immune responses
as well as alterations in gut microbial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. Recent studies from the Magness lab
in murine ileal organoids demonstrated that exposure to IL-22 favors progenitor cell expansion over intestinal
stem cell (ISC) self-renewal, and this phenotype is thought be regulated by activating Signal Transducer and
Activator of Transcription (STAT)-3. Further, new evidence has shown that the gut microbial SCFA, butyrate,
enhances IL-22 receptor expression and IL-22-induced activation of STAT3 in human colon cancer cells. While
mouse, organoid, and cancer cell lines have helped to advance the field, more physiologically relevant in vitro
human models are needed to increase accuracy and resolution of experiments aimed at predicting and
uncovering the response of human gut ISCs and differentiated epithelium to such IBD-relevant factors.
My aims will use a novel planar crypt-microarray (PCM) device and reporter cell lines to live-image primary
human colonic stem cells during their response to IBD-related perturbations. PCMs have already been optimized
for culture of mouse ISCs, and preliminary data demonstrates human ISC compatibility. Aim 1 will adjust factors
such as PCM membrane composition, thickness, and timing of apical/basal media changes to promote confluent
monolayers and compartmentalization of stem (Olfm4-EGFP) and differentiated (Muc2-BFP) cell zones. Using
human-optimized PCMs, I will test the central hypothesis that butyrate-stimulated IL-22 signaling enhances
asymmetric division and differentiation in human colonic ISCs. Aim 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9 indels to
induce a frameshift loss-of-function (LOF) mutation in IL-22 receptor subunit alpha 1 into a tetracycline-inducible
H2B::RFP (tetO-H2B::RFP) human colon stem cell line to test whether IL-22 signaling is necessary for
asymmetric division. The tetO-H2B::RFP fusion protein allows for controlled, sensitive analysis of cell division
dynamics in mammalian cells, with rapidly dividing cells corresponding to diluted RFP fluorescence intensity over
time. RFP label-retaining cells will be assessed for phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) via immunofluorescence
imaging on unsorted cell monolayers and for perturbed lineage pathways by FACS-scRNA-seq. The LOF model
will be compared against IL22RA1+ controls on PCMs to determine if asymmetric division is enhanced by
butyrate-stimulated IL-22 signaling. Our lab already has preliminary data for Olfm4-EGFP and H2B reporter lines.
In the outstanding training environment in Dr. Scott Magness’ group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, I will gain expertise in microfabrication and intestinal stem cell biology and learn new techniques in primary
human colon stem cell culture, single-cell biology/genomics, and bioinformatics. My career development training
plan focuses on research skills, professional development, and clinical skills to promote my path to independence
as an academic physician-scientist."

Progress towards HIV elimination will stall unless we overcome persistent drivers of new HIV infections by
jointly optimizing HIV treatment and effectively delivering HIV prevention modalities. We aim to determine how
to reduce HIV incidence to <0.1% using innovative strategies for HIV prevention and treatment to concurrently
reach “persistent driver” populations with scalable interventions optimized and evaluated in two phases.
• In Phase A (years 1-2), we will conduct individually randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to optimize the
 following prevention and treatment packages: 1) Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention with flexible Pre-
exposure/post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP) access integrated at family planning, antenatal care and
HIV clinics and at community Youth Hubs that generate demand by also offering provision of life-skills,
micro-finance and vocational training. 2) Dynamic Choice HIV Treatment with individual and system care
 options and services tailored for youth, men, mobile populations, and heavy drinkers.
• In Phase B (years 3-5), we will test the hypothesis that a multi-sector intervention, offering dynamic choice
of biomedical HIV prevention and treatment for persistent driver populations will increase viral suppression
 and prevention coverage and lead to a reduction in HIV incidence greater than standard of care.
Aim 1: Optimize dynamic prevention and treatment interventions: We will conduct RCTs of PrEP/PEP
dynamic prevention at multiple venues with high risk populations, and dynamic treatment interventions for
multiple populations with unsuppressed viral load. Primary efficacy outcomes (HIV prevention coverage and
viral suppression) will be used with implementation outcomes, costing, modelling projections, and stakeholder
input to optimize dynamic prevention and treatment intervention packages for Phase B.
Aim 2: a) Compare the effect of Dynamic Choice Prevention and Dynamic Choice Treatment
interventions vs. standard-of-care on prevention coverage, viral suppression, HIV incidence and
community health outcomes at 3 years. We will use a community randomized 2x2 factorial design to identify
effect of each intervention package and their combination on prevention coverage, viral suppression, and other
health outcomes. b) Elucidate pathways of intervention impact via evaluation of implementation and
process outcomes and of socio-behavioral pathways of action at the community, clinic, and individual levels.
Aim 3: Determine sustainability and inform policy. We will conduct multi-site costing of each aspect of the
multi-component intervention and estimate costs per HIV infection averted and impacts on multi-disease
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Modelling incorporating study data will be used to inform stakeholders
on anticipated long-term health impact and costs of alternative prevention and treatment strategies.
Significance: This study will address major knowledge gaps on how to overcome key factors fueling the HIV
epidemic that inform stakeholders and guide policies towards accelerating the path to HIV elimination."

Human norovirus (HuNoV) gastroenteritis is a significant public health burden worldwide. The lack of a robust
and reproducible HuNoV cell culture system still limits our ability to study fundamental aspects of HuNoV
infection. While several recent breakthroughs increased our ability to propagate HuNoVs in vitro (e.g. B cell
and human enteroid cultures), these systems are not robust enough, can be time consuming and expensive or
hard to replicate. The surrogate models available for HuNoV research do not necessarily reflect essential
biological features of HuNoVs and their natural host. In this proposal we will use our novel rhesus enteric
caliciviruses (ReCV) model that reflects the biological features and diversity of HuNoVs to identify host
determinants of infection. Zoonotic/interspecies transmission of ReCVs and HuNoVs between human and non-
human primate hosts suggests evolutionary conservation of shared factors of host susceptibility between the
two genera. Here we seek to identify host determinants of enteric calicivirus infection using CRISPR-Cas9
genome wide screening. We recently identified a functional ReCV entry receptor that is necessary for ReCV
permissiveness in cell culture. We hypothesize that the ReCV entry receptor is also involved in HuNoV
infections. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize receptor mediated
ReCV infection. Aim 2: Comparative characterization of HuNoV and ReCV infections in enteroid and B cell
cultures. In the first aim we will dissect the role of HBGAs in ReCV receptor mediated entry by using ReCV
isolates with disctinct HBGA binding, cell lines expressing different HBGAs and/or the receptor, Enterobacter
SENG-6 EPS and different synthetic HBGAs. We will also evaluate the role of the different transmembrane
isoforms of the receptor in infection and map the ReCV interaction site and importance of glycosylation. In the
second aim, we will evaluate the role of ReCV entry receptor in HuNoV infections in enteroid and B cell
cultures and identify other cell surface components playing a role in HuNoV infections. We will also evaluate
the mechanism of bile or bile salts in promoting HuNoV infections and the role of M cells in infections of
polarized cells. Our long-term goal is to identify and characterize viral and host determinants of ReCV and
HuNoV infections and to develop novel intervention/prevention strategies. Our proposal uses a novel enteric
calicivirus model to understand viral entry and the role of bile and HBGAs in enteric viral infections. Our
findings with ReCVs may be directly transferable to HuNoV infection. The major significance of this project is
the identification of determinants of susceptibility to enteric calicivirus infection that can lead to improved
HuNoV cell culture systems and new intervention/prevention strategies."

10845457,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a widely used treatment for hematologic cancers; however, many
survivors experience late effects that resemble an accelerated aging phenotype, or age-related functional
declines thought to be manifestations of aging at the cellular level. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that
HCT can accelerate biological aging in survivors by up to 15 years. Not all survivors experience these late
effects, suggesting that modifiable behavioral factors may influence vulnerability. Given the intense
psychological and biological demands of HCT, the recovery period may represent a “window of opportunity” in
which behavioral factors such as social support may exert a particular influence. Emerging evidence suggests
that social experiences can impact key biological aging pathways in non-cancer populations; however, whether
they contribute to variability in accelerated aging in HCT survivors has not been tested. The overarching goal
of the proposed research is to examine the influence of social relationships on biological and phenotypic aging
in HCT recipients over the first year of recovery. Specifically, this project will: (1) examine associations
between social processes and symptoms of phenotypic aging; (2) examine associations between social
processes and biological aging; (3) test biological aging as a mediator linking social processes and phenotypic
aging; and (4) explore sex differences in associations between social process and biological and phenotypic
aging. Adopting a prospective design, this research will comprehensively assess survivors’ social relationships
at critical 100-day and 1-year post-HCT time points by combining reports of social support, strain, and isolation
with an innovative, in vivo behavioral observation tool, the Electronically Activated Recorder, that captures
ambient sound bites to unobtrusively assess social interactions in survivors’ daily lives. Participants will provide
reports of symptoms to characterize phenotypic aging, including cognitive, physical (e.g., fatigue, pain, frailty),
and functional complaints, and blood samples to assess biological aging pathways, including cellular
senescence, inflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress assessed via genome-wide transcriptional
profiling. This research has the potential to identify concrete, modifiable behavioral targets that contribute to
biological and phenotypic aging processes in HCT recipients and can be used to develop biologically informed
interventions to improve quality of life and prolong the healthspan of individuals with accelerated aging. This
career development award will expand the candidate’s existing expertise in clinical health psychology and
behavioral research by providing training in biological and phenotypic aging and functional genomics in the
context of cancer survivorship. The proposed research, along with mentorship from a team of expert faculty
(Dr. Carroll, Dr. Bower, Dr. Seeman, and Dr. Cole), and the interdisciplinary environment and resources
available at UCLA, will prepare the candidate to become a fully independent research scientist in the field of
aging and biobehavioral health."
10654672,"Abstract
CYP1B1 is absent or expressed at very low levels in the liver and healthy tissues while being overexpressed in
tumors, giving it the title of “universal tumor antigen”. Evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological
studies demonstrate that CYP1B1 is involved in cancer initiation, progression, and resistance to a wide range of
chemotherapeutics. In addition, several point mutations have been discovered within CYP1B1 that are
associated with other disease states, particularly hereditary congenital glaucoma and metabolic disorders.
However, there is currently no known molecular mechanism that explains how mutations, altered protein levels,
and environmental conditions impact the function and dysfunction of this enzyme. We hypothesize that CYP1B1
subcellular localization, oligomerization, protein:protein assembly, degradation, and small molecule binding are
altered in cancer cells as a result of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms or environmental features.
Trafficking of CYP1B1 from the ER to the mitochondria, association into multimeric states, or generation of
abnormal protein:protein assemblies could result in damaging levels of the protein and, consequently, metabolic
products including ROS and mutagens that facilitate malignant progression. This work will demonstrate how the
protein:protein interactions of a cytochrome P450 enzyme impacts enzyme activity and protein lifecycle. Single
molecule microscopy methods and fluorescence lifetime microscopy imaging will be used to gain high resolution
information on protein assembly and activity in live cells. Additionally, paradigm-shifting inhibitors of this enzyme
will be developed that act though two distinct mechanisms: long-residence-time coordinative inhibition, and
activation of CYP1B1 degradation. Reduction of CYP1B1 protein levels and activity should suppress its role in
cancer progression, and is anticipated to facilitate restoration of efficacy for a variety of chemotherapeutics."
10663224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid are a socially and clinically vulnerable population who
account for a disproportionate amount of healthcare expenditures paid by both programs. Dual eligibles have a
higher burden of disease compared to Medicare only beneficiaries, with more than 20% of individuals having
multiple chronic conditions. Dually-enrolled beneficiaries also have worse cancer outcomes. They are less likely
to receive recommended screening, are less likely to receive definitive treatment after a cancer diagnosis, and
have a higher risk of cancer-specific mortality. The complex social and healthcare needs of dual eligibles present
a challenge in effectively delivering high-quality cancer care to these patients.
Accountable care organizations (ACOs) strive to provide coordinated, high-quality care to patients while
containing costs for payers. As Medicare’s predominant ACO model, the Medicare Shared Savings Program
(MSSP) has shown promise in improving quality of care, generating savings per beneficiary, and caring for
clinically vulnerable patients. Whether the MSSP increases the quality of care across the cancer continuum for
dual eligibles remains relatively unknown.
The proposed research investigates how much the MSSP ACO model improves quality of cancer care for a
clinically complex, vulnerable patient population. Aim 1 will estimate the effect of MSSP ACOs on breast and
colorectal cancer screening in dual eligibles ages 65-75. Aim 1 will involve a quasi-experimental approach using
an intention-to-treat difference-in-difference analysis with propensity score matching. Aim 2 will employ a time-
to-event survival analysis that will compare the time to treatment initiation after a primary breast or colorectal
cancer diagnosis for MSSP ACO-attributed dual eligibles ages 18 and older to non-ACO dual eligibles ages 18
and older. Aim 3 will assess Medicare spending on cancer treatment for dual eligibles ages 18 and older with
primary breast or colorectal cancer. Analysis of costs will use generalized linear models with a log-linked, gamma
distribution. Taken together, the results of these three aims will inform policymakers and providers on whether
value-based care reforms deliver better quality of care for dually enrolled beneficiaries.
Through this proposed research, the outlined training plan, and the guidance of a highly experienced mentorship
team, the applicant will be trained in various quantitative methods using large secondary datasets, strengthen
her clinical skills and thinking for providing care to a diverse patient population, and enhance her professional
skills that will make her a successful independent academic physician-scientist."

The proposed study will combine qualitative and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to
conduct an in-depth examination of polysubstance use among people who use illicit opioids at the person-
and event-levels. The overarching purpose of the research is to better understand the motivations, contexts,
timing and sequencing of polysubstance use and related implications for opioid overdose risk behavior.
Nearly three-quarters of fatal opioid overdoses in 2016 involved additional drugs. Studies tend to measure
polysubstance use in broad timeframes such as 6 months or 30 days, which misses potential variations in
patterns of use and cannot shed light on how substances are timed or combined. In addition, drug use is
episodic and informed by a variety of individual and situational factors. Although these factors are typically
measured through their statistical associations with polysubstance use, a different approach—examining
such factors in the proximate context of daily life—will enhance our understanding of polysubstance use in
general and polysubstance-related overdose risk in particular. We propose to conduct an intensive, mixed-
methods examination of polysubstance use in a community-based sample of people who use illicit opioids.
We will work with the Drug, Set, and Setting framework to examine both person- and event-level drug use
patterns, as well as set and setting characteristics, that influence polysubstance use. The Specific Aims
are: Aim 1: To use formative qualitative methods to explore and identify “set” and “setting” influences on
polysubstance use among people who use illicit opioids. Aim 2: To use EMA methods to investigate
polysubstance use timing, sequencing and drug combinations at the person- and event-level among people
who use illicit opioids. Aim 3: To combine EMA and qualitative methods to conduct an in-depth examination
of how “set” and “setting” factors are associated with polysubstance use at the person- and event-levels, with
special emphasis on risk behavior for overdose. The proposed research will be conducted in Oakland, CA,
with a community-based sample in a predominantly African American urban neighborhood. The proposed
study will generate rich multimethod findings regarding polysubstance use at the person and event levels.
Findings about proximate patterns of polysubstance can inform the next generation of overdose prevention
strategies, as well as contribute to a stronger understanding overall of polysubstance use for future
investigations."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are estimated to be among the most costly health conditions in
America, with the bulk of the costs stemming from the provision of long-term services and supports: that is,
help with everyday activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, using the toilet, eating, and moving around.
Family and friends provide most of this care, often at great financial, emotional, and physical expense to
themselves. This burden can be alleviated somewhat through a strong support system—a cohesive network of
family and friends coordinating and communicating to provide support to both the caregiver and the care
recipient—yet to date there is little research examining these support networks. This is surprising given that
stronger networks are consistently associated with better health outcomes. And this may be particularly true
for caregivers: because social networks change along with life transitions, caregiving potentially puts caregivers
at risk of social isolation and worsened health. The handful of prior studies on this topic have significant
limitations: namely, they focus on populations outside the U.S. or on older adults. This will be the first study to
collect data on the social networks of family caregivers in a nationally representative online panel study of
adults in the U.S., age 18 and over. Our aim is to identify family caregivers across the age spectrum to increase
representativeness, measure extended perceived caregiver networks, and capture greater detail on caregiver
network composition and structure (e.g. “weak” ties, negative ties, frequency of contact, emotional closeness, or
type of ties). We will examine common network typologies and their associations with a variety of measures of
physical, mental, and social well-being, and we will test for potential mediating factors, including the
caregiving context and care recipient health. Finally, we will examine change in caregivers’ social networks and
how it may be associated with caregiver health over the caregiving cycle. This work will help researchers and
policymakers identify the network characteristics of caregivers that matter most for a variety of health and
well-being outcomes over time. It is also a critical first step for collecting empirical data that can inform the
development of caregiving interventions that incorporate social network-based interventions—for example,
technology-based interventions that provide personalized network visualizations to trigger strategies for
altering networks (e.g., dropping ties, connecting disconnected ties, or spending more time with supportive
network members)—to improve the health and well-being not only of adults with dementia but also of their
caregivers."
10654723,"ABSTRACT
Fracture nonunion poses a significant clinical problem. In the United States, approximately 1.6 million bone
fractures encounter prolonged healing or nonunion each year. Fracture nonunion treatment usually involves
complicated and massive procedures in practice, and sometimes needs multiple surgeries, therefore increases
the cost of health care and results in marked patient disability. The major population bearing with these clinical
complications are patients with inflammatory conditions, e.g, elder patients, smoking, diabetic or rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) patients, highlighting the potential deleterious role of chronic systemic inflammation in fracture
r epair.
 The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic inflammation results in fracture nonunion
through Dnmt3b downregulation mediated angiogenesis defect, and local delivery of OPN and CXCL12 restores
angiogenesis and fracture repair under inflammatory conditions. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary
data wherein we show that Dnmt3b is highly expressed in fracture callus during fracture repair and Dnmt3b is
the major DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) responsive to cytokines in MPCs. Relevant to our proposal, we provide
evidence that inflammatory signals inhibit Dnmt3b in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Consistently, mice with
Dnmt3b loss-of-function (LOF) in chondrocytes display impaired angiogenesis and fracture repair; and Dnmt3b
gain-of-function (GOF) in chondrocytes shows protective effect from inflammation in vitro and accelerates
fracture repair in mice. Mechanistically, angiogenesis defect mediated by inflammation and Dnmt3b LOF
coincide with downregulation of OPN (Osteopontin) and CXCL12 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12) and
exogenous OPN and CXCL12 can restore angiogenesis capacity in vitro. To further examine the efficacy of local
delivery of OPN and CXCL12 in vivo, we have developed an optimized biomaterial sheet loaded with OPN and
CXCL12 and showed a robust angiogenesis process and a restoration of fracture union in RA mice.
 Three main Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will delineate the mechanism by which
inflammation reduces angiogenesis via downregulating Dnmt3b during fracture repair. Specific Aim 2 will
determine the optimal release kinetics of OPN and CXCL12 on angiogenesis. Specific Aim 3 will determine the
therapeutic effect of sustained OPN and CXCL12 release on angiogenesis and fracture nonunion in mice. The
proposed studies will enhance our understanding of mechanisms by which systemic inflammation (via the NF-
κB pathway) affects the angiogenic process through Dnmt3b. This work will establish an important therapeutic
option to improve the angiogenesis and fracture healing."

The long-term vision of the Vanderbilt Digestive Diseases Research Center (VDDRC) is to continue to inspire
interest in the study of digestive diseases and perform paradigm-shifting science that translates to benefit for the
patients and communities we serve. The collaborative VDDRC research base is multidisciplinary (88 faculty in
10 Departments; 58 Full members, 30 Associate members), and highly productive as evidenced by 1) 444 peer-
reviewed publications (57% collaborative) including 89 in journals with impact factors >10, and 2) robust funding
support which increased from $24.7M to $27M (31% NIDDK) since the last competing renewal. The
overarching theme that galvanizes members is the study of microbial and host constituents that impact
digestive disease pathobiology within the context of inflammation and the environment, and investigative
interests fall into three interactive areas: 1) Gastrointestinal Infections and Injury; 2) Progenitor Cells,
Development, Regeneration, and Pre-malignant Lesions; and 3) Obesity, Metabolism, and Nutrition. The
VDDRC supports four cutting-edge Cores: 1) Cell Imaging, 2) Flow Cytometry, 3) Translational Analysis,
and 4) Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics. These cores are highly utilized and well integrated into the Center and
provide members with the latest advances in technology. Based directly on investigator demand, we augmented
VDDRC Core offerings by adding, among other services: lightsheet microscopy and cryo-EM; spectral high-
throughput flow cytometry; inductively coupled MS; as well as digital histology, multiplex IF/IHC, and state-of-
the-art probe development for molecular small animal imaging within a strategically reorganized Translational
Analysis Core. The VDDRC has now expanded member access to institutional Core services through an
innovative Complementary Awards Program supported by new institutional funds ($125K), and extended the
impact of the institutionally-supported ($125K) VDDRC Academy of Investigators by using new NIDDK and
Academy funds to launch a Diversity Initiative targeting underrepresented minority researchers. A strong Pilot
and Feasibility Program generated a 32:1 return on investment for NIH funds over the last 10 years and
96% of awardees remain active in GI research. The Pilot Program receives institutional support of $100K/year
and we have now established new partnerships with Vanderbilt Centers to co-fund additional content-appropriate
Projects. A responsive Administrative Core oversees financial management and operations and contains a
Biostatistical Component and an Enrichment Program, which sponsors seminars and retreats to promote
scientific collaboration and the development of new initiatives. The VDDRC also broadened its impact as 1)
member publications involved collaborators at 504 institutions worldwide, and 2) the Center is now engrafted within
a newly minted NIDDK-funded Eastern Regional DDRCC Alliance to promote the professional development
of junior faculty. These accomplishments exemplify the ability of the VDDRC to function as a highly effective
catalyst that both coalesces and promotes high-impact collaborative GI research."

Healthy ‘phagocytosis’ — a process by which foreign cells such as tumor cells and apoptotic debris are
engulfed and removed by inflammatory monocytes and macrophages — is a defense against cancer, including
breast cancer. However, phagocytosis against cancer can become inhibited by ‘don’t eat me’ signaling caused
by overexpression of CD47 on the surface of solid tumor cells.
Remarkably, anti-CD47 antibodies can restore phagocytosis of tumor cells, causing tumors to shrink or
stabilize. Unfortunately, these antibodies may also sometimes have severe side effects, especially anemia and
reticulocytosis.
This project addresses the challenge of restoring phagocytosis against solid tumors via the CD47 pathway
without the side effects of anti-CD47 antibodies. We will do this by testing nanoparticles we developed to
selectively deliver small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme SHP1 intracellularly into inflammatory monocytes
and macrophages within breast tumors. SHP1 is part of the CD47 signaling pathway within macrophages and
an excellent target for restoring phagocytosis without side effects.
Strong evidence indicates our nanoparticles can act as a kind of Trojan horse to deliver small molecule drugs
selectively into inflammatory monocytes and macrophages that infiltrate solid tumors. We will reveal the
mechanisms of: A) selective nanoparticle uptake; and B) in vivo nanoparticle delivery of SHP1 inhibitors in 2
murine breast cancer models. Aim 1 will identify the nanoparticle uptake receptor and elucidate the
mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake and persistence in tumors. Aim 2 will test nanoparticles for selectively
releasing SHP1 inhibitors inside inflammatory macrophages, then restoring phagocytosis and shrinking tumors
in vivo without causing anemia and reticulocytosis.
Impact: This project will advance understanding of the CD47 pathway in cancer, develop an intracellular
therapeutic approach to inhibit CD47-related signaling, help remove a major barrier to progress in oncology —
the lack of selective drug delivery into inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, and advance design
principles for translational therapies based on in vivo immune cell selectivity."
10820536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal outgrowth of
hematopoietic cells with a somatically acquired mutation most commonly in JAK2 (JAK2V617F), which leads to
excessive production of myeloid lineage cells. Patients with early stage MPN can spontaneously progress to
myelofibrosis, a more aggressive stage of the disease with an average survival rate of two years. Moreover,
MPN patients have a significant risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The traditional approach to
therapy in MPN is simply to reduce the risk of blood clots with aspirin, manage symptoms, and observe for
progression of the disease. Therapeutic intervention is focused on patients with late stage disease, mostly due
to the lack of currently available therapies that halt progression. There is thus a need for interventions that impact
disease progression in MPN. Preliminary work by the laboratory of Dr. Fleischman, in collaboration with
mathematical modelers Komarova and Wodarz, has shown that inflammation can accelerate the growth rate of
JAK2V617F mutant cells relative to JAK2WT cells, and that this can potentially have a variety of consequences for
the evolution of mutant cells at homeostasis. This suggests the possibility of a new treatment modality for early
stage MPN, in which the evolutionary fate of the JAK2V617F mutants is altered and disease progression is delayed
or halted. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate how this can be achieved. In Aim 1, experiments are
proposed that document the dynamics of JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mutant cells in isolation with and without
inflammation for the purposes of model construction and parameterization. We will also interrogate the
intracellular mechanisms responsible for the differential response of JAK2V617F mutants to inflammation. In Aim
2 we will perform experiments in which JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mutant cells are combined in mouse models with
and without inflammation. This will quantify how the number of mutants influence the kinetic parameters of wild-
type cells, which is important because we know that mutants themselves can increase inflammation and hence
alter the dynamics. In Aim 3 we will measure how a panel of existing drugs impact the kinetic parameters of cells
and use our model to predict combinations and dosing schedules that will lead to diminution of the mutant cells.
Many treatment scenarios (in sequence and in combination) will be explored, and the most promising therapeutic
approaches predicted by the model will be tested experimentally. This can identify better and currently unknown
ways in which to utilize existing drugs. On a more exploratory level, the validated mathematical model can
suggest which parameter(s) to target in which ways to make treatment more efficient than can be currently done.
This information would facilitate development of future treatments and guide drug discovery and could be
translated into a future clinical trial."

development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an
emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal
analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and
interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development
and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan
comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge
gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari
Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in
machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development.
Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to
conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working
stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as
an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong
cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs."
10653125,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mean age of first-time mothers is on the rise, with serious consequences for maternal health and that of
their offspring. Older maternal age is strongly associated with birth defects, miscarriage, and infertility. These
poor reproductive outcomes can frequently be traced back to defects in follicular and oocyte quantity and quality
that occur with ovarian aging. A continuous decline in the quantity of ovarian follicles (i.e. the “ovarian reserve”)
occurs during reproductive aging, as the pool of primordial follicles is continuously depleted. Additionally, oocyte
quality declines as follicles and oocytes accumulate DNA damage over time, a process which accelerates even
more rapidly when the ovary is exposed to gonadotoxins. There is therefore an urgent need to better understand
the mechanisms that control follicular and oocyte quantity and quality in order to support the health of women
and their children. The noncoding RNAs H19 and let-7 play essential roles in mammalian development, but little
is known about their role in ovarian follicle growth and oocyte function. We have uncovered a plausible
mechanism for noncoding-RNA-based regulation of follicular health via the H19/let-7 pair. We previously showed
that H19 binds and antagonizes the miRNA let-7. We also demonstrated that in the absence of H19, ovarian
AMH expression is decreased, follicular recruitment is accelerated, and fertility is compromised. We have
observed that AMH has a functional let-7 binding site, suggesting a ncRNA-mediated mechanism for AMH
regulation by H19 via let-7. Moreover, our preliminary data suggests altered response to DNA damage in the
absence of H19. Thus, there is plausible mechanistic insight into, and strong support for, the role of H19 and let-
7 in the regulation of follicular/oocyte recruitment and function. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of H19 in E2-
and AMH-mediated regulation of follicle quantity. In Aim 2, we will determine whether ovaries of H19KO mice
are more susceptible to DNA damage than their WT counterparts. Lastly, for Aim 3, we will determine whether
the abnormal follicular development and expression of DNA damage genes observed in H19KO mice is
mediated via let-7 and identify changes in the transcriptome of somatic cells and oocytes related to loss of
H19. Our approach is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by
defining noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as major regulators of oocyte quantity and quality, and has the potential to
lead to novel, ncRNA-based treatments for a broad range of reproductive disease states."

 Despite much progress in mapping genetic associations for T2D, its complications, and related traits,
the underlying causal variants, effector genes, and gene networks are not well understood. The AMP-T2D
consortium aims to accelerate the pace by which these disease mechanisms are elucidated, through
generation and integration of novel genomic data interrogating genetic associations. This project addresses
RFA-DK-19-505 “Limited Competition for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) in Type 2 Diabetes
Knowledge Portal (UM1)” and will be conducted by the leaders of the current AMP T2D Knowledge Portal
(T2DKP). Its goal is to continue development of the T2DKP by enhancing its infrastructure to aggregate,
analyze, and visualize genetic and genomic datasets and results, thereby helping to identify causal risk
variants and effector genes for T2D and its complications.
 The goal of specific aim 1 is to enhance the data and knowledge base for the T2DKP. It will enhance
the T2DKP software platform to represent additional classes of ‘omic and phenotypic data, integrate datasets
relevant to AMP-T2D within a federated data warehouse, develop new methods and analytical pipelines to
analyze these data, and enable them to be accessed by download or application programming interfaces
(APIs). The goal of specific aim 2 is to enhance the publicly accessible T2DKP web interface. It will develop
new web modules to visualize datasets within the T2DKP, extend the T2DKP with tools from external public
genomic databases, maintain curated knowledge lists for T2D and its complications, allow users to customize
data and tools shown within the T2DKP, and update the T2DKP in response to stakeholder feedback. The goal
of specific aim 3 is to coordinate the AMP-T2D consortium. It will provide operational support for AMP-T2D
investigators, foster collaborations with external partners, track and ensure the timely release of AMP-T2D
datasets, administer an opportunity pool to fund additional AMP-T2D projects, and conduct outreach and
training on the T2DKP.
 Significance: The project would extend the T2DKP with new capabilities to integrate and display
datasets with information regarding causal variants, effector transcripts, and gene networks for T2D and its
complications. Public access to these data and results will significantly accelerate efforts to identify new
therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, or reverse T2D and its complications."

 This Great Lakes Native American Research Centers for Health (GLNARCH) application aligns
established partnerships to promote a network of resources for AI/AN programs as well as support ongoing
successful initiatives. We have identified opportunities to establish synergistic education, training, and research
within the Indian Health Service Bemidji Region with increased focus on including Tribal Colleges and
Universities (TCUs). This application proposes an unprecedented endeavor to engage AI/AN
populations in an indigenized (culturally responsive) research and training agenda. This agenda will
follow the common AI/AN cultural theme of holistic health and wellness connected to the land and the unique
natural resources of the Great Lakes region. The Student Career Enhancement Project (SCEP) proposes
exciting updates to the highly successful program that will expose AI/AN students to remote learning, thereby
connecting them in an indigenous styled network whilst also preparing them for 21st century education. The
Capacity Building Project (referred to as NEHR) is responsive to recent experiences and evaluation reports to
seek even better research networks and resource sharing within the GLNARCH service area, which is
geographically broad and underfunded. The Native American Environmental Health Research (NERH) network
will better engage TCUs and tribal serving institutions. The pilot project, “Healing from Within”, is an integrated
strength-based, survivor-led, and culturally specific investigation to address the intersecting barriers to help-
seeking for American Indian women after experiences of gender-based violence. The proposed team has
successfully implemented over 17 years of successful and impactful GLNARCH programming. They possess
the necessary skills, institutional environment, and connections to execute these aims."

10863808,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The long-term goal of our research program is to develop general and selective nitrogen atom transfer
methods that can generate new molecular entities through precise functionalization of both complex molecules
and simple commodity chemicals. A large number of therapeutic molecules and small-molecule biological
probes have at least one nitrogen atom; therefore, synthetic methods based on direct nitrogen atom transfer to
organic molecules are important synthetic tools. Although a variety of valuable olefin amination methods have
been established, new selective nitrogen atom transfer methods based on novel reaction mechanisms are still
urgently needed which can be effective and exquisitely selective across a broad range of substrates and
thereby fill important gaps of existing synthetic approaches. Inspired by these outstanding synthetic challenges,
we intend to discover new reactivity in three directions of selective nitrogen atom transfer and we will develop
new synthetic methods that hold the promise to become unique and enabling tools for organic synthesis and
medicinal chemistry.
 First, we will explore uncharted territory in iron catalysis and discover the iron-catalyzed olefin
amination that does not involve radical intermediates and would thereby be compatible with a range of
functional groups which are problematic with the alternative amination methods. Completion of this project will
provide effective methods for selective olefin amination in complex molecules. Next, we will discover a
fundamentally new cis-glycosylation reaction that does not proceed through an oxocarbenium ion and develop
a series of iron-catalyzed one-step glycal amidoglycosylation methods that efficiently connect glycals and
glycosyl acceptors to selectively afford 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages that are known to be difficult to form
reliably in high stereoselectivity using traditional glycosylation methods. Completion of this project will provide
an array of unique methods that fill an important gap in complex-carbohydrate synthesis. Furthermore, we will
explore an entirely new HN3 activation mechanism and develop a range of metal-free methods that enable
direct addition of HN3 at ambient temperature across a wide variety of unactivated olefins for azido-group
labeling of complex molecules. Completion of this project will provide a valuable tool of azido-group labeling for
applications in synthetic chemistry and chemical biology."
10845596,"Our research group addresses fundamental questions concerning how nucleic acids are damaged and what the
biochemical consequences of damage are. We also capitalize on the fundamental discoveries made in these
investigations to create enzyme inhibitors, radiosensitizing agents, and tools that are useful in biotechnology. To
bring these research projects to fruition, we utilize organic chemistry, biochemistry, as well as molecular and cell
biology. Over more than two decades, this research approach has enabled us to uncover novel pathways of
DNA damage, adjudicate mechanistic controversies, and reveal biochemical effects of damaged DNA that
illustrate that nucleic acid damage itself is not always the end of the story. We request support to continue all 3
aspects of this research program. We will utilize our ability to independently generate reactive intermediates to
elucidate questions concerning oxidative damage in free and nucleosomal DNA. For instance, we will examine
the reactivity of nitrogen radicals, which we demonstrated are capable of initiating tandem lesion formation via
hydrogen atom abstraction, unlike most carbon radicals. Tandem lesions are a deleterious form of DNA damage
that are a hallmark of g-radiolysis. Some of the nitrogen radicals are also chameleon-like in that their pKa's are
sufficiently high that reasonable quantities of the respective radical cations are present at neutral pH. Radical
cations are important species produced from the direct effect of ionizing radiation and initiate hole transfer in
DNA. We will study hole transfer in nucleosomal DNA by independently generating radical cations in nucleosome
core particles (NCPs) at defined sites. This will enable us to determine the effects of NCP structure on hole
migration, a topic that is of increasing interest due to the realization that hole transfer is important in signaling
between proteins and DNA. Efforts on understanding the effects of DNA damage will focus on chemistry in NCPs
and the consequences of DNA damage-induced histone modification. We will build upon our discoveries that
alkylated DNA forms DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) with histones and that histone catalyzed chemistry of
oxidized abasic sites results in modification of lysine residues. These studies will range from experiments in test
tubes to cells to determine the prevalence of histone modifications formed in cells and to identify their biochemical
(""downstream"") effects. We will also determine whether DPC formation occurs in NCPs when DNA is alkylated
in the minor groove. Finally, we will utilize halogenated purines to potentiate the effects of DNA alkylation by
stabilizing the DPCs formed. This research will contribute to our fundamental understanding of DNA damage
and its connection to the etiology and treatment of disease."

10840773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This overall goal of this application is to create an infrastructure for supporting and augmenting neuroimaging
research in the National Institute of Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADC) Program. The ADC program is
comprised of 30 centers that pursue research goals dedicated to increasing our understanding of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) with a view towards improving diagnosis, care, and treatment of patients. Over the past decade,
neuroimaging has played an increasingly important role in this mission, as new approaches to measuring brain
structure, function, and biochemistry have produced biomarkers useful in diagnostic, mechanistic, and
therapeutic studies. At the same time, methods for standardization of neuroimaging have become accepted,
such that, despite the complexity and cost of imaging, we have the ability to combine images obtained at
different centers in order to answer important questions about AD that require large datasets. This project will
focus on standardizing approaches to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography
(PET) images. MR standardization will address structural and functional (task-free) MRI, and PET
standardization will address amyloid, tau, and glucose metabolic imaging. We will work with the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) to develop protocols for securely uploading and de-identifying all
images at a NACC image repository, where a searchable database will also be available to researchers. We
will develop standards for MR and PET image acquisition, and make these imaging protocols available to the
ADC community. Uploaded images will undergo rigorous quality control and processing to permit merging of
images obtained on different platforms and, for PET, at different resolutions. Laboratories that have specialized
in image processing will produce numerical summary data of brain cerebrovascular pathology, brain volumes,
perfusion, diffusion, and cortical thickness, amyloid and tau deposition, and glucose metabolism. These
numerical variables will be stored at NACC where it will be linked to other ADC-related data on participants and
made available to researchers. Additional aspects of the program will include a website with documentation,
search functions, and user help functions. The administrative structure of the project will involve an executive
committee with membership from the participating laboratories as well as representation from the NACC, the
ADCs, and NIA. Leadership will remain apprised of changes in the neuroimaging landscape, and incorporate
new MR and PET measures as they develop with the overall goal of standardizing and disseminating agreed-
upon best practices while not stifling the development of new, innovative technical advances."
10656562,"We propose to create VOrtex, a Virtual Observatory for the Cortex: Spanning the Scales of Organelles, Cells,
Circuits, and Dynamics. The observatory will disseminate an existing dataset: an automated reconstruction of
all cells in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the synaptic connectivity of the neurons and
calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. The cubic millimeter volume spans all layers of cortex and four
visual areas (V1, LM, AL, RL).
 A team of human proofreaders will detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated
segmentation. Such semiautomated reconstruction by “proofreading” is much faster than manual tracing of
neurons. Considerable human proofreading effort is still required, however, due to the enormous scale of the
data. Our cubic millimeter volume is 35x larger than an entire Drosophila brain, and 70x larger than the Janelia
fly “hemibrain.”
 The proofreading team can be viewed as a new kind of scientific instrument. Just as a telescope is
directed by the astronomy community, proofreading efforts should be directed by the neuroscience community.
Based on requests from users (target cells, scientific rationale), the proofreading schedule will be decided by a
scientific steering committee. The committee will consist of representatives from five subfields: neuronal cell
biology, glial cell biology, cortical cell types, cortical circuits, and theory/simulation. Our novel approach of
centralized labor, but distributed governance, combined with fast public releases of proofreading updates,
should accelerate scientific discovery.
 The proofreading team will follow established quality control procedures, and quantitative metrics of
accuracy will be maintained. Updates to the reconstructed wiring diagram will be made on an at least quarterly
basis. Interactive viewing of the EM images and automated segmentation will be possible from any site with an
internet connection. Users may execute large-scale computational analyses on their local clusters or
commercial cloud through programmatic downloading of the data using our CloudVolume software. A
community manager will solicit proofreading requests from the user community, design a proofreading
schedule that maximizes fulfillment of requests, and propose the schedule to the steering committee. The
manager will also recruit users and help them with the mechanics of accessing the data. The Allen Institute will
continue to educate in the use of this data at The Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain.
 The VOrtex will provide fundamental knowledge about the cortex. The cell biology of neurons and glia
is relevant for brain diseases, and the normal wiring diagram of the cortex could be relevant to the search for
connectopathies."

UC END-DISPARITIES will address the inequitable multilevel factors that promote cardiometabolic disease,
including hypertension, diabetes, and complications such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and chronic
kidney disease. These conditions are highly influenced by structural disadvantage and disproportionately affect
low-income, minoritized, and other marginalized groups in the highly diverse and contiguous region of Los
Angeles County (LAC) and Orange County (OC) (combined population over 13M; > 46 states). The Center will
fill a gap in the current efforts to advance health equity via a multilevel community-academic partnered
approach to improve cardiometabolic related health outcomes in targeted LAC and OC Latino, Black, Asian,
Pacific Islander, and American Indian communities, which have some of the highest rates of cardiometabolic
risk factors and premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the nation. UC END-DISPARITIES will
function through three highly integrated cores and three inaugural center research projects across
southern California, all supporting Pilot Awards and Community Catalyst Awards, while leveraging
synergies with key community-academic networks, community, public health, and health system stakeholders,
regional networks of minority-serving institutions, centers at UCLA and UCI for clinical and translational
science, and methodologic leaders with expertise in health equity research, biostatistics, implementation
science, and health information technology. The Administrative Core, Investigator Development Core, and

10612789,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of
oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or
neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to
assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical
trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a
dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification
system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE.
However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and
confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity.
There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at
risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions,
has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has
been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now
have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as
well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside.
We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive
models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic
and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort
study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our
specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal
acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2)
Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and
uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most
predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external
validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning
techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal
clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part
of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary
study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing
unnecessary cesarean sections."
10889057,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
The Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases (abbreviated as CMSDLD) is a NIH/NIDDK
Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) where it has served as the nidus for the expansion of
digestive and liver disease research at the University of Pennsylvania for the past 25 years and successfully
promoted interdisciplinary interactions spanning multiple departments, institutes, and schools at the University.
The CMSDLD has witnessed robust and vibrant growth in scientific research, collaborations and interactions
between members, maturation of the initial young investigator base and incorporation of new associate
members, vigorous use and evolution of state-of-the-art scientific core facilities, cohesion-fostering enrichment
activities, and a highly successful pilot and feasibility grant program. This has led to a marked increase in
institutional support from the leadership of Penn Medicine and The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP),
with growing collaborative interactions with the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (aka Corporal Michael J.
Crescenz VA Medical Center) uniquely positioning the CMSDLD for success in the current decade and beyond.
The impact that the environmental factors such as diet and the gut microbiota play in health and disease,
particularly related to the GI tract and liver, is enormous but incompletely understood especially in humans. At
UPenn, there is now an unprecedented opportunity to leverage resources, technologies and collaborative
multidisciplinary expertise to address gaps in knowledge and unmet needs relating to these issues. The
membership of the research base has gradually evolved to investigations relevant to the new theme of the
Center: Host-environmental interactions in digestive and liver disease research from bench to bedside.
The research base of the Center now consists of 45 full and 14 associate members streamlined into three
research themes, (1) Intestinal Biology; (2) Liver Biology; and (3) The Microbiome, supported by four biomedical
research cores: Genetically Modified Mouse Core, Molecular Pathology and Imaging Core, Host-Microbial
Analytic and Repository Core, and the Biomedical Data Science Core (Clinical Core). The membership maintains
a strong base of digestive and liver disease research funding of $35.3 million dollars annual directs (32.3%
NIDDK) representing a significant increase in total DDN research funding, an increase in %NIDDK funding, and
greater cohesion. Greater emphasis on translational and human subject research and, with the addition of a new
core on ‘big data’ analytics, provides enhanced opportunities for collaborations focused on host-environmental
interactions. Finally, the Center continues to develop the future of research in digestive and liver diseases by
actively supporting trainees and junior faculty with enrichment activities and by attracting new researchers
through our Pilot and Feasibility Award program that has resulted in significant R01 funding for our awardees."
10848300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of our Digestive Health Center (DHC): Bench-to-Bedside Research in Pediatric
Digestive Disease is to promote research that will yield insights into the fundamental processes and pathogenic
mechanisms of digestive disease in children and generate innovative treatment to restore digestive health. The
Cores aims are: 1) to strengthen the Research Base and foster collaborations, 2) to catalyze discoveries by
giving investigators access to highly innovative Cores, and 3) to develop junior investigators and the future
leaders in the field. The last award period of the DHC was very successful, with Core services that evolved to
meet the scientific needs of innovative investigators. Our Research Base of 68 investigators attracts $36.5
million of extramural digestive disease-related funds annually; they published 630 articles in the last 4 years.
Several Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Awardees transitioned to R01-funded investigators and the entire research
community benefitted from a scientific Enrichment Program presenting the latest advances in digestive disease
research. This trajectory of success will be pursued in future years by fostering research and promoting
interdivisional and interdepartmental collaboration to maintain a solid critical mass in digestive disease research
with a focus on translational research. Specifically, our long-term goals are to improve child health through
better diagnosis, treatments and outcomes that will emerge from highly innovative work in our three key
focus areas: 1) Mechanisms of Liver Disease modeling, 2) Digestive Disease and Immunity, and 3) Stem
Cell and Organoid Modeling of Digestive Diseases. Each focus area brings opportunities for potential impact
on the digestive health of children, helps advance the national research agenda, and creates a unique
environment to integrate research into patient care. The focus areas are linked by three complementary and
uniquely innovative Biomedical Research Cores (Gene Analysis Core, Integrative Morphology Core, and
Stem Cell/Organoid Core and Genome Editing Core) and by a Clinical Component of the Administrative
Core to facilitate patient-based research. Collectively the Cores and the Clinical Component form a powerful
infrastructure that fosters the development of personalized and predictive medical approaches based on the
genetics and molecular basis of GI disorders, and of therapies that take into account basic mechanisms of
disease. Our working model promotes laboratory discoveries to generate translational research opportunities
that lead to validation in patient samples and lead to clinical trials. To strengthen digestive disease research, the
DHC will foster collaborations among its investigators and investigators from other disciplines. It will also fund
highly promising P/F Projects for junior investigators and will sponsor a dynamic Enrichment Program of
scientific seminars, workshops and symposia. With these strategies and an exceptionally supportive
institution, the DHC is well positioned to catalyze translational research in pediatric digestive disease."

proposed intervention projects target community and primary care approaches to diet, physical activity,
smoking cessation, and other proximal contributors to CVD and RCC among Minnesota’s diverse BIPOC
communities. C2DREAM will promote innovative, multilevel interventions that target fundamental causes of
health inequities among diverse BIPOC communities across Minnesota; generate knowledge, analytical and
implementation approaches, and community engagement strategies to understand and develop solutions to
address racism at multiple levels; develop and support the next generation of health equity researchers; create
and sustain a community-engaged and equity-guided dissemination and implementation processes to translate
research results and knowledge regarding addressing chronic disease inequities into action; and employ
equity-guided evaluation approaches. All center activities and research projects are aligned with a unifying

10756923,"Project Summary
 Tuberculosis (TB) killed 1.3 million people in 2017 and is the most deadly infectious disease in the world.
Infections caused by drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can be cured. But treatment
regimens are long, requiring at least 6 months of therapy with multiple drugs. TB has become increasingly
difficult to treat due to the global spread of drug resistant strains. Such strains account for at least 5% of
infections, and the cure rate for those patients is low. New drugs are urgently needed to treat drug-resistant
strains, but drug development is a slow and costly process.
 But what if clinically-approved β-lactam antibiotics could be repurposed to treat TB and drug resistant TB?
This would significantly speed up patient access to new therapies. Since the 1990s, there have been
occasional reports of TB infections responding to β-lactam antibiotics. For example, amoxicillin/clavulanate
and meropenem/clavulanate have been used successfully to treat patients with drug resistant TB. β-lactam
antibiotics target enzymes in the cells wall. Targets include penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and the
recently discovered L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs). Both classes of enzyme are critical to survival because they
maintain the structure and rigidity of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall.
 We propose to develop new molecular probes to identify and validate β-lactam drug susceptibility in
mycobacteria. Our approach facilitates monitoring multiple PBPs and LDTs at once, enabling a
comprehensive examination of these enzymes. We will detect enzymes in protein gel-resolved lysates using
activity-based probes (ABPs) derived from the major classes of β-lactam drugs. Identifying drugs with activity
against dormant mycobacteria is a high-priority. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use ABPs to profile the
regulation of PBPs and LDTs in dormant, reactivating, and actively-replicating Mtb. In Aim 2, we will
determine the drug selectivity and inhibitor profiles for the Mtb PBPs and LDTs following exposure to
clinically-approved β-lactam antibiotics. In Aim 3, we will investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of the
LDTs. In Aim 4, we will extend our findings to a second high-priority mycobacterial pathogen: M. abscessus.
 Upon successful completion of this project, we will have an effective approach for assessing the
susceptibility of mycobacterial strains to treatment with β-lactams and combination therapies. We anticipate
that our findings will have a positive impact on selecting effective therapies for patients infected with Mtb or
M. abscessus."

to the establishment and amplification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), ii) to identify molecular
mechanisms responsible for failure to respond to standard of care (SOC) therapies, and iii) to develop
assays and tools to monitor these dysfunctional pathways and stratify patients towards personalized
therapies. Understanding major disease pathogenic drivers and identifying biomarkers to follow them in the
clinical setting are highly significant goals to advance clinical trial design and ultimately personalized patient
care. The proposed studies stem from our previous CORT cycle and build on our work uncovering both
molecular heterogeneity and basic mechanisms contributing to the generation of immunostimulatory nucleic
acids (NAs) in this disease. We now provide data supporting that erythroid cells are a novel source of
mitochondrial NAs giving rise to myeloid cell activation and pro-inflammatory loops in children with SLE. In
Project 1, we will dissect the basic mechanisms, pathogenic role and biomarker potential of this novel pathway.
In Project 2, we will capitalize on the groundwork that we have developed over the past 4 years of this CORT
cycle using next generation single cell (sc) transcriptional and epigenetic profiling as well as on our discoveries
of novel gene splice variants expressed in SLE patient immune cells. Both projects will incorporate cutting-
edge technologies and build upon our established expertise in immune profiling. The projects will be critically
supported by collaborations with Clinicians, Molecular and Cellular Biologists, Computer Scientists and experts
in Systems Immunology. The Administrative Core will organize and operate the Center, and assure
communication and interactions among all members and collaborators. The Clinical Core will oversee patient
enrollment and clinical assessment, clinical data collection and sample storage and distribution. Samples
obtained via the Clinical Core will enable the Center scientists to work together and the CLR will ensure
integration of clinical and laboratory data associated with samples across Institutions. The specific aims of the
projects are i) to identify the upstream mechanisms leading to retention of mitochondria in SLE Red Blood Cells
(RBCs); ii) to follow the presence of Mito+ RBCs and their upstream dysfunctional pathways in pediatric and adult
SLE patients during flares and remissions to establish their value as biomarkers and a stratification tool; iii) to
dissect the contribution of erythroid-derived mitochondrial NAs to SLE inflammatory loops; iv) to identify
transcriptional markers of SOC resistance pathways at the single-cell level and to identify isoforms associated
with disease severity and response to treatment; v) to define epigenomic signatures of SLE Disease Activity and
therapy responsiveness, and vi) to characterize the phenotype of therapy-sensitive and resistant Plasmablasts
(PBs) and identify, through functional genomics, the molecules/pathways that confer resistance to therapy."
10872992,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Breathing unhealthy amounts of particulate matter (PM) in polluted air is unavoidable for many people. Currently,
our knowledge of specific biochemical interactions that link exposure to the many adverse health effects of PM
is incomplete, as is our ability to directly treat and/or prevent these effects. In this study we will build upon our
work establishing a novel mechanistic paradigm for how PM can cause deleterious effects in the lungs, involving
activation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1), melastatin-8 (TRPM8) and vanilloid-1 (TRPV1)
ion channels. Our work shows that different types of PM activate different TRP channels, often leading to specific
effects that are relevant to human respiratory disease causation and acute exacerbation. Thus, a continued in-
depth assessment of this mechanistic paradigm has the potential to provide crucial knowledge for understanding
the basis for respiratory malaise associated with PM, and to further our understanding of the precise contributions
of TRP channels to environmentally-sensitive lung diseases such as asthma. Additionally, by establishing
fundamental mechanisms that regulate pathophysiological outcomes associated with TRP channel activation by
PM, our research could reveal innovative strategies for developing interventions to possibly treat and/or prevent
environmental lung diseases.
The current studies are motivated by results showing that differential activation of TRPA1, M8, and V1 in human
lung cells by PM is coupled to pro-inflammatory and other responses that affect human respiratory disease-
related pathways and phenotypes, generally referred to herein as “PM toxicity.” Further, there are species-
specific differences in TRP channel responses to PM, suggesting that rodents may not adequately model TRP-
dependent mechanisms of PM toxicity in humans. We opine this could be an important barrier for translating
mechanistic findings from rodent models to humans, and for developing effective interventions. Finally, we have
found that TRPA1, M8, and V1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can modulate cellular responses to
certain forms of PM, as well as ostensibly cause poorer asthma symptom control in children. Also, the TRPV1
I585I/V SNP genotype correlates with the diagnosis and severity of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
Thus, assessment of mechanisms by which selected TRP SNPs affect cellular responses to PM, as well as
asthma control, could reveal prognostic biomarkers of hypersensitivity to PM, and criteria for personalizing
medical care. Our hypothesis is: Activation of TRPA1, M8 and/or V1 by PM represents a pivotal event underlying
the toxic effects of PM. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine mechanisms and the significance of species-
specific TRP channel activation by PM; 2) Elucidate the basis and toxicological significance of TRPV1 I585I/V-
dependent TRPA1 expression by human lung epithelial cells; and 3) Quantify the impact of TRPA1, M8, and V1
genetics in environmental exacerbation of asthma."

This is a resubmission application for a research education program to support
individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue the study of bioengineering and a
career in research. The overall objective is to recruit talented students from the
Community College of Denver, a minority serving institution (MSI), into the
undergraduate Bioengineering program at the University of Colorado Denver, also a
MSI, and to provide these students with the skills necessary for postgraduate studies in
bioengineering, biomedical sciences, and medicine. The rationale for the proposed
research education program is that community college transfers are an important, but
often neglected, part of the pipeline of students with diverse backgrounds that enter
undergraduate bioengineering programs. In order to support this group of students we
will pursue the following specific aims: (1) a pre-transfer advising program on
academic, cultural, and financial issues to make for a successful transfer to a four-year
degree program, (2) a summer bridge program in which students earn credit towards
their degree and learn essential skills in design thinking and computational thinking
while being oriented into campus culture, (3) academic year activities that includes paid
engineering apprenticeships and a layered mentoring approach, (4) a summer research
experience in bioengineering at an academic medical center that includes skills
workshops and responsible conduct in research training, and (5) an honors and
leadership program that provides additional research experience and leadership training
in the junior and senior years as well as entry into a combined B.S./M.S. program. This
approach is innovative because it targets a unique population of students with diverse
backgrounds and will yield an educational research program that caters to their
strengths and needs. The proposed education program is significant because it will
provide both quantitative and qualitative data on how these approaches support science
identity, academic efficacy, scholarship, and matriculation into postgraduate programs.
If successful, this program could be expanded at CU Denver and replicated at other
institutions to support community college transfers in bioengineering and related fields."
10836974,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective weight loss treatment for patients who are severely obese; however, 1 in
5 patients develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD) after undergoing surgery. After surgery, changes in
metabolism, hormone levels, and behaviors alter the rewarding effects of alcohol while concurrently changing
its absorption rate, putting patients at significantly elevated risk of hazardous drinking. To better understand the
development of AUDs after bariatric surgery, we must first identify factors leading to re-initiation of alcohol use
and escalation to heavy drinking. Promising areas include mood and eating behaviors. The purpose of the
proposed study is to identify the distal and proximal factors that contribute to re-initiation and episodic alcohol
use following bariatric surgery. We will use an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach and first obtain
qualitative data to inform the quantitative phase. In the qualitative phase, we will conduct interviews of patients
who are between 6 months and 3-years post-bariatric surgery (N= 30) to identify the reasons they consumed
alcohol after bariatric surgery. We will also inquire about the frequency, amount, and the antecedents and
consequences of episodic alcohol use (i.e., mood, eating behaviors). This information will be used to inform the
quantitative data phase (i.e., finalize the constructs to assess, how and when to measure these variables, and
the frequency of assessment). In the quantitative phase, patients (N= 100) will also be recruited between 6
months and 3-years post-surgery. Participants will complete measures of substance use, mood, and eating
behaviors at baseline and at 6- and 12-weeks post-baseline to capture longer-term data to identify distal
factors associated with alcohol use. Within the 12-week study period, participants will also be randomly
assigned a 3-week period in which they will complete an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. The
EMA design consists of brief, daily morning and evening assessments in “real-time” regarding emotions and
behaviors (i.e., substance use, affect, and eating behaviors), which will allow us to identify the factors
contributing to episodic alcohol use (i.e., proximal factors). We will also examine intended and unintended
drinking. Our long-term goal is to better understand the progression from re-initiation of alcohol use, to heavy
use, to development of an AUD, which will assist in targeting interventions to prevent AUDs. In addition to
being the first study to examine distal and proximal factors of post-surgical alcohol use, this project contains
multiple innovative components including an EMA design which allows for the examination of unintended
drinking. Further, given participants will have varying histories of alcohol use prior to surgery, we will explore
whether distal and proximal predictors are differentially predictive of drinking among those with and without a
history of heavy drinking prior to surgery. The proposed line of research is significant and relevant to NIH’s
mission because it will lead to tailored, effective interventions to reduce alcohol use and prevent the
development of an alcohol use disorder among patients at high risk (i.e., those who undergo bariatric surgery)."

10891338,"Project Summary: Rates of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) have doubled over the last ten years in the US.
Although increasing, overall rates of cannabis use and CUD are still lower among women relative to men.
However, epidemiological reports document a telescoping effect; women transition from first use to CUD at a
faster rate than men. Preclinical studies with laboratory animals demonstrate that relative to males, females
are more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of cannabinoids, perhaps explaining the accelerated progression to
CUD observed in the epidemiological reports. To date, no studies have prospectively probed cannabis’s sex-
dependent differences in abuse-liability in humans. To understand cannabis’s acute effects that underlie the
accelerated trajectory to CUD observed in women, the proposed study will compare the dose-dependent
effects of smoked cannabis on endpoints directly associated with abuse-liability between light- and heavy-
cannabis using men and women, including positive subjective effects and cannabis self-administration. In
addition to abuse-related endpoints, understanding sex differences in the analgesic responses to smoked
cannabis have significant public health implications. Nearly 50% of medical cannabis users are women, with
pain cited as the primary indication for which treatment is sought. Thus, assessing both the abuse liability and
analgesic efficacy of cannabis as a function of sex is of critical importance.
 Preclinical studies point to three factors that contribute to sex-dependent responses to Δ-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoid 1 receptor (CBR1) agonists; 1) estradiol increases the
sensitivity to CBR1 agonist abuse-related effects, 2) pharmacokinetics (pK) of THC differ, with females
exhibiting faster conversion from THC to its primary psychoactive metabolite than males and 3) enhanced
development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects (but not other endpoints) in females after chronic
administration. The proposed prospective clinical study will directly address sex-dependent differences in
cannabis’s effects as a function of these factors. We will 1) compare the abuse-related and analgesic effects
of smoked cannabis between men to women while controlling for menstrual cycle effects, 2) evaluate
differences in the pK of THC and respective metabolites between men and women, and 3) investigate
cannabis’s sex-dependent effects as a function of frequency of cannabis use (light versus heavy cannabis
users). Specifically, healthy light (N=60, 30M, 30F) and heavy (N=60, 30M, 30F) cannabis users will be
recruited for this 3-session, double-blind, placebo-controlled, laboratory study. All participants will be
administered placebo (0% THC), lower (3% THC), and higher (10% THC) strengths of cannabis in counter-
balanced order. Cannabis’s abuse-related effects, analgesia, and pharmacokinetics will be assessed as a
function of sex and frequency of cannabis use. Findings from this study will fill a critical gap in our knowledge
and be integral in understanding sex as a biological variable in predicting, preventing, and treating CUD."
10634503,"Stroke survivors are vulnerable to reduced social interactions. Reduced interactions are related to worse
physical recovery after stroke. Enhancing social interactions after stroke may be one of the most
powerful strategies to improve stroke recovery. Social interactions are defined as the synchronous
interactions, commonly verbal, between individuals who are usually co-present in the same physical
location. Current ways to detect social interactions rely on self-report, which cannot be performed reliably
by patients with language or cognitive deficits. Patients with such deficits are most vulnerable to social
isolation. This project introduces a new wearable social sensor, SocialBit, that can detect audio
signatures of social interactions in real-world settings. Our preliminary data show that SocialBit can
detect social interactions accurately (~95%), and it can do so by processing select audio features without
storing raw audio data. Therefore, the technology detects and measures the duration of the social
interaction while preserving the privacy of the content during the interaction. Based on these findings, we
have developed a research plan to establish the usefulness of SocialBit in stroke survivors in the
immediate post-stroke period. The post-stroke period is apt for such a study because 1) patients are
vulnerable to social deprivation in this time period, and 2) the bounded nature of an inpatient setting
provides an ideal environment to test SocialBit against a ground truth of directly observed social
interactions. Our central hypothesis is that SocialBit can accurately detect social interactions in stroke
survivors in inpatient settings. This project is primarily designed to establish the accuracy of SocialBit to
detect social interaction in patients with varying deficits against the ground truth of video-assisted, real-
time observation in the post-stroke period. First, we will examine the accuracy of SocialBit to detect the
social interaction time against direct observation in 200 patients (Aim 1). Second, we will determine the
association of social interaction time to social isolation and stroke outcomes at 3 months (Aim 2). Finally,
we will determine the medical factors associated with social interaction time (Aim 3). This study will
establish the key criteria of quantifying social interaction in stroke recovery research. The project will (a)
identify automatic and unobtrusive methods to measure social interaction, (b) determine key design and
outcome criteria for a future intervention trial, and (c) increase our understanding of underlying
mechanisms in social changes after stroke. In so doing, this study will address the public health priority
of building better behavioral modification strategies for patients with stroke."
10895268,"Project Description
Dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown cause (DCM) is a major public health problem affecting more than a million
people in the U.S. Most DCM is now known to have an underlying genetic basis. First-degree relatives (FDRs)
of an individual with DCM are considered to be genetically at risk, particularly if they carry variants classified as
pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP) or uncertain significance (VUS) in DCM genes. Practice guidelines
recommend that these FDRs undergo serial imaging because prompt intervention may avert advanced disease.
While tissue damage is already well underway when DCM is manifest, myocardial tissue changes, termed “pre-
DCM” herein, are known to precede adverse changes in myocardial structure and function. Our central
hypothesis states that cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging may detect pre-DCM in individuals with
increased genetic risk by identifying myocardial tissue changes prior to myocardial structural and functional
changes. CMR measures of myocardial tissue characteristics, including late gadolinium enhancement and
myocardial T1 mapping, have been histopathologically validated and have established diagnostic and prognostic
value in DCM. Thus, our specific hypotheses state that adverse CMR-based myocardial tissue characteristics
will be associated with (1) A higher burden (number) of relevant variants (P, LP, VUS) in established DCM genes;
and (2) Subsequent adverse changes in measures of cardiac structure and function. We propose to leverage
the DCM Precision Medicine Study, a multisite DCM Consortium study now completing the enrollment of 1300
DCM patients (probands), balanced for race and sex, and their FDRs, most with no history of DCM. FDRs are
cascade tested for relevant variants (P, LP, VUS) in DCM genes identified in probands. We aim to (1) Estimate
the associations between CMR-based myocardial tissue characteristics and the number (burden) of the
proband's variants in DCM genes in at-risk FDRs. In 650 FDRs of probands with LP/P variants and/or VUSs,
CMR scans will be completed at 9 participating DCM Consortium sites. The association between CMR-based
myocardial tissue characteristics and the number of the proband's variants of each class (LP/P, VUS) carried by
an at-risk FDR in a particular age group will be evaluated, adjusting for biologically relevant covariates. We will
also (2) Estimate the association between CMR-based myocardial tissue characteristics and subsequent
changes in measures of cardiac structure and function in FDRs with normal baseline left-ventricular size and
function. FDRs examined in Aim 1 with normal left ventricular size and systolic function will receive a second
CMR exam 2.5 years after their baseline exam. We will estimate the covariate-adjusted associations between
baseline myocardial tissue characteristics and subsequent changes in CMR-derived measures of cardiac
structure and function in groups defined by the most deleterious of the proband's variants carried (none, VUS,
or LP/P). This study will validate a CMR-derived “pre-DCM” phenotype for FDRs who carry P or LP variants
(established risk), and also provide preliminary evidence that some VUSs are biologically relevant."
10914304,"AIHEC BIRCH Overall Core
Project/Narrative
The vision of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium’s (AIHEC) “Building Indigenous Research
Capacity in Health” (BIRCH) project is sovereign Tribal Nations asserting full ownership, direction, and control
of the health research needed to help their people grow healthy and strong. Implementing new programs in the
37 TCUs across the country, AIHEC will provide additional resources for American Indian and Alaska Native
(AIAN) students to pursue coursework and careers that will enable them to act as healthcare providers and
researchers. This project provides a comprehensive approach to growing a networked community of AIAN and
non-Native researchers, educators, and community practitioners to implement traditional knowledge practices
in addressing AIAN health issues and continuously improve Native health and health research practices and
outcomes.
The lack of tribal healthcare researchers and providers perpetuates health disparities and a lack of equity in
tribal communities. Furthermore, studies show that communities with tribal healthcare providers and
researchers have a higher treatment adherence and fewer mortalities or serious illnesses. Promoting the
advancement of AIAN students will not only benefit the students. Still, it will also lead to healthier tribal
communities, increased compliance with healthcare visits and interventions, participation in clinical trials, and a
reduction in the primary causes of illness and mortality such as diabetes, substance use disorders, injuries,
homicide, and suicide.
The long-term goals of the project are: To expand a community of Indigenous research practice in
health/health sciences at the nation’s TCUs; to establish TCUs as essential tribally-centered components of the
national health sciences research and education infrastructure; to improve the quality of health services
provided to AIANs using a science-based empirical approach to intervention development and evaluation that
is relevant to Native peoples and communities and based on core tribal values, cultures, and traditions; to
expand the TCU component of the health research and education career pipeline to recruit, support, and
provide critical linkages for AIAN students to pursue health careers; to empower tribes and tribal communities
to develop and control their research agenda and connect that research to tribal values and needs, and to
promote the integration of Indigenous knowledge and Western knowledge."
10999820,"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI
Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced
innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic
privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and
governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the
privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people
trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film,
television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding
of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments
raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic
information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law
enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and
security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict
and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation
of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or
all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety
of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive
research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical
regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to
respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications
for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will
address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices
affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2)
Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US
and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to
intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities
and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next
generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims
will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new
investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed."
10802280,"The long-term goals of the proposed research program are to provide insight into the complex dialogue that
occurs each generation between humans and their microbiota during the critical period following birth.
Recent research has indicated a strong correlation between outcomes of these early events and life-long
health. However, the inaccessibility of colonized tissues and high diversity of the microbiota renders an in-
depth study of early colonization of human tissues extremely challenging. When faced with such complex
phenomena, biologists often turn to simpler model systems to provide insights into evolutionarily conserved
features and reveal basic principles. To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
initiation of bacterial associations with apical surfaces of mucosal epithelia, the proposed program exploits
the binary symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host, Euprymna scolopes. This
relatively simple association has been studied for over two decades as a model for the chronic colonization
of mucosa by Gram-negative bacteria. As in humans, the squid-vibrio association begins anew each
generation, requiring a ‘winnowing’ of other environmental bacteria that results in persistent association
restricted to the coevolved partners. In this system, the process of symbiosis initiation occurs across ~100
microns over minutes to hours. It can be directly imaged in its entirety using confocal microscopy, which
offers the rare opportunity to define, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the reciprocal molecular and
biochemical dialogue that results in the establishment of a specific, life-long beneficial symbiosis. This
project brings together two collaborators, each with expertise in the biology of one of the symbiotic
partners, and introduces new technology to the study of host-microbe interactions, including: HCR-FISH,
which enables visualization of rare transcripts in host and symbiont cells; NanoString, a new technology for
simultaneous analysis of dozens to hundreds of targeted transcripts; and high-efficiency RNAseq, which
produces robust transcriptional libraries from as little as 10 ng total RNA (~105 bacteria). An understanding
of the human microbiome is in its infancy, and this frontier field is currently at the stage of building
paradigms. Within this context, as the squid-vibrio system has in the past, the results of the current study
will shed light upon fundamental principles governing the onset of both beneficial and pathogenic
associations.
RELEVANCE (See instructions): During the colonization of humans and other animals, by either the normal
microbiota or microbial pathogens, the first few hours are critical. The resulting interplay determines
whether a healthy association will be fostered, a dysfunctional community will develop, or a frank
pathogenesis will ensue. We will use innovative imaging, microbial genetics, and genomics/transcriptomics
approaches to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying this crucial period, defining the general
principles that govern the reciprocal interactions between host cells and their microbes."
10919248,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex
psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased
healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in
the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have
shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric
comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics,
including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and
educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such
as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility
of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in
clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their
treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype”
relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived
from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai.
Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and
related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and
these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance
in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data
from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will
substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric
disorders."

10912525,"Project Summary
Major health inequities continue to impact tribal nations, yet a serious shortage of scientists who conduct tribally
engaged research aimed at alleviating health disparities affecting American Indian (AI) people persists. For
several years, Cherokee Nation, the University of Oklahoma (OU) system and the Oklahoma Medical Research
Foundation (OMRF) have partnered to address this issue by building tribal research capacity through the Native
American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) mechanism. In this cycle of NARCH funding, the partnership
among Cherokee Nation, OU and OMRF continues and, importantly for student career enhancement, expands
to include the Oklahoma State University (OSU) system as a key partner for student career enhancement
activities. The overall mission of Cherokee Nation NARCH is to develop durable research capacity within the
context of a Native American tribal nation to address health inequities affecting the AI population of northeastern
Oklahoma. To achieve this goal, the five Specific Aims of Cherokee Nation NARCH are:
1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a Leadership Team (LT) and a Tribal-Campus
 Advisory Committee (TCAC), that ensures integration of career enhancement, capacity building and research
activities;
2. to educate the next generation of researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the context
 of tribal research, focusing on undergraduate, graduate and health professions students;
3. to build tribal capacity by developing a set of research codes to govern the conduct of genomic and other
 biomedical research predicated on the concept of tribal data sovereignty;
4. to conduct innovative research capable of seeding future research projects performed by researchers
 seeking to work within the Cherokee Nation setting; and
5. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of student career enhancement,
 capacity building, and research projects, and evaluation of the overall Cherokee Nation NARCH program.
Cherokee Nation NARCH provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in health
disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens this project, as OSU has demonstrated remarkable
success in the education of AI students in scientific and health professions fields, including the advent of the first
tribally affiliated medical school in the US. Cherokee Nation NARCH therefore provides an unprecedented
environment in which a Tribe, two research-intensive universities with large NA student populations (OU and
OSU), and a biomedical research foundation (OMRF) will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable
disparities in health that continue to affect AI people."
11030464,"Project Summary
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase-2 (GRK2) is a key regulator of GPCR recycling and desensitization
that is upregulated in several cardiac pathologies, including hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). Cardiac
ischemia-reperfusion injury induces ERK-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 at S670, which results in the
translocation of GRK2 from the cytosol to mitochondria. We discovered that in the adult cardiomyocyte
mitochondrial GRK2 regulates glucose-mediated oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting pyruvate
dehydrogenase, the rate limiting enzyme of glucose oxidation. Although the physiological impact of mitochondrial
GRK2 was reported, it remains largely unknown how mitochondrial GRK2 regulates cardiac mitochondrial
metabolism. This proposal focuses on deciphering mechanistically how GRK2 phosphorylation and
mitochondrial translocation regulate cardiac glucose metabolism. Additionally, we propose that mitochondrial
GRK2 participates in key metabolic signaling post-myocardial infarction (MI) by acting as an amplifier of
pyroptosis- a novel lytic cell death mechanism. Thus, we hypothesize that GRK2 phosphorylation at S670 is
paramount for cardiomyocyte responses in consequence of altering metabolic availability and cardiac injury.
Using a novel GRK-S670A and two Gasdermin E mouse models, we propose to carry out two specific aims: 1.)
Determine how mitoGRK2 regulates cardiac mitochondrial metabolism; 2.) Assess whether phosphorylation of
GRK2 at S670 modulates cardiac pyroptotic signaling. Overall, our work will shed light on the role of GRK2
phosphorylation at S670 in cardiomyocytes and how this post-translational modification regulates metabolic
signaling and chronic-injury responses. The overarching goal of this research is to exploit novel mechanistic
signaling for the development and identification of new pharmaceutical drugs for HF treatment."
10891447,"Title: From 3D genomes to neural connectomes: Higher-order chromatin mechanisms encoding long-
term memory
Summary
The Cremins Lab focuses on higher-order genome folding and how classic epigenetic modifications work
through long-range, spatial mechanisms to govern genome function in the developing brain. Much is already
known regarding how transcription factors work in the context of the linear genome to regulate gene
expression. Yet, severe limitations exist in our ability to engineer chromatin in neural circuits to correct synaptic
defects in vivo. At the lab’s inception, it remained unclear whether and how genome folding would functionally
influence cell type-specific gene expression. Thus far, we have developed and applied new molecular and
computational technologies to discover that nested chromatin domains and long-range loops undergo marked
reconfiguration during neural lineage commitment, somatic cell reprogramming, neuronal activity stimulation,
and in repeat expansion disorders. We have demonstrated that loops induced by cortical neuron stimulation,
engineered through synthetic architectural proteins, and miswired in fragile X syndrome were tightly connected
to transcription, thus providing early insight into the genome’s structure-function relationship. We will now focus
on a fundamental mystery in neuroscience: how memory is encoded over decades despite rapid turnover of
synaptic proteins/RNAs. We hypothesize that the 3D genome integrates molecular traces of synaptic plasticity
written on chromatin to store long-term memory in neural circuits. We will employ single-cell genomics and
imaging technologies to dissect the extent to which individual synaptic inputs create 3D epigenetic traces. We
will perform genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify specific loops and epigenetic modifications functionally
important for synaptic plasticity. We will also re-direct technologies used for genome architecture mapping to
create molecular activity-dependent connectome maps, and computationally integrate neuronal connectome
maps across length scales with 3D epigenetic data sets. Successful completion of this work will shed new light
on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms governing structural and functional synaptic plasticity in
physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models of memory encoding and consolidation. Many neurological
disorders exhibit synaptic defects, and alterations in neuronal activity-dependent gene expression underlie
pathological neural phenotypes. Addressing this knowledge gap will provide an essential foundation for our
long-term goals to understand how, when, and why pathologic genome misfolding leads to synaptic
dysfunction, and to engineer the 3D genome to reverse pathologic synaptic defects in debilitating neurological
diseases."
10885977,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Collective cell migration is critical in wound healing, morphogenesis, gastrulation, as well as in pathological
processes. This collective motion arises from coordination of the biochemical polarization of individual cells.
Some of the biological details of this coordination have been identiﬁed – many different cell types integrate
information from cell-cell contact through cadherins in order to repolarize Rho GTPase activity. These biochemical
events drive stereotyped reactions like contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), where cells repolarize and crawl
away from contact. There is a critical gap in our understanding between identifying molecular players in cell-
cell interactions and being able to predict how changes in cell-cell interactions drive collective migration of an
epithelial layer or an invading stream of cells. A long-term goal of the Camley group is developing computational
physical models of collective cell migration to bridge this gap. This project addresses that goal by building models
of collective cell migration with realistic geometry, mechanics and cell-cell signaling to study:
 1. Determining the effect of cell geometry on cell-cell interactions like contact inhibition of locomotion
Assays to test cell-cell interactions in collisions of migrating cells are performed on two-dimensional substrates,
allowing collisions to occur between cells with broad lamellipodia. However, in vivo, cell-cell interactions occur in
a context established by three-dimensional extracellular matrix, mechanical conﬁnement, and neighboring cells,
which are all known to alter motility. How can cells reliably integrate cell-cell contacts with highly variable
contact areas and durations to coordinate their motion? We will develop models to describe the effect of
cell and matrix geometry on cell-cell collisions. This will include recent experiments on cell-cell collisions on
suspended ﬁbers, in which our collaborators found traditional contact inhibition of locomotion is near-absent.
 2. Understanding how myosin activity ﬂuctuations and mechanotransduction regulate cell-cell rupture events
Invasion of cells in both normal and diseased tissue can occur by cells breaking off from a larger group. This is a
key part of collective invasion. What controls the critical step of cell-cell rupture? We hypothesize that these
rare events are dependent on ﬂuctuations in the level of motor proteins like myosin at cell-cell junctions. We will
develop models to describe this strand invasion, how dissemination depends on cell motility, and the ability of
cells to sense the forces exerted on junctions. We will develop tools to infer models of feedbacks between the
tension at the cell-cell junction and cell motility directly from experimental data. These will be used on data from
collaborators studying invasion in controlled microﬂuidic geometries. In addition, we will develop models studying
how the size of clusters breaking from a strand depend on the strand geometry.
 Together, these models provide links from physical and molecular aspects of cell-cell collisions to large-scale
collective migration, and will drive future questions in collective migration and development."
10883660,"Rapid advances in scientific knowledge have resulted in unparalleled opportunities for new discoveries that could
substantially improve human health and cure disease. A cadre of interdisciplinary scientists who can work at the
interface between pathophysiology and clinical medicine is essential to accomplish this goal. It is the overarching
objective of the Northwestern University Program in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Hormone Action (NUPEDHA)
to enable such research in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism. This objective will be accomplished by
training basic and clinical scientists in an environment that integrates rigorous fundamental science into a
disease-oriented context. An essential component of this training program is the superb, highly collaborative
training faculty of 24 outstanding mentors whose research focuses on translational science related to
endocrinology, diabetes, obesity and metabolism. There are 5 tightly linked co-mentors who will provide
expertise in state-of-the-art “Omics” and “Big Data” approaches. There is also 1 mentor in training to ensure that
there is a pathway to develop junior faculty as mentors. The overall program objectives are to 1) provide training
in the fundamental biology and integrative physiology of endocrinology, diabetes, obesity and metabolism in a
disease-oriented environment; 2) integrate innovative “Omics” and “Big Data” approaches into trainee research
projects through co-mentorships; 3) mentor the next generation of investigators who can work at the interface
between the laboratory and clinical medicine to ensure that scientific advances are rapidly translated to improve
the care of patients with endocrine and metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity. The combined
training of graduate students (two per year; up to three year appointments), PhD,or MD postdoctoral fellows
(three per year; up to two year appointments) in Endocrinology and Metabolism emphasizes these objectives as
well as the continuum between fundamental science and patient care. The training program contains a core of
didactic activities with additional didactic experiences tailored to the needs of each trainee. Mentor training
occurs at the level of graduate students, post-docs, and faculty. The Individual Development Plan (IDP) was
implemented for all trainees in 2010, well before it was an NIH requirement. Professional development
opportunities include training in manuscript and grant writing, presentation skills, rigor and reproducibility,
responsible conduct of research, and pathways to academic and research success. The rigorous, ongoing
program evaluation will continue to be overseen by the External Advisory Committee and the Northwestern
University Searle Center for Advancing Learning & Teaching. NUPEDHA has an outstanding record of
accomplishment. Over the past 15 years, 23% (10/43) of NUPEDHA trainees (15 predoctoral; 28 postdoctoral)
have been underrepresented minorities (URM). 86% (12/15 predoctoral; 25/28 postdoctoral) have academic or
clinical appointments, research positions in industry, or are continuing in training. Currently, 50% (2/4) of trainees
supported by NUPEDHA are URM."
10754224,"Neonatal Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) originates from the underdeveloped germinal matrix, a site
of cell rapid cell division adjacent to the lateral ventricles of the brain. IVH leads to post-hemorrhagic
hydrocephalus (PHH). Within the same time frame that neonatal IVH occurs, the neonatal brain is also rapidly
producing the cells needed for myelination. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the brain, are derived
from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs are fragile cells - exquisitely sensitive to many factors that
are present across multiple neurological diseases such as excitotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative
stress. Across a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, neuroinflammation causes OPC loss and failure of
myelination. Infiltrating brain macrophages are implicated in many forms of neonatal brain injury. Macrophages
are activated by many different stimuli in CNS injury and disease, including blood products released into the
ventricular space. Understanding the role of macrophages after IVH is critical to improving outcomes, as
macrophage activation mediates white matter injury in other forms of neonatal brain injury.
 Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic that is safe in neonates. Besides its antibiotic
properties, azithromycin is also anti-inflammatory and shifts macrophage activation into an anti-inflammatory
phenotype that actually promotes tissue recovery rather than injury. Azithromycin has been used in a variety of
anti-inflammatory applications including preclinical work in spinal cord injury where it improves tissue sparing
and neurological function. Importantly, azithromycin has already undergone rigorous clinical trials in neonates
for inflammation-induced lung injury. This study will pharmacologically block infiltrating macrophages in
IVH/PHH and test azithromycin’s ability to protect OPCs from macrophage-induced injury in a rat model of
neonatal IVH. I will use a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine macrophage activation,
OPC death and myelination with and without azithromycin treatment. My in vivo work will allow us to use
neurobehavioral outcomes to assess the efficacy of azithromycin while my in vitro model will allow for in-depth
mechanistic studies of macrophage-OPC interaction. This project will support Dr. Miller’s training in studies of
neuroinflammation and neurotherapeutics. If successful, this project will pave the way for clinical studies of
azithromycin for improving neurological outcome after neonatal IVH."
10855746,"The treatment of early stage, localized breast cancer has evolved over several decades from highly invasive
techniques to minimally invasive, breast-conserving therapies. Our breast-specific magnetic resonance-guided
focused ultrasound system non-invasively delivers focused energy deep inside the body under high-resolution
image guidance. The technical advances we have made poise MRgFUS as a nearly ready non-invasive
ablation treatment for localized breast disease. We have developed a rapid, treatment planning package to
predict ultrasound beam placement and assess potential beam aberration, a hybrid MR thermometry method
to monitor temperature in both fat and aqueous based tissues and validated a novel MRI-registered whole
mount histology technique that compares MRI metrics to histopathological analysis. This R37 2-year extension
proposal will continue this work between experienced academic investigators at the University of Utah and
industry investigators at Image Guided Therapy. This extension will finish and extend this important work,
integrating each component into ThermoGuideTM, a clinic-ready focused ultrasound software control
environment. Specifically, we will: 1) Use the rapid treatment planning technique to evaluate the necessity for
phase aberration correction techniques in breast MRgFUS, 2) validate the accuracy and precision of our
hybrid, breast-focused volumetric MR thermometry method, 3) apply our novel MRI-registered whole mount
histology technique that compares MRI metrics to histopathological analysis to immunohistochemistry data and
4) evaluate the entire protocol in a feasibility treat-and-resect clinical trial targeting unifocal invasive breast
cancer tumors. This R37 extension application will complete the validation and translation of the breast
MRgFUS System in this proposal, providing an exciting new image-guided non-invasive treatment option for
breast cancer patients."
10657553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 By some estimates, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) accounts for 82% of hip osteoarthritis
(OA) cases. FAIS patients present with a loss of sphericity of the femoral head, reduction in femoral-neck offset,
and/or an excessively prominent acetabular wall. Patients report pain that is position- or motion-related. Often,
cartilage is delaminated from bone and the labrum is torn. The theory of FAIS pathophysiology is that
pathoanatomy causes pathomechanics. However, we lack a quantitative understanding of the disease. Studies
that have examined hip anatomy and biomechanics in FAIS patients have yielded conflicting data, likely due to
the application of inaccurate measurement techniques. There is also a high prevalence of FAI morphology
among the asymptomatic population (i.e., positive controls), which has hindered progress to understand why FAI
morphology causes damage. Herein, we apply experimental and computational techniques to advance
understanding of FAIS pathophysiology. We will examine three cohorts: FAIS patients, negative controls, and
positive controls. Aim 1 will measure in-vivo hip articulation during inclined walking, pivoting, and squatting in the
three cohorts using dual fluoroscopy. We hypothesize that patients with FAIS will exhibit altered kinematics;
however, given our preliminary data, we posit that range of motion will not be reduced in patients. Further, we
hypothesize that positive controls will have altered kinematics when compared to negative controls. In Sub-Aim
1, we will visualize the interaction between the shape of the hip joint and its kinematic position during dynamic
loading using statistical shape modeling of the dual fluoroscopy data. Completion of Aim 1 improve clinical
understanding of FAIS by enabling us to visualize the effects of pathologic shape during dynamic loading. Aim
2 will analyze chondrolabral mechanics in-silico to improve understanding of FAIS pathophysiology. Specifically,
we will generate finite element models of bone, cartilage, and labrum using a validated pipeline. We will compare
load transfer to the labrum and shear stresses and strains at the osteochondral and chondrolabral junction during
inclined walking, pivoting, and squatting. We hypothesize that load transfer to the labrum is increased, and
cartilage shear stresses and strains at the osteochondral and chondrolabral junctions are elevated in FAIS
patients. Compensatory motion experienced by the positive control group may keep chondrolabral stresses and
strains within normal. Thus, we hypothesize that there will be no significant differences in FE results between
the two control groups. Sub-Aim 2 will quantify relationships between local measures of hip shape and
chondrolabral mechanics. Completion of Aim 2 will enhance understanding of OA pathogenesis in patients with
FAIS. Identifying how positive controls cope with their deformities could inform new treatment strategies."
10891439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pain and other symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, and somnolence often co-occur, persist into adulthood, and
heighten health risks for adolescents. For instance, poorly managed pain, fatigue and psychological symptoms
may contribute to risky self-management behavior such as use and misuse of prescription drugs and other
substances. These risky behaviors and drug exposures during teenage years have been associated with
prescription drug misuse and substance use (PDM/SU) into adulthood. Importantly, we know little about how
persistent symptom trajectories develop during childhood and adolescence. We also know little about how
family and other environmental factors influence children’s symptom trajectories or how they contribute to
symptom-motivated PDM/SU behavior. Since persistent or recurrent pain, psychologic problems, and PDM/SU
often emerge during adolescence, a better understanding of the relationship between these factors is critical.
Equally important is that we understand the family and environmental factors that can help protect teens with
persistent symptom trajectories from engaging in risky self-medication or PDM/SU behavior. Our overall goal
with this research is to identify and strategize optimal interventions to prevent or reduce symptom-associated
PDM/SU among teens. Our first objective is to identify a symptom profile (or “signature”) during early
adolescence that indicates vulnerability to 1) persistent or worsening pain, psychological, and somatic (body)
symptoms (P-PSS). We will also identify key factors in the family and environment that are relevant and
primary targets for early intervention. To accomplish this, we will use data from the 11,875 children enrolled in
the national longitudinal Adolescent, Brain, and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. In Aim 1, we will
differentiate children based on their P-PSS (symptom) trajectories at age 13 years, and will determine the
degree to which child health, family health and environmental factors influence these trajectories. In Aim 2, we
will demonstrate how children with the most vulnerable (persistent/worsening) symptom trajectory are at risk
for ongoing symptoms and PDM/SU behavior by age 15/16 years. We will also identify key interventional
targets (child, family and environmental) that enhance or reduce the risk for ongoing symptoms and PDM/SU
behavior. In Aim 3, we will use dynamic simulation modeling to examine the potential impact of selected
interventions addressing these prime targets to disrupt the path from symptoms to PDM/SU. This research will
provide the most comprehensive understanding of the symptom-related pathway to PDM/SU in teens, to date.
Our findings will not only improve our knowledge about adolescent symptom progression and key risk factors,
but will inform the optimal application of interventions to prevent or curtail the symptom-to-substance use
pathway."
10890636,"Abstract:
As per the provisions of DSHEA, the FDA has primary responsibility for ensuring that appropriate regulatory
actions are taken against marketed products that present significant health risks or bear false or misleading label
claims. The development and dissemination of research-based, scientifically valid information requires
cooperation between academia, government, and industry. As a part of the FDA program to establish ‘Centers
of Excellence (COE)’ in support of research relevant to their mission, in 2001 the office of dietary supplements
at CFSAN, established an agreement with the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University
of Mississippi. This agreement represents a cooperative effort to address critical research needs in the botany,
chemistry, and biology aspects of dietary supplement ingredients, especially those of priority safety concern to
CFSAN.
Through two decades of the long-standing, successful inter-institutional cooperative research agreement,
researchers at the COE addressed the ongoing quality and safety issues with botanical ingredients in dietary
supplements and cosmetics. Specifically, several botanically-verified materials and chemical markers were
established and utilized to address the quality and authenticity of more than 10,000 finished products. More than
200 independent analytical methods were designed, and the development of such tools was instrumental in
addressing quality control issues with dietary supplement products. These findings allowed regulators to develop
a critical scientific base to recall several thousands tainted botanical supplement products containing synthetic
artifacts or others exogenous components. In addition to the state-of-the-art instrumentation available at the
COE, in-house medicinal plant garden and collaborative research agreements with national and international
botanical research partners allowed the COE to amass several thousand botanicals for both research and
training purposes. As result of these cohesive scientific efforts, on average, the COE contributed more than 50
publications and generated about 1000 citations per year for the last 10 years, addressing various quality and
safety issues with botanical ingredients integral to various dietary supplements and other products.
The current proposal is a request for continued support to address critical quality and safety aspects of botanical
ingredients’ in various finished products. This request aligns with CFSAN’s mission to assure public health. The
COE will continue to augment the development of a prioritized list of botanicals of concern, implement reference
materials, and develop suitable analytical methods for establishing the invaluable scientific base for requlatory
compliance. The proposed diverse activities and resulting tools could provide an important arsenal to regulators
to develop, implement and modify regulatory guidance to assure the quality and safety of botanical ingredients
in dietary supplements, cosmetics, and other formulations."
10917012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the availability of evidence-based guidance and treatments, many patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)
do not achieve optimal glycemic control. In prior work, patients with DM identified primary needs of improved
access to food and nutrition education. Several innovative models for food services have emerged to address
patient needs for improved healthy food access. Currently, select non-profit organizations across the U.S.
deliver millions of medically-tailored meals (MTM) to patients with chronic illnesses, based on the premise that
food can be as helpful as medicine in improving patient outcomes. While a handful of pilot studies have
demonstrated success of MTM in reducing healthcare utilization and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among patients
with DM, no randomized trials have assessed the sustained impact of MTM on long-term outcomes for patients
with DM. Similarly, individual studies of medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which includes individualized nutrition
education and counseling, have shown benefit for improving DM outcomes. However, uptake of MNT across
health systems has historically been extremely limited because of patient logistical barriers to attending the in-
person visits. MNT delivered by telehealth (tele-MNT) has potential to overcome these barriers. Our goal is to
evaluate the effect of MTM, with and without additional tele-MNT, on outcomes for patients with poorly
controlled type 2 DM. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with patients who have poorly
controlled DM. Outcomes of interest include change in HbA1c, cost effectiveness, weight, diabetes self-
efficacy, self-care, diabetes quality of life, and patient satisfaction. We will assess the efficacy of 1) MTM and
2) MTM + tele-MNT compared to usual care in reducing HbA1c at 3, 6 (primary outcome) and 12 months and
the cost effectiveness of each intervention compared to usual care up to 12 months. We will also explore
patient perspectives regarding experiences with MTM and MTM + tele-MNT to gain a better understanding of
potential factors contributing to treatment failure and success within each group. The proposed research is
innovative because it develops and tests a novel tele-MNT intervention tailored to recipients of MTM, provides
a comprehensive solution to patient-identified nutrition needs, includes complete utilization data provided by
the HealthShare Exchange, and leverages a unique health system and community group partnership to
improve sustainability and scalability. Study results will inform 1) provider and payor decisions regarding
offering and covering these services; 2) how services should be structured for scalability; and 3) integration of
these services into the larger care delivery system to reduce DM disparities."
10663844,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our goal is to find the best ways to prevent pancreatic cancer deaths in patients with pancreatic cysts. Recent
advances in imaging have led to the detection of innumerable pancreatic cysts that could never be seen
before, now visible in >10% of patients who have an MRI and in >2% who have a CT scan for an unrelated
reason. When such cysts are unexpected and asymptomatic, they are considered “incidental.” The majority
represent intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are indolent precursors to Pancreatic
Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer. Given the poor prognosis and
survival of patients with PDAC, pancreatic cysts have become a primary target of early PDAC detection.
Imaging surveillance is advised for most patients who are diagnosed with an incidental pancreatic cyst, but key
factors that define surveillance – e.g., the frequency, modality, and duration of imaging, and when to pursue
biopsy or surgery – are highly controversial. Critics of intensive surveillance raise concerns about overtesting
and overtreatment, particularly given that many patients with such cysts are older and have comorbidities.
Advocates emphasize the singular opportunity for early PDAC detection that arises from close monitoring.
To address this problem, we will build a computer-based simulation model that replicates the natural history of
incidental pancreatic cysts, and use it to formulate a precision management approach. Our research plan will
draw from our team’s existing simulation model of PDAC, which is calibrated to data from the National Cancer
Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and published studies. First, we will
extend this model to replicate the natural history of incidentally detected pancreatic cysts (Aim 1). We will then
use the model to identify effective (Aim 2) and cost-effective (Aim 3) management strategies that are tailored to
both cyst features (size, complexity) and patient characteristics (age, comorbidity status). Finally, we will
evaluate the potential for emerging blood and cyst-fluid biomarkers to further improve management (Aim 4).
The proposed research is innovative because it applies an advanced modeling approach to a controversial
problem that will be difficult to solve with observational studies or clinical trials alone. The research team is
well-suited, with an established track record in pancreatic cancer care and incidental pancreatic cysts, and with
substantial experience in developing mathematical models that have been used to inform health policy at
national levels. The results will be threefold: 1) a detailed natural history model of incidental pancreatic cysts;
2) a tailored approach to their management, based on cyst features and patient characteristics; and 3) a
roadmap for advancing future research in cystic precursors to pancreatic cancer in the coming years."
10802296,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While cerebral oxygen delivery depends on the cerebral blood flow (CBF; ml blood/100g tissue/minute) and
blood oxygen content, it is becoming increasingly recognized that blood capillary transit time itself can also
influence tissue oxygen extraction, even in the presence of normal or elevated CBF. In individuals with
anemia where accelerated capillary flow velocities may be present as a result of hyperemia and
cerebral autoregulation, reduced capillary transit time can lead to reduced times for tissue oxygen
offloading. Compelling evidence has been provided for heterogeneous capillary flow underlying abnormal
oxygen delivery in multiple conditions including expansion of infarcts in acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain
injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In sickle cell anemia (SCA), we have observed that rapid capillary transit,
visible on arterial spin labeling (ASL) CBF-weighted MRI, is present in more than 50% of adults and children.
We have shown in published work and preliminary data from 154 adults and children with SCA that
hyperintense ASL signal within cerebral dural venous sinuses is directly associated with elevated arterial
velocities, elevated CBF, and reduced oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; ratio of oxygen consumed to oxygen
delivered), and that this effect may reduce following transfusion therapies that improve oxygen delivery to
tissue. These findings indicate that venous hyperintense signal on ASL images may represent a marker of
capillary-level disturbances in oxygen exchange efficiency. One of the most impactful findings of our
preliminary work is that we have observed that rapid capillary-level arterio-venous transit is associated
with reduced oxygen metabolism, suggesting that these transit times may provide a biomarker of
cerebral ischemia in individuals with SCA who have greater than a 50% risk of cerebral infarcts by age
30 years, yet often lack conventional stroke risk factors. Here, we propose to refine neuroimaging
methods for evaluating arterio-venous transit to allow for robust, quantitative measures of capillary transit time
non-invasively in vivo, and subsequently to test fundamental hypotheses regarding cerebral oxygen utilization
in anemic individuals with vs. without infarcts. Aim (1): To apply innovative ASL MRI methods and time
regression analyses over major intracranial arteries and dural sinuses in healthy control and SCA participants.
Aim (2): To quantify cerebral capillary transit time in SCA participants before and after treatment with blood
transfusion to understand how increases in hemoglobin parallel an improvement in brain oxygen extraction.
Aim (3): To test the hypothesis that arterio-venous transit times are reduced in individuals with SCA with
versus without infarcts. The short-term goal is to utilize non-invasive imaging approaches to understand
mechanisms of oxygen utilization and neurovascular dysfunction in anemia. The long-term goal is to
use this information to triage individuals with anemia for personalized stroke prevention therapies, as
well as to objectively quantify the impact of these therapies on brain health."
10866608,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than
six-fold over the past three decades. EAC patients' 5-year survival rate is less than 15%, underscoring the
need to understand the underlying biology to identify new therapeutic approaches. Chronic gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD), where acidic bile salts (ABS) abnormally refluxate into the esophagus, affects more
than 20% of the US population. In this program project, we hypothesize that interactions between APE1 redox
functions and isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) protein adducts promote activation and stability of critical oncogenic
transcription networks to mediate cell survival and expansion in esophageal tumorigenesis. This program
project leverages unique expertise of the principal investigators and takes advantage of advanced genetic and
surgical animal models, 3-dimensional in vitro models, human tissues, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and
innovative technologies. Project 1 investigates mechanisms by which APE1-redox function promotes
activation of SOX9 transcription factor in EACs under reflux conditions. Mechanistic and functional studies will
explore the role of APE1 redox function and IsoLGs adducts in regulating SOX9 to promote cancer cell survival
and expansion. Translational studies will determine the efficacy APE1 redox inhibitors using in vivo mouse
models. Project 2 investigates novel mechanisms of STAT3 by IsoLG protein adducts, as a cellular response
to oxidative stress induced by reflux conditions. The translational experiments include the use of isoLG
inhibitors to suppress formation of oncogenic protein adducts and progression to EAC in animal models of
Barrett’s tumorigenesis. Project 3 investigates the role SOX4 in EAC development. The translation studies in
Project 3 include testing FDA-approved drugs that inhibit SOX4, as a proof of concept to develop a novel
strategy to treat EACs. The integrated data exchange in this program project will enable us to collectively
investigate the role of APE1 redox functions and IsoLG protein adducts in esophageal tumorigenesis. The
three proposed cores deliver key services for all the projects. The Administrative Core (Core A) will manage
all scientific and fiscal issues and facilitate research interactions. The Molecular Pathology Core (CORE B)
will provide histopathology and immunohistochemistry services for animal and human tissues. The
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (CORE C) will play a central role in providing computational,
statistical, and bioinformatics services. Via these Project and Core interactions we will identify biology-relevant
oncogenic molecular vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted to benefit EAC patients"

Organ form is vital for organisms to function properly. This is particularly evident for essential organs such as
the human heart where shape defects result in congenital heart disease, a common birth defect. Despite major
efforts, we still lack answers to this simple question: how does DNA encode shape? Developmental and
molecular biology uncovered the principles of how maternal morphogens setup axes and trigger cascades of
gene regulation to precisely determine cell fate patterns. Yet how the interplay of genetic information and
mechanical activity orchestrates interaction of cells that shape organs remains elusive.
In his seminal book “On growth and form” the polymath D'Arcy Thompson advocated for quantitative analysis
of morphogenesis. His ideas where ahead of their time: they predate the genetic revolution, and many tools for
quantitative analysis where missing. This proposal seeks to lay the foundations for quantitative
morphogenesis, revisiting Thompson's agenda armed with the toolkit of the modern era. For a predictive
understanding of morphogenesis, molecular investigation must be extended by quantitative analysis
of tissue dynamics at the organ scale. At the organ scale concepts from physics of collective phenomena
become relevant to study how thousands of cells streamline their `activity' to generate shape. Connecting
developmental biology with physics harbors the promise to uncover new mechanisms at the organ scale. We
know the transcription factors that determine fate, and cytoskeletal proteins that execute cell behaviors. Many
of these players are conserved across a large portion of the tree of life. On the other hand, we learned shape
of materials is determined by physical quantities such as force and mechanical stress. To unfold the full
potential of an interdisciplinary approach, we need new tools bridging the gap between genetic players and
physical quantitates. This approach will lead the way to the principles of morphogenesis.
My team develops break through technology overcoming hurdles of whole organ quantitative analysis. Multi-
view light sheet microscopy enables rapid in toto live imaging at subcellular resolution. Tissue cartography
dives into the rest-frame of curved tissues and generates a panoramic overview, simplifying data handling and
quantitative analysis. We pioneer biophysics-image-informatics to extract quantitative observables from
fluorescence microscopy in the language of physics. Leveraging advanced understanding of the early embryo
in the advanced genetic model system D. melanogaster, we aim for a comprehensive framework predicting
how genotype determines tissue flows during axis elongation. Our approach will have a broad impact: by
connecting development with physics we form the foundation of quantitative morphogenesis."

10887393,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
The Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) is an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center that integrates key
strengths in cancer biology, immunology, genetics, population sciences and clinical oncology with expertise in
imaging, engineering and technology development. The translation of basic science discoveries through clinical
trials and collaborative team science is a distinguishing feature of the SCI.
The SCI has 300 members and includes faculty from 32 Departments and from three Schools (Medicine,
Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences) within Stanford University. Seven programs (Cancer Biology and
Cancer Stem Cells, Cancer Imaging and Early Detection, Cancer Immunotherapy, Cancer Therapeutics,
Hematologic Malignancies, Population Sciences, and Radiation Biology) address basic, translational, clinical,
and population-based components of cancer research and are supported by 11 shared resources (Animal Tumor
Models, Biomedical Informatics, Bioscience Screening, Biostatistics, Cancer Imaging, Cell Science Imaging,
Flow Cytometry, Genomics, Human Immune Monitoring, Proteomics, and Tissue Procurement).
With a current NCI funding base of $41.9 million, $33 million in other cancer-related NIH support, $16.4 million
in other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant funding and $91.3 million in total peer reviewed funds, the SCI is fulfilling
its mission to translate Stanford discoveries into improving the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of cancer
patients and to better understand cancer etiologies among diverse populations in the Bay Area and beyond. SCI
has made major investments in Population Sciences, including the recruitment of a new Associate Director for
Population Sciences and the formation of a new Department of Epidemiology and Population Health. We have
brought important focus to our catchment area and to health equity through the recruitment of a new Associate
Director for Community Outreach and Engagement and the formation of a new SCI Office of Cancer Health

 Demand for heart transplant (HT) in the United States (US) far exceeds the supply of
donor organs. Each year, more than 500 patients on the waitlist die or become too sick for
transplant. Outcomes are especially poor for patients with high levels of sensitization – the
presence of preformed antibodies rendering one incompatible with potential donors. To reduce
waitlist mortality, it is essential to narrow the gap between donor heart supply and demand while
maintaining fairness. The current study will inform efforts to do so in a series of three aims.
 The first aim is to show the feasibility and benefits of higher donor heart utilization,
that is, the proportion of candidate hearts that are used for transplant. Average donor heart
utilization in the US is ~30%. Utilization is higher in Europe and at more “aggressive” centers
within the US, who nonetheless achieve acceptable post-transplant outcomes. The current
study will use simulation modeling to evaluate hypothetical scenarios in which all US HT centers
achieve the same utilization rates as 1) “aggressive” US centers and 2) Europe. Outcomes of
interest will include wait times and survival, measured on a population-level.
 The second aim is to identify patients who would – and would not – benefit from
transplant. The hypothesis being tested is that many on the waitlist would fare as well or better
with medical or mechanical device therapy in lieu of transplant. Delisting such patients would
help alleviate the supply-demand gap, but identifying this subset is challenging. One approach
uses multivariate risk scores to measure a patient’s potential benefit from transplant. The
current study will systematically test the reliability of post-HT survival scores in historical
cohorts. Suspecting their reliability to be poor, an alternative approach will be presented: to
estimate the benefit to transplant using blood type as an instrumental variable.
 The third aim is to demonstrate the benefits of prioritizing sensitized patients.
Allocation schemes can be designed that boost priority and reduce waiting times for sensitized
patients. The payoff to such schemes, in terms of wait times and population-level survival, will
be estimated using simulation modeling and an optimal prioritization scheme will be identified.
 This work will be conducted at Stanford University, a renowned research institution and
home to leaders in HT research. It accompanies a training plan that draws on close mentorship
and Stanford’s ample resources to equip the trainee with pertinent and career-advancing skills."
10578839,"ABSTRACT
Depression is debilitating, costly, and highly prevalent, representing the leading cause of ill health and
disability worldwide. A majority of US households includes pets. Pets offer a source of emotional
support and previous research has shown that they may help ease depression, anxiety, and stress.
However, longitudinal studies to establish causal relationships or explore mechanistic pathways are
still lacking. The objective of this proposal addressing PAR-18-213, ‘Human-Animal Interaction (HAI)
Research’, is to, for the first time longitudinally, examine the effects of pets in the home on depression
and psychological distress in humans, and to explore potential pathways by studying stress biomarkers
(salivary cortisol-DHEA ratio) and the direct and mediating effects of the gut microbiome and
metabolome in these associations. We will leverage three ongoing large population-based studies –
the Nurses’ Health Study 2 (NHS2, n=116,430), NHS3 (n=47,435), and the Growing Up Today Study
(GUTS), 12,413 children of the NHS2 women, who were 9-14 years old at enrollment in 1996 (88%
with pets). With biennial follow-up, they offer a wealth of repeatedly assessed lifestyle, environmental,
and psychosocial assessments allowing to finely control for their potential confounding in our analyses.
Our primary study aims include an ongoing collection of stool samples from 35,000 participants in the
NHS2, who we will follow after stool collection for depression to include 400 women with/without pets
and incident depression in the current application. In addition, a subcohort of 226 NHS2 participants
(62% with pet) collected detailed, repeated psychosocial assessments including information on pet
attachment, pet owner’s personality dimensions, and stress biomarkers as well as participants’ gut
microbiome; thus, we leverage these microbiome data at no additional cost. Further, embedded in
NHS3, we will initiate a longitudinal ‘Nurses’ Pets Study’ (NPS), enrolling pets of nurses into active
follow-up for future HAI studies.
Our chief hypotheses are that pet ownership/attachment reduces risk of incident depression and
psychological distress, and that primary pathways include an improved cortisol-DHEA ratio and
alterations in the gut microbiome, offering the potential for new therapeutic approaches and evidence-
based advice regarding the introduction of a pet into one’s home."
10849718,"Project Summary
Overall
This proposal is to continue the development of a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in
Integrative Neuroscience at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). Nationally, advances in the neurosciences
are proceeding on many fronts and addressing fundamental questions in both basic and clinical science. The
COBRE at UNR was established to synergize and elevate the capacity for neuroscience research at UNR and
the state of Nevada, by 1) cross-fertilizing research units that had already developed teams of focused
expertise in cognitive or cellular neuroscience or bioengineering; and 2) providing the modern infrastructure
required to mount impactful research programs in the field. Phase I and II have supported 24 tenure-track
junior faculty in both basic and clinical research. These mentored project leaders have achieved very high
productivity in both peer-reviewed publications and NIH, NSF, and agency funding. Phases I and II also
developed research cores with high impact and use, including establishing the first fMRI facility in the region.
The resources provided through the cores have expanded far beyond the original aims, and have been
mounted in ways that are highly cost-effective and sustainable. Phase III will further expand and solidify these
successes, supporting four research cores for 1) Neuroimaging; 2) Computational Modeling and Analysis; 3)
Cellular and Molecular Imaging; and 4) Virtual and Augmented Reality Interactions. The Computational Core
represents an expansion of the data analytics services supported in Phase II to include facilities and technical
support for AI and deep learning, and will fill an area we have identified of high potential impact and need. The
cores will continue to serve a large number of investigators and their teams and the user base will be further
expanded and strengthened by a Pilot Project Program providing investigator project support and a pool of
funds for using core facilities. Finally, the COBRE will continue to drive the rapid growth of other neuroscience
initiatives at UNR, by becoming the research arm of the Institute of Neuroscience established with university
support at the beginning of Phase II. This will allow the research aims of the center to connect with and
leverage the broader neuroscience research and training initiatives at the university, and to transition to a
permanent and sustained research center."
10841043,"Overall Abstract: We propose a Tri-Institutional Tuberculosis (TB) Research Advancement Center
(TRAC) at Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Rockefeller University. The
three institutions are adjacent to each other on a Tri-Institutional (Tri-I) campus in New York City. The purpose
of the proposed Tri-I TRAC is to pool the expertise and resources of an outstanding team of 20 senior TB
investigators at the three institutions to expand the number of investigators in the field of TB research and to
promote innovative multidisciplinary TB research. The senior investigators have diverse expertise
spanning biochemistry, basic microbiology, mycobacterial genetics, human genetics and immunology, drug
discovery, international clinical trials, and implementation science. A major focus will be supporting New
Investigators (NIs), who we define as senior post-doctoral fellows or junior faculty members who seek an
academic career and have not yet received an R01. We also will recruit New to TB (N2TB) Investigators,
who are R01 experienced investigators in other scientific disciplines who bring their expertise to study TB. The
TRAC will have four Cores. The Administrative Core will provide leadership, financial oversight,
communication, and program evaluation. A Developmental Core will fund 6 Developmental Project Awards
annually of $50,000 each to support NIs and N2TB investigators. Institutional support from Weill Cornell
Medicine will fund two of these awards each year which will be designated for under-represented minorities
and women scientists. The Clinical Core will build upon long-standing collaborations primarily in Haiti and
also in Tanzania. The Basic and Clinical Science Cores will provide NI and N2TB recipients of Developmental
Project Awards mentorship, technical expertise, and scientific resources unique to TB research including
access to TB animal models, genetically modified mycobacterial libraries, and biobanked clinical samples. The
Basic and Clinical Science Cores will also facilitate sharing of technology and resources between senior TB
investigators in order to initiate new lines of collaborative translational TB research. Other activities including
an annual symposium, a technology workshop, and travel to international TB clinical sites will bolster the
pipeline of new TB investigators and generate an environment conducive to multidisciplinary collaboration.
There will be no overlap with other NIH research grants, centers, or institutional cores. The TRAC will leverage
these existing resources and synergistically expand the number of TB investigators and foster new innovative
lines of collaboration. Our goal over 5 years is to have 25 NIs successfully compete for a TB related NIH R01
and transition to independence and to attract at least 5 N2TB investigators to TB science. Half will be
women and at least 20% underrepresented minorities. We will also initiate new lines of collaborative
translational research to address the five NIAID priorities in TB science with the ultimate goal of improving TB
diagnostics, prevention, and treatment and ending morbidity and mortality from TB world-wide."
10927226,"Abstract
Bone infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus remains the bane of orthopaedic surgery, as diagnostics,
prophylactics and treatments have significant shortcomings that result in catastrophic outcomes for patients,
and crippling healthcare costs. Although the incidence of infection following primary total joint replacement
(TJR) is low (~1%), reinfection rates are very high (15-40%), which has led to the orthopaedic paradigm that S.
aureus infection of bone is incurable. Additionally, prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is known to be a non-random
event that is largely determined by patient-specific factors. To address this, we proposed the original Center of
Research Translation on the Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection (CoRTOBI) to test the hypotheses
that: 1) there must be a reservoir of S. aureus that is not affected by standard of care treatments, and 2) the
patient’s immune proteome against S. aureus antigens impacts the incidence and outcome of bone infection.
Our work on this has resulted in innovative technologies that are being translated to the clinic by industry
partners, and several seminal discoveries that we will continue to work on in this renewal, including: 1) S.
aureus colonization of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) of live bone, 2) novel small molecule
inhibitors that specifically target these mechanisms that can be 3D-printed into custom spacers as adjuvants to
antibiotics, 3) development of a custom multiplex immunoassays to elucidate the immune proteome of S.
aureus, 4) development of in vivo imaging to quantify “the race for the surface” of implants in real time, and 5)
identification of anti-IsdB responses as susceptible immunity vs. anti-Gmd responses as protective immunity in
mice and patients with culture confirmed S. aureus bone infection. Based on this success, we propose
continuation of CoRTOBI with its Administrative Core that provides operational and fiscal management of the
CoRTOBI, as well as a Biostatistics Sub-Core, an Enrichment Program, and a Pilot and Feasibility Project
Program. We will also continue the Research Projects. Project 1 is focused on elucidating the mechanisms of
S. aureus invasion of the OLCN, and developing novel antibiotic and adjuvant impregnated 3D-printed
spacers. Project 2 is focused on elucidating the mechanism responsible for the susceptible immune proteome
in patients, translating our discovery of five protective antigens with a novel multivalent mRNA vaccine, and
bioinformatic assessment of patient-specific factors with the strain of S. aureus with which they are infected.
The Projects will be supported by an Osteoimmunology Research Core, which will provide state of the art
imaging, microfabrication and immunoassay analyses. The Core will also further innovate these technologies
into novel outcome measures and enhance their clinical utility towards commercial products. At the conclusion
of this CoRTOBI we will have in-depth knowledge of S. aureus OLCN invasion and immune evasion, as well as
novel candidate clinical assays, antimicrobials and vaccines, to diagnose, prevent and treat the most serious
bone infections, whose outcomes have not improved over the last half century."
10828749,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Inflammatory Responses (CMPHIR: P20-GM103625) was
established at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in 2012. The underlying scientific theme
is that addressing existing and emerging problems in infectious disease in a clinically relevant fashion will require
an understanding of both the pathogens themselves and how they impact the host immunological and
inflammatory response. This theme is based on the premise that understanding the complex interplay between
diverse pathogens and their common human host is a prerequisite to maximizing opportunities to manipulate
one or both sides of this equation in favor of the desired prophylactic and/or therapeutic outcome. In Phases I
and II, we assembled a critical mass of investigators around this scientific theme and provided them with the
administrative and technical resources they needed to establish successful scientific careers. In Phase III, we
will refine and expand on these efforts with the overall goal of building on our success in Phases I and II to
establish a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence that focuses on infectious diseases in a
comprehensive and clinically relevant fashion. To this end, the specific aims of this Phase III application are to:
1) provide an infrastructure that maximizes the competitiveness of CMPHIR investigators through the support of
essential core facilities; 2) promote continued growth of the CMPHIR and career development of its investigators;
and 3) transition the CMPHIR to a nationally recognized, self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research
Excellence with the expertise and resources to address existing and emerging problems in infectious disease."
10870604,"Suicide among Black youth has increased rapidly over the last two decades, reaching unprecedented levels.
While there have been substantive gains in knowledge related to the etiology of suicide ideation and behaviors
(SIB), most of this work has included predominantly White samples or have been cross-sectional or short-term
longitudinal studies. Less is known about the course of SIB during the adolescent and emerging adult years, and
malleable individual-specific and social ecological precursors and correlates associated with this course, among
low-income, urban Black youth. Such work is vital to informing developmentally-sensitive preventions and
interventions aimed at mitigating this major public health problem. The proposed R01 application aims to address
the aforementioned limitations by leveraging data collected among Black youth (N = 630) drawn from Baltimore
City over a 20-year period spanning the critical developmental windows of adolescence and emerging adulthood,
during which SIB often emerges. Data on mental health, academic and social competence, and life events have
been collected annually during early childhood (i.e., ages 6-8), adolescence (i.e., 12-18) and emerging adulthood
(i.e., 19-26). In addition, SIB, substance use and social ecological constructs (i.e., life events, racial
discrimination, neighborhood characteristics, and social support) have been measured during adolescence and
emerging adulthood. Specific aims of the study include: (Aim 1) to identify trajectories of SIB across adolescence
and young adulthood, and whether SIB trajectories during adolescence are associated with SIB trajectories in
emerging adulthood; and (Aim 2) to determine risk and protective individual-specific and environmental factors
during the early childhood, adolescent, and emerging adult years that are associated with SIB trajectories during
adolescence and emerging adulthood. We also plan to explore whether the identified risk and protective
longitudinal factors in Aim 2 influence the transition or changes in SIB trajectory membership from adolescence
to emerging adulthood. Determining salient factors associated with SIB continuity during adolescence and
emerging adulthood may inform the identification of pathways that could be promoted or interrupted, which may
have long-term implications for SIB across the life course. The investigative team brings together expertise in
the etiology and prevention of SIB among Black youth, prevention science, mental health and substance use of
adolescent and adult populations, and longitudinal latent variable modeling; thus, we are extremely well-
positioned to accomplish the study aims. This study directly responds to recommendations offered in the
Congressional Black Caucus’ Ring the Alarm report as it seeks to: 1) identify subgroups of Black youth at
increased risk for SIB across the lifespan; 2) determine risk and protective factors that are amenable to early
intervention; and 3) examine non-psychiatric factors (e.g., social and structural determinants) associated with
SIB course, which if found to be significantly related to SIB, might be the focus of targeted upstream suicide
preventions among Black youth."

10851674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We recently identified a novel population of flu-specific, lung-resident memory B cells (BRM cells) that are
phenotypically different than systemic memory B cells, reside in unique sites in the lung and respond more rapidly
to challenge infection than their systemic counterparts. Interestingly, lung BRM cells provide a significant degree
of protection to challenge infection, even when they do not cross-react with the HA and NA proteins of the
challenge virus, suggesting that BRM cells have additional effector functions beyond antibody (Ab) production.
In fact, B cells make inflammatory cytokines like IFN, lymphotoxin, OX40L and IL-6, as well as anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL-10, IL-27 and IL-35. Moreover they are potent APCs, particularly for their cognate antigens.
Thus, BRM cells have a variety of mechanisms, in addition to Ab, to modulate inflammation and promote anti-
viral immunity. The experiments in this proposal will investigate the mechanisms used by flu-specific BRM cells
to clear virus and protect the lung and will determine how pulmonary vaccination can elicit and maintain BRM
cells in the lung."
10896119,"ABSTRACT
Surveillance of many human pathogens relies primarily on clinical diagnosis of individuals who seek testing or
care. In most contexts the number of unobserved infections is unknown, which poses a challenge in effectively
mitigating transmission. Infections may go unobserved for a number of reasons, including mild and
asymptomatic infections not captured by clinical surveillance as well as symptomatic infections not captured
due to factors such as barriers in access to healthcare or limited testing resources. This is true for Vibrio
cholerae, a pathogen responsible for an estimated 3 million cholera cases and 100,000 deaths each year.
Previous studies in Bangladesh have shown that unobserved infections account for at least half of V. cholerae
infections and that individuals with asymptomatic infection shed less V. cholerae in their stool compared to
symptomatic cholera. The extent to which this impacts our ability to prevent and control outbreaks, and
whether these findings apply to other populations, is unknown. In this study we aim to address this gap in our
knowledge by investigating the contribution of unobserved infections to cholera burden and transmission in
multiple populations. We propose to do this by estimating the magnitude of V. cholerae infections that go
unobserved by comparing patterns in clinical and serological data across various endemic and epidemic
locations (aim 1), examining the degree to which individuals with mild symptoms who commonly go
unobserved shed V. cholerae bacteria that may be transmitted (aim 2), and estimating the risk of infection
following exposure to asymptomatic household contacts (aim 3). We expect to find high levels of unobserved
infections, particularly in areas with barriers in access to healthcare. We also anticipate that mild/asymptomatic
infections will be associated with bacterial shedding and ongoing transmission, but to a lesser extent than
cases with more severe symptoms. Alternatively, since people with mild/asymptomatic infections are less likely
to receive antibiotics and often continue to go about their daily routines, we may find increased bacterial
shedding and secondary infections in these cases. In either scenario, these results will provide important
insights into the degree to which unobserved infections contribute to V. cholerae persistence and spread, as
well as their role in our efforts to mitigate outbreaks. Our long-term goal is to better understand the underlying
host, microbial, and socio-demographic factors that lead to infections going unobserved so that we can design
more effective prevention and control strategies."

The NICHD also supports research to develop compounds for reproductive health related fields of research (e.g., infertility, gynecologic health, obstetrics and pediatrics, as well as pregnancy and perinatology).  The Chemical Screening and Optimization Facility (CSOF) fulfills a unique role by identifying, optimizing, and conducting small scale production of molecular agents that achieve a contraceptive effect.  The CSOF provides overall project management and the capabilities to support these objectives pursuant to development of new contraceptive methods: these include, but are not limited to, the generation of recombinant peptides and proteins, assay development, high throughput screening (HTS), x-ray crystallography, computational chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology.  Compounds identified and/or optimized by the CSOF will be prepared under non-Good Manufacturing Practices (non-GMP) for further preclinical evaluation. The CSOF plays a critical role in the drug development mission of the CRB. 
One approach to achieve this goal includes high throughput screening studies for the purpose of identifying hit compounds using High Throughput Screening (including computational approaches) for either contraceptive or reproductive health related targets. The research directed by this task order will utilize either in-house methods or appropriate subcontract facilities capable of high throughput screening, confirmatory assays (as needed) and/or in silico methods (as needed) or will be done in conjunction with a successful service request applicant who would assume responsibility for all biochemical and/or biological assays. 
Specifically, this Task Order is for the identification of small molecule(s) hits that engages a validated target either for inhibition or activation of a process for either contraception or a reproductive health related indication. It is expected that for a given service request up to 100 new chemical entities will be identified with biological properties consistent with conventional bioavailability design parameters (e.g. Lipinski’s Rule of 5) over a period of up to twelve months.  At the conclusion of which, the identified hit compound/small molecule(s) will have a significant improvement over established positive controls for ligand affinity (e.g., IC50 < 1 uM, up to 100 fold improvement compared to positive control) as demonstrated using identified biochemical assays, cellular assays, appropriate counter screening efforts, safety considerations (PAINs compliant), and isoform selectivity (>25 fold, if applicable). 
The objective of this contract is for the Chemical Screening and Optimization Facility (CSOF) with the capability to carry out the production of active recombinant protein, assay development, chemical screening, identification and optimization of chemical lead series and production of milligram to kilogram quantities of materials for in vitro and in vivo testing for contraception and/or reproductive health-related therapeutic indications."
10998058,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
DNA replication follows a defined spatiotemporal program in which different parts of the genome replicate at
different times during S phase. The DNA replication timing program interfaces with genome regulation while
also influencing the genome’s stability and mutational landscape. Abnormal replication timing is associated
with genetic diseases and oncogenesis. Despite the importance of DNA replication regulation to cell and
organismal biology, we have very limited understanding of the DNA sequences and molecular mechanisms
that specify the eukaryotic DNA replication timing program. Similarly, it remains unclear how replication timing
control intersects with the regulation of gene expression and with the epigenome in general. My lab has, and
continues to, develop novel experimental and computational approaches for measuring genome-wide
replication timing. We also pioneered a unique approach of linking replication timing to human genetic variation
in order to reveal the sequence elements that control replication timing and study their mechanisms of action
(Koren et al., Cell 2014; Ding et al., Nature Communications 2021; NIH Director’s New Innovator Award DP2-
GM123495). In this MIRA application, we will: 1) generate a new dataset of human replication timing, the
largest so far, and use a computational approach to link replication timing to gene expression and epigenomic
regulation in a novel and powerful way. 2) Utilize our previous and concurrent replication timing genetic
mapping in order to experimentally edit DNA sequences controlling replication timing. This will be followed by
several epigenomic assays and genetic experiments that will reveal the mechanisms and consequences of
replication timing regulation. As part of this, we will also develop a new approach, “perturb-RT”, to
systematically screen for novel sequence elements controlling replication timing. 3) Continue our recent
success of profiling replication timing in single cells by jointly measuring replication timing and gene expression
in the same single cells. We will use this approach to study how replication timing and gene expression co-vary
during cellular differentiation. Our work will substantially contribute to the field of DNA replication timing and
beyond, by providing unprecedented genomic resources, introducing novel genetic and genomic approaches,
deciphering the genetic basis of human replication timing, and revealing new insights into replication timing
regulation and its consequences."
10861897,"Abstract: The mechanisms by which neural stem cells build the brain from a simple epithelial tube is a
compelling mystery of biology. Mouse genetics has been one of the most powerful tools to discover the genes
and processes involved in building a healthy brain, or in neurodevelopmental disorders that affect brain
structure or function. The library of targeted mutations created by the International Mouse Phenotyping
Consortium (IMPC) provides a highly valuable resource for understanding those genes and processes. Many
mutations that cause neurodevelopmental phenotypes are lethal, either due to the brain defect or to pleiotropic
functions of the gene in other organs essential for viability. Thus, the bank of lethal mutants at IMPC provides
an enriched set of candidate genes required for brain development. However, changes in brain structure or
wiring are difficult to detect without the right tools and expertise. We propose to apply our expertise to
phenotype selected knockout lines that are likely to have neurodevelopment defects, based on gene
expression, function, and/or known mutation in a human developmental disorder. This is in response to an
FOA to characterize developmental defects in lethal IMPC mutants. We will combine non-hypothesis driven
gross phenotyping with hypothesis-driven analysis of a few selected brain development mutants. To add value
and efficiency to this screen, subsets of mutants will also be tested by co-investigators for inner ear
development phenotypes, and placenta, gastrulation, or neural tube defects. For the first tier of phenotyping,
lines will be tested for age of lethality and phenotyped for gross abnormalities of brain, inner ear, spinal cord,
and body development. Tier 2 phenotyping will incorporate histopathology of brain, inner ear, and placenta,
since many structural defects in these organs cannot be ascertained without sectioning and staining. We will
test for proliferation, layering, and axon tract defects. Tier 3 phenotyping will focus on a small number of
mutants with both abnormal brain phenotypes and gene functions in cytokinesis, to address our hypothesis:
that different defects in cytokinesis of cortical neural stem cells underlie a variety of brain malformations. We
will make use of methods we have established for quantitative analysis of cytokinetic furrowing and abscission
defects in developing mouse cortex. In all stages of phenotyping, heterozygotes and homozygotes will be
compared to controls quantitatively and with statistical rigor. Data will be shared with IMPC for the benefit of
the community. Our team of three investigators has a combined >50 years of expertise working on cellular
bases of organ development in the mouse model, and forward and reverse genetics. Through this project , we
will discover new mouse models for developmental disorders of the brain, inner ear, and placenta, and will
provide important new insights into the mechanisms of neural stem cell divisions and cellular defects
underlying brain malformations."
10770561,"SUMMARY
The goal of this program is to use comparative analysis of KSHV, EBV and MHV68 short and long noncoding
RNAs to reveal conserved functions of, and regulatory nodes targeted by, γ-herpesvirus noncoding RNAs during
tumorigenesis. Our unifying hypothesis is that A) γ-herpesviruses utilize short and long noncoding RNAs to
regulate both virus and host gene expression, and B) viral noncoding RNAs and/or virus-perturbed host lncRNAs
directly contribute to the genesis of HIV-associated malignancies. In support of this hypothesis, our program has
made a number of seminal findings during the first funding period, including: identification of high confidence
miRNA targetomes across all three viruses; demonstration of host lncRNA de-regulation in γ-herpesvirus infected
cells; discovery of circRNAs across all three viruses; global resolution of EBV and MHV68 transcriptomes and
discovery of new noncoding transcripts; demonstration that noncoding RNAs are the predominant viral gene
products detectable in some EBV+ malignancies; and demonstration of the first in vivo function for the long-
studied EBV EBER1 noncoding RNA. To date, our results from the first cycle have been reported in 20 research
publications and 5 review articles. To continue to address our unifying hypothesis we propose three highly
integrated projects: Project 1, led by Dr. Renne (University of Florida, UF), will mechanistically study viral
lncRNAs and how KSHV-encoded miRNAs induce alterations of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-
associated KSHV malignancies. Project 2, led by Dr. Flemington (Tulane University) will interrogate the role of
EBV (and KSHV) miRNA cluster inhibition of host miRNA maturation through “microprocessor overload” in the

The goal of this program is to use comparative analysis of KSHV, EBV and MHV68 short and long noncoding
RNAs to reveal conserved functions of, and regulatory nodes targeted by, γ-herpesvirus noncoding RNAs during
tumorigenesis. Our unifying hypothesis is that A) γ-herpesviruses utilize short and long noncoding RNAs to
regulate both virus and host gene expression, and B) viral noncoding RNAs and/or virus-perturbed host lncRNAs
directly contribute to the genesis of HIV-associated malignancies. In support of this hypothesis, our program has
made a number of seminal findings during the first funding period, including: identification of high confidence
miRNA targetomes across all three viruses; demonstration of host lncRNA de-regulation in γ-herpesvirus infected
cells; discovery of circRNAs across all three viruses; global resolution of EBV and MHV68 transcriptomes and
discovery of new noncoding transcripts; demonstration that noncoding RNAs are the predominant viral gene
products detectable in some EBV+ malignancies; and demonstration of the first in vivo function for the long-
studied EBV EBER1 noncoding RNA. To date, our results from the first cycle have been reported in 20 research
publications and 5 review articles. To continue to address our unifying hypothesis we propose three highly
integrated projects: Project 1, led by Dr. Renne (University of Florida, UF), will mechanistically study viral
lncRNAs and how KSHV-encoded miRNAs induce alterations of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-
associated KSHV malignancies. Project 2, led by Dr. Flemington (Tulane University) will interrogate the role of
EBV (and KSHV) miRNA cluster inhibition of host miRNA maturation through “microprocessor overload” in the
context of HIV-associated EBV malignancies. Project 3 led by Dr. Tibbetts (UF) will investigate the function of

This resubmission of application R01DA050470 proposes to use innovative approaches to identify “hotspots,”
defined as geographic areas in which high rates of HIV or HCV infection, high HIV viral loads, or drug-resistant
HIV strains are found. We propose two novel approaches for identifying hotspots: 1) Use of web-based
mapping technology to document observed and self-reported HIV and overdose risk behaviors among PWID in
private and semi-public injection settings (SPIS) and the attributes of these risk settings; 2) Systematically
collect cookers (containers used to mix and heat drugs before injecting) from injection settings and test them
for HIV and HCV antibodies (testing cookers is a novel method developed in the Johns Hopkins Virology lab).
We will recruit 600 HIV positive and negative people who inject drugs (PWID). These PWID will complete a
survey using a software program developed by our team to locate and map the areas where they inject and
attributes of these injection settings. These data will be used to identify high-risk behaviors in SPIS within
census block groups (CBGs). These participants will be followed for 2 years.
 The findings from this observational portion of the study will then be used to inform an innovative pilot of an
injection setting targeted peer-driven intervention to reduce HIV/HCV transmission and overdose risk
behaviors. From the identified CBGs, we will select 60 non-contiguous CBGs for a pilot cluster randomized trial
(CRT) of the intervention. The CBGs will be randomized to one of 4 conditions: 1) Peer education and stocking
of SPIS with risk reduction materials, 2) Peer education only, 3) Stocking SPIS with risk reduction materials
only, and 4) The standard of care. Based on their CBG and SPIS use, 120 index PWID participants will be
selected from the 600 PWID. These index participants will receive training corresponding to the assigned
condition of their CBG. The indexes will implement the intervention targeting two specific SPIS. Each index will
also recruit PWID from their CBG to serve as data collectors. In the SPIS, the data collectors will use
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and collect cookers for HIV/HCV testing. Data from the indexes
(N=120) and data collectors (N=120) will be used as outcomes of the 4-arm intervention."
10999035,"Small circular mRNA vaccines
Abstract:
Vaccines save numerous lives each year. Conventional vaccines based on pathogens, DNA, proteins, or
peptides are associated with poor pharmacokinetics, limited biostability, preexisting anti-viral-vector immunity,
weak immunogenicity, or safety concerns over genomic integration or virulent reversion. The emerging mRNA
vaccines hold the potential to overcome the above issues with pharmacokinetics and safety using mRNA and
advanced drug delivery systems. However, despite efficient delivery, current mRNA vaccines rely on long mRNA
that is still associated with 1) limited biostability, though extensively modified, and the resulting limited shelf-life
even using cold chains and poor antigen translation efficiency, and 2) complicated enzymatic production. To
address these limitations, we propose developing antigen-encoding small circular mRNA (circRNA), which are
highly biostable and efficiently delivered by existing nanocarriers, as a novel platform of mRNA vaccines. Small
circRNA is comprised of minimal RNA elements to translate peptide antigens. Our preliminary data showed
several notable features of small circRNA vaccines: 1) in contrast to long mRNA, small circRNA leverages
automated RNA synthesizers for fast, efficient, and precise chemical synthesis and versatile functional
modifications; 2) even without any biostabilizing modifications, terminus-free circRNA prevents exonuclease
degradation and prolongs its in vivo half-life and shelf-life under freezing, fridge, and ambient temperatures; as
a result, circRNA showed efficient antigen translation and immunomodulation; 3) small circRNA vaccines
leverage current drug delivery systems for efficient delivery to desired tissues and cells, and the small circRNA
sizes can increase its loading capacity in nanocarriers, relative to bulky mRNA; 4) circRNA vaccine is self-
adjuvanted due to intrinsic immunostimulation; 5) in cells, circRNA produces long genuine peptide antigens that
elicit potent immunity; and 6) the modularity of circRNA vaccine allows its easy adaption for wide application. As
a result, low-dose circRNA nanoparticles elicited potent immune responses in both young adult mice and aged
mice, protected mice from target cell challenge, and mediated robust tumor immunotherapy. In this application,
Aim 1 will optimize the antigen translation and presentation of biostable small circRNA vaccines by circRNA
engineering; Aim 2 will study nanoparticle delivery of circRNA into immune tissues and cells, and the stability,
integrity, and antigen translation kinetics of circRNA vaccines upon delivery to target cells; Aim 3 will decipher
the immunomodulation mechanism by nanoparticle-delivered small circRNA vaccines; and Aim 4 will use human
papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancer as a test bed to assess the prophylaxis and therapeutic efficacy of
nanoparticulate small circRNA vaccine in syngeneic and transgenic mouse tumor models. The PI (Early Stage
Investigator) has assembled a team with complementary expertise to conduct this study. If successful, this study
will lay the foundation to develop circRNA as a novel platform of mRNA vaccines for wide application in the
prophylaxis and treatment of diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases.

10926890,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this Program Project is to develop novel statistical methods for integrating
multi-omic data to address etiology, prognosis, and treatment of cancer through a collaboration
of four closely related projects and four
shared cores (see inset). The four
projects can be broadly described as
spanning the spectrum of analysis
challenges including feature selection,
mediation, interaction, and
characterization. The first of these,
“High-Dimensional Regression for Data
Integration,” develops new strategies
for the analysis of longitudinal -omic
data incorporating external functional
information, maintaining a rigorous
inferential foundation. The second
project, “Integration of Omic Data to
Estimate Mediation or Latent
Structures,” develops novel latent factor
and mediation models using high-dimensional omic data or GWAS summary statistics to identify
and distinguish genotype, exposure and omic effects. The third project, “Integration of Omic
Data in the Analysis of Gene x Environment Interaction,” incorporates gene expression and
other -omics data into powerful multi-step approaches to scan for interactions leveraging
exposure or disease marginal associations. Project 3 will also add novel approaches to identify
transcriptional interactions, hierarchical GxE models with heredity constraints (i.e., requiring
interactions to include the corresponding main effects), and extensions to longitudinal, survival,
and quantitative traits. The fourth project, “Statistical Methods for Genome Characterization,”
automates annotation of gene function using phylogenetic inference to identify new cancer-
specific regions of conserved DNA methylation. Project 4 also proposes a novel approach for
agnostic pathway gene set enrichment analysis. These projects will be supported by four cores:
Administrative Core (A), Functional Annotation Core (B), Computation and Software
Development Core (C), and Data Analysis and Research Translation Core (D). Core B will
maintain up-to-date copies of key bioinformatics resources and will develop a software
application that will provide a single unified portal for creating annotation files that integrates
data from multiple resources. Core C will assist with high-volume computing needs and will
develop user-friendly software packages that implement novel methods. Core D will focus on
translation of new methods, both by supporting applications to real cancer datasets and by
developing materials for training outside investigators in the use of our methods and software.
Our proposed work will have both methodological and substantive importance. On the one
hand, we will develop novel statistical methods that will be applicable to a wide range of cancer
epidemiology studies and clinical trials. These methods will, for example, allow more powerful
discovery of genetic associations and interactions through leveraging biological information from
other sources. They will have translational significance in the areas of risk prediction and
targeted interventions. Our program is designed to be highly integrative, with the various
projects and cores being inter-related, so that together they will be more informative than any of
them could be on their own. Program members have access to extraordinary data resources at
USC and elsewhere, assuring that the methods we develop will be motivated by, and applicable
to, important questions arising in current cancer research."
10841386,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to non-homeless
people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable
death. Homeless smokers want to quit, but studies have not yet uncovered the optimal approach to help them
do so. In a recently published 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) at Boston Health Care for the
Homeless Program (BHCHP), we found that financial incentives for smoking abstinence were associated with
7-fold higher odds of brief smoking abstinence in comparison to a non-incentivized control condition. These
results suggest that financial incentives are a promising approach for reducing smoking in this vulnerable
population, although further investigation in a larger sample is needed to improve the duration of on-treatment
abstinence, assess post-treatment effects, and better understand mechanisms of action and contextual factors
that may influence treatment response. To address these gaps, we will conduct a community-based RCT of
financial incentives for smoking abstinence among adult smokers at BHCHP. We will recruit 400 participants
from 3 BHCHP sites and randomize them to receive guideline-concordant standard care with (N=200) or
without (N=200) financial incentives for smoking abstinence. Standard care will consist of 8 weeks of
combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and 5 sessions with a tobacco coach who will provide
behavioral counseling, distribute NRT, and coordinate referrals to existing tobacco treatment resources.
Incentive arm participants will additionally receive a 24-week schedule of 20 debit card payments contingent on
short-term abstinence based on exhaled carbon monoxide levels, augmented with 16 interspersed payments
contingent on longer-term abstinence based on urine anabasine levels. We will use an embedded-experiment
mixed methods design, where qualitative (‘qual’) data collection is embedded within a larger quantitative
(‘QUAN’) RCT with the following aims: Aim 1. (QUAN) To determine the effect of the financial incentives
intervention on anabasine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at A) the end of treatment (24 weeks) and B) 24
weeks after treatment (48 weeks). We hypothesize that incentive arm participants will have greater abstinence
at both timepoints. Aim 2. (qual) To assess why, how, and under what circumstances homeless smokers A)
achieve abstinence in response to financial incentives and B) maintain abstinence after incentives are stopped.
To accomplish this aim, we will interview selected participants at 24 and 48 weeks, probing cognitive,
procedural, and contextual dimensions of their response to financial incentives to generate hypotheses about
mechanisms for on-treatment and post-treatment effects and to inform future work in this area. Our findings
could have important tobacco treatment implications for the 934,000 people served annually in US Health Care
for the Homeless programs, advancing NCI’s objective of reducing smoking in vulnerable populations."
10851899,"Overall Summary/Abstract
Our research focuses on understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead individuals to develop
dementia, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our findings, as well as those from others, indicate that there is
a complex interaction of clinical and subclinical cerebral and systemic factors during the pre-clinical phases of
AD, some which convey vulnerability and some which convey resilience. The use of state-of-the-art technology
is gradually providing us with better knowledge of the sequence of events and the role played by each risk
factor. There is agreement among researchers that inflammation plays a critical role in the AD
pathophysiological process, as noted in multiple pathological studies but examining inflammation in vivo has
been challenging. To address these issues, we propose to characterize a new PET tracer, SMBT-1, that has
high binding affinity for MAO-B, a proxy of astrogliosis. Astrogliosis is involved in Aβ deposition and alterations
in cerebral blood flow and blood brain barrier integrity. One critical remaining question is the temporal
relationship of astrogliosis to amyloid deposition, is astrogliosis reactive to Aβ deposition or does astrogliosis
represent an additional “hit” exacerbating the effects of amyloid and tau pathology. The present PPG proposes
to explore across 4 projects, the relationship of astrogliosis to AD pathology and risk factors using a
combination of state-of-the-art neuroimaging, clinical, blood biomarker (and neuropathological tools. We
propose to assemble a cohort of 300 participants age 55 and older who will complete annual
neuropsychological, clinical, and blood examinations on all participants. At 24 and 48 months follow up
evaluation will also include repeat PET and MRI scans to identify abnormalities and/or changes in Aβ and tau
deposition, astrogliosis, brain structure and function to determine severity and progression of AD pathology,
astrogliosis and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Utilizing this cohort, Project 1 will focus on the hypothesis
that astrogliosis augments, either directly or independently, the effects of Aβ and tau pathology as well as the
effects of CVD on neurodegeneration (MRI) and cognition. In Project 2, we will explore the hypothesis that
astrogliosis mediates the association between health risk factors (cardiovascular risk factors and sleep) and
amyloid and tau pathology. Project-3 will utilize novel 7T MRI to assess the role of brain fluid dynamics in the
pathway between astrogliosis and AD pathology. Finally, Project 4 will use the existing ADRC and PPG
banked brains to characterize regional differences in SMBT-1 autoradiography and in vitro binding in relation to
fine-grained immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of MAO-B/GFAP astrogliosis, amyloid and tau
pathology, vascular pathology, and synaptic markers in AD and non-AD autopsy brains, and it will ultimately
characterize SMBT-1 PET in relation to neuropathology in postmortem brains from PPG participants who come
to autopsy."
10806135,"Scientific Abstract:
The frequent use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to support cell cultures is challenged by lot-to-lot variability, supply
constraints, pathogen contaminants and ethical questions. These issues have increased significance due to the
burgeoning use of FBS in cell research and therapy development. FBS has been used for over a century to
culture cells, but with the need to define culture conditions for efficient manufacturing, along with modern
approaches to control delivery of key molecules, many of the problems associated with FBS use can now be
alleviated. The need to reduce animal products is critically important, as is the need to use human growth factors
to optimize human cell growth. The company StemCultures specializes in controlling the growth factor (GF)
component of cell culture media. Our goal is to replace FBS GFs with a bioengineered DISCTM (Defined Insert
for Sustainable Culture) device providing controlled-release human recombinant GFs. The advanced cell
manufacturing DISCTM device will address concerns about FBS and improve the reproducibility of cell production.
In this application we will develop a DISCTM device for growth of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.
Human RPE was selected as a testbed for FBS replacement as these cells are a vanguard for stem cell
replacement therapy in the US, Europe and Asia. A barrier to reducing FBS use is the lack of knowledge about
the GF content of FBS that is critical for growth of the RPE cell product. We will measure levels of FBS GFs that
stimulate human RPE cell proliferation. Selected recombinant human GFs will be encapsulated in controlled-
release GF microbeads that provide a standardized growth signal over time, to replace the variable levels of
bovine GFs provided by FBS with defined levels of native human recombinant GFs. The GF microbeads will be
assessed in a factorial design experiment to identify microbead combinations that support RPE cell growth at a
reduced level of FBS. The microbead combination that supports RPE cell growth without FBS or at the lowest
level of FBS will be packaged in a Defined Insert for Sustainable Culture (DISCTM) device to simplify RPE cell
manufacture. The DISCTM will be manufactured as a commercial product marketed to reduce FBS dependence
of the commercially important RPE cells. Future work will apply the microbead/DISCTM platform strategy to
reduce FBS dependence of other cell types. The company StemCultures (SCL) routinely manufactures
microbeads and DISCsTM for sustained release of GFs in culture media and the co-located Neural Stem Cell
Institute (NSCI) has extensive RPE cell culture expertise. The SCL-NSCI collaboration successfully completed
Phase 1 aims, in preparation to make Phase 2 goals highly feasible."
10595614,"Background: Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disorder, whose incidence has
been increasing over time. Untreated pHPT can lead to many preventable complications (nephrolithiasis,
osteoporosis and pathologic fractures, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders) and significantly decrease the
quality of life. Our preliminary work with national data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data
Warehouse (CDW) has identified significant under-recognition of pHPT among hypercalcemic patients and
underutilization of indicated parathyroidectomy across the VA healthcare system. To design effective
interventions, we first need to validate the database-derived results with data from individual medical record
review, and to explore the reasons for such a significant deviation from evidence-based guidelines. We also
need to uncover possible misconceptions and gaps in knowledge among clinicians, possible system barriers in
the management of patients with pHPT, as well as to elicit input from clinicians about possible interventions.
Innovation: This is the first study to explore at a granular level with a mixed methods approach the reasons for
the under-recognition and undertreatment of pHPT observed both in the VA and in other healthcare systems.
We anticipate that this pilot work will serve as the basis for health-informatics-based interventions, which will
be some of the first ones addressing surgical diseases, and thus provide a model for other surgical pathologies
in the future. The proposal intends to address two VA HSR&D areas of emphasis: Information systems to
enhance access and timeliness to care (informatics to facilitate diagnosis and management of a common
endocrine disease) and Innovation in Health Services Research (novel approach of broadening the focus of
Health Informatics in the management of surgical diseases across the VA system).
Specific aims: (1) To evaluate the underlying reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of patients with
pHPT in the VA; (2) To explore VA clinician perceptions related to diagnosis and management of
hypercalcemia and pHPT, including their attitudes towards potential interventions for improvement.
Methodology: In this exploratory pilot project, we will conduct an in-depth medical record review of 200
hypercalcemic Veterans without parathyroid hormone testing (underdiagnosis) and of 200 patients with pHPT
without parathyroidectomy (undertreatment) to explore possible reasons for underdiagnosis and
undertreatment of pHPT.
We will also conduct semi-structured interviews with 30 VA clinicians to explore their knowledge and
perceptions on hypercalcemia and pHPT management, external barriers affecting compliance with guidelines
and their attitude towards possible interventions. Our goal is to reveal misconceptions, gaps in knowledge,
systemic limitations in the management of patients with pHPT in the VA, as well as to elicit input from the
providers on proposed interventions.
Next steps: The results will inform the design of improvement interventions, which will be trialed at a local
level before disseminating implementation more broadly in the VA."

The emergence of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is a growing problem that
threatens established antimicrobial treatment protocols. Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical threat pathogen
notorious for its ability to rapidly develop multidrug resistance. A. baumannii causes hospital-acquired infections,
which manifest as bacteremia, urinary tract and wound infections. In the US, an estimated 60% of hospital-acquired
A. baumannii infections were multidrug-resistant, often including carbapenem resistance, which leaves colistin as
the “last-resort” treatment option. However, colistin resistance has also emerged. There is an urgent need to
understand intrinsic mechanisms that promote antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii to guide alternative antimicrobial
strategies. Our preliminary work has identified two LD-transpeptidases that promote viability of colistin resistant
lipooligosaccharide-deficient A. baumannii. Specifically, LD-transpeptidase-dependent cell envelope modifications
are key for the resistance phenotype, where alternative crosslinks compensate for outer membrane defects. In this
proposal, we will address three important questions to understand the function and regulation of LD-transpeptidases
in A. baumannii, including (I) how does LD-transpeptidase activity counter otherwise lytic mechanical forces
produced by outer membrane defects?; (II) how are LdtK lipoprotein substrates regulated in A. baumannii?; and (III)
how do class A penicillin-binding proteins impact LD-transpeptidase activity in A. baumannii? Collectively, these
studies will address key questions in bacterial physiology and cell envelope assembly, which will enable us to
build a model of intrinsic factors in A. baumannii that contribute to multidrug resistance. Furthermore, these analyses
will aid in the design of combinatorial drug regimens that target both essential outer membrane and peptidoglycan
layers of the cell envelope, thus precluding resistance; consequently, our findings support the National
Institute of Health mission, which aims to foster fundamental discoveries to reduce human disease."

research on Hispanic, Military, and Veteran health issues, UT-Health-SA addresses regional health
disparities that present both challenges and opportunities for medical research that are of nationwide
relevance. The Goals of the South Texas Medical Scientist Training Program (STX-MSTP) are to support
the training of a diverse group of physician-scientists who will: 1) Provide the highest quality of clinical
care, 2) Conduct innovative and impactful biomedical research across the basic, translational, and clinical
spectrum, 3) serve as clinical and scientific leaders addressing the growing health disparities of America,
and 4) Practice inclusive, safe, and rigorous mentorship in research and medical training environments. The
STX- MSTP provides training in traditional wet-lab biomedical science investigation while exposing
students to our unique clinical environment and providing them with training in Health Disparities
Research. Based upon the success of our initial STX-MSTP T32 award, and significant, positive trajectories
in student recruitment, achievements (publications and F-grant awards), and retention, as well as placement
after program completion over the past ten years, we are requesting support for 11 training slots per year

1. Coordinate NARCH tribal partnerships among FDL, Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate (SWO), Native American
 Community Clinic (NACC), additional tribes/tribal organizations, and academic researchers to grow our
 research network in order to build relationships and encourage future research collaboration.
2. Develop the FDL Research Data Repository to gather, store, and curate multi-site tribal research data
 from the NARCH Epidemiologic Project to Increase Indigenous Capacity (EPIIC), as well as from other
 past and future research projects conducted at FDL.
3. Hire, train, and mentor a FDL Research Data Manager to be responsible for organizing, storing, and
 analyzing data as efficiently as possible, while upholding rigorous, agreed-upon standards in privacy,

irradiation. SCC usually develop from premalignant precursors, providing an opportunity for intervention to
prevent malignant disease and metastatic progression. Treatment of clinically detectable malignant lesions and
precursor actinic keratoses still relies largely on surgical excision. These procedures are invasive, carry a
significant healthcare cost, and are often an insufficient means of preventing metastatic progression in
immunocompromised patients. Consequently, there is a need for more effective mechanism-based treatments
with no or minor side effects. In preliminary investigations, we showed that increased nuclear transporter
exportin (XPO)1 drives aberrant localization of the scaffolding and signaling protein 14-3-3 to activate
prosurvival pathways in SCC cells. Genetic deletion of the gene for 14-3-3 suppressed tumor development by
75% and blocked malignant progression while nontumorigenic skin cells were unaffected by the lack of 14-3-
3. Consequently, our hypothesis is that inhibiting two key regulators that drive aberrant prosurvival signaling
will provide a novel and effective means to prevent skin tumor growth and malignant progression with minimal
toxicity to the surrounding normal skin. In the proposed research we will delineate the mechanisms and
consequences of XPO1-driven aberrant 14-3-3 signaling for malignant keratinocytes (Aim 1), improve upon
candidate agents we have developed that disrupt 14-3-3 prosurvival signaling (Aim 2), and provide proof-of-
principle evidence of the efficacy of 14-3-3 and XPO1 inhibitors for the prevention of skin tumor development
and progression using human patient derived (PDX) and UV irradiation-induced skin cancer models.
Successful completion of this work is anticipated to lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment
of skin cancer."
10815824,"This proposal finalizes the design of a portable ankle robot as a therapeutic device to reverse foot drop and restore safer
independent walking after stroke, then conducts a rigorous randomized clinical trial to establish clinical proof for this new
market application. Currently, there are no therapeutic solutions for foot-drop, only assistive devices (braces, canes,
electrical stimulation) that don't reverse the underlying ankle deficits. In contrast to arm robotics, lower extremity robotics
have been largely unsuccessful in stroke patients to date, we posit because they do not emphasize volitional engagment for
mediating motor learning. We pioneered modular ankle robotics technology, enabling human-robotics cooperative
learning utilizing impedance control for deficit severity adjusted assist-as-needed in conjunction with adaptive control for
precise timing of assistance to sub-events across the gait cycle. Our five positive clinical studies using this tethered
research device show hemiparetic ankle motor learning that translates into improved over-ground gait. Most importantly,
our randomized study shows that 18 sessions of ankle robotics integrated treadmill training (but not seated robot training)
durably reverses foot drop, restores paretic leg propulsion, and promotes safer heel-first foot landing during unassisted
walking, enabling 85% to self-discard their ankle braces or switch to a less dependent assistive device. Inspired by our
findings that ankle robot mediated functional motor learning is most effectively conducted in the context of locomotor
task-oriented training, we pursue finalization of a lighter weight and ergonomic portable ankle robot (AMBLE) that
meets portability and clinical usability standards for untethered wear into regular mobility focused physical therapy (PT).
Phase I produces a commercial portable ankle robot with desired portability (device mass, battery life); hardware design
(FDA freeze)-microcontroller software (FDA compliant); and adequate clinical usability (client-therapist performance
report card, auto-adjustable assistance) that meets key safety, stability, and comfort metrics (don-disengage time,
slippage, part failure, skin abrasions/irritations) during over-ground walking and mobility tasks for full integration into
physical therapy. Commercial units meeting FDA requirements will reach design freeze the first year (Phase 1); feasibility
of which is supported by our precedent battery operated version already showing proof-of-function in stroke patients.
Using AMBLE as a therapeutic device, optimized by the robot's intrinsic measurement capacities, we shift the robotics
rehabilitation paradigm beyond repetitive robot guided exercise task practice, toward immersive PT integrated robotics
(PTR). Phase II (3-yrs) is a blinded, randomized clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that 9 weeks (18 sessions) of
PTR is more effective than PT alone to reverse foot drop as assessed by gait biomechanics (ankle angle at initial contact,
peak swing ankle angle, number of heel-first strikes - % total steps, gait velocity; secondary outcomes- 3D gait
biomechanics, daily ambulatory activity ) and blinded clinician assessment (dorsiflexion active range of motion, ankle
muscle strength, assistive device needs). Our results will establish safety and initial efficacy for reversal of foot drop and
restoration of biomechanically safer walking as a new market application filling an unmet need, and shift care toward PT
integrated robotic exoskeletons across other impaired joints."
10652975,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast and ovarian cancer are two of the most common cancers among women in the US. Approximately 15%
to 20% of cases exhibit a family history of breast or ovarian cancer suggesting strong heritable components.
Clinical germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition gene panels is now widely used in an effort to identify
women at risk for these cancers. The identification of pathogenic mutations in established predisposition genes
can result in improved risk management for ovarian or breast cancer, depending on the gene, for tested
patients and their family members. For instance, MRI screening for early detection of breast cancer is
recommended for all individuals with pathogenic mutations in high and moderate risk breast cancer genes, and
carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers can benefit from prophylactic mastectomy and/or
oophorectomy for reduction of cancer risk. Furthermore, ovarian cancer patients with germline or somatic
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may benefit from targeted therapy with platinum agents or PARP inhibitors. The
efficacy of these clinical interventions show the promise of identifying pathogenic mutations in genes that
predispose to these cancers. However, the utility of results from panel testing has been limited because the
levels of risk for breast and ovarian cancer associated with mutations in several of the panel genes has not
been clear. Importantly, recent studies have established that germline pathogenic mutations in RAD51C and
RAD51D are associated with substantially increased risks of ovarian cancer, and moderate and high risks of
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), respectively, and RAD51D mutations are associated with moderate risks
of breast cancer overall. While these genes have important roles in susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer,
much remains to be learned about how to use testing results for the benefit of those with germline pathogenic
mutations or variants of uncertain significance or with somatic inactivation of the genes in tumors. In this
precision medicine oriented project we propose to define the contribution of RAD51C and RAD51D mutations
to ovarian and breast cancer. In Aim 1 we propose to define the risks of ovarian and breast cancer associated
with inherited RAD51C and RAD51D mutations in high-risk families and the general population. In Aim 2, we
propose to comprehensively characterize the functional properties and functional domains of RAD51C and
RAD51D that influence cancer risks and response to therapeutic agents, leading to classification of the clinical
relevance of many variants of uncertain significance (VUS). In Aim 3, we propose to evaluate the influence of
targeted therapy on RAD51C and RAD51D deficient tumors in preclinical models. At the conclusion of the
study we expect to have improved understanding of RAD51C and RAD51D-associated cancer susceptibility
and the responsiveness of ovarian tumors deficient in RAD51C or RAD51D to specific therapeutic agents.

10814301,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the US and in most countries
worldwide. Over 3.6 million US men are currently living with PC, and this number is expected to increase to >5
million by 2030. Approximately 90% of PC cases are diagnosed at a local or regional stage, when the 5-year
survival is >99%. Consequently, most men with PC survive >15-20 years after diagnosis. However, PC
diagnosis and treatment can be devastating for men and their partners, and may increase risks of mental
illness. Importantly, mental disorders are treatable, and early intervention could reduce suffering, improve
quality of life, and prevent premature death. Despite the high public health burden of mental disorders, they
are severely understudied compared with somatic outcomes of PC. A comprehensive understanding of long-
term mental health sequelae is critically needed to improve care and outcomes for PC survivors and their
partners. The few prior studies have had important limitations, including limited follow-up times and sample
sizes, and ascertainment of mental disorders using only hospital data, which captures only the most severe
cases. No large-scale studies have included partners. We will address these limitations by conducting the first
comprehensive long-term study of mental health outcomes in PC survivors and partners in a national cohort (N
>4 M) using highly complete data from primary care, specialty outpatient, and inpatient settings. We
hypothesize that PC survivors and their partners have increased risks of major mental disorders and suicide.
To test this hypothesis, we will examine these outcomes in 210,432 men diagnosed with PC in Sweden in
1987-2018 and their 163,085 partners, compared with 2.1 M men without PC and their 1.6 M partners, followed
for up to 34 years through 2020. Sweden is an ideal setting because individual-level data an PC diagnoses,
treatment, and mental health outcomes are available for the entire population with over 3 decades of follow-up,
and the incidence and treatment of PC and common mental disorders are comparable to the US. This
proposal addresses key priorities identified by the 2019 NCI workshop on ""Evidence Gaps in Cancer
Survivorship Care"". Our specific aims are to identify: (1) long-term risks of 4 mental disorders (major
depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug use disorders) and suicide in PC survivors; (2) high-risk subgroups who
may benefit most from interventions; (3) whether mental disorders are associated with higher PC-specific
mortality; and (4) long-term risks of mental disorders and suicide in partners of PC survivors. The proposed
research is significant because millions of men are surviving with PC, and their mental health sequelae may
have substantial impacts that are understudied and preventable. It is innovative because it will provide the first
long-term assessment in a national cohort of PC survivors and partners by integrating unparalleled individual-
level data for >4 M people. The results will identify the long-term mental health outcomes in PC survivors, their
partners, and high-risk subgroups, and guide early interventions to improve their long-term health."
10606531,"Background
Every day, more than 600 hospitalized Veterans face a time-pressured, complex, high-stakes choice regarding
post-acute care (PAC) supports following hospitalization. While nearly all efforts to improve PAC choice have
focused on which provider to use, the type of PAC services selected can have life-altering implications in terms
of patient outcomes, finances, and caregiver burden. For the majority of older Veterans, the main choices are
to go to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or go home, with or without home health care (HH). In preliminary work,
we found that Veterans are infrequently included in post-acute care decision-making and are not informed
about tradeoffs between PAC settings.
Significance/Impact
This research program will provide critical knowledge to Veterans, clinicians, and policy makers about
Veterans' outcomes across PAC settings, while also piloting a tool to support high-quality decision-making by
better aligning Veterans priorities with services.
Innovation
This theoretically driven mixed methods approach will draw from decision science, use large datasets, and
incorporate user-centered design to reveal new insights into what matters most to Veterans discharged to
PAC, and how best to align care with their values and goals. Veterans' priorities and goals for PAC are
unknown, and our approach will establish important patient-centered outcomes for the VA to consider in
achieving patient-centered PAC. I will use these findings to develop a new PAC decision support tool that is
feasible and acceptable to patients, caregivers, and clinicians.
Specific Aims
My specific aims include: 1) Identify attributes of PAC that matter most to a diverse sample of older Veterans
and caregivers when making decisions about post-discharge supports. 2) Determine differences in 100-day
outcomes for older hospitalized Veterans who receive PAC via SNF vs. HH. 3) Develop and pilot a decision
tool to elicit hospitalized Veterans' priorities for PAC, so they may be shared with the healthcare team.
Methodology
To better inform PAC decisions and evidence-based practice, in Aim 1 I will first use a mixed-methods
approach informed by decision-science to identify what matters most to Veterans and caregivers when
deciding between care types. In Aim 2, I will compare patient-centered outcomes between PAC settings to
identify important trade-offs in SNF vs. HH. I will use advanced statistical techniques and a unique dataset (the
2012-16 Residential History File) to accomplish this aim. Last, in Aim 3 with methods from user centered
design, I will rigorously identify what matters most to Veterans when making PAC decisions and pilot a
decision tool.
Next Steps/Implementation
This research program will help better out understand the tradeoffs in outcomes between post-acute care
services, while piloting a tool to support decision-making."
10677554,"Background: This is a time of unprecedented loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness in particular is
a powerful predictor of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, functional decline, and death. Loneliness can
and should be addressed by health systems. Due to risk for loneliness and negative health outcomes, a
group of particular concern is older adults with medical or psychiatric comorbidity who have limited
treatment engagement. Caring Contacts is an intervention that can address loneliness and poor
treatment engagement. However, it has only been evaluated in a narrow population of psychiatric
patients and not examined amongst patients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other disasters.
Significance: This project addresses VA’s top clinical priority (suicide prevention), an overarching
priority of the Office of Research and Development (clinical trials), and multiple Health Service
Research and Development priority areas, including social determinants of health, aging, access to
care, mental health, suicide prevention, and population/whole health. The impact of this project is very
high because it will advance scientific understanding of key gaps related to the mechanisms and
outcomes of Caring Contacts, while also evaluating a timely, pragmatic, low-cost, and scalable
intervention for Veterans affected by lack of social connection and treatment engagement. If effective, it
will have applicability as a response to treatment disengagement and future disasters.
Innovation and Impact: We have taken an empirically-grounded suicide prevention intervention and
adapted it for Veterans with poor treatment engagement in VA outpatient care. This study is innovative
in testing an intervention responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, and unique in using
a health services intervention strategy to target loneliness. The intervention’s peer support component
is highly novel for its low resource demands and potential for scalability.
Specific Aims: The overarching objective of this project is to evaluate “Crisis Caring Contacts” (CCC),
an adaptation of Caring Contacts tailored to reduce loneliness in the context of the pandemic. To reach
this objective we will achieve these aims: 1) Among older Veterans with poor treatment engagement,
evaluate the effectiveness of Crisis Caring Contacts in decreasing loneliness, compared to enhanced
usual care; 2) Evaluate the effect of Crisis Caring Contacts on other important outcomes, including
treatment engagement and suicidal ideation; 3) Explore potential moderators of treatment response to
Crisis Caring Contacts; and 4) Explore the effect of Crisis Caring Contacts on all-cause mortality and
suicide attempts.
Methodology: Our approach is to conduct a multisite, pragmatic randomized controlled trial of CCC.
We will target Veterans age 60 and over with active psychiatric or medical diagnoses who have had
limited treatment engagement in VA outpatient care. Those in the CCC treatment arm will be sent 10
postcards over 10 months by a Peer Support Specialist. Those in the enhanced usual care arm
(control) will be sent non-personalized, general health resource information. We will examine self-report
and administrative data outcomes over 24 months of follow-up.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will collect pre-implementation data from our study sites and share
this with our operational partner, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP). Crisis
Caring Contacts is highly suited to future implementation due to its scalability, ease of creating an
operational dashboard to identify Veterans who could receive the intervention, and ability to add study
materials to an implementation toolkit for VA Caring Contacts interventions."
10834737,"Project Summary
American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults are more likely to develop cancer and die from it than white
American adults, reflecting pronounced and persistent cancer health disparities (CHDs). Colorectal cancer
(CRC) rates are disproportionately high among AIANs in the Northern Plains and Alaska regions; likewise, risk
factors for CRC are also high, including non-modifiable factors such as increasing age and rurality, and proven
modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity, and obesity. A recent consensus report indicates strong
evidence that physical activity (PA) lowers risk for colon cancer through systemic (i.e., metabolism,
inflammation) and obesity reduction pathways. However, despite availability of efficacious behavioral
interventions to increase PA among older adults, a critical gap exists between evidence generated and action
taken to implement such interventions among AIAN older adults. This gap represents a missed opportunity to
implement current evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer prevention among high-risk populations
experiencing pronounced CHDs. Implementation science concentrates on understanding and accelerating
integration of such EBIs into public health practice settings to improve health and can be leveraged here to
address this critical public health gap, thus addressing persistent CHDs and improving overall health among
AIAN communities. This F99/K00 Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award application assists a
promising trainee - Maja Pedersen, who has 15 years of experience in community-based behavioral
interventions among rural AIAN communities in the Northern Plains and Alaska regions - to embark on a
rigorous research and training program to confront this critical gap using best practices for intervention
research with AIAN communities and current implementation science methods. Pedersen’s long-term goal is to
become an independent investigator in designing and implementing PA interventions among underserved
populations - including AIANs - to improve cancer-related health outcomes and reduce CHDs. Her short-term
goals include gaining expertise in the use of multilevel intervention methods, dissemination and implementation
science, cancer prevention and control among geriatric populations, experimental design, and intensive
longitudinal methods. In collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of predoctoral mentors, she has
developed a training plan to initiate these goals via coursework, workshops, scientific meetings, directed
readings, and mentored research (F99 Phase). As she transitions into the postdoctoral phase, she will
assemble a team of high-level, cancer-focused mentors to support her through continued mentored training
with an explicit focus on cancer prevention and control. Her postdoctoral research (K00 Phase) executes the
logical next steps in her research sequence on a trajectory toward a full-scale implementation and
effectiveness trial as an independent scientist."
10784728,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center (HMTRC) renewal project is to
develop and disseminate optimal new hyperpolarized (HP) 13C MR technologies with requisite
training/documentation to advance significantly this emerging molecular imaging method driven push-pull by 13
Collaborative Projects (10 extramural). Through numerous preclinical and clinical research studies to date, it
has become clear both that HP 13C MR has outstanding research and clinical value, but also that virtually all
aspects of this technology (instrumentation, agent chemistry, DNP/dissolution methodology, MR acquisition,
and data analysis) require specialized developments to realize their full potential.
These new technologies, driven “push-pull” by the CPs, will be developed through three Technology Research
& Development (TRD) projects and provided to 12 Service Projects (10 extramural) to benefit their funded
research and disseminated widely to the general scientific community. TRD1 focuses on technology
development for polarizer and RF detector/exciter instrumentation. TRD2 will develop novel HP MR
molecular imaging probes tested in realistic preclinical models and correlative science studies. TRD3 will
develop new HP C-13 MR acquisition and free, open-source analysis software for the reconstruction, analysis,
and visualization of HP MR data specialized for CP and SP needs.
This proposed P41 renewal project was recently reviewed by our External Advisory Committee that is
comprised of experts in HP 13C MRI, clinical translation, and CP & SP PI’s. Their report states: “The EAC…is
unanimous in their assessment that the HMTRC is high functioning as an NCBIB. The HMTRC has led the
nation (and the world) in the development and translation of HP MRI through a unique combination of skills,
expertise, instrumentation, environment, clinical engagement, and industry engagement, which simply does not
exist elsewhere. The HMTRC will continue to serve as a critical national resource through the next funding
cycle as the field of HP MRI expands and matures, particularly with the clinical translation of new HP agents,
and more sites engaging in research involving human subjects. The restructured Center benefits from clear
and enhanced synergy between all TR&Ds and Collaborative Projects that are more broadly geographically
distributed. HMTRC programs for training and dissemination remain outstanding. Progress in the engagement
and stimulation of clinical interest is nothing short of remarkable, and crucial for the continuing growth and
development of this field.” The current P41 project was designed 5 years ago to focus on preclinical HP 13C
MR research, since at that time, human studies were only being conducted at UCSF. However, now that many
different sites are conducting clinical research studies with the support of this NCBIB, the new renewal P41 is
redesigned to facilitate widespread future clinical trials of HP 13C MRI to address unmet clinical needs."

The prevalence of chronic pain is higher among American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) people than any other
group in the United States. Although a number of psychosocial interventions for chronic pain are well-established
as effective, there are no culturally adapted interventions for AI/AN individuals. This proposed study aims to
begin the process of developing a culturally-adapted psychosocial pain intervention for AI/AN individuals at the
Portland Area Indian Health Service – Yakama Service Unit. The K99 phase will focus on the development of
the intervention and the R00 will entail a feasibility randomized pilot trial. During the K99 phase, focus groups
will aid the in the development of a treatment manual, workbooks, and procedures for a culturally appropriate
psychosocial pain intervention (Specific Aim 1). After developing a prototype intervention, focus groups will then
provide feedback to improve the intervention (Specific Aim 2). Specific Aim 3 is to assess the feasibility of
conducting a future randomized controlled trial with the developed intervention from the K99 phase. This
research will provide pilot data for an NIH R01 proposal which will be prepared and submitted towards the end
of the R00 phase. The long-term objective of the proposed Pathway to Independence Award is to support the
applicant in transitioning into an independent research scientist who studies chronic pain disparities and
conducts intervention research in AI/AN communities. The candidate's prior research in chronic pain disparities
in low-income communities in Alabama, community-based participatory research, and chronic pain trials are a
strong match for this current proposed project. With the current project, she will expand her knowledge and
expertise into an important new area of research that has largely been neglected by the research community.
With this project, the candidate will have the mentoring and training necessary for enhancing cultural competency
in working with AI/AN individuals (Training Goal 1), gaining skills in conducting community-based participatory
research with AI/AN communities (Training Goal 2), and fostering skills in the development, adaptation,
implementation, and dissemination in clinical trials (Training Goal 3). Drs. Jensen, Walters, Rhudy, and Fuentes
will serve as mentors and offer expertise in the areas of chronic pain intervention research, cultural adaptations
for psychosocial interventions for AI/AN individuals, tribal based research, and community-based research
methods with AI/AN communities. The University of Washington training environment provides significant
resources and support that would facilitate the development of skills and expertise needed for the applicant to
transition into an independent research scientist. The Yakama Service Unit is strongly committed to this
proposed study and will provide critical support in recruitment, retention, and space for focus groups and
treatment. Because each tribal community has their own values, traditions, and culture, the proposed study will
offer a step-by-step process for culturally adapting chronic pain interventions that may extend to tribal
communities across the country."
10661630,"Project Abstract
Castrate resistant prostate cancer is a uniformly lethal disease and, although there have been a number of
new therapeutic agents approved, there is still a large need for more effective treatments in this patient
population. In this proposal, we will study a radioligand therapy (RLT) that targets the prostate specific
membrane antigen (PSMA), a molecule that is expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells. In multiple
small studies, PSMA RLT has shown to have remarkable efficacy in heavily pretreated patients, with over 40%
of patients having decreased PSA of over 50%. PSMA RLT relies on two basic premises: targeting the
radiation to PSMA and the radiosensitivity of the tissue to the deposited radiation. First, we will understand
how PSMA expression is regulated, allowing us to pharmacologically target cancer cells to increase their
PSMA expression. Second, we will understand whether tumors respond because of intrinsic sensitivity to
radiation or high doses of deposited radiation. This knowledge will be critical to determine if patients need
higher expression of PSMA or increased tumor cell sensitivity in order to improve the response to this therapy.
We will test treatments capable of increasing the sensitivity of tumors to radiation as well as potential therapies
that can increase expression of PSMA. This work will be used to inform the development of a clinical trial that
will involve PSMA RLT and a co-administered therapy to increase its already promising efficacy."
10810683,"In 2010 we treated our first patient with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) with intravenous (IV) allogeneic NK cells.
Since then, we have worked to improve the persistence and function of NK cells in this disease. Based on our
pre-clinical findings, we designed and completed a clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of ex vivo expanded
(IL-15 + GSK3b inhibitor) adaptive NK cells administered intraperitoneally (IP) to treat OC. These allogeneic NK
cells persisted and had enhanced in vivo function for up to 21 days with promising clinical responses. These
initial results support improved NK cell persistence with IP versus IV delivery and NK cell-mediated antitumor
effects in advanced OC. The overarching hypothesis for Project 3 is that IP delivery of NK cells will be optimal
for clinical testing of NK cells gene modified to target OC through their Fc receptors. We will test an off-the-shelf
NK cell product that resists CD16 cleavage (hnCD16) in combination with IL-2 and an Fc-optimized mAb against
B7-H3, a target highly expressed on OC. We predict this NK product will overcome suppressive mechanisms
and mediate potent anti-tumor activity and that targeting these cells with specific killer immune engagers
containing IL-15 will enhance their specificity to kill OC. These studies are supported by strong pre-clinical data
showing high NK cell frequencies with markedly diminished CD16 expression in ascites from OC patients. The
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK (iNK) cell product (FT516) proposed for use in this project has
non-cleavable CD16 to sustain antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) when combined with an Fc
optimized anti-B7-H3 antibody. To further enhance the antitumor efficacy of FT516 NK cells, we will test our own
IL-15-containing Trispecific Killer Engagers: 1) a 1615B7H3 TriKE comprised of three functional domains: a) an
NK cell-engaging single domain Ab fragment against CD16, b) an OC-engaging Ab fragment against B7-H3, and
c) an IL-15 linker between them; 2) a 1615CD133 TriKE to target OC stem cells; and 3) a 1615CD133B7H3
TriKE for dual targeting of OC cells. Lastly, supported by strong pre-clinical data, we developed a CD64/CD16
chimeric receptor, as CD64 is the only high-affinity receptor that can stably bind monomeric IgG with >30-fold
higher affinity than CD16. This novel receptor has been genetically edited into iPSC-derived NK cells and will be
tested in vitro and in xenogeneic mouse models of OC. We have developed Specific Aims to 1) clinically test
whether IP delivery of FT516 iNK cells combined with enoblituzumab (anti B7-H3 antibody) will enhance efficacy
through ADCC in advanced OC; 2) pre-clinically test whether single- or dual-targeted TriKEs will enhance the
antitumor efficacy of FT516 NK cells; and 3) pre-clinically test whether multi-antibody targeting by iNK cells
expressing the chimeric CD64/16A receptor will enhance function. The themes developed in Project 3 will inform
the Program on whether delivery of an off-the-shelf NK cell product directly into the peritoneal cavity, an
environment that may evade immune attack, can enhance tumor control. Results from these studies will inform
Projects 1 and 2 on the mechanisms of rejection versus the intrinsic capacity of NK cells to persist in vivo."
10810687,"The Administration and Clinical Research Support Core will provide essential support for all administrative
activities and clinical trials associated with the program project grant. The extensive early phase clinical trial
activities in Projects 1-3 within this renewal application has required expanded activities undertaken by the Core.
The administrative components of the Core will provide support for accounting, budgeting, fiscal reporting, and
communication, while the clinical research support components will facilitate protocol activation and execution,
effective dissemination of information between Projects and Core B (biostatistics) and Core C (Immune
Monitoring & Tissue Analysis). Clinical research support activities will include preparation and distribution of
protocol revisions, research sample calendar monitoring, collection, tracking, and distribution to research
laboratory sites, as well as monitoring supply procurement and distribution for centrally purchased materials
needed for clinical trials. Core A personnel will also assure appropriate preparation and timely submission of
protocols for review as needed by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board (IRB), Cancer Center
Protocol Review Committee, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Marrow Donor Program
(NMDP) IRB. Core personnel will provide all necessary information for the other clinical site investigators to be
prepared for submission to their own Institutional Review Board and other internal and external regulatory bodies.
In the upcoming funding period, Core A will also assume more direct involvement in insuring quality performance
of required protocol activities for the proposed trials in Projects 1-3. Core responsibilities will include protocol
monitoring and communication among project and core personnel through in-person meetings, regularly
scheduled conference calls, and additional telephone communication. Additionally, the Core will support
scheduling and coordination of internal research meetings and external consultant visits. Finally, Core A will
carry on the established accomplishments of the current funding in NK cell immunogenetics. Core personnel will
coordinate KIR/HLA typing of NK cell products through the NMDP and curation of new KIR alleles and large
transplant cohort analyses by Project investigators including the screening of third party CMV+ donors for
adaptive NK cell studies. This broadly collaborative resource in immunogenetic analysis of HCT outcomes will
be used to assess the impact of KIR/HLA interactions on NK cell biology, clinical outcomes, and design off-the-
shelf NK cell products. This Core will be led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller who will work directly with his Executive
Committee and External Advisory Board to coordinate their involvement within this Program. The Specific Aims
of the Core are to provide administrative support, scientific oversight, clinical oversight/services, coordination of
HLA/KIR typing and analysis, and leadership and resources to promote PPG interactions and collaborations."
10612381,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated
microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as
many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore,
systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection
and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic
therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The
overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced
detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced
toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for
detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a
promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT
compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted,
porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the
anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this
nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can
confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can
eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection
compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function
in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment
light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast
quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2,
the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light.
In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while
reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in
improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to
reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial
ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as
oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers."

2020. More than 70% of all cancer mortality now occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Histology, critical to the diagnosis and disease management for many cancers notably including breast cancer,
is currently performed using techniques that are more than 100 years old. Market forces, technological
advances in optics, and innovation in care strategies are opening the door for disruptive innovation that could
massively reduce costs and time and improve accessibility while provide equivalent or even superior results.
We propose to contribute to the field's evolution by combining two already functioning and complementary
technologies: 1) a tissue millifluidics approach (developed in PI Seibel's lab) for hands-off core needle biopsy
handling; and 2) a rapid, low-cost, direct-to-digital slide-free imaging solution (developed in PI Levenson's lab).
The goal is to implement a context-appropriate, automated instrument that can capture diagnostic-quality
histopathology images from core-needle biopsies vital to high-quality breast-cancer diagnosis and staging, at
time of procedure. Additional project goals include implementation of innovative rapid immunofluorescence
methods for near-real-time therapy guidance; and development of AI tools for patient triage or even local
diagnostic support, the latter under the direction of Dr. Mahmood (BWH), a leader in multiclass AI algorithms.
Key to success of this project is local implementation and clinical evaluation in Kumasi, Ghana, under the
direction of Dr. Addai, consultant breast surgeon and CEO of Peace and Love Hospitals (established in 2002).
Her group will critically assess performance, usability, and compatibility with the service environment in both a
central hospital and a remote satellite clinic; clinical validation studies will eventually encompass at least
several hundred patients recruited under IRB-approved protocols. Additional guidance will be provided by Dr.
Dan Milner, CMO of the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), who has extensive experience in
global-health-focused initiatives, as well as by our collaborating pathologists who are familiar with issues
relevant to LMIC settings. Feedback will inform the design of the second-generation automated instruments to
be delivered near the end of this project."

Genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in glioma development. An individual with two or more first- and/or
second-degree affected relatives has a two-fold increased risk of the disease. We were the first to suggest
mutations in POT1 (Protection of Telomeres 1) as causative in familial glioma (FG). We have now established
the presence of POT1 mutations in 5 different families, providing the strongest evidence of its role in glioma.
However, we do not yet have direct functional evidence that loss of POT1 is causal in glioma leaving few
options for carrier surveillance or potential treatment targets. We are currently able to explain the genetic basis
of glioma in up to 12% of our families, using highly stringent criteria for calling a mutation deleterious and
causal. In contrast, the majority of our families remain unexplained though several candidate genes have
emerged as `suspects of interest (SOIs)'.
We propose a data-driven, knowledge-based, computational approach to guide candidate gene selection for
functional characterization. In order to further our efforts to explain the genetic basis of FG we propose two
specific aims to: Identify new gene candidates that may cause FG through WGS (Aim 1). We will identify
SNVs, small indels, and structural variants in both coding and noncoding regions of the genome, intensively
annotate those variants using more than 50 data sources, and we will rank these variants using multiple criteria
based on their likelihood to cause disease. In addition to the 270 FG cases (from 203 FG families) with
sequence data already available, we will also sequence an additional 100 cases (from 100 families) already
collected in our Glioma International Case-Control Study with a reported family history using Gliogene criteria,
and 200 newly recruited cases (from 100 families) with a strong family history of glioma to enhance our
discovery. ). We will molecularly characterize tumor samples when available to enable analysis of our cohort
by tumor subtype. The second aim is to functionally validate SOIs to include: A) POT1 mutations identified in
additional families and B) newly discovered FG susceptibility genes (SOIs) from Aim 1 using our novel
experimental mouse stem cell spheres and mouse models of gliomagenesis.To determine the functional
contributions of POT1 and novel mutations identified in our WGS studies, we will evaluate these genes in
glioma mouse models using CRISPR gene editing technology.
This study has the strong potential for delineating the genetic basis of glioma for genetic testing of high-risk
families; success will offer insight on the underlying biology of glioma for future work on early detection and
targeted treatment."

Proteomics Core that has extended our strategies and analytic skills in proteomics. Our collaborative studies
have resulted in considerable progress and productivity. In this revision, a major change that we have made is
an increase in the number of projects from 2 to 4 in order to allow for more fully developed aims and
approaches to answer the following unanswered questions: 1) What are the unique features of the kinases
employed by TCR that have been optimized for regulating critical downstream tyrosine phosphorylation and for
unique characteristics involved in ligand discrimination? 2) What are the properties of the circuitry that allow
for discrimination of self-pMHC from agonist-pMHC recognition to establish a stable homeostatic state versus a
robust cellular response? 3) How is the adaptor LAT condensation regulated and serve to coordinate and
amplify the diverse signaling events associated with a robust cellular response? 4) How does the TCR
signaling network regulate Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) with downstream, canonical and
non-canonical effector kinase signals in a properly regulated and faithful manner to incoming TCR signals? To
answer these questions, a new Project is now incorporated into this proposal to address each of these issues.
Our overall goal then is to capitalize on our current progress and leverage our distinct knowledge and skills

11002061,"Project Summary
The activity of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, and bulk DA release in the ventromedial striatum (VMS),
encodes reward prediction errors (RPE). However, there is also evidence that DA activity reflects value-
orthogonal aspects of learning, including value-less sensory prediction errors (SPE). Reconciling these two
bodies of data would greatly advance our understanding of DA transmission in normal and pathological
conditions.
One proposition is that DA release might signal a multi-factorial prediction-error. This would explain recent
findings demonstrating that DA neuron ensembles encode the sensory properties of outcomes that violate
learned predictions. This requires that this information, observable at the level of neuronal firing, be transmitted
to downstream regions via DA release. This proposal will test the hypothesis that DA neurons encode a multi-
dimensional error signal by examining specific spatiotemporal patterns of DA release in downstream regions.
The current proposal takes advantage of a new methodological approach that I developed during my postdoc to
image DA release in freely moving rats across a wide area at cellular resolution, as well as new technologies for
gene editing and neuronal manipulation. Rats will perform an odor-guided choice task that induces both RPEs
and SPEs, while DA release in the VMS will be recorded using dLight1.2 combined with GRIN lens implants and
the UCLA miniscope. These recordings will be analyzed with machine learning algorithms to determine whether
the specific spatiotemporal pattern of DA release encodes both value-based and value-orthogonal information
(Aim 1). It will also be examined if these signals may be degraded in a pathological condition, by performing
recordings in rats with chronic cocaine use experience (Aim 2). For the independent phase of the proposal, I will
first examine the role of upstream cortical circuits in the encoding of this information by using chemogenetics to
silence the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Aim 3). I will then focus on how a specific biophysical property of DA
neurons may shape this information encoding, by using gene editing techniques to delete a key K+ modulator in
DA neurons while imaging DA signals in the proposed task (Aim 4).
During the mentored phase of the current proposal, I will receive training critical for my short- and long-term
success, including analysis of high-dimensional neural data, genetic editing using CRISPR-Cas9, and rodent
self-administration models of drug use. The proposed training program combines hands-on training with expert
experimenters, independent study, formal coursework, establishment of an independent collaboration, and
professional scientific meetings. This program will equip me to lead a laboratory focused on the interaction of
behavioral, computational, and molecular approaches to study the function of neural circuits."

10677566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Imaging is an essential tool to guide stroke patient management. Recent DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials have
provided the definitive evidence that imaging is critical to guide late endovascular therapy (EVT), underscoring
the need to transition from onset time-based to tissue-based treatment. However, it has been estimated that
the majority of stroke patients (~70%) presenting 6-24 hrs with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) over 6 are not
DAWN and/or DEFUSE-3 eligible (Desai et al. J Neurointerv Surg. 2018; 10:1033-37). The 2018 American
Heart Association Stroke Early Management Guidelines pointed out that it is “… reasonable to incorporate
collateral flow status into clinical decision making in some candidates to determine eligibility for mechanical
thrombectomy.” Tissue metabolic MRI is a surrogate biomarker of the collateral flow status that is promising to
address this clinical need. We will develop fast pH and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and evaluate their value
for guiding reperfusion therapy in experimental stroke models.
During the previous funding cycle, we made steady progress in developing new stroke MRI techniques. We
developed pH-specific imaging based on magnetization transfer and relaxation-normalized amide proton
transfer (MR-APT) MRI (Guo et al. Neuroimage 2016;242-9). Using filament middle cerebral artery occlusion
rats, we refined the perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging (PWI/DWI) lesion mismatch for the metabolic
penumbra and benign oligemia (Wang et al. Neuroimage 2019;610-7). Our acute stroke patient study showed
that the volumes of acute DKI lesions have a higher correlation coefficient than those on the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) maps with 1-month follow-up T2 images (Yin et al. Radiology 2018:651-7). This echoes the
recent study from NINDS investigators who reported: “ADC evolution in patients with early, complete
revascularization, now more commonly seen with EVT, is strikingly different from our historical understanding.”
(Hsia et al., Stroke. 2019;50:2086-92) We hypothesize that new fast MRI techniques refined tissue-clock helps
delineate ischemic tissue, predict tissue outcomes in permanent stroke, and guide reperfusion treatment. It is
urgent to test the refined tissue-clock, in the presence of common stroke comorbidities and in the experimental
setting, before initiating future prospective clinical trials. Briefly, we will develop robust fast pH and DKI stroke
imaging (Aim 1), establish the spatiotemporal evolution of the refined MRI in MCAO rats (Aim 2), and test
tissue-clock-guided reperfusion in rats of common stroke comorbidities of age and diabetes (Aim 3). The
success of the project will lay the groundwork for future clinical trials to test advanced imaging-guided stroke
treatment in the clinic."
10872991,"Poor dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors escalate risk for obesity, cancer, and other chronic diseases,
and contribute to disparities. Mid-life is a vulnerable life stage when obesity rates peak and chronic diseases
emerge. Neighborhood environments provide opportunities, barriers, and cues/triggers to engage in healthy or
unhealthy behaviors. Overall, however, research findings on environment-behavior associations are
inconsistent and effect sizes are small. This research is limited by sole focus on residential neighborhoods,
failure to consider the environment’s role in within-person daily and momentary differences in behaviors, and
scarce attention to identifying for whom the environment matters and under what conditions. A new approach
is needed that considers the broader environment where people spend time (activity space). Our objective in
the proposed study is to address misspecification of environmental exposures ubiquitous in prior research and
provide a definitive test of activity-space environment explanations for between-and within-person diet and PA
variations during mid-life. The central hypotheses are that activity-space environmental exposures contribute to
both between- and within-person variations in dietary and PA behaviors and more strongly influence these
behaviors than residential-neighborhood environments alone. Drawing on Temporal Self-Regulation Theory,
we also hypothesize activity-space environmental exposures are more consequential for diet and PA when
self-regulatory capacity—trait or state factors that affect a person’s ability to make efforts to regulate
behavior—is diminished. An in-depth, rigorous study of 510 Latinx, African American, and White adults ages
40-64 is proposed. We will use a rich combination of cutting-edge geographically-explicit ecological momentary
assessment (GEMA) methodologies: global positioning system (GPS) location tracking; smartphone-based
mini-surveys of diet, PA, and state factors; and accelerometry, as well as three 24-hour dietary recalls,
anthropometric measurements, and questionnaires of trait and other factors. Sophisticated routine, daily, and
momentary activity-space measures will be derived based on the spatial extent of their movement, but also
duration of exposure. Multiple features of the residential and activity-space environments will be measured
using GIS including absolute and relative availability of healthful and unhealthful foods, walkability, recreational
resource availability (e.g., parks, fitness facilities, greenness), and crime. For the first time, this innovative
research will employ a dynamic environmental exposure approach using GEMA to supply evidence on the
environment’s role in between- and within-person variations in diet and PA during mid-life, a pivotal time, in a
racially/ethnically diverse sample. As such it will contribute to a much-needed shift in how environmental
determinants of behaviors are studied, making a lasting impact on the field. Our research is significant because
the results can inform new targets for lifestyle and place-based interventions to improve health during mid-life
and set the stage for better later-life health."
10922018,"Development of oral KCC2 potentiator AXN-027 as a novel anti-epileptic drug for mesial
temporal lobe epilepsy
Abstract:
Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) have spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) that are often
refractory to commonly used antiepileptic drug (AEDs). New targets and therapies are thus urgently required to
address this drug resistance in ~40% of patients. Loss of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in neuronal circuits is
a pathological hallmark of epilepsy. KCC2 is a CNS-specific potassium/chloride cotransporter that maintains low
intracellular chloride in neurons, and is critical for enabling GABAergic inhibition. However, KCC2 hypofunction
occurs in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy, while KCC2-deficient mice have increased seizure
susceptibility and mTLE pathologies. The resulting abnormally high chloride in neurons is thought to lead to
pathological excitatory responses to GABA, and limit efficacy of GABA-acting AEDs. Increasing KCC2 function
via genetic, viral and pharmacological approaches protects against epileptic seizures in vivo and in vitro.
Therefore, a KCC2-potentiating treatment could restore E/I balance, rescue pharmacoresistance, and treat SRS
in mTLE patients. But there are no FDA-approved drugs that selectively potentiate KCC2.
 AXONIS’ are developing proprietary compounds that selectively potentiate KCC2 function by binding to
KCC2, increasing KCC2 surface clustering, and increasing KCC2 chloride extrusion. AXONIS’ lead KCC2
potentiator, AXN-027, is a highly optimized orally-bioavailable compound selected from extensive structure-
activity relationship work driven by potency and CNS-favorable ADME/PK properties. In this Phase 1 SBIR, we
will use a well-characterized intrahippocampal kainate-induced mouse model of mTLE with chronic SRS and
electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate anti-seizure efficacy of AXN-027, which will enable development of
a first-in-class KCC2-potentiating AED to treat mTLE patients."

The goal of this application is to develop a research training program in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) that
inspires a new generation of underrepresented minority (URM) students to pursue research careers targeting
cardiovascular health. We propose an eight-week intensive summer research institute delivered in partnership
between the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (UMMSM), Virgin Islands Department of Health
(VIDOH), and University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), a historically Black College and University. A HRSA-
designated Health Professional Shortage Area, USVI is a culturally-distinct Black region that disproportionately
suffers from CVD, with 80% of USVI residents reporting at least one major CVD risk factor. VIDOH, the
region's leading healthcare system, faces numerous challenges including an inadequate health system
infrastructure and diminishing healthcare workforce. Over 30% of federally funded VIDOH positions are vacant
and 42% of funded public health positions are unfilled. Lack of data, limited research capacity, and flight of
skilled human capital further exacerbate these challenges. In response, we propose the Cardiovascular
Research Empowerment Workforce (CREW) program aimed at increasing knowledge, skills, and motivation of
URM scholars to pursue research careers. UMMSM is a national leader in URM training with an extensive
research infrastructure and training expertise targeting learners at all academic levels. Aligned with the USVI’s
healthcare context, CREW will leverage UMMSM’s rich, interdisciplinary research environment to prepare a
cohort of emerging URM researchers to address CVD and related disparities in the USVI. The aims of the
program are to: 1) facilitate immersive research experiences for USVI college students addressing CVD
and related disparities; 2) implement an engaging curriculum that supports meaningful research
experiences and nurtures trainee potential to envision a CVD-focused research career; and 3) establish
a support network among trainees and CREW mentors for ongoing mentorship, research collaboration,
and grad school preparation. Adapted from UMMSM’s existing URM pipeline programs, CREW curricula will
draw from UM research centers, including the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Translational Sleep
Center, Office of Diversity, and Florida Stroke Center. During the eight-week experience, CREW scholars will
receive hands-on exposure to CVD-related research, professional development, and continuous research
training through immersion in a specific USVI-based research project. In the five-year funding period, 50 URM
scholars from USVI will receive mentorship and learn strategies to create culturally-tailored cardiovascular
interventions from evidence-based models in clinical and basic sciences. By doing so, the program will further
develop USVI’s undergraduate research training infrastructure and promote locally designed research
addressing CVD disparities, serving as a catalyst to increase the representation of USVI scientists in the
healthcare workforce."

10680433,"Background. Depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder that carries a heavy disease burden and
is the 2nd leading risk factor for suicide among Veterans. VA has disseminated three effective psychotherapies
for depression to VA clinics but therapist use of these treatments is <12%. Surprisingly, no studies have
examined the provision of evidence-based psychotherapies for depression (D-EBPs) in VA and reasons
underlying infrequent delivery, leaving a critical gap in depression care delivery in VA. System factors are a
known driver of EBP use, and early signs from OMHSP's efforts and unique factors related to how depression
care is organized in VA warrant an empirical investigation. Significance. Low utilization of D-EBPs and the
lack of empirical evidence on barriers is a significant problem for several reasons. First, suicide prevention is a
top priority in VA and across the nation and untreated depression is a major risk factor for suicide. Second,
effectiveness of existing interventions that target provider-level barriers cannot be maximized without data
about system barriers. Increasing the reach of other EBPs (e.g., PTSD) has required intervention at all levels
(patient, provider, and system) and the same is undoubtably true for D-EBPs. Identifying and targeting system
factors and exploring therapist factors and conducting the first exploration of patient perceptions of D-EBPs will
bolster these early provider-focused interventions. Furthermore, this proposal is timely in that it comes on the
heels of OMHSP's shift from assessing anticipated barriers to D-EBP delivery during trainings to developing
partnerships to understand barriers experienced in the field. Finally, since this proposal is examining D-EBP
delivery in specialty mental health clinics where other mental health conditions are treated, findings have
implications of EBPs for those other conditions. Innovation/Impact. The proposed 3.5-year study will be the
first study to examine reasons for low utilization of depression EBPs by therapists in VA. Our mixed-methods
approach will yield a robust understanding of how the policies, resources and culture within specialty mental
health clinics contribute to low D-EBP use by therapists. Our aims are directly aligned with OMHSP's goal to
increase the implementation of clinical practice guideline-concordant care in VA mental health clinics. Our
proposed classification of all VA medical centers on system-level factors that are associated with D-EBP
delivery, strategic qualitative analysis, intervention mapping and stakeholder engagement provides invaluable
data to OMHSP and the field quickly. Aims. 1) Quantitatively examine the association between health system
factors and D-EBP delivery; 2) Qualitatively examine how contextual and system factors impact therapist
decisions around the provision of D-EBPs; 3) Develop a framework of intervention targets and potential
solutions to reduce barriers to D-EBP use; 4) Secondary/Exploratory Aims: a) Qualitatively explore how
therapist factors impact D-EBP use; b) Explore patients' perceptions of D-EBPs. Methodology. Using an
explanatory sequential mixed-method design, in Aim 1 (quantitative) we will abstract system-level and EBP
training data for FY21 Q3-FY22 Q2. Descriptive statistics of system-level factors and general linear mixed
model analysis will be used to characterize facilities and examine associations between system factors and
therapists' D-EBP use. This will enable us to quickly understand both the main correlates of D-EBP utilization
and variability of these factors across sites, provide critical data to our OMHSP partners and inform selection of
sites for Aim 2. Aim 2 and secondary aims (qualitative) will include interviews with therapists trained in the
three D-EBPs and mental health leaders from 10 VA medical centers (5 high and 5 low performers; N = 120-
150) and 20 patients to understand their perceptions of D-EBPs. Aim 3 will involve intervention mapping and
Delphi strategies to develop a framework for reducing system barriers to D-EBP delivery. Implementation.
Findings from our intervention framework development and strong partnership with OMHSP will maximize the
translation of study findings into practice."
10630189,"Abstract
Pancreatic inflammation is the major cause of gastrointestinal-related clinical morbidity and mortality, and
effective therapeutic strategies against pancreatic inflammatory diseases remain an unmet medical need.
Inflammation is a common feature in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and associated acinar-to-ductal metaplasia
(ADM), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Given the prominent role of inflammation in the spectrum of pancreatic pathologies, understanding pancreas-
specific inflammatory mechanisms is critical for the prevention and treatment of the associated diseases.
Inflammation is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among known causal factors, ROS act as both
a signaling molecule and a mediator of inflammation. Wild-type KRAS is subject to ROS modification on cysteine
of the redox-sensitive NKC118D motif leading to a transient hyperactivation. KRAS mutants are observed in ~30%
of patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting the critical role of KRAS mutations in pancreatic inflammation.
In the past thirty years, mutant KRAS has been viewed as being locked in a constitutively active state. However,
recent studies have found that mutant KRAS, at an endogenous level, is not constitutively active but can be
hyper-activated by inflammatory insults leading to sustained inflammation, irreversible ADM, and PanIN lesions.
However, the molecular mediator and mechanism linking inflammation to mutant KRAS hyperactivation and
associated pathologies remain elusive. Studies have shown that NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a major mediator
of pancreatitis-induced inflammation and major enzymes activated by mutant KRAS for the generation of ROS.
However, whether mutant KRAS is subject to the same ROS modification as wild-type KRAS leading to the
observed hyperactivity in the context of inflammation is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to identify the
molecular mediator and unravel the underlying mechanism on how inflammation promotes mutant KRAS
hyperactivation and associated pancreatic pathologies. Notably, by ablating the NOX-docking subunit p22phox
in mice expressing an endogenous level of KRASG12D/+ in pancreatic acinar cells, we demonstrate that NOX
inhibition considerably curbs KRASG12D/+ hyperactivation, suggesting that NOX is not only a downstream effector
but also a potential upstream regulator of KRASG12D. Thus, NOX and KRASG12D potentially form a co-activation
feed-forward loop necessary to induce chronic inflammation, irreversible ADM, and PanIN lesions. We
hypothesize that under inflammation, NOX generates ROS to modify the redox-sensitive motif of KRASG12D,
leading to KRASG12D hyperactivation and associated pathologies. Our hypothesis will be tested with three specific
aims in mouse models in the context of inflammatory insults. Aim 1 is to determine the role of NOX in pancreatic
inflammation. Aim 2 is to determine if NOX is necessary for KRASG12D hyperactivation, sustained inflammation,
irreversible ADM, and PanIN lesions. Aim 3 is to determine if the redox-sensitive NKC118D motif is required for
KRASG12D hyperactivation and associated pathologies. Information gained in our studies will fill the outstanding
knowledge gap on how inflammatory insults promote mutant KRAS hyperactivation and associated pathologies
and guide the design of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies against these diseases in humans."
10685952,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to triple by
2050. Currently, there is no known effective treatment for ADRD. Prevention through behavioral
changes affecting ADRD risk is therefore of utmost importance, and about 35% of ADRD risk is
thought to be attributable to potentially modifiable factors. Current changes in modern family life
and work are likely to have important effects on the risk of ADRD, as the work and family structure
multiple aspects of individuals lives and environments that are likely to be related to ADRD risks.
Yet, work and family trajectories as pathways and moderators of ADRD risk are understudied.
Our overall hypothesis is that contemporary changes in family patterns and work lives contribute
to age related changes in cognition and ADRD. A shift to “modern” family structures and work
tasks have occurred relatively early in Norway, and unique data availability allows these changes
to be studied prospectively to predict coming changes in ADRD in the US and other countries.
We will study life-course effects of and interactions between family and work in adulthood for risk
of ADRD and cognitive impairment in older adults. This will be done by exploiting the exceptional
Norwegian HUNT (Nord-Trondelag Health Study) dataset, a large ongoing prospective population
that includes cohorts born 1900 – 1960, combined with Norwegian national registry data. Using
these population-representative cohorts have exceptionally detailed health and socioeconomic
longitudinal data to address these issues. We will take advantage of specific events that create
natural experiments. Our results will help to identify “sensitive periods” over the life course and
how they mediate genetic risks of cognitive decline and ADRD."

appropriate services, research, education, and employment opportunities”. The overall objectives of the AC
are to provide an administrative infrastructure for the successful implementation of FDL-RRI research and
training projects; to facilitate productive communication among all collaborators; and to create linkages between
FDL-RRI and tribal partners, universities, and other institutions. Through the efforts of the AC, FDL-RRI will be
a regional resource for tribes, research scholars and students to assist them in conducting research in
collaborative partnership with AIAN communities. The specific aims are to:
Aim 1. Develop FDL-RRI AC leadership roles and procedures through the establishment and coordination
of an Executive Advisory Committee to guide all projects, partnerships, research, and training activities.
Aim 2. Guide systems for operational management, coordination of activities, and communication. This
will include strategic planning; budgetary and grant management; guiding purchasing decisions; hiring, training
and supervising staff; and overseeing event/travel coordination.
Aim 3. Oversee human subjects research protection and promote tribal data governance and
sovereignty. We will work with tribal and university IRBs to ensure all human subjects research are in full
compliance with tribal data governance structures, protect data sovereignty, and that culturally appropriate
safeguards are established and utilized for ongoing data safety and data monitoring.
Aim 4. Support advisory committees and community involvement in FDL-RRI program development and
oversight to ensure scientific and cultural integrity of the projects.
Aim 5. Foster synergy and development of new opportunities across all projects and promotion of FDL-
RRI regionally. This will include facilitating communication with the public; creating a website; consulting with
tribal communities regarding health disparities information; research and development of new tribally-initiated
research protocols; creating and supporting new student research opportunities; and fostering knowledge
sharing opportunities.
Aim 6. Conduct formative and summative evaluation with annual member surveys, interviews, retreats, and
documentation of key priorities."
10570869,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has impacted over 60% of all OEF/OIF Veterans over the past
decade, and over 20% of these Veterans carry a diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome. Arguably the most
disabling postconcussion symptoms are sleep-wake and cognitive disturbances. Sleep, cognitive function, and
related symptoms often remain impaired >10-15 years following mTBI. Not only are these symptoms
themselves exceedingly difficult to live with, but poor sleep and cognition also interfere with ongoing
rehabilitation interventions, and prevent reintegration into civilian life and return to gainful employment. Most
existing therapies for sleep-wake and cognitive dysfunction following mTBI are merely symptomatic, and they
also suffer from low efficacy and/or patient acceptability. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify mechanism-
based interventions for sleep and cognitive problems following mTBI, in order to facilitate optimal rehabilitation
and functional outcomes.
 Our long-term goal is to implement a brain-bioactive pharmacological intervention to address sleep and
cognitive disturbance in individuals with mTBI. The overall objective of this application, which represents our
first step towards this goal, is to test the feasibility and limited efficacy of a highly promising therapy consisting
of a dietary supplement, branched chain amino acids (BCAA; i.e., leucine, isoleucine, and valine), to treat
sleep disturbances in individuals with mTBI. There is compelling scientific precedent and safety data to support
the testing of BCAA therapy in Veterans with mTBI. Our preclinical data has shown that the mechanism of
action for BCAA, acting as a precursor to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, restores the balance of
excitation to inhibition within the dysfunctional brain circuits for both sleep and cognition in mTBI.23-26 With
these data, we have also meticulously mapped the optimal dosing, duration, and route of administration in
mice.27 Further, we now have pilot data from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study showing that 3 weeks
of dietary BCAA supplementation, but not placebo, significantly improved self-reported sleep in Veterans.
Other research groups have used dietary BCAA supplementation in humans across multiple conditions at
doses up to 60 grams/day and durations up to 12 months with few to no side effects.32-49
 Our central hypothesis is that BCAA dietary supplementation will improve sleep quality in Veterans with
mTBI. As a first step towards testing this hypothesis, we propose a long-term feasibility, acceptability, and
limited efficacy study of BCAA's effects on sleep that will be randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-
blinded. Veterans with mTBI will be randomly assigned to receive BCAA at 20, 40 or 60 grams/day per oral
(PO) or a placebo (n=50 per group) for 12 weeks. Feasibility, acceptability, and limited efficacy outcomes
based on sleep (e.g., self-report, continuous actigraphy, and overnight polysomnography) will be assessed.
 We expect that these results will inform the optimal study methodology and design for a future, full-
scale randomized controlled trial, including the identification of the proper dose and duration of BCAA to
improve sleep and the potential subpopulations of Veterans with mTBI that may be differentially affected by
BCAA. We also intend to use this work to generate hypotheses on the effect of BCAA on cognition and overall
quality of life measures to inform future research."
10808884,"Overall Component Abstract
Community colleges (CCs) are primary engines for economic advancement for persons from lower socio-
economic backgrounds, but the promise of higher education is often thwarted by untreated mental health
problems, especially among racial/ethnic minority students. Alarmingly high rates of depression and anxiety on
community college campuses collide with daunting life challenges (such as early adversity, housing and food
insecurity) and inadequate mental health resources. Untreated depression and anxiety can have dire
consequences, extending from poor academic performance to suicide. To address the enormous mental health
gap in a low income, highly diverse sample of CC students at East Los Angeles College (ELAC), we propose to
evaluate a scalable, efficient, and evidence-based system of care called STAND for screening, tracking and
treating anxiety and depression. STAND uses a stratified stepped care model, ranging from self-guided online
cognitive behavioral prevention, to online cognitive behavioral therapy with coaching, to clinician-delivered care.
Continuous tracking enables treatment adaptation as needs evolve plus rapid detection and management of
suicidality. The STAND system was implemented on the UCLA campus from late 2017- early 2020. Since Fall
2019, we have been collaborating with ELAC administrators and students to adapt STAND for their needs, and
have an ongoing pilot project funded through the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health (2020-2022).
This pilot lays the groundwork for ALACRITY in which we will optimize STAND at ELAC (n=1000) with continuing
support from DMH and we will explore sustainability and spread to other CCs. The ALACRITY center focuses
upon (1) optimizing effectiveness through multivariate predictive models, including social determinants of mental
health, for improving stepped care triaging, adaptation, and risk detection, which will simultaneously advance
the science of personalized mental health, (2) optimizing implementation through exploratory projects, pilot trials
and Methods Scientific Area hubs that primarily target uptake and engagement as well as integration and cultural
competency to meet the needs of this underserved, diverse student population, and (3) exploring sustainability
via centralized state-wide data-streams, cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment projections for STAND
implementation, investigation of generalizability, and exploration of barriers and facilitators of implementation
across geographically diverse CCCs, that inform discussions with policy makers and stakeholders. The overall
approach is guided by the Accelerated Creation to Sustainment implementation framework which allows for
continuous evaluation and redesign over each annual cohort. The Administrative Core will oversee operations
of the Center, pilot study program, training of junior investigators, and sustainability planning. The Methods Core
will support research projects, implementation efforts, and innovative and synergistic collaborations that focus
on increasing engagement of stakeholders. Our long-term goal is to optimize STAND through personalization
tools and facilitate expansion of STAND’s reach across CCs statewide and ultimately nationwide."
10668240,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background. Veterans are at increased risk of adverse outcomes after hospital discharge, including
rehospitalization, nursing home admission, and mortality. Post-acute skilled home health care (HHC) can
provide critical support for Veterans following a hospitalization. The services provided through HHC, including
nursing and therapies, can help Veterans meet their goals to improve function, well-being, and return to
independent living in their homes. For Medicare-eligible Veterans, skilled HHC is provided through 1) VA
purchased skilled HHC from a contracted HHC agency or 2) Medicare-funded HHC (i.e., Part A benefit,
Medicare Advantage). Preliminary work suggests that the majority (66%) of Veterans discharged home from
VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) with skilled HHC receive VA-contracted skilled HHC and the remainder receive
Medicare-funded HHC. However, funding for skilled HHC varies substantially across VAMCs, with implications
both for HHC service delivery and Veterans’ outcomes. In preliminary work, we found that 30-day readmissions
are higher among Veterans who receive VA-financed HHC compared to Medicare-financed HHC, which could
be related to HHC agency quality.
Significance/Impact. A better understanding of HHC referrals and financing, which has always been
purchased and delivered by community HHC agencies, could provide key insights for the VA given the growth
in community care for Veterans. Because community home health agencies have always provided post-acute
HHC, this context provides an ideal opportunity to examine interorganizational partnerships and Veterans’
outcomes. The proposed research will characterize post-acute HHC use, financing, and quality of care, and
how these factors are associated with outcomes for Veterans discharged from VAMCs, as well as providers’
and Veterans’ experiences of delivering and receiving post-acute HHC. Findings will inform the development of
a toolkit for VA and HHC leaders with resources to guide high-value HHC agency selection and collaboration.
The contribution of this research is significant because the results will directly inform how operational partners
choose HHC agencies to include in provider networks and develop policy for skilled HHC referrals, and will
also provide practical tools for multiple stakeholders to provide optimal HHC for Veterans.
Innovation. This is the first comprehensive study to examine VA contracting, referral practices, and financing -
including both VA and Medicare - to understand their influence on Veterans’ outcomes. A stakeholder-
engaged, complex mixed-methods study design is used to understand the mechanisms and processes that
shape the use and outcomes of post-acute HHC from multiple perspectives.
Specific Aims. 1) Identify determinants of VA vs Medicare-financed post-acute skilled HHC among community
dwelling Medicare-enrolled Veterans; 2) Understand multiple stakeholders’ perspectives on older Veterans’
use of post-acute skilled HHC and factors that influence the delivery of HHC; 3) Determine the impact of home
health agency quality and HHC payer source on differences in outcomes for older Veterans receiving post-
acute HHC.
Methodology. This proposal uses a complex mixed-methods study design with advanced statistical
techniques and comprehensive VA and Medicare administrative data, as well as a robust qualitative approach
to interview stakeholders from VAMCs, HHC agencies, Veterans, and caregivers to accomplish our aims.
Implementation/Next Steps. The culmination of findings from this work will be incorporated into a toolkit to
promote high-value HHC selection and collaboration. In addition, this work will form the foundation for a large-
scale study to develop and test implementation and effectiveness of a shared decision-making model for
Veterans and VAMC personnel to promote high-value HHC."
10862536,"ABSTRACT: Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is a growing public health concern for American
Indian and Alaska Native (AI/ANs) people, but AI/ANs are profoundly underrepresented in ADRD research. For
example, the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center database, an important resource for influential ADRD
studies, includes just 162 AI/ANs out of 31,000 adults (0.5%). This is a troubling exclusion, since AI/ANs have high
burdens of many ADRD risk factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, vascular brain
injury (VBI), and stroke. The Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians (CDCAI) study,
conducted by our research group, is the only prospective cohort study with longitudinal data for rigorous evaluation
of cognitive function, ADRD, and VBI in any US Native population. In its first wave of exams, CDCAI collected data
on 818 elderly AI/ANs living on reservations in 3 primarily rural, geographic regions; the second wave of exams is
underway. CDCAI is yielding seminal findings on ADRD risk factors and biomarkers in AI/ANs; 33% of the sample
showed evidence of VBI, with men even higher. Yet the cohort is not representative of the national AI/AN population
because 72% of AI/ANs now reside in urban areas. Urban A/ANs represent an “invisible tribe” that is largely absent
from health research. One likely explanation is that urban environments feature distinctive risk and protective
profiles, including lifestyle factors that exacerbate age-related cognitive decline, and protective factors such as
better access to acute and specialty care and higher levels of education. Accordingly, we propose a novel study,
URBan Native Elders (URBANE), to replicate CDCAI in a large cohort of urban AI/ANs with broad geographic
representation. We will recruit 1,200 men and women ages 55 and older in 5 geographically diverse metropolitan
areas with large AI/AN populations. Data collection will include MRI for all participants, and genetic testing for
alleles associated with ADRD in the all-races population. We will expand CDCAI protocols to reflect state-of-the-
art imaging and neuropsychological assessments. We will use protocols established by the CDCAI to estimate
probable ADRD based on a single exam. The resulting analyses will establish the baseline prevalence of cognitive
impairment, probable ADRD, and VBI and their associations with clinical, genetic, neuroimaging, behavioral, and
lifestyle risk and protective factors. Of importance, this cross-sectional study will lay the foundation for future
longitudinal research on ADRD. Our Specific Aims are to: Quantify the extent of probable ADRD and VBI as
defined by brain MRI, and determine their associations with cognitive functioning in a diverse sample of urban
AI/AN elders. 2) Evaluate associations between conventional risk factors and probable ADRD, and evaluate
potential mediation of selected risk factors by VBI. 3) In an exploratory analysis, evaluate potential differences in
our primary associations by sex; and evaluate education and access to healthcare as potential protective factors
for cognitive impairment and probable ADRD in elders with VBI."

10752606,"Many Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latinx patients are much more likely to receive low quality end-of-
life medical care than White individuals– in fact, they are 3 times more likely than white Americans to die after
a lengthy intensive care unit stay. Advance care planning (ACP)– the process of discussing one’s wishes with
loved ones and clinicians, and then documenting them in an advance directive (AD)– can help reduce these
health inequities by preventing costly/burdensome treatments that are unlikely to reduce suffering or improve
quality of life. Though ~60% of Americans engage in ACP, <25% of underserved populations have done so– in
large part due to distrust of the healthcare system/clinicians, and reluctance to discuss death and dying. This
study harnesses underserved communities’ existing, trusted social networks to deploy two community-based
ACP interventions and study their mechanisms of action. By identifying which interventions increase
engagement in ACP in underserved communities (and why), this project will help improve quality of end-of-life
care, reduce unnecessary suffering, and end-of-life healthcare costs which conserves public health resources.
Over the past 5 years, our team has studied an inexpensive and readily scalable serious game called Hello
that prompts discussion of sensitive end-of-life issues. Across multiple studies, participants report that playing
Hello is enjoyable, eye-opening, and motivating —98% of participants subsequently performed at least 1 ACP
behavior. Recently, we developed a nationwide community-based delivery model for ‘Hello’ and confirmed the
game’s acceptability by engaging 53 underserved communities in ACP (n=1,165). We now propose a 3-
armed, cluster, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in diverse, underserved populations to compare the
efficacy of ‘Hello’ (Group 1) with a nationally promoted structured workbook ‘The Conversation Project Starter
Kit,’ (Group 2), and a non-ACP game called ‘Table Topics,’ (placebo/attention control; Group 3). We will
randomize 75 underserved communities across the US (20 participants/site; n=1,500). The primary outcome
is completion of a visually verified AD; secondary outcomes include performance of other ACP behaviors.
This study will provide key scientific advancements by: 1) providing efficacy data on two widely used and easily
scalable but not yet evidence-based interventions; 2) advancing the science of interventional design by
examining the interventions’ potential mechanisms of action (i.e. quality of communication, and role of socio-
cultural environment); and 3) assessing how and why our community-based delivery model engages
underserved communities in ACP. Should the RCT have negative findings, we still will have gained a robust
understanding of the sociocultural environment’s role in population health research. If successful, this project
will provide an evidence-based model for engaging underserved communities in ACP, along with a robust
understanding of how to design and deliver community-based initiatives relevant for other population health-
based research or initiatives for the underserved."
10771924,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ENDx-TB proposal
A central component of WHO’s End TB Strategy is to diagnose approximately 3 million patients annually who
are not diagnosed or treated due to inadequate tests that are not tailored towards specific needs for different
levels or capabilities of health care facilities. Better tests are needed at point-of-care, where triage in low-resource
settings is essential to prioritize those with the highest risk for tuberculosis disease to higher levels of care. On
the other hand, more complex, resource-intensive tests aimed at specific phases of host-pathogen interaction,
like at the end of treatment or during latent infection would complement community-based diagnosis in less-
developed health care systems that have access to central, specialized laboratory facilities. Wide-ranging
diagnostic capacities co-exist in different regions of the same country, for instance in rural vs urban areas and
therefore, a comprehensive battery of diagnostic tests that are appropriate for specific settings are needed.
Meeting the End TB Strategy targets will also require dramatically improved prevention of disease approaches
to block transmission. With 1.7 billion people latently infected, it is not cost-effective to provide prophylaxis to all.
Hence a test that could predict those most at risk of developing disease would enable targeted therapeutic
approaches. Similarly, tests to enable personalized or stratified treatment strategies are urgently needed. The
goal is to conduct a clinical research program across the globe to compare side-by-side the most promising new
tests for a wide range of health care settings in experienced clinical sites in Africa (South Africa, The Gambia),
Southeast Asia (Vietnam) and South America (Peru), and advanced laboratories in the USA and Europe. The
cohorts include adults, children, and people living with HIV and with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The new assays
include: 1) at point-of-care: sputum-free assys, including two triage tests, based on detection of host proteins
and host transcripts, both on fingerstick blood, and a high-sensitivity urinary lipoarabinomannan assay; 2) at
regional laboratories: a modified liquid culture method with TiKa reagent for increased sensitivity and faster
performance, and the cycle threshold value of the Xpert Ultra test as a measure of bacterial load for tuberculosis
treatment monitoring; and 3) at central laboratories: a multiplex qRT-PCR test for mRNA signatures for
progression to tuberculosis, and a host 4-protein biosignature in blood for prediction of poor treatmeht outcome.
The performance of these tests will be evaluated according to internationally established target product profiles
for the respective health care levels. The proposal makes provision for the future inclusion of additional tests in
the pipleline and the inclusion of additional cohorts for specialized diagnostic research questions. Together this
approach will identify the best tests for different health care levels and for different phases of infection and
disease. The multi-disciplinary team of test developers and clinical scientists, and the selection of cohorts are
well suited to identify novel technologies towards meeting the End TB milestones."
10844538,"ABSTRACT
 We propose a deep interrogation and a systems approach that will identify molecular signatures to
vaccination across three cohorts of vulnerable patient populations: autoimmune patients with B cell depletion,
aged and frail individuals, and patients with sickle cell disease who are functionally asplenic. These distinct
populations share a dysregulated inflammatory milieu that is linked to poor vaccination responsiveness. We have
assembled an interdisciplinary team of investigators with a track record of longstanding and productive
collaborations to use a systems approach that combines well-defined and understudied cohorts with unbiased
large-scale profiling to elucidate signatures defining vaccine responsiveness. This goal will be accomplished by:
1) examining three vulnerable patient cohorts challenged with different vaccines, including novel mRNA vaccines
and one shared vaccine; 2) using shared platforms that deeply interrogate immune responses from blood and
limited-access compartments; and 3) refining new mathematical tools for multidimensional analysis of data to
identify active pathways and modules and to determine specific connections among components in the immune
network that contribute to differential vaccine effectiveness. This effort capitalizes on recent advances in single-
cell and spatial immune profiling methods along with shared immunologic and proteomic platforms to create a
novel public resource for vulnerable populations that characterizes diverse states of the human immune system.
Integration across our cohorts will support the development of molecular signatures of vaccination responses
and identify critical pathways relevant for potential therapeutic strategies."

This project will develop a new pipeline for tracking the migration of single cells in vivo at the whole-body level.
Cell migration is a crucial biological process involved in the pathology and treatment of some of the world’s
most intractable diseases. Stem cell therapy and immunotherapy, for instance, are emerging as viable
treatments for conditions previously thought incurable, such as heart failure and diabetes. Unfortunately, cell
tracking methods remain inadequate to fully capitalize on these recent advances. Currently, cell tracking relies
on imaging the distribution of a specific population of cell through a contrast agent, which is either directly
affixed to the cells or targeted towards an engineered reporter protein. This approach precludes precise
measurement of cell circulation kinetics or migration routes. Furthermore, due to efflux and non-specific
retention, the distribution of the contrast agent does not necessarily match the underlying distribution of cells.
In view of these challenges, we consider a novel approach that has the potential to revolutionize cell tracking.
While current methods aim to track bulk populations of cells, we hypothesize that novel biological insight may
be gained by tracking cells individually, in small numbers, with unprecedented temporal and spatial accuracy.
We will pursue the development of CellGPS, a method capable of tracking the 3D position of individual cells
continuously as these cells migrate through the body of a living subject. To accomplish this goal, we rely on a
previously developed algorithm that can extract the position of a moving cell directly from the raw list-mode
output of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. PET is the most sensitive imaging modality available
for whole-body human imaging and, therefore, the ideal imaging modality for this project. Building on extensive
preliminary studies, we plan to pursue the following four specific aims: (1) develop a rapid, safe and robust
strategy for radiolabeling cells; (2) design and build a novel microfluidics pipeline to molecularly profile and
isolate single cells for in vivo tracking; (3) evaluate single-cell tracking as a readout of cell dissemination in an
experimental model of metastatic melanoma; and (4) explore translation of this technology to human imaging
scanners. This project is expected to generate a positive impact for biomedical research both in the pre-clinical
and clinical setting. For instance, single-cell tracking could be used to determine the spatiotemporal kinetics of
cell migration during the earliest phase of the metastatic cascade. The method could also help determine the
dynamic distribution of cells after transplantation for cell-based therapy, which could help predict response and
optimize treatment regimen. This project will achieve critical milestones towards routine and reproducible
tracking of single cells in vivo using PET."
10838447,"Abstract
Exposure to household air pollution from the use of traditional energy sources is a top-ten risk factor for morbidity
and mortality worldwide. Emissions from traditional energy sources in the home create unhealthy levels of
household air pollution and the issue is pervasive. Approximately 3 billion people rely on fuels like wood,
charcoal, and kerosene to support needs such as cooking, heating, and lighting. Approximately 80% of the
population in Rwanda uses such fuels, making exposure to household air pollution the 3rd leading contributor to
the burden of disease in this country. Exposure to household air pollution is also a problem in the developed
world. Nearly 30 million Americans burn solid fuels as their primary source of heating energy.
Nearly 50 years of research on ‘cleaner’ household energy technologies has demonstrated only modest global
impact, due to a combination of economic, cultural, and technologic barriers that prevent access to and usage
of clean energy. A further limitation is that nearly all household energy interventions, to date, have focused on
replacing only a single energy source (i.e., replacing just cooking, or just lighting) with a more modern technology.
We propose to address these issues by conducting a randomized controlled trial that (1) focuses on total
household energy (2) in a country that evinces readiness for alternative forms of energy, (3) by forming a public-
private partnership to promote technological solutions that are consumer-focused and market sustainable, (4)
by investigating outcome measures that are clinically actionable and strongly linked to morbidity/mortality, and
(5) by developing project outputs that can inform policymakers with cost-benefit information. We hypothesize
that a whole-house energy intervention (replacing all primitive forms of energy within the home with cleaner,
modern forms) will produce meaningful reductions in household air pollution and health benefits in rural Rwandan
homes. The randomized controlled trial will substitute traditional forms of household energy (biomass for cooking
and kerosene for lighting) with solar power and liquefied petroleum gas stoves in rural Rwanda. Participants will
be followed for 3 years with repeated measurements of household air pollution exposure (24-hour fine particulate
matter and black carbon), energy usage, and health. Primary health endpoints will include blood pressure in
adult women and men and lung-function growth in children; secondary health endpoints include blood pressure
in children and lung-function change in adults.
The long-term goals of this research are to increase the clinical knowledge-base on the health effects on
household air pollution, to demonstrate that a whole-house energy intervention will produce meaningful
household air pollution reductions and health benefits in rural Rwandan homes, to elucidate the relationship
between fuel subsidy levels and household air pollution exposure, and to demonstrate that scalable solutions to
the household air pollution disease burden are achievable via public-private-governmental partnerships."
10706996,"Background: One in four Veterans presenting to VA primary care screen positive for hazardous drinking.
However, due to barriers such as Veterans’ stigma about seeking alcohol use treatment and challenges with
traveling to VA, most of these Veterans do not receive any alcohol-related care. Mobile applications (apps) are
an innovative means of expanding access to alcohol use treatment. The evidence for mobile apps, such as
“Step Away”, to improve drinking outcomes is emerging. Nevertheless, poor patient engagement remains the
Achilles’ heel of these apps. Peer Specialists (“Peers”) can facilitate Veterans’ engagement with mobile apps
intended for self-management of hazardous drinking by helping to orient patients to these apps and by
providing technical support and accountability. In a VA HSR&D pilot study (PPO 16-305), we created a Veteran
version of the Step Away app (“Stand Down: Think Before You Drink”) and conducted an open trial in which
Veterans with hazardous drinking used the app while receiving Peer phone support. The intervention (“Peer-
Supported [PS]-Stand Down”) was highly acceptable to patients, and patients reported significant
improvements in drinking outcomes. These data provide a strong foundation for a larger pragmatic trial to test
the effectiveness of the Stand Down app and PS-Stand Down to reduce hazardous drinking among Veterans
seen in primary care, relative to the current standard of care that these patients receive.
Significance: By capitalizing on a high-value workforce shown to improve Veterans engagement in care (i.e.,
Peers), this research can expand access to alcohol care for Veterans with low staff burden and, in turn, reduce
the long-term health consequences associated with untreated hazardous drinking. Our proposed research
responds to HSR&D priorities of Access to Care, Mental Health, and Virtual Care, and the VA MISSION Act.
Innovation and Impact: Poor patient engagement severely limits the potential effectiveness of mobile apps for
self-management of alcohol use problems. Use of Peers to enhance patients’ engagement with such apps is a
novel approach to overcoming this problem. Peers are ideally suited to this role by virtue of their lived
experience with addiction. This approach represents a novel application of the supportive accountability model
of adherence to e-health interventions. Combined with VA’s expansion of Peers on Patient Aligned Care
Teams (PACT), PS-Stand Down, if shown to be effective, can transform the delivery of care for Veterans in
primary care who screen positive for hazardous drinking.
Specific Aims: We propose to evaluate whether the Stand Down app reduces drinking among Veteran
primary care patients who engage in hazardous drinking, and for whom PS-Stand Down is more effective than
the app alone. Aim 1: Test whether Stand Down (vs. Usual Care; UC) and PS-Stand Down (vs. UC and vs.
app only) predicts better drinking outcomes, and test mediators of these effects. Aim 2: Test for differences in
satisfaction with care across conditions, and conduct qualitative interviews with patients and PACT staff to
understand potential barriers/facilitators to implementing PS-Stand Down in primary care. Aim 3: Explore
baseline moderators to elucidate for whom PS-Stand Down (vs. app only) is most beneficial.
Methodology: In a 3-group RCT at the Palo Alto and Syracuse VAs, 274 Veteran primary patients who screen
positive for hazardous drinking, received a brief intervention following a positive screen, and are not currently
in alcohol use treatment will complete a baseline interview, be randomized to either (i) UC, (ii) UC plus Stand
Down, or (iii) UC plus PS-Stand Down (four phone sessions with a Peer over 8 weeks to enhance app
engagement), and be re-interviewed at 8, 20, and 32 weeks. For Aim 2, the CFIR framework will guide key
informant interviews with 12 patients and 12 PACT providers from each site.
Next Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results, we will work with our VACO partners in the Offices of
Mental Health & Suicide Prevention and Connected Care to conduct a large multisite implementation trial."
10673626,"Background: The toll of suicide goes way beyond the death of an individual. Those exposed (defined as knowing
the person) to a suicide death are at elevated risk for mental illness, physical disorders, impaired social
functioning, and fatal and nonfatal suicide behavior. Conclusions from the handful of studies that have examined
this topic among Veterans are limited by distinct samples, limited sample sizes and other methodological issues.
Additionally, the numbers of women and minority race/ethnicity service members and Veterans in these studies
were too small to examine what are likely critical differences by sex and race.
Significance: This study will provide foundational information on an understudied risk factor for suicide in a
cohort of Veterans at increased suicide risk – post 9/11 Veterans within six years following military separation. It
will provide information to inform suicide postvention strategies that target the population of suicide bereaved
post-9/11 Veterans as well as those targeting women and American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: (1) Use of VA data to provide the most reliable prevalence estimates for suicide
exposure among Veterans to date; (2) Oversampling of vulnerable but understudied populations -- Women and
AI/AN Veterans; (3) inclusion of two comparison groups to elucidate the common and unique contribution of
suicide exposure to health outcomes and patterns of VA service utilization; and (4) Assessment of the formal
and informal supports Veterans receive for mental health problems associated with suicide using both survey
and VA healthcare utilization data.
Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate differences in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prolonged
grief disorder (PGD), and in suicidal ideation, attempts and planning among Veterans exposed to suicide
compared with those exposed to other causes of sudden death and with unexposed Veterans. We will also
evaluate differences by sex and race. (2) Identify modifiable moderating factors for the association between
suicide exposure and negative outcomes and modifiable moderating factors for the association between suicide
or sudden death exposure and negative outcomes relative to those with neither exposure. (3) Describe treatment
experiences, interests, reported suicide attempts, and patterns of VA service utilization among those exposed to
a suicide death compared to Veterans exposed to other sudden deaths and to unexposed Veterans. (4)
Contextualize quantitative findings through interviews with a purposive sample of Veterans exposed to suicide.
The interviews will focus on modifiable factors at each level of the socio-ecological model of suicide prevention
to better understand targets for intervention.
Methodology: This explanatory sequential mixed methods study examines outcomes associated with suicide
exposure in a nationally representative sample of post-9/11 Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare. We will collect
data in three waves. Wave 1 will implement a national population probability sample using a brief survey to
assess exposure history (suicide, other sudden death, neither) and exposure characteristics (e.g., time since
exposure) among 11,400 Veteran respondents. Wave 2 will survey Wave 1 respondents, stratified by exposure
history (suicide, sudden death, neither), to assess outcomes and variables of interest among 4,500 Veterans
(1,500 respondents per exposure group). Wave 3 involves interviews with a purposive subsample of 32 Waves
2 survey responders who have been exposed to suicide but differ in outcomes. Quantitative analysis is the
priority of the study; the qualitative component will contextualize the quantitative findings.
Next Steps/ Implementation: This work will direct VA and the field towards an understanding of the most critical
outcomes among veterans exposed to suicide, the mechanisms that may lead to deleterious outcomes, and lay
a foundation for understanding the effective treatments and supports needed for Veterans who experience a
suicide loss, including women and AI/AN Veterans."

opioids) before they leave high school, a fact that has serious long-term health and societal impacts. Since
most adolescents begin using substances with peers, an understanding of the processes that lead to peer
influence susceptibility in the context of substance-using peers offers critical avenues for successful
intervention in substance use. Our prior research developed a unique performance-based experimental
paradigm for measuring peer influence susceptibility and found that individual differences in susceptibility
interact with adolescents’ perceptions of their peers’ substance use to predict their own substance use
engagement. However, it remains unclear why some adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence than
others, and how development confers increased risk for susceptibility. This work will examine the neural
correlates associated with individual differences in peer influence susceptibility. Specifically, we will assess
how increased functional connectivity within and between neural networks subserving greater sensitivity to
social rewards and punishments, motivation to attain rewards and avoid punishment, and representations of
social others is associated with greater peer influence susceptibility. We will also examine a network involved
in executive control as a protective factor against later substance use. Using a two-cohort, accelerated
longitudinal design including adolescents spanning grades 6-12, we will investigate how individual differences
in connectivity within and between candidate neural networks predict prospective substance use initiation in
the context of peers. Eight hundred adolescents (age 11-13 years) will complete baseline assessments of
substance use, and peer influence susceptibility using an innovative experimental paradigm. A subset (n =
250) of the initial sample will partake in longitudinal task-based functional imaging in year 1 and 3, as well as
multi-wave longitudinal assessment occurring at one-year longitudinal intervals in subsequent years 2-5 to
obtain extensive data on adolescents’ and peers’ substance use trajectories across a critical developmental
period associated with substance use. By delineating the neurobiological markers of social influence
susceptibility, project findings can characterize those individuals at greatest risk for substance use, which can
inform interventions by targeting the psychological processes that contribute to peer influence susceptibility."
10768581,"Program Summary
The overarching goal of this P01 proposal is to develop novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine candidates that
can elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibody responses in immunization. Despite highly effective antiviral
drugs against HCV now being available, the continuous increase in new infections underscores the real-world
challenges in combating this human infection without a vaccine. This P01 proposal “Broadly Effective Hepatitis
C Vaccine” is built on the hypothesis that an HCV vaccine effective against diverse circulating HCV strains can
be developed through rational engineering of vaccines to enhance antigen immunogenicity and presentation of
conserved neutralizing epitopes, and to target well-defined multidonor class broadly neutralizing antibody
(bnAb) responses to HCV. Multidonor class antibody responses are antibodies sharing common genetic and
functional features produced in infection or vaccination at the population level. This P01 program consists of 2
research projects, supported by an admin core and 2 scientific cores. The overall aims of the program are: (1)
To determine the structures of HCV envelope glycoproteins important for rational vaccine design; (2) To
rationally design HCV vaccine antigens for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies that will be effective
against diverse circulating viral strains; (3) To determine the antibody responses elicited by HCV vaccine
antigens in preclinical animal models. Success in this research program will result in both basic scientific
knowledge and a strong HCV vaccine candidate for future pilot production and clinical testing."
11193665,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
The Administrative Core remains a central component of the Moffitt CSBC. It has oversight of the disbursal of
funds to the Projects and Cores. It is the clearinghouse for communication between the Moffitt CSBC and the
NCI and other members of the network. The core prepares the yearly reports to the NCI and will host the
External Scientific Advisory Board as well as the annual Integration Symposium. The Administrative Core will
provide travel support for the Moffitt CSBC team, invited guest speakers, and external advisors. To foster
scientific collaborations with researchers interested in related research with particular focus on Cancer
Systems Biology, the admin Core will be responsible for the distribution of information materials,
communication with other institutions, and collaborations with other relevant research programs. The admin
core plays a particularly critical role in the CSBC pilot projects. The administrative core will advertise pilot
funding opportunities, collect applications, organize the review panel and oversee the conduct of the funded
research. These funds will be used to support exploratory research that aligns with the evolutionary and
ecological theme of our CSBC as well as unexpected avenues of investigation that arise through developments
in the CSBC projects and core. Applications will be prioritized according to their (a) scientific merit, i.e.
significance and feasibility; (b) centrality to the mission of the Moffitt CSBC, i.e. an eco-evolutionary view of
cancer, and (c) innovation, i.e. a new paradigm. These projects will be supported by the $50,000 annual
institutional funding for pilot awards (see intuitional letter of support). In addition, in years 1-5 the Moffitt CSBC
budget includes another $50K for pilot awards. The Moffitt Cancer Center currently funds $50K per year to the
winner of the annual IMO transdisciplinary workshop (also guaranteed for the next 5 years). Finally, our CSBC
budget also provides an annual budget of $75,000 for trans-network projects (a requirement of the RFA) that
will enrich for center-center collaborations, ensuring the CSBC network flourishes."
10794296,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Although the World Health
Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy sets ambitious goals to reduce TB incidence by 90% by 2035, we are
not on track to achieve them. We will need to “accelerate basic, translational, and clinical research to improve
understanding of TB and expedite the development of innovative new tools and strategies to improve
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment to end the TB pandemic,” as stated in the NIAID Strategic Plan for TB.
We propose the Emory/Georgia TB Research Advancement Center (TRAC) to catalyze and elevate
multidisciplinary basic, translational and clinical TB research at Emory University and partner institutions:
University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, and Morehouse School of
Medicine. The Emory/Georgia TRAC builds upon the strong foundation established by the Emory TB Center,
created in 2020 in response to the growing number of investigators engaged in TB research. Across all the
Emory/Georgia TRAC institutions, there is a critical mass of 72 investigators engaged in TB research, and TB
PI/MPIs have received a total of over $104 million in TB research funding since 2010. Expertise in our TRAC
represents the full spectrum of TB science: TB transmission and epidemiology, human immunity to TB,
pathogenesis of TB using animal models (including non-human primates [NHP]), TB diagnostics, vaccines and
host-directed therapies, pharmacokinetics, drug-resistance and TB comorbidities (HIV, diabetes).
 The Emory/Georgia TRAC will create added value by leveraging the scientific strengths at TRAC
institutions to catalyze and expand multidisciplinary TB research. The TRAC will provide financial, logistical,
and intellectual resources, pilot grants, and mentoring via a Developmental Core, Clinical & Population
Science Core, Basic & Translational Science Core, and Bioinformatics & Integrated Systems Biology
Core. These Cores will provide training and access to human study populations in high burden countries and
the US, resources for BSL3 laboratory-based Mtb and animal model research, including NHP, and
opportunities to utilize cutting-edge technologies and systems biology that can be leveraged for new
multidisciplinary and translational TB studies. Further, the TRAC will provide mentorship and support for early-
stage and non-TB investigators and create shared data and specimen biorepositories that will be a resource
for new study ideas and preliminary data. The Emory/Georgia TRAC, through its Core activities and resources,
will achieve these overarching aims: Aim 1: To catalyze and expand collaborative multidisciplinary TB
research among established basic, clinical and translational TB investigators and collaborators in the U.S. and
internationally; Aim 2: To capitalize on the strengths of the Emory/Georgia TRAC universities to grow and
diversify TB research in new directions; and Aim 3: To identify, train and mentor the next generation of TB
researchers and scientific leaders."
10786064,"SUMMARY
In recent years, the incidence of AIDS-defining cancers has dramatically decreased due to the HAART therapy.
In contrast, the incidence of the non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC), especially lung cancer (LC) has risen by
more than 3 fold. In the U.S., LC has become the most common NADC with an incidence rate of 204 cases per
100,000 person-years. LC is also the most common NADC cause of death and accounts for 21% of cancer-
related death in the HIV(+) population. Although smoking is a key risk factor for HIV associated LCs, HIV(+)
individuals still have a 3-fold increased LC risk after controlling for smoking status, indicating that other factors
are responsible for this increased incidence. Unlike other common HIV associated cancers such as cervical
cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma, HIV associated LCs do not have a known viral
etiology. To discover any potential oncopathogen for HIV associated LCs, we have utilized our Next-
Generation-Sequencing-based PARSES pipeline to interrogate more than 1,000 LC RNA-seq data sets. We
discovered that human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally associated with LCs in the HIV(+) population. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the involvement of HPV in HIV associated LCs using our well-
established sequencing based informatics approaches as well as newly created HPV(+) HIV associated LC
model systems. We will first examine the hypothesis that there is a causal association between HPV and LCs
in the HIV(+) population but not in the general population. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that HPV
promotes lung oncogenesis by enhancing the estrogen-mediated growth signaling and expressing viral
E5/E6/E7/hpv-circ-880-408 oncogenes in the HIV(+) individuals. We will elucidate the critical roles of HPV
oncogene products including a novel viral circular RNA and estrogen-mediated growth signaling and immune-
evasion in HIV associated lung carcinogenesis. We will simultaneously examine an important concept of being
able to precisely treat HPV(+) HIV associated LCs with anti-estrogen and/or anti-HPV regimens in the era of
personalized medicine. Further, by determining the HPV etiology, our work may help prevent LCs by promoting
HPV vaccination for both sexes. Together, completion of the research will add conceptually to our
understanding of HIV associated LCs and provide potentially unique therapeutic opportunities and ultimately
benefit a subset of HIV(+) LC patients."
10800682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While abundant skeletal (ask-actin) and cardiac (aca-actin) actin isoforms are famous for their essential role in
striated muscle contraction, low abundance non-muscle “cytoplasmic” actin isoforms (bcyto- and gcyto-actin) are
also emerging as important in the maintenance of specialized structures (and functions) in normal and
diseased skeletal muscle. During this project, we generated and characterized muscle-specific mouse lines
either lacking or overexpressing bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin to understand their endogenous functions and role(s) in
dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, each bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin single knockout develops a
qualitatively similar phenotype characterized by a progressive myopathy with significant myofiber
degeneration/regeneration and muscle weakness. We have shown that skeletal muscle-specific
overexpression of bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice affords significant protection from
eccentric contraction-induced force drop while overexpression of a C272A mutant of gcyto-actin affords no
protection. These and other data suggest that eccentric contraction drives a rapidly-reversible, reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inhibition of sarcomeric contractility that may function to protect dystrophic
muscles from damage caused by repeated, high force contractions. Our new preliminary data show that
muscle-specific ablation of bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin from wildtype muscle results in eccentric contraction-induced
force drop that is reversed by the nonspecific antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Finally, we have obtained new
data suggesting that gcyto-actin is important for repair of membrane damage. Going forward, we will make use
of our unique animal models, isoform-specific reagents, and biochemical and physiological methodologies to
address new fundamental questions about cytoplasmic actins in normal skeletal muscle function and in
dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. In aim 1, we will identify the sources of ROS contributing to eccentric
contraction-induced force drop in dystrophic mdx skeletal muscle as well as the downstream targets of ROS
that ultimately inhibit force production. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of oxidative stress in driving the
myopathy and eccentric contraction-induced force drop associated with genetic ablation of bcyto- or gcyto-actin in
skeletal muscle. In aim 3, the interplay between cytoplasmic actin isoforms and ROS in membrane repair will
be investigated using state-of-the-art imaging approaches to analyze muscles from the same mouse lines
used in aims 1 and 2. The results of the proposed studies will further delineate the unique and important
contributions of cytoplasmic actin isoforms to the function of normal and dystrophic skeletal muscle."
10764910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major roadblock to rational HIV-1 vaccine design is the lack of a suitable primate model in which broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be commonly induced and the molecular, biological and immunological
mechanisms responsible for eliciting such responses studied in a reproducible and iterative fashion. Recently,
we demonstrated that primary HIV-1 Envs, when expressed by simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs)
in rhesus macaques (RMs), elicited patterns of Env-antibody coevolution strikingly similar to humans infected by
homologous virus strains, leading to neutralization breadth. These similarities in Env-antibody coevolution in
humans and rhesus included conserved immunogenetic, structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition
and precise Env amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of
one rhesus bNAb, capable of neutralizing 49% of a 208-strain panel, revealed a V2-apex mode of recognition
like that of human bNAbs PGT145 and PCT64-35M. Another rhesus antibody bound the CD4-binding site of
HIV-1 Env by CD4 mimicry mirroring human bNAbs 8ANC131, CH235 and VRC01. Based on these observations
supporting the relevance of the rhesus model to bNAb induction in humans, we propose here a novel “reverse
vaccinology” strategy in SHIV infected RMs as a “molecular guide” to inform and accelerate HIV-1 vaccine design
in humans. Specific aims are: (i) To isolate bNAb mAbs targeting CD4bs, fusion peptide, V3 glycan and V2 apex
epitopes from a subset of 150 SHIV infected RMs and to characterize their breadth, potency, immunogenetics,
target epitopes and structural solutions to epitope recognition. (ii) To characterize molecular patterns of Env-Ab
coevolution from rhesus germline B cell unmutated common ancestors (UCAs) to mature bNAbs and to identify
key Env intermediates, or “immunotypes,” that are responsible for driving bNAb lineage affinity maturation to
breadth. (iii) To design, construct and characterize novel SOSIP Env trimers that mimic key Env “immunotypes”
and demonstrate that they bind preferentially to bNAb UCAs and intermediate stage Abs. (iv) To conduct a proof-
of-concept preclinical vaccine trial in 24 RMs to test the hypothesis that reverse-engineered, B lineage-designed
SOSIP Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity mature bNAb responses in RMs to an extent that is superior to
conventional SOSIP Env immunogens and comparable to SOSIP-SHIV or SHIV-only immunizations."
10769821,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This proposal investigates in the nonhuman primate how attentional load changes the behavioral and neural
strategies for flexibly learning object relevance. High attentional load characterizes real-world learning scenarios
with multiple, multidimensional objects. Evidence suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying learning
during high attentional load fundamentally differs from neural mechanisms used to learn under low load. Our
proposal elucidates how learning at increasing attentional load (1) changes the cognitive subcomponent
processes used to succeed learning, (2) changes which brain areas are used to flexibly learn, and (3) recruits
additional neural circuit mechanisms to realize fast adjustments.
First, we will address the specific behavioral subcomponent processes used for learning the relevance of objects
in environments with increasing number of visual feature dimensions reflecting increasing attentional load.
Simple learning can be achieved efficiently with a hybrid mechanism that uses working memory (WM) of recently
rewarded objects to guide future choices together with slower reinforcement learning (RL) for updating longer-
term value expectations. When attentional load increases working memory breaks down, and efficient learners
flexibly adjust their exploration rates and attentional prioritization to speed up reinforcement learning. Our
proposal quantifies these changing learning strategies with multi-component WM-RL modeling.
Second, while subjects learn with varying strategies which features to use for making a decision, we will test the
causal role of three brain regions implicated to realize the respective learning mechanisms. We use transcranial
focused ultrasound stimulation to induce transient, fully reversible lesions allowing to functionally disrupt confined
neuronal ensembles. With this tool we elucidate the hypothesized contributions of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
to learning using fast working memory of rewarded objects, the contribution of the anterior cingulate cortex in
adjusting exploration strategies and the contribution of the anterior striatum for attentional biasing of slower
reinforcement learning of the highest reward-value object within a complex, multidimensional feature space.
Third, our project elucidates how the local circuits in each of the three brain areas contribute to successful
learning with varying strategies. We use massively parallel recordings of single neuron activity in ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior striatum to extract those cell classes whose firing
encodes the key learning variables. We expect that subclasses of interneurons maximally correlate their firing
only during those periods when the area specific learning strategy is realized. This approach pinpoints the cell
classes that maximally correlate with choice probabilities, prediction errors, working memory, and exploration
rates when subjects adjust their learning strategies to successfully learn the relevance of objects with real-world
complexity."
10805384,"Mammalian cells exhibit a precise gene regulation process, during which enhancers play critical roles in mediating rapid gene activation in response to different signals. Indeed, much of our knowledge about gene transcriptional control comes from the long-standing investigation of the actions of nuclear receptors, well exemplified by estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2)-dependent activation of transcriptional programs. This program is controlled virtually entirely by activation of a cohort of ~1000 robustly activated ERα-bound enhancers. Under physiological conditions, many signals are pulsatile, including ligands for nuclear receptors such as ERα, representing a continuum from transient, acute stimulation to chronic stimulation. We have found that the acute 17β-estradiol (E2)-dependent activation of functional enhancers requires assembly of an eRNA-dependent ribonucleoprotein (eRNP) complex, referred to as the MegaTrans complex. A transformative, newly emerging concept, to which we are pleased to have contributed, is that acute signal of ligand-dependent activation of target enhancers causes them to form an RNA-protein condensate, with features of phase separation, that results in cooperative activation of other homotypic enhancers separated by multiple TADs and, even in other chromosomes. In contrast, chronic signal/ligand activation results in loss of the dynamic RNP condensate at the
enhancers, loss of induced proximity of homotypic enhancers observed with acute activation, with enhancer activation function now confined to the nearby cognate target gene promoters. We will use global genomic, proteomic, and real time, single nucleus approaches, with appropriate informatics, to examine the patterns of enhancer activation, potential interactions in acute vs chronic ligand-dependent activation, relationship to localization in phase-separated subnuclear architectural structures and patterns of movement by single molecule imaging. Our goal is to provide a paradigm-shifting insight into ligand/hormone-regulated transcriptional programs, based on this multidisciplinary approach."
10788337,"Abstract
Non-malarial acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFIs) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in
Latin America, and the incidence of dengue-like illness has increased dramatically in recent years. As in most
low-and middle-income countries, only a handful of “dengue” cases are confirmed by laboratory testing and
therefore many other pathogens remain hidden under the dengue “umbrella”. Lack of proper training among
scientists and health care workers was recognized as one of the major obstacles in the diagnosis of AUFIs. To
fill this gap, our D43 Global Infectious Disease Research Training Program was launched in 2016, with the goal
of forming a strong team of scientists studying non-malarial acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFIs) in
Colombia. Since then, the program has filled a major gap. Over the past five years, we completed advanced
training of Colombian Faculty members, predoctoral and postdoctoral students, and conducted short-term
training on grant writing and manuscript preparation. The program encompassed short, medium, and long-term
research training, and it has exceeded expectations (see Progress Report). The past five years has allowed us
to identify additional gaps, challenges, and opportunities. Our new proposed activities will build on our
accomplishments and continue to build capacity and train a new group of Colombian Faculty members, PhD
students and postdoctoral fellows studying the emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. We will expand
the focus of our D43 training program to address respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza
viruses. We will incorporate training of master’s students enrolled in the Master’s in Basic Biomedical Sciences
and implement training on novel molecular and bioinformatic methods, electron microscopy, novel diagnostic
methods, grant writing, scientific writing, ethics in scientific research, and biosafety, and for Colombian Faculty,
PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, research leadership. Our carefully designed plan includes: 1) In Years 1
and 2, we will support medium-term training of six Colombian Faculty members under a “train the trainer”
approach, 2) In Years 1 and 2, we will recruit and support in-country long-term training of master’s students
interested in emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases working under the mentorship of the Colombian
Program Faculty, 3) In Years 3 through 5, we will recruit and support long-term training of PhD, and postdoctoral
fellows in the US in advanced research methodologies, scientific writing, biosafety, and bioethics, and, 4) we will
conduct short-term in country training in Colombia to ensure appropriate implementation of methodologies, and
also conduct specific workshops. We will continue to support training across institutions in the region through in-
country visits of US Faculty members and funds will be available for pilot and reinsertion small grants after
completion of training. An important planned outcome is the increased awareness of these diseases at the level
of human and veterinary health professionals, as well as public health authorities."
10767914,"Project Summary
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related death
in the United States. The five-year survival rate of less than nine percent is attributed mainly to a difficulty in
early detection and a lack of effective treatments for PDAC. Novel immunotherapies such as immune
checkpoint blockade which have revolutionized treatment of other cancers have failed to achieve efficacy in
PDAC. This is thought to be due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of PDAC which limits the
effector T cell infiltration and activation necessary for effective immunotherapy. Understanding how to increase
T cell activation and infiltration despite an immunosuppressive microenvironment is essential to increasing the
efficacy of immunotherapies in PDAC.
 Using a genetically engineered mouse model (“KPCY”) of pancreatic cancer, our lab has demonstrated
that clones derived from primary KPCY tumors can be divided into “T-cell-inflamed” or “non-T-cell-inflamed”
phenotypes. While T-cell-inflamed tumors are responsive to combination immunotherapy, non-T-cell-inflamed
tumors are resistant. A CRISPR screen of non-T-cell-inflamed cells found that DNMT1, a DNA
methyltransferase involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication, is important for tumor
growth in PDAC. Knockout of DNMT1 in a non-T-cell-inflamed tumor line was found to significantly increase T
cell infiltration and decrease tumor growth in vivo. T cell depletion, however, was found to rescue the wild type
phenotype. Based on recent studies of the non-specific DNMT inhibitor azacytidine, loss of DNMT1 is
hypothesized to de-repress endogenous retroviruses in the genome, leading to dsRNA induction which
activates a “viral mimicry” immune mechanism. The goals of this proposal are: (1) to determine how loss of
DNMT1 promotes T-cell dependent anti-tumor immunity, and (2) to assess the therapeutic potential of
targeting DNMT1 in conjunction with immunotherapy.
 To examine the mechanism of tumor cell intrinsic DNMT1 in inhibition of T-cell dependent suppression
of tumor growth, I will first assess the changes in DNA methylation at endogenous retroviruses and genes
related to the viral mimicry pathway provoked by loss of DNMT1. I will then determine if loss of DNMT1 leads
to activation of the viral mimicry pathway, and whether inhibition of this pathway rescues the wild type
phenotype (Aim 1). To determine the translational potential of DNMT1 as a target, I will first identify anti-tumor
changes in T cells and tumor cells provoked by loss of DNMT1. I will trial immunotherapy in mice with DNMT1
knockout tumors to determine changes in sensitivity to immunotherapy (Aim 2). Ultimately, the insights gained
from this study will provide us with a better understanding of the role of DNMT1 in regulating the PDAC
immune microenvironment and its potential as a therapeutic target."
10928118,"Title: Dissecting epitranscriptomic signal from complex tissues
PROJECT SUMMARY:
“RNA epigenetics” or “epitranscriptomics” has emerged in recent years as an exciting and active research
field to study post-transcriptional regulation of gene expressions. The RNA modifications play important roles
in gene expression regulation, and are involved in neurodevelopment and a number of neurological diseases.
Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeRIP-seq) is a newly developed technology for
transcriptome-wise profiling of the RNA epigenetic modifications. MeRIP-seq leads to an expansion of
applications in both basic and clinical research, but faces a number of challenges in analysis with its unique
data characteristics, including 1) the presence of technical artifacts due to sequence content and sample
preparation procedures unique to MeRIP; 2) lack of appropriate methods for identification and comparison of
RNA methylated regions; and 3) lack of methods to account for the heterogeneity of tissue samples.
In this proposal, we will address these challenges and develop a series of novel statistical methods for
MeRIP-seq data preprocessing and analyses. They include a data normalization procedure to remove
technical bias, accurate and efficient methods for RNA methylation site detection and comparison, and signal
deconvolution methods to draw cell type specific inferences based on data from tissue samples. All methods
developed in this project will be implemented and released as free, open source software to benefit the
epigenomics research community, including basic scientists working on genetics, epigenetics, gene
regulation and cell development, as well as clinicians looking for disease biomarkers."
10833459,"This project proposes an integrated set of aims and analyses of existing social and epigenetic data from three
national studies of aging in the family of Health and Retirement studies (the US Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA), and the Irish Longitudinal
Study of Aging (TILDA)); assays of existing samples to produce longitudinal epigenetic data for the three
countries are also proposed. Comparative analyses based on these data will address central questions about
how life circumstances in both childhood and adulthood affect epigenetic change and how different historical and
life-course exposures in these countries may result in differential patterns of associations. The project will also
examine how epigenetic changes in turn are associated with health after age 50. The proposal is submitted in
response to the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership, a unique research initiative involving
funding agencies from the United States (US), the Republic of Ireland (RofI), and Northern Ireland (NI).
Proposals are submitted to each of the three countries with funding requested for each country's participation
from their respective grant agency (e.g., US NIH); grant review is done only by NIH for all three projects based
on this proposal. The project will examine the links between lifetime social, economic, psychological,
environmental and behavioral circumstances, and epigenetic markers related to aging and health, and
subsequent health. Epigenetic modification is one of the “hallmarks” of aging, i.e. an underlying physiological
change that can speedup or delay aging-related health outcomes. Faster aging is characteristic of people in
adverse social circumstances and epigenetic change, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm), appears to be
especially influenced by adverse social circumstances, both at early ages and at later ages. This project will be
unique in evaluating how a variety of social circumstances, i.e. low levels of education and income, minority
group membership, adverse childhood experiences, adult traumas, risky health behaviors, psychological states,
and chronic stress, are associated with epigenetic markers in three different countries, with somewhat different
historical, social and behavioral characteristics which are operating in different health policy regimes – allowing
for both replication where effects are hypothesized to be similar and differentiation where they are hypothesized
to differ (e.g., where risk characteristics are differentially patterned by SES). The applicants are uniquely placed
with their resources to explore how socioeconomic experiences across the life course alter epigenetic profiles to
influence health outcomes such as biological dysregulation, frailty, disability, chronic disease, and premature
mortality. The three data sets have been harmonized for information collection from the beginning of the studies
and were designed to encourage comparative analysis. They have been harmonized in the survey information
and the development of the epigenetic data in the three countries. Each country has strong independent research
teams who bring unique expertise and resources and a history of collaboration to this collaborative proposal."
10828710,"The United States continues to struggle with a major opioid crisis. This is a critical issue for state Medicaid
programs as rates of opioid use disorders (OUD) in the Medicaid population are almost twice as high as the
general population. Nearly 40% of people with OUD have Medicaid. Evidence-based treatments for OUD,
including the three FDA-approved medications, exist but are underutilized. Barriers to access and retention in
treatment are numerous and complex, including stigma, provider capacity and health insurance policies.
Federal and state governments regulate Medicaid Health Plans (MHPs); however the plans have discretion in
several areas including coverage, utilization management, network management, provider payment and
innovative policies. Plan policies directly affect individual access both through coverage and through provider
willingness to offer services, given lack of coverage, administrative headaches from utilization management
requirements and low payment rates. Despite the opioid crisis, there is almost no information or transparency
on MHP polices related to opioid treatment services.
The proposed study aims to systematically examine delivery and management of OUD treatment in MHPs, an
under-explored level where important decisions are made. We will conduct a national survey of MHPs and link
their responses to national data on health plan quality and to patient-level Medicaid data from three states in
order to examine outcomes. The specific aims are:
 Aim 1. Describe Medicaid health plan OUD treatment policies (e.g. coverage requirements, utilization
management, network design, payment, and innovative care approaches) across MHPs that contract with
50 states and the District of Columbia and identify state policies, market and plan characteristics associated
with OUD treatment policies.
Aim 2. Evaluate the relationship between Medicaid health plans’ OUD treatment policies and plan-level
rates of enrollee access to and quality of OUD treatment.
Aim 3. Evaluate the relationship between Medicaid health plans’ OUD treatment policies and patient-level
outcomes of OUD treatment (e.g. pharmacotherapy duration, overdose).
The study team is uniquely qualified for this project and will leverage expertise developed in four previous
NIDA and NIAAA-funded commercial health plan surveys of delivery and management of behavioral health
services and 2 previous NIDA-funded Medicaid studies. Findings will provide valuable information regarding
access to and effectiveness of OUD treatment under Medicaid plans. This information can be used by plan
administrators as they develop and implement plan policies, state Medicaid directors as they contract with and
regulate MHPs and federal policy makers making determinations about use of Medicaid waivers and other
efforts to address OUD in the US, to help stem the tide of OUD and its often-deadly consequences."
10845693,"Aging is a biological process that is the major risk factor for chronic disease and degeneration during the
lifespan. However, it is beginning to be appreciated that disease and degeneration impinge on the aging
process, in something akin to a feedback loop, suggesting that a better knowledge of one contributes to an
understanding of the other. This necessitates that development of therapeutic interventions must address the
degenerative disorders of aging, while the search for broad interventions that target the biological aging
process itself continues. The agenda just described calls for the creation and nurturing of an environment in
which multidisciplinary research of sufficient breadth is focused on key elements of aging and regeneration. At
the same time, it is necessary to populate this translational space with talented and successful investigators.
Our Phase I and II COBRE launched and further propelled us in this direction by allowing us to seed several
key research topics with ambitious junior investigators, who in just nine years have advanced to independently
funded status with remarkable success. Our task is not yet done, however, if we are to maintain momentum
and a critical mass of investigators dedicated to aging and regenerative medicine. COBRE Phase III will allow
us to continue to grow our cadre of dedicated investigators through our pilot projects and by enriching the
research environment through our mentoring and training programs, as well as topical seminars. These efforts
will be aided by the maintenance of a state-of-the-art Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Imaging Core
that has a sustaining revenue base. Our emphasis is on multiplying the opportunities for interactions that will
generate collaborative projects that are synergistic and competitive for multicomponent project grant funding.
Our goals are to: (1) Continue to expand the number of aging and regeneration research-oriented, funded
investigators within our scientific community through our pilot projects, with emphasis on collaborative
research, and to provide a mentoring program for these researchers and others that supports successful
career development. (2) Maintain our state-of-the-art infrastructure to provide sustainable resources that
continuously enhance the competitiveness of our faculty for national funding, by expanding and updating the
services performed by our Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Imaging Core. (3) Cement the position of
the Tulane Center for Aging at the forefront of aging and regenerative medicine by growth of our thematic,
multidisciplinary research foci to facilitate successful extramurally funded collaborations that will support and

10831478,"Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death worldwide from a curable infectious agent and is becoming a major
concern due to the spread of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. In 2015, the South African
National Tuberculosis Programme introduced Bedaquiline (BDQ) to strengthen existing regimens for the therapy
of rifampicin-resistant TB. This initiative has immediate and far-reaching implications for thousands of South
Africans suffering from TB. Concerningly, mutations associated with BDQ resistance (rv0678 and atpE) have
been identified in Mtb clones isolated from patients who have never been treated with BDQ or clofazimine (CFZ).
Intriguingly, both BDQ and CFZ target the Mtb electron transport chain. These findings, together with the fact
that Mtb can persist in a dormant, drug-tolerant state, sometimes reactivating to cause TB decades after the
primary infection, indicate an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms of BDQ/CFZ resistance in clinical
strains of Mtb.
 Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of Mtb drug resistance and how this knowledge can
be used for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes in South Africa. In this proposal, our central hypothesis is
that mutations in rv0678, atpE and elsewhere in the Mtb genome dysregulate central metabolism that contributes
to BDQ and CFZ resistance. To test this hypothesis, we have established a global collaborative effort between
basic and clinical investigators at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU) in South Africa and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). As part of this collaboration, we have established a series of
specific aims to determine the prevalence of rv0678 and atpE mutations in specific Mtb lineages isolated from
patients in South Africa. We will also make use of a novel technology termed extracellular flux (XF96) analysis
that we have adapted for studying Mtb bioenergetics in real time. This technology will be complemented by 13C
stable isotope analyses using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Lastly, we will further pursue our
exciting preliminary findings and determine whether BDQ resistance associated variants contribute to the bacilli's
bioenergetic flexibility.
 This contribution is significant, because it has the potential to identify a new paradigm that will lead to a
mechanistic understanding of the emergence of BDQ/CFZ resistance, and how disruption of this process could
be exploited to sterilize Mtb. This proposal is innovative in our opinion, because the newly adapted technology
that is supported by whole genome sequencing, real-time bioenergetics and metabolomics, distinguishes itself
from conventional approaches for studying drug resistance in pathogenic microbes."
10665600,"Background: Over 40% of Veterans have obesity, a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Weight loss
interventions produce clinically significant weight loss, yet weight regain commonly occurs due to declining
adherence to lifestyle changes. These changes are often substantially influenced by others in the home. Thus,
involving both Veterans and a cohabiting support person in weight management efforts could improve long-
term weight loss. The goal of the proposed trial is to evaluate the efficacy of involving romantic and non-
romantic support persons in weight management efforts to sustain long-term weight loss in Veterans.
Significance: This study will contribute to our long-term goal of implementing effective approaches to reduce
obesity and associated comorbidities among Veterans. This proposal addresses Health Services Research &
Development priorities of access, primary care practice, and virtual care and Office of Research &
Development priority of providing Veterans with access to high-quality clinical trials. The importance of
identifying efficacious strategies for weight loss maintenance was highlighted in a 2016 State-of-the-Art
conference on weight management.
Innovation: We will substantially enhance prior work and the MOVE! program offered through the VA by 1)
teaching Veterans and their support persons to apply communication and support skills to support Veteran
weight management and 2) focusing on long-term weight loss.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare effects of patient-only and partner-assisted interventions on long-term weight
loss (primary outcome) and obesity-specific quality of life (secondary outcome). Our primary hypothesis is that
average weight loss from baseline among Veterans will be at least 3 percentage points greater, a clinically
meaningful difference, in the partner-assisted arm than the patient-only arm at 72 weeks. Aim 2: Evaluate the
extent to which early intervention effects are mediated by changes in interdependence theory constructs
(transformation of motivation, couple efficacy, outcome expectancy, and social support). Aim 3: Evaluate
implementation outcomes of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility among MOVE! Coordinators via
validated surveys and qualitative interviews, and evaluate treatment receipt and enactment among a subset of
participating Veterans and support persons via qualitative interviews.
Methodology: This is a two-arm randomized trial. Participants: Dyads comprising a Veteran with obesity and a
cohabiting adult support person. Intervention: Index patients will participate in a group-based weight
management program using the Veterans Affairs (VA) national MOVE! weight management curriculum and
delivered using the VA virtual technology platform, VA Video Connect. Support persons will join the sessions,
and dyads will learn and practice communication skills. Comparison: Veterans will participate in the weight
management program without a support person. Outcomes: The primary outcome is percent weight loss from
baseline. Time: The intervention is 72 weeks in duration. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and every 24
weeks, with 72 weeks as the primary endpoint.
Implementation: We will assess MOVE! coordinator perceptions of intervention appropriateness,
acceptability, and feasibility and Veteran treatment receipt and enactment in Aim 3. Armed with this
information, we will be poised to study implementation in the future. The materials developed in this study
could be disseminated and implemented as an optional module by MOVE! Coordinators."
11146120,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Asthma, a chronic condition that affects over five million US children, is more prevalent among
racial/ethnic minority children and those from low-income families. Despite advances in asthma treatment,
asthma clinical care and mortality rates in children have plateaued, and disparities persist across racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic groups. I propose a training and research plan that will deepen my understanding of
evidence-based clinical asthma care and the differential impacts of multifactorial causes underlying disparities
in childhood asthma, while launching an innovative, policy-relevant research portfolio that combines multi-
source, linked data to conduct “natural policy experiments” regarding Medicaid managed care (MMC) plans.
Objective: To produce evidence regarding the “add-on” benefits of MMC plans and their relative effects on
outcomes of children with asthma, accounting for factors at individual, family, and neighborhood levels. This
evidence will be used to simulate different ways of assigning patients to MMC plans that best serve their needs
and, ultimately, reduce health disparities. Aim 1. To examine evidence-based indicators of pediatric asthma
care quality and outcomes across different MMC plans. Aim 2. To evaluate the role of individual, family, and
neighborhood contributors—including sociodemographic, economic, and biological (comorbidity) risk factors—
associated with asthma outcomes. Aim 3. To develop an algorithm that matches each patient with an MMC
plan that helps them achieve the best possible asthma outcomes. Research Design: Natural experiment
analyses and simulation methods using administrative longitudinal linked datasets from 2000-2021. Methods: I
will collect detailed data on MMC plan benefits and rely on established quasi-random assignment of Medicaid
beneficiaries to MMC plans, to specify a set of regression models aimed at estimating causal effects of plan
benefits on asthma-related outcomes, individually and relative to the social determinants of health. These
analyses will use individual and geographic-level linked South Carolina datasets that contain health, economic,
sociodemographic outcomes, and comorbidities: Medicaid; Vital Statistics; Department of Education and
Department of Juvenile Justice records; American Community Survey data. I will use simulation methods to
evaluate child health outcomes under differing Medicaid policy scenarios, to match each child to an optimal
MMC plan. Training Plan: To complement my existing skills in economics and data analysis and support my
path to independence, I will gain essential training in: 1. Evidence and circumstances of clinical asthma care
that will aid in constructing precise plan quality measures; 2. Stakeholder engagement that is key to (a)
confirming details of plan coverage with MMC plans and leadership, (b) informing and disseminating research
results, and (c) engaging with other states’ Medicaid programs in the future; 3. Advanced methodologic skills in
policy simulations. Implications: This project will address NHLBI’s research priority to investigate factors that
account for differences in health among populations via advancing methods for assessing impactful exposures."
10831466,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cortical dysfunction has been implicated in many neurological disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and
stroke. The majority of cortical connections are local, implying that local microcircuitry should be a dominant
contributor to pyramidal neuron receptive fields and, therefore, perception. Cortical microcircuit motifs include
recurrent excitation and inhibition, which mediate interactions between similarly tuned populations, and feed-
forward excitation and lateral inhibition, which mediate interactions between distinctly tuned populations.
Studying these motifs in vivo has proven challenging because pyramidal neurons with different functional
tuning are often intermingled, requiring cellular-resolution perturbation approaches to probe microcircuit
function. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that local microcircuit interactions shape neural
receptive fields during naturalistic behavior, and that these interactions contribute to perception. We focus on
mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1), where sensory input from single whiskers outputs onto
small patches of cortex known as `barrels', making individual whisker sensory representations tractable targets
to comprehensive recording and subsequent perturbation. In previously published work, we demonstrated the
ability to record and classify the majority of layer (L) 2/3 neurons in a barrel. Here, we present preliminary data
demonstrating the ability to lesion small subsets of identified neurons in a barrel using multiphoton ablation,
thereby overcoming the previous constraint on experiments probing the role of recurrent amplification among
similarly tuned neurons. Preliminary experiments in single-whisker mice indicate that recurrent excitation in vS1
L2/3 amplifies the responses of neurons tuned to whisker touch, but not of those tuned to whisker movement,
and that recurrent inhibition does not exert a measurable effect on touch responses. Further preliminary data
in mice with two whiskers reveals that feed-forward excitation from single-whisker responsive neurons shapes
multi-whisker responses and that cross-whisker suppression declines following single-whisker neuron lesions.
Finally, preliminary barrel-scale lesion experiments reconcile recent controversies in the field and show that
vS1 is necessary for discrimination but not detection behaviors. We propose three aims testing 1) whether
recurrent interactions – excitatory and inhibitory – shape vS1 L2/3 responses of neurons tuned to the same
whisker; 2) whether L2/3 excitatory touch neurons tuned to different whiskers interact via feed-forward
excitation to generate multi-whisker receptive fields and via lateral inhibition to produce cross-whisker
suppression; 3) whether individual vS1 barrels contribute to perception, and whether L2/3 recurrent excitation
in vS1 contributes to perception. The proposed work involves a novel combination of large-scale two-photon
calcium imaging, multiphoton ablation, barrel-scale lesions, and quantitative head-fixed mouse behavior. Our
long-term goal is to understand sensory microcircuit computations and how they shape perception."
10807088,"ABSTRACT – Overall Component
In the current proposal we will use a systems vaccinology approach to address two fundamental issues in
vaccinology. The first issue concerns the immunology of COVID-19 vaccines, which utilize novel platforms
(mRNA) or adjuvants (Matrix M used in the Novavax vaccine). The second issue is related to the role of the
microbiome on vaccine immunity. With respect to the first issue, despite the rapid development of COVID-
19 vaccines, there is a paucity of understanding about the mechanisms by which they induce innate and
adaptive responses. Furthermore, the nature of the immune response induced by mRNA vaccines in special
populations such as those with serious allergic disease is unknown. Interestingly, there have been reports
of rare but severe allergic reactions to vaccination, in individuals with an atopic background. Therefore, we will
assess immunity to the BNT162b2 vaccine atopic versus healthy subjects. In the case of the Matrix-M
adjuvanted recombinant COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax, there is a paucity of understanding of
immune mechanisms stimulated by the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant. We will analyze samples collected
from a Novavax sponsored clinical trial in South Africa.
 The second theme of the proposal is focused on the impact of the microbiome on immunity to
vaccination in healthy adults. Our recent work involving antibiotics driven ablation of the microbiota has
highlighted an important role for the microbiome in modulating immune responses to vaccination with the
seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immune response against seasonal influenza vaccine in adults
represents a recall response, because of prior exposure to influenza. The impact of the microbiome on a
primary immune response, such as the response to rabies vaccination, is unknown.
These two issues will be addressed in the following highly collaborative projects and cores: Project 1 (PI
Pulendran) will utilize a multi-omics approach to define innate responses driving adaptive immunity immunity
to vaccination. The signatures identified in this project will be correlated with antigen-specific T and B cell
responses assessed in Projects 2 (PI Davis) and 3 (PI Boyd), respectively. Project 2 will perform an in-depth
analysis of the dynamics of the antigen-specific T cell responses to vaccination. Project 3 (PI Boyd; Co-I
Nadeau) will perform an in-depth analysis of the dynamics of the antigen-specific B cell responses to
vaccination. The three projects will be assisted by 4 cores. The Administrative Core will support the
coordination efforts across the HIPC-Stanford Center. The Clinical Core (PI Nadeau) will ensure a
standardized approach in the recruitment and clinical characterization of human subjects in all studies; the
Data Management and Analysis Core (PI Khatri) will provide bioinformatics expertise, and the Human
Immune Monitoring Core (PI Holden) will support the projects by providing immune monitoring assays."

As the population ages, Alzheimer's disease and dementia are becoming a public health crisis. In our initial
cycle, the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project was established to examine cardiovascular function in relation to
structural neuroimaging changes and cognition. We also tested whether associations were more prominent in
clinically symptomatic individuals. We successfully enrolled several hundred participants age 60 and older, our
data successfully supported multiple training grant opportunities (e.g., National Research Service Awards,
Career Development Awards), and we published numerous papers. Our results suggest subclinical
cardiovascular changes relate to worse cognition, white matter changes, and cerebral atrophy, especially in the
hippocampus and other cortical regions primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease. Evidence to date supports
our central hypothesis that well-established homeostatic mechanisms designed to protect cerebral blood
supply become less effective with age, altering the integrity of cerebral hemodynamics, and lowering the
threshold for neurodegenerative and cognitive changes. Interestingly, our preliminary associations between
subclinical cardiovascular integrity and cerebral hemodynamics are stronger among carriers of the
apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE-ε4) allele, an Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factor. Furthermore, findings are
more prominent in cognitively unimpaired participants, suggesting subtle cardiac hemodynamic changes may
act as an underrecognized precipitating contributor of neurodegeneration and corresponding cognitive decline,
distinct from the exacerbating effects of overt cerebrovascular disease. In the next cycle, we propose to better
characterize underlying mechanisms linking early cardiac hemodynamic changes to abnormal brain aging in
cognitively unimpaired participants, and test whether APOE-ε4 moderates the effect of vascular damage on
brain health. We will follow the existing cohort and supplement it with enrollment of several hundred cognitively
unimpaired participants to increase statistical power for more comprehensive analyses. The new participants
will complete serial longitudinal assessments with identical procedures plus lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal
fluid acquisition. Innovative translational efforts leveraging sophisticated neuroimaging and molecular
biomarkers are critical to better detect early, asymptomatic cardiac hemodynamic changes, which may be
more influential in initiating downstream cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative processes than previously
recognized."

The Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC), in its 48th continuous year of operation as a NIH-
sponsored Diabetes Center, seeks to continue its efforts to facilitate the discovery, application, and translation
of scientific knowledge to improve the care of patients with diabetes. The VDRC is an interdisciplinary program
involving 142 participating faculty distributed among 15 departments in two schools and three colleges at
Vanderbilt and neighboring Meharry Medical College. Because of the VDRC and the environment it creates,
VDRC investigators have made important scientific contributions related to diabetes, obesity, and metabolism.
The VDRC consists of: 1) Administrative Component that coordinates the scientific, organizational, enrichment,
training, and outreach activities; For example, the VDRC established the National Diabetes Research Center
Virtual Seminar Series early in the COVID crisis and this is now part of efforts by 15 Diabetes Research
Centers to promote communication and interaction. 2) Biomedical Research Component that recruits and
selects VDRC investigators and supervises the research cores that facilitate and enhance their research; 3)
Pilot and Feasibility Program that facilitates the development of new investigators into independent scientists
and encourages scientists in other fields to enter the field of diabetes research; and 4) National Enrichment
Program in which the VDRC serves as the coordinating and organizing center for the NIDDK Medical Student
Research Program which has allowed more than 1000 medical students from more than 140 US medical and
osteopathic schools to conduct diabetes-related research at one of 16 NIH-supported Diabetes Research
Centers. As part of its efforts to promote the next generation of scientists, the VDRC also enhances the efforts
of 6 diabetes-related training grants, four of which are supported/funded by NIDDK The NIH support for the
VDRC is greatly amplified by: 1) Vanderbilt’s sustained commitment to provide research space and additional
financial resources; 2) a diverse, comprehensive array of research core services at Vanderbilt, which allows
NIH funds to target unique, diabetes-related research cores; and 3) collaborative efforts with other NIH-funded
research Centers at Vanderbilt. The VDRC is evolving and dynamic, including additions to its investigator
base, expansion of VDRC research areas, expanded focus on clinical and translational research, realignment
and evolution of core support to provide unique, indispensable core services, and service as a national
resource for the diabetes research community."

Osteoporosis is a major problem in our aging population. While the pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis
has advanced substantially over the past 2 decades, treatment that can truly reduce the risks of fracture to
youthful levels remains elusive. Bone anabolic therapies (parathyroid hormone receptor agonists
teriparatide/abaloparatide and the anti-sclerostin antibody romosozumab) represent an important component of
our therapeutic armamentarium for this common, costly, serious, and debilitating disease. Without an
optimized ability to stimulate bone formation, cure of osteoporosis for many patients with severe disease will
not be achieved. Notably, the anabolic efficacy of our currently-used agents wanes over time for unknown
reasons. The goal of the CORT is to elucidate mechanisms of action of osteoporosis anabolic therapies, and to
understand why they stop working. In doing so, the CORT will accelerate translation of knowledge to improve
our understanding of osteoporosis pathobiology. To achieve this goal, the overall focus of the CORT is to
define the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of currently-used osteoporosis anabolic agents in
humans. A highly-collaborative, multi-disciplinary, international network of investigators based at several
Harvard Medical School-based institutions and Imperial College London have come together to tackle this
challenge. In Project 1, investigators will define the effects of romosozumab and teriparatide on skeletal stem
cells including osteoblast progenitors using flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing, and histopathology.
Studies will be performed using samples from patients receiving anabolic therapy and in complementary
genetically-modified mouse models where lineage tracing and single cell RNA sequencing can be combined. In
Project 2, investigators will define the effects of romosozumab and teriparatide on osteocytes. Based on
preliminary data, osteocytes can directly regulate bone matrix formation and remodeling, leading to the exciting
hypothesis, tested here in human and mouse samples that anabolic agents impact cortical bone via direct
effects on osteocytic perilacunar remodeling. Projects 1 and 2 will be supported by a highly innovative
Bioinformatics Core that will incorporate cross-species transcriptomics datasets with available human and
mouse genetics in order to develop novel hypotheses, also tested here, regarding genes and gene network
that mediate bone anabolic responses. CORT efforts will be further enhanced by the complementary
experience of investigators in osteoporosis clinical research, bone biomechanics, bone stem cell biology,
osteocyte biology, bone marrow microenvironment investigation, statistical genetics, osteoporosis
epidemiology, and genetic origins of bone disease."

the Administrative Core will support the scientific goals of the CORT via coordinating
management across projects, supporting a pilot award program, supporting patient recruitment
efforts, and facilitating scientific and regulatory reporting. Second, the Administrative Core will
provide infrastructure and timely support to ‘unburden’ CORT investigators by coordinating
teleconferencing, meeting planning, travel arrangements, and performing post-award grants

dissemination of CORT scientific activities with the broader academic skeletal biology and
osteoporosis research communities. These efforts will rely on integration with existing
dissemination networks for translational science, a Visiting Professor series, and developing a
robust series of platforms to publicize the CORT mission. The Administrative Core leadership
structure will involve a director and associate director with appropriate expertise in fundamental,
translational, and clinical skeletal biology research, with support from an appropriately-selected
External Advisory Committee panel. In sum, the Administrative Core represent an integral
component needed for the success of this collaborative, multi-disciplinary, inter-institutional
translational research program."
10904706,"PROJECT SUMMARY
From bacteria to humans, organisms modulate their food intake and energy expenditure in accordance with their
internal nutrient state, allowing them to maintain a healthy energy balance. During evolution, conserved
homeostatic mechanisms developed to cope with potential nutrient deprivation from a fluctuating food supply.
Hence, when food is plentiful, excess energy is stored as fat reserves and mobilized during future scarcity.
However, in the 21st-century nutritional scarcity is the exception rather than the norm, resulting in an increasing
prevalence of obesity in humans. Obesity impacts cancer progression, accelerates aging, compromises
immunity, and impedes a healthy lifestyle. We posited that understanding mechanisms and molecules at the
interface of opposing nutrient states — scarcity and surplus — will reveal processes that control critical metabolic
outcomes. Furthermore, we proposed that certain proteins function as molecular switches to control processes
that allow an organism to operate in both states efficiently. We further surmised that chronic nutrient surplus
impairs the capacity of the ‘molecular switch’ proteins to efficiently alternate in response to the nutritional state,
resulting in energy imbalance. Once we identified such proteins, we determined to use them as an entry point to
identify cellular mechanisms critical to healthy energy balance. To this end, we investigated one process: how
do fat cells retain or release fat hormones – called adipokines— that serve as systemic nutrient surplus signals?
Our investigations led to identifying one critical molecular switch, which is recognized as playing a role in
membrane fusion events in previous studies. However, unexpectedly, we identified that this protein controls
nutrient-state-dependent adipokine intracellular localization and gene expression. Therefore, we have uncovered
a molecular switch mechanism that controls unanticipated cellular processes at the intersection of scarcity and
surplus. The cellular processes that we have uncovered represent strategic avenues to treat and manage
complex metabolic disorders. Hence, we propose to elucidate the following: i) define the molecular pathway by
which this molecular switch protein controls nucleocytoplasmic localization and gene expression; ii) understand
how diet-induced obesity disrupts this regulation, and iii) map consequences of this cell-intrinsic mechanism to
organism-level metabolic outcomes and behaviors. We will use fruit flies for short to medium-term goals, as we
have established a robust physiological Drosophila surplus model that mimics the diseased state. We will test
conservations of these findings in mammalian systems in the future. In summary, our goal is to address
outstanding issues in energy physiology by adopting a comprehensive and conceptually novel approach in a
highly tractable model."

10618397,"PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired neurologic disability in
children; yet, no effective therapies exist. Secondary injury from inflammation increases neurologic disability
from damage after impact. Microglia (the brain's resident immune cells) mediate inflammatory release of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytotoxic factors early after TBI. Microglia that become reparatory remove
debris by phagocytosis and resolve inflammation. The immature brain is highly vulnerable to secondary injury
due to its low antioxidant reserve and vigorous inflammatory response. Agents that move microglia away from
inflammatory towards reparatory activity may decrease neurologic disability after TBI, particularly in children.
Docosahexaenoic Acid, or DHA, is a candidate therapy for childhood TBI. DHA is a fatty acid essential for
normal brain growth and function that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In rats, DHA restores
brain DHA losses after TBI. In cultured microglia, DHA promotes reparatory activity. Using our pediatric TBI
model, controlled cortical impact (CCI) in male 17-day old (P17) rats, DHA diet before CCI reduced learning
deficits (Morris Water Maze, MWM) brain lesion volume and white matter injury (histology and MRI, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging). We also showed that DHA given after CCI improved rat pup outcomes. Intraperitoneal
(IP) DHA at 30 minutes after CCI, followed by up to 60 days of DHA diet, decreased ROS, microglial
inflammatory genes at post injury day 7(PID7) and memory dysfunction (Novel Object Recognition, NOR).
Whether DHA affects brain inflammatory markers in female pups, or if DHA affects microglial activity (ROS
production and phagocytosis) after TBI in either sex, is unknown. Similarly, whether delayed (later than 30 min
after CCI) or short (7-day course) DHA will retain acute and chronic neuroprotection, is not known. Finally, little
is known about how DHA may modulate microglial activation after TBI. We hypothesize that either DHA at 30
min or 3h after CCI will decrease PID7 microglial inflammation in males and that only long term DHA will
improve PID45-60 outcomes in both sexes. We hypothesize that DHA will decrease PID7 inflammation
associated with decreased TLR4 and activated STAT1 proteins on cell membranes and caspase activity. We
will use male and female P17 rat pups and CCI or sham surgery. We will compare onset of DHA (30 min or 3h)
and duration (7 days to 60 days) to control. During week 1 after CCI, we will use cell membrane assays, tissue
and microglial protein markers, and microglial activity to assess inflammation. From PID 45 to 60 we will use
NOR/ MWM testing, histology and MRI for functional, anatomic and inflammatory outcomes. This proposal is
significant because it focuses on the immature brain after severe TBI, a devastating condition for which no
effective therapies exist. It will yield new knowledge on the effects of sex and DHA on microglial function after
TBI and on optimal DHA initiation and duration timing. Results will enable future clinical trials of DHA with the
potential to decrease the burden of pediatric acquired neurologic injury after TBI."

The COBRE CMADP was created in July 2012 to encourage basic research scientists to develop and implement
new enabling technologies for the study of biological pathways and applied processes related to disease. Over
the past nine years, CMADP investigators have pursued health-related research related to the molecular analysis
of disease pathways. We have supported 24 junior faculty to date through research support and mentoring. The
18 faculty that have graduated from the program thus far have generated over $38.5 million in external funding.
We also established three new Core Laboratories focused on enabling technologies for the study of disease: the
Genome Sequencing Core, the Synthetic Chemical Biology Core and the KU Nanofabrication Facility (formerly
the Microfabrication & Microfluidics Core). These three Cores brought new and essential enabling technologies
to KU, allowing us to attract high-quality biomedical researchers and faculty to Kansas. As a result, CMADP
strengthened both the human and the physical resources for biomedical research in the state. This application
requests five years of funding for Phase 3 of our COBRE Center to pursue the following objectives: (1) to continue
growing a critical mass of new and continuing investigators focused on the very broad theme of molecular
analysis of disease pathways, (2) to continue a successful program of COBRE Pilot Project grants that utilize
our Core Labs, and (3) to strengthen our existing Core Labs by expanding their capabilities and user bases,
working with the KU Office of Research to position them for long-term sustainability based on a combination of
fees generated plus a base of support from the University. The result will be a very strong cadre of successful
mid-career biomedical research faculty and self-sustaining Core Labs that support research in molecular analysis
of disease pathways statewide. We strongly believe that the overall impact of CMADP on biomedical research
at KU and the state of Kansas will thus be substantial and enduring."

a meaningful impact on the global epidemic. SEA-TRAC will operate from three world class institutions in Seattle:
The University of Washington (UW), Seattle Children’s Research Institute, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center. We will leverage close partnerships with local non-academic entities, such as the Institute for
Systems Biology, Public Health Seattle King County, and PATH as well as international partners, such as the
Kenya Medical Research Institute. The Administrative Core will lead SEA-TRAC and assume responsibility for
strategic planning and operational management as well as promoting an environment to foster dialogue that will
lead to new collaborations and funding applications. The heart of SEA-TRAC will be the Development Core,
which will oversee several new educational, training, and grant programs designed to foster career development
of junior or senior investigators that are new to TB research. The Clinical and Translational Science Core will
lead training and consulting in clinical research methodology and foster collaborative research with our
international partners. The Basic Science Core will provide training for scientists new to working in the Biosafety
Level 3 (BSL3) environment and lead training and consulting in advanced microbiology and immunology
methods. Finally, the Data Sciences Core will leverage our local strengths in Biostatistics, Computational
Biology, and Modeling to host community building events, such as TB ‘hackweeks,’ provide training to scientists
that are new to data science, and offer consulting services for advanced research questions. Our Leadership
Team is composed of faculty with a demonstrated commitment to training and mentorship that represent the
diversity of scientific interests, tenure stage, gender, and ethnicity of our research community. We have secured
institutional commitments totaling $861,420 or 29% of total direct costs that will allow us to support a diverse
suite of programs immediately upon funding. SEA-TRAC will build on the strong foundation that has been
established over the last five years by the UW Tuberculosis Research & Training Center (TRTC) to nucleate,
strengthen, and expand the impact of our research. By the end of the funding period, we expect that SEA-TRAC
will have achieved several quantifiable objectives and established itself as a flagship TRAC program, leading
new initiatives through interactions with other TRACs and the NIH."

loss of podocytes. This is a cause of a kidney disease known as Focal segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Despite the growing prevalence of kidney diseases, there are
currently no FDA approved therapies to prevent the loss of podocytes. The goal of this grant
application is to gain a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in podocyte
injury related to the BRAF signaling pathway, so that it may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.
We started with a rare genetic kidney disease caused by mutations in an enzyme called PDSS2.
Interestingly, we found that the loss of function of this enzyme causes podocytes to die, resulting
in FSGS. We subsequently found that a key molecule in preventing podocyte death is BRAF and
a small molecule that activates BRAF, called GDC-0879, can protect podocytes from cell death.
In fact, GDC-0879 was able to protect podocytes from several injuries including toxic lipids and
other stress-causing molecules. Most excitingly, we now have evidence that GDC-0879 protects
mice from podocyte injury and the resulting kidney filter damage (called proteinuria). Here, we will
explore the precise molecular mechanisms involved in BRAF-related podocyte injury, and the
potential for GDC-0879 to become a treatment for FSGS.
Successful completion of this work may provide a new, much needed treatment for FSGS and
chronic kidney diseases, and one that may be easily brought to the clinic, since GDC-0879 is
already an FDA approved drug for other indications."
10840778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies, and its incidence has strikingly
increased 6-8 fold in Western countries (including the United States, UK and several European countries) over
the past 4 decades. Despite new insights gained from recent genomic analyses, meaningful therapeutic
improvements have not occurred and the 5-year survival of EAC has remained extremely low (~20%). Therefore,
alternative research approaches, including advanced epigenomic studies, are desperately needed to understand
the molecular basis of EAC for developing novel treatment regimens. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a premalignant
condition and is considered as the obligate precursor lesion of EAC. During Barrett’s esophagus-associated
neoplastic evolution, benign BE first becomes dysplastic and then progresses to EAC. Therefore, BE serves as
an ideal pre-malignant model for the investigation of the step-wise neoplastic evolution of esophageal epithelial
cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms promoting BEAN remains limited, with key
questions (e.g., the primary drivers for the malignant transformation of BE into EAC) still unaddressed.
 We and others have shown that malignant transformation is accompanied by genome-wide gains and losses
of enhancers and super-enhancers, which are occupied and regulated by upstream master regulator
transcription factors (MRTFs). Indeed, our recent studies demonstrated profound alterations in both enhancer
usage and MRTF activity between normal gastroesophageal junction (NGEJ), BE and EAC samples. Particularly,
we have identified a set of EAC-specific MRTFs (ELF3, KLF5, GATA6, EHF). Pilot experiments have shown that
these 4 MRTFs co-occupy hundreds of EAC-specific enhancers and super-enhancers, indicating they may
regulate the EAC transcriptome. Moreover, these EAC-specific MRTFs are highly and uniquely expressed in
EAC compared with normal GEJ or BE samples and are functionally required for EAC cell proliferation.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that EAC-specific MRTFs directly promote the malignant
transformation of BE cells by rewiring enhancers and super-enhancers across the epigenome, activating
signaling pathways and cellular processes essential for EAC development. We will test this hypothesis by
investigating the biological functions of MRTFs in human BE-derived 3D organoids. In addition, we will study the
mechanistic basis of the strong association between obesity and EAC by focusing on the regulatory loop of
MRTF and fatty-acid synthesis, which is the key downstream pathway identified by our preliminary data. These
investigations promise to establish primary driving forces of BE-associated neoplasia evolution and uncover
epigenomic mechanisms underlying esophagus transformation, which will fundamentally transform our insights
into the biology of esophageal cancer. More importantly, successful execution of this proposal may identify
potential avenue for the prevention and early intervention of EAC by targeting fatty-acid synthesis pathway in
the high-risk individuals (e.g., refractory and/or high-grade BE patients) with obese condition."
10612963,"ABSTRACT
The main objective of the proposed research is to examine, for the first time, intergenerational transmission of
human brain networks using a natural cross-fostering design. We take reading-related brain networks, in
particular those related to phonological and orthographic processing (as well as in language- and more
preliminarily in math-related processes), as model systems because of the potentially differential impact of
genetic and environmental factors on these networks and corresponding behavioral phenotypes. In addition,
impairment of these neurocognitive processes is associated with specific learning disorder of word reading
(aka decoding-based reading disorder [RD] or developmental dyslexia) that has a lifetime prevalence of 5-
10%, and an increased risk of the offspring developing RD by 4 to 8 times the general population with an
immediate family member with RD. The proposed natural cross-fostering design addresses a critical question
about the mechanisms of intergenerational effects, i.e., whether they are genetic (G), prenatal (PreE) or
postnatal environmental (PostE) in origin. This is only now possible with the widespread availability of in-vitro
fertilization (IVF). We will obtain cognitive measures, and functional and structural MRI, in healthy families
(triads) at a pace of 30 families per site per year. We will examine parent-offspring correlations, including brain-
brain correlations, across four groups of IVF children that receive distinctive G/PreE/PostE contributions from
their rearing parents as well as a fifth group of naturally conceived children (N=60 triads per group, with
children of ages 8-11, half with daughters and the other half with sons): (1) the HOMOLOGOUS group in which
offspring conceived through IVF are borne and reared by their genetic parents, thus being exposed to maternal
and paternal G/PreE/PostE influences; (2) the DONOR EGG and (3) DONOR SPERM groups, in which
offspring are conceived from donor eggs/sperm, and hence rearing mothers/fathers only have PreE/PostE, not
G, influence on their offspring; (4) the gestational SURROGACY group in which offspring are borne through
non-genetic, non-rearing mothers, and hence rearing parents only have G/PostE but no PreE influences over
their offspring; and (5) the NATURAL conception group in which naturally conceived offspring are borne and
reared by their genetic parents, thus being exposed to maternal and paternal G/PreE/PostE influences and
without the influence of IVF. Fathers’ PreE influence is typically considered minimal. The specific aims of the
proposal are: to examine parent-offspring (dyad) correlations, to examine the extent to which environmental and
genetic factors contribute to shared variance in reading- and language-related cognitive and neurobiological
processes, to examine parent-of-origin effects, and to dissociate G, PreE and PostE influences. A successful
outcome will establish a new paradigm for studying genetic and environmental influences on brain networks,
and ultimately provide us with important information about risk/protective factors, windows of opportunity to
intervene, and development of early intervention and preventive strategies of RD."

10887390,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trauma is the leading cause of death for children and adults 46 years and younger, killing more Americans
than AIDS and stroke combined. African Americans (OR 1.2, P<0.001), people living in high poverty
neighborhoods (OR 1.01, P<0.001), and those enrolled in public health insurance programs (OR 1.53,
P<0.001) have increased mortality after trauma when compared to their injured counterparts. Quantifying
the equity in access to Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and designated/verified trauma centers (TCs), as
well as the extent to which timely access to care improves health outcomes are critical first steps to address
this alarming discrepancy. Equitable availability to EMS has yet to be evaluated and equitable access to TCs is
understudied. In fact, no one has explored the importance of expeditious availability to emergency health care
services such as EMS and timely access to emergent trauma care as key social determinants of health
(SDOH). Models to evaluate the role of SDOH as major predictors of these disparities remain untested. Rapid
transport to a TC is associated with a 25% reduction in mortality; however, nearly 45 million Americans lack
timely access to a verified TC. When compared to white populations, recent data show racial/ethnic minority
populations have significantly less access to TC and worse outcomes following trauma. Understanding
the factors that determine trauma-related socio-spatial disparities can inform interventions at both the policy
and system levels to mitigate the disproportionately large numbers of deaths experienced by minoritized
populations. Thus, there is a compelling need for research in these areas to facilitate targeted interventions to
eliminate socio-spatial disparities within the pre-hospital phase of the emergency trauma care system to
improve patient outcomes. To evaluate socio-spatial disparities in availability and access to both EMS and to
TCs among critically injured trauma patients, we will apply the Health Equity Measurable Framework (HEMF)
to the pre-hospital phase of the emergency trauma care system (availability to EMS, EMS response time,
EMS scene time, EMS transportation time, EMS decision to transport to TCs vs. non-TCs, and EMS total
prehospital time) and use large national databases to develop spatiotemporal models to assess drivers of
disparities in traumatic injuries. HEMF will be particularly well suited for our proposed study because it is
designed to describe SDOH in a causal framework to guide the quantitative analysis of health equity for
ongoing pre-hospital trauma care surveillance of the critically injured and subsequent policy development. Our
interdisciplinary team will use data science methods and novel analytics to address this critical public health
need by identifying health disparities at the level of the pre-hospital emergency trauma care system."
10793496,"Summary/Abstract
There are currently limited treatment options for improving endothelial dysfunction in vascular diseases such as
sepsis, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction results in endothelial cell activation,
disruption of endothelial barrier function and sensitivity to apoptosis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
delineate the pathways by which the endothelium can resist injury and disruption to facilitate the advancement
of new targets for therapeutic development. Activated protein C (APC) is a promising therapeutic and exhibits
multiple beneficial effects including stabilization of endothelial barriers and anti-apoptotic activities. Protease-
activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is the central mediator of APC cellular
signaling, which requires caveolin-1 (Cav1) and compartmentalization in caveolae. We discovered that APC-
activated PAR1 signals primarily through b-arrestin-2 (b-arr2) to promote endothelial barrier protection, and not
heterotrimeric G proteins like thrombin (Th)-activated PAR1. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop
a mechanistic understanding of how APC/PAR1 generates b-arr2 transducer bias to promote endothelial
cytoprotection. We hypothesize that distinct GRK5 determinants and co-receptors facilitate APC/PAR1-induced
b-arr2 transducer bias to promote endothelial cytoprotection through pathways enabled by Cav1
phosphorylation. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1: To delineate the mechanisms that enable GRK5 to
distinctly regulate APC- vs. Th-induced biased signaling. GRK5 is required for APC-stimulated signaling and
desensitization of Th-induced signaling. However, the mechanisms that enable distinct GRK5 functions is not
known. We will determine if distinct GRK5 functions are regulated by localization to discrete plasma membrane
microdomains such as caveolae using human cultured endothelial cells, a native system that permits the study
of endogenous PAR1 and GRK5 and HEK293 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells. Aim 2: To determine the
mechanisms by which APC vs. thrombin control b-arrestin transducer bias. It is not known how b-arrestin
transducer bias (signaling vs. desensitization) is induced by APC- vs. Th-activated PAR1 nor how APC/PAR1
promotes two distinct b-arr2-mediated cytoprotective signaling pathways: dishevelled2 (Dvl2)-Rac1 controls
endothelial barrier protection whereas sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)-Akt regulates anti-apoptotic activities. We
will determine if distinct determinants of b-arrestin and GPCR co-receptors control different b-arr2 binding modes
and functions induced by APC vs. thrombin. Aim 3: To define the mechanisms by which APC/PAR1 regulates
Cav1 function to promote cytoprotection. APC/PAR1 stimulates Cav1 phosphorylation but how this modulates
Cav1 function and is integrated into the cytoprotective pathway is not known and will be determined. The
proposed research is innovative because it will test novel hypotheses to explain how GRK5, b-arr2 and Cav1
drive APC/PAR1 endothelial cytoprotective responses in a physiologically relevant context and will help advance
the status of new targets as a future therapeutics for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction."
10782996,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for around 85% of all lung cancer. The
5-
year survival rate is about
14% for stage IIIA NSCLC, while it is about
5% for stage IIIB. However, once
NSCLC has reached to the stage IV
and metastasized to different places, it is very difficult to treat. The
5-
year survival rate for stage IV
NSCLC is
just about 1%. Targeted therapy such as anti-EGFR or anti-ALK is the frontline treatment for advanced NSCLC
with EGFR or ALK mutations, while platinum-based chemotherapy is the first line treatment for advanced
NSCLC without targetable mutations. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy
is a new and effective strategy for advanced NSCLC. While NSCLC patients initially show great benefit from these
treatments, the response is only transient with relatively short duration likely due to acquiring resistant
mechanisms. Identification of novel and effective therapeutic strategies is therefore an urgent need for advanced
NSCLC with metastasis. A small cell population with CSC properties contributes to cancer initiation, progression
and metastasis as well as drug resistance in various cancers such as NSCLC, but an effective strategy to eliminate
CSCs is currently lacking, representing an unmet clinical need for CSC and NSCLC targeting. While CSCs possess
immune escape properties, it is unclear how non-CSC cancer cells accounting for the majority of total cancer cell
populations could also resist from immune cell attack. The goal of this study is to characterize a novel and unique
CSC population in NSCLC and its regulatory mechanisms that can be harnessed for developing a novel effective
strategy for advanced NSCLC and/or for overcoming the resistance to current standard of care. Our study
identifies a novel druggable regulator localized in cell membrane for maintaining CSCs, cancer progression and
metastasis of NSCLCs and its overexpression predicts poor survival outcome NSCLC patients. Genetically or
pharmacologically targeting this newly identified regulator attenuates oncogenic signal for maintain CSC
properties and immune escape leading to cancer progression and metastasis of NSCLC. We hypothesized that a
unique cell population with CSC properties existed in cancer can transmit an oncogenic and immune escape
signal to non-CSC cancer cells, thereby endowing bulk cancer cells with immune escape properties. We proposed
three specific aims, which are highly supported by our innovative preliminary results, to further characterize the
roles and underlying mechanisms of this novel regulator and its ligand as well as their targeting in regulating
CSCs, progression and metastasis of NSCLC. Our proposal is highly original and significant, as we have proposed
a breakthrough concept, identified a novel checkpoint blocker with CSC and immune escape properties and
utilized cutting technologies including unbiased transcriptomics, Cas9/CRISPR editing, patient-derived
organoids, patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, and humanized mice and genetic knockin mouse models
with intact immunity to validate our provocative hypothesis and concept. Our study has revolutionized and
significantly advanced our understanding of CSC and cancer-immune regulation, but also offers a new paradigm
and strategy for targeting advanced NSCLC."

 This application proposes to collect, process, and disseminate data in the 2021 and 2023 waves of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative
sample of U.S. families that was begun in 1968. A cornerstone of the nation's social science research
infrastructure, PSID has collected 41 waves of data over more than 50 years on original families and their
descendants. Its long-term measures of economic and social wellbeing allow study of the dynamics of social
and behavioral processes and how they interact with health over the life course. Its design of following children
of sample members when they become economically independent supports study of the intergenerational
transmission of socioeconomic circumstances and health. Nearly 6,000 publications over its 50-plus year
history attest to the PSID's broad scientific reach. This project will collect, process, and distribute data on
health, wealth, and time use for nearly 11,000 families in PSID's 2021 and 2023 waves and collect saliva
samples to support multi-generational genomic analysis. Specifically, the project will: 1. Collect health, wealth
and time use data in the core PSID 2021 and 2023 waves; 2. Collect and store saliva samples from adults in
PSID 2021 in order to obtain DNA from three generations of the same families (in conjunction with PSID's
Child Development Supplement saliva collection); and 3. Process and distribute core files; create life course
and family context files including a new harmonized PSID Social, Health, and Economic Longitudinal File
(SHELF) and extended files on family relationships and complexity; and provide user support and training.
After collection, survey data will be processed and distributed via PSID's Online Data Center, which allows
users to create customized extracts and codebooks. Sensitive data will be made available to qualified users
under contract with the University of Michigan. Saliva samples will be stored for genotyping in the ISR
Biospecimen Lab. With the proposed aims, PSID is poised to accelerate the study of life course and multi-
generational influences on health in middle and late life in a genealogical context."

Overall
The overall goal of the UCLA/UCSD Acne Center for Research Translation (Acne CORT) is to bring together
scientists with expertise in different aspects of microbiology, lipid metabolism and immunology to engage in
translational research to study the interaction between the microbiota, lipid metabolism and the host immune
response in acne. Cutibacterium acnes is the dominant bacterium of the pilosebaceous unit (PSebU), the initial
site where acne lesions develop, and is considered to be one of the key contributing factors in the
pathogenesis of acne. The UCLA/UCSD Research Project is based on our recent findings using
transcriptomics, metagenomics and lipidomics, establishing the goal to link together these diverse biologic
responses into a model that may explain the pathogenesis of acne. The UCLA/UCSD Research Project
(Modlin, Gallo), “Acne: a disease of lipid metabolism, microbiome and the immune response”, will initially focus
studies on the role of TREM2 macrophages and adipogenic fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of acne. Our
preliminary data using from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial-sequencing identified these
two cell populations as over-represented in acne lesions, with gene programs reflecting their link to altered lipid
metabolism. The project investigators will obtain acne biopsy specimens (Hata, Kim), then address the link
between the immune response in acne lesions to the microbiome and lipid metabolism. The Research Project
will be supported by a UCLA Bioinformatics Core (Pellegrini, Yang) to analyze scRNA-seq and spatial-seq of
acne lesions, a UCSD Microbiology and Metagenomics Core (Gallo, O'Neill) to isolate and characterize C.
acnes strains, and lipidomics analysis (Bensinger, UCLA) of biopsy specimens and key cell types derived in
vitro. Ultimately, the Bioinformatics Core will use mergeomics to combine data from transcriptomics,
metagenomics and lipidomics to create a network model of the pathogenesis of acne. The Administrative Core
will facilitate research interactions between the projects with: i) research seminars, an Enrichment Program
and Advisory Board meeting; ii) a Pilot and Feasibility Project Program to extend the research base; and, iii)
plans to utilize the resources and environment at UCLA/UCSD including core facilities, the UCLA and UCSD
Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program Centers as well as the mentoring programs for
medical and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, dermatology trainees and junior faculty. The proposed
studies will provide new insights into how lipid metabolism and the skin microbiome shape cutaneous immune
responses contributing to inflammation, with the potential for intervention in skin disease."

Scientist in the COIN. Her long-term professional goal is to grow her career as an independent VA health
services researcher who applies a diverse array of methods to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of
mental health and family service delivery systems. The short-term objective of this application is to describe
and strengthen Veteran and family determinants of mental health service utilization.
The proposed CDA research seeks to address scientific gaps related to the low use of psychotherapy
among Veterans with PTSD: Aim 1a— Identify Veteran and family determinants that predict initiation and
completion of psycho-therapy for PTSD; Aim 1b— Explore mechanisms linking enabling resources,
[treatment preparedness], and initiation and completion of PTSD psychotherapy; Aim 2— Refine and test
the feasibility of a family-involved treatment preparedness intervention to increase initiation and completion
of EBP psychotherapy for PTSD; Aim 3— Analyze whether use of VA supportive services predicts initiation
and completion of PTSD psychotherapy by strengthening economic enabling resources.
This application is highly innovative and will advance clinical practice by contributing evidence about 1) the
role of complex Veteran and family risk factors that inhibit PTSD treatment use and 2) promising, strategies
to strengthen these factors, including a family-involved treatment preparedness intervention and VA
education and vocational rehabilitation services to increase uptake of PTSD evidenced-based practices
(EBPs).21 This project is consistent with VA priorities, such as increased access to care and uptake of
EBPs.
The research proposed in Aim 1 will employ novel machine learning causal forest methods93 to Caregiver
Support Program survey data and VA administrative data to identify Veteran and family predisposing,
enabling, and need factors and elucidate how enabling resources (i.e. perceived financial strain, income,
education level, family strain) moderate the association between need for treatment and use/completion of
psychotherapy. Subsequent qualitative interviews with Veterans and family members will seek to identify
the underlying mechanisms between Veteran/family determinants and service use. The goal of Aim 2 is to
refine and test the feasibility and acceptability of an existing family engagement strategy74 using a
successive cohort design (SCD) among Veterans who were referred to EBP psychotherapy for PTSD. For
Aim 3, VHSC, Veteran Benefits Administration, and Caregiver Support Program data will be combined to
examine the effect of VA supportive service use on time to use/completion of psychotherapy treatment
using Cox proportional hazard models; sequential stratified matching will be applied to minimize baseline
differences between treatment groups. By the end of the 3rd year of CDA funding, a merit award application
will be submitted to fund a randomized trial of the Aim 2 intervention.

through recruitment of other immune components and interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME). To
that end, Core C will provide seamless sample processing and state-of-the-art assays to best inform the projects

Translational Therapy Laboratory, an NCI funded Cancer Center Support Grant shared resource, with a number
of novel techniques to gain deep understanding of NK cell biology, the immune landscape influencing and
resulting from NK cell intervention, and the tumor microenvironment the NK cell interventions must operate in.
Mass cytometry, CyTOF, will be used to phenotypically evaluate NK cells and immune reconstitution at a high
level of detail. The CODEX platform will be leveraged to maximize histologic analysis of the TME, and a variety
of flow cytometric and imaging-based assays will be used to determine NK cell function prior to and after patient
treatment. Assays will be carried out equally across all projects to determine differences in pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic profiles of each of the products so they can be fairly compared to each other and inform
project leaders on how to best implement NK cell immunotherapeutic interventions. Uniform, high-quality data
generated in these studies will be integrated with clinical outcomes, in collaboration with Cores A and B, and
will be made available to all of the projects in order to maximize synergy and limit variation generated by having
different laboratories carry out assays for individual projects."

The Administrative Core represents an important component of the University of Colorado's 
Population Center (CUPC) proposal in response to RFA-HD-20-015 for the Population 
Dynamics Research Infrastructure Program FY 2020 (P2C). CUPC requests renewal of 
infrastructure support for the five-year project period 2020–2025. The Administrative Core is 
CUPC's backbone, operating in the background to enable affiliates to focus squarely on their 
population science research. 
The Administrative Core is staffed by a director, program manager and grant specialist, with 
additional support from a university-funded Graduate Research Assistant and an undergraduate 
student supported by the Institute of Behavioral Science. Changes in the core are responsive to 
CUPC's growth, most notably in the last five years with affiliates engaging in increasingly 
complex, problem-driven projects. An important change is the elimination of the associate 
director (AD) position, thereby yielding salary savings. In lieu of the AD, the Development Core 
has been restructured with five faculty leads for primary research areas as well as a speaker 
series faculty coordinator. Since these new positions will also be on CUPC's Executive 
Committee, these changes will increase faculty engagement with the Center and broaden 
faculty participation in governance. 
Combined with these salary savings, generous new university investments in CUPC provide the 
opportunity to employ a full-time manager, a necessity given the additional activities taking 
place in the Development Core – which is supported by the Administrative Core. New activities 
include a grant writing workshop, PRA working groups, additional speakers, and additional mini- 
conferences and workshops. 
The other P2C-supported Administrative Core staff member will be CUPC's grant specialist who 
provides personalized support with an emphasis on funding agencies and programs of particular 
relevance to population research. This specialized grant support has been deemed essential 
since CUPC's inception in 2005 and has provided important value-added. 
Finally, CUPC benefits substantially from being embedded in IBS which has a deep pool of 
efficiently-administered resources. Such efficiencies include CUPC's ability to benefit from IBS's 
faculty lines, space, and administrative resources such as post-award support."

PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Development Core represents an important component of the University of Colorado’s 
Population Center (CUPC) proposal in response to RFA-HD-20-015 for the Population 
Dynamics Research Infrastructure Program FY 2020 (P2C). CUPC requests renewal of 
infrastructure support for the five-year project period 2020–2025. Fueled by NICHD funds, the 
Center is firmly established as the hub of population science at CU and CUPC’s Development 
Core has been redesigned to build on CUPC’s strong momentum. 
In the next five years, the Development Core has three specific aims: (1) increase the scientific 
impact, innovation, and productivity of CUPC's population researchers; (2) increase CUPC 
affiliate's competitiveness for external funding in population science; and (3) continue and 
increase support for early investigators in population science. A variety of new and reconfigured 
activities are proposed to meet these aims. To enhance productivity and innovation, as well as 
to increase cohesiveness within primary research areas, in the past five years, thematic working 
groups have been established with faculty leads. These groups have had notable success in 
spurring new research collaborations and in the next grant cycle, resources are requested to 
support innovative activities within the working groups. Also, to increase external funding 
competitiveness, CUPC will develop a grant writing workshop to build on the already-impressive 
success of the Center’s energetic, early stage investigators. Finally, substantial new investment 
from CU Boulder provides resources to raise the funding on seed grants and increase the pool 
of available funds. Throughout, the CUPC director and Development Core director collaborate 
to ensure that early stage investigators are centrally considered within investments with a target 
of this group receiving at least 50% of seed grants in the next five years. 
Faculty accomplishments have been recognized at the university scale as evidenced by 
generous, new support from across the Boulder campus. A formalized Memorandum of 
Understanding with CU Denver expands the Center with new funding, space and collaborative 
commitment. These combine to lay a foundation for CUPC’s continued growth in productivity, 
innovation and impact and the Development Core has been redesigned to support the Center in 
this growth."
10854717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Older smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-related disease, particularly lung cancer, and
smoking prevalence among older smokers has not declined as steeply as that of younger smokers. The
majority of risk results from the chronic inhalation of combusted cigarette (CC) smoke. However, older smokers
are often more unwilling or unable to quit smoking than younger smokers, which suggests that they might
benefit from switching to potentially less harmful nicotine products. Recent studies, as well as statements from
the FDA, suggest that electronic cigarettes (ECs), may be less harmful than CCs. However, it is unknown how
ECs would be used in this population, in a real-world setting, and whether or not such use would provide a
safer alternative to CC smoking. This project will evaluate changes in product use, acceptability, reinforcement,
symptoms of nicotine dependence, and biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolism in
smokers at high risk of lung cancer as they switch from CCs to ECs. Participants (n=330) will be smokers who
meet criteria for high risk of lung cancer, who are uninterested in quitting smoking, but who are interested
trying ECs and changing CC consumption. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 conditions, EC or
usual brand (UB) CC, for 6 months (26 weeks). Those assigned to the EC condition will sample and choose
from among 4 EC flavors. All participants will be strongly encouraged to quit CC smoking at the end of the
study if they have not already, and will be offered free standard treatment (NRT and counseling) in our clinic, if
interested. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To characterize the effects of switching from CCs to
ECs on product use, product acceptability, and reinforcement among adult daily CC smokers at high risk for
lung cancer; (2) To characterize the effects of switching from CCs to ECs on biomarkers of inflammation and
oxidative stress among adult daily CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer; (3) To characterize metabolomic
changes that result from switching from CCs to ECs among CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer; (4) To
characterize which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching from CCs to ECs among CC smokers
at high risk for lung cancer. This project is significant because it will inform regulatory science and public health
policy about the potential harms and benefits of switching from CCs to ECs in older adult smokers at greatest
risk for lung cancer who are uninterested in quitting CC smoking. This project is innovative because it will be
among the first to focus exclusively on this high risk group and to evaluate the harms and benefits the effect of
switching from CCs to ECs using a prospective clinical trial, that accesses the risks and benefits of switching
across multiple domains, including behavior, addiction, and health outcomes."
10757313,"Project Background: Ninety-seven percent of women and 77% of men internal medicine physicians in a
recent Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facility survey reported sexual harassment from patients. Staff may
cope with patient-perpetrated harassment by omitting elements of care, rushing clinical tasks, and distancing
from the patient emotionally and physically. Further, patient-perpetrated harassment is associated with
decreased staff well-being and increased burnout and turnover, which are in turn associated with decreased
quality of care, decreased patient satisfaction, and increased risk of medical errors. Secretary McDonough
recently vowed to end all forms of harassment and discrimination at VA, and the new Deborah Sampson Act
requires facilities to implement anti-harassment procedures. However, prior work indicates that VA lacks
systematic, evidence-based interventions for responding to patient harassment of staff that anticipate
harassment, stop the incident, communicate that harassment is unwelcome, facilitate incident reporting, and
support affected staff. The goal of this pilot project is to design a novel intervention to guide immediate post-
incident staff, clinic, and facility responses to patient-perpetrated sexual harassment of staff in primary care.
Significance/Impact: The resulting intervention will address ORD Strategic Priority 4: actively promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion by communicating that VA does not tolerate harassment based on social identity
characteristics. Additionally, it will contribute to HSR&D priority domain: Primary Care Practice and Complex
Chronic Disease Management by offering support related to patient-perpetrated harassment that can “improve
provider and staff morale,” improve staff-provider interactions, and increase quality of patient care.
Innovation: This pilot project leverages a unique opportunity to respond to unprecedented leadership and
policy support for interventions to address harassment at VA. The resulting intervention will fill a critical gap in
procedures grounded in empirical data for responding to patient-perpetrated harassment and supporting VA
staff, and will complement VA’s ongoing anti-harassment efforts. Our design process will be guided by an
innovative framework that will ensure that the intervention fits with VA priorities and stakeholder needs.
Specific Aims: The Specific Aims are to: 1) identify intervention components based on existing and ideal
practices for responding to patient-perpetrated harassment of staff; and 2) refine the post-incident intervention
through iterative stakeholder feedback.
Methodology: Guided by a Steering Committee of operations partners, VA leadership, and subject matter
experts, we will follow a step-based process of transcreation, i.e., co-designing interventions with stakeholders
to fit with local contexts from the outset. We will focus on primary care settings, which have established rates of
harassment and serve as the main port of entry into VA care. We will achieve Aim 1 by interviewing VA primary
care providers (e.g., physicians, medical trainees), supervisors (e.g., primary care chiefs, fellowship
preceptors), leaders (e.g., facility directors, fellowship directors), and other subject matter experts (e.g.,
ethicists, disruptive behavior committee members) (n = 30) to elicit current and desired staff, clinic, and facility
procedures for responding to patient harassment and supporting affected staff. We will achieve Aim 2 by a)
engaging an expert panel of Steering Committee members and Aim 1 staff participants (n = 12) in a modified
Delphi process to build consensus on importance and feasibility of intervention components identified in Aim 1;
and b) conducting interactive webinars with staff from Women’s Health Practice-Based Research Network sites
to assess likelihood of intervention adoption and potential adoption barriers.
Implementation/Next Steps: Following project completion, we will seek HSR&D funding to test the
intervention in an effectiveness-implementation trial, with the ultimate goals of adaptation to other clinical
settings and forms of patient-perpetrated bias (e.g., racial/ethnic discrimination) and dissemination."
10591576,"Suicide rates are rising in the US and more than a million Americans try to take their own lives each
year. Effective, brief, low-cost interventions for individuals who attempt suicide are essential to saving lives and
achieving the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. This proposal takes advantage of a time-
sensitive research opportunity to test the effectiveness of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program
(ASSIP), a manualized 3-session intervention for recent suicide attempt survivors that produced dramatic
reductions in suicide attempts in a efficacy trial–80% fewer reattempts and an average of 72% fewer hospital
days over 24 months in the intervention group compared to controls. Our research will now test its
effectiveness of in the US public mental health care system, examine theoretically grounded mechanisms, and
explore cost-effectiveness. ASSIP is currently being implemented by New York State in a Zero Suicide initiative
funded by SAMHSA. Consistent with NIMH Notice of Interest MH-17-031, our project leverages this federal
investment and a strong state partnership to conduct effectiveness research. Our project has three aims:
Aim 1. Effectiveness. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ASSIP in reducing
suicide reattempts in a community mental health setting in the U.S. To accomplish this aim we will conduct a
randomized controlled trial with 400 individuals referred from psychiatric inpatient and emergency services
following a suicide attempt. Participants will be randomized to receive either usual care + ASSIP (intervention
arm) or usual care only (control arm), and followed for assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.
Aim 2. Mechanism. The secondary aim of this study to examine the psychological mechanisms of ASSIP as
predicted by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide. We will conduct statistical analyses of a mediation model to
determine (a) whether ASSIP improves perceptions of low belonging and being a burden on others, and (b)
whether the effect of treatment on reductions in suicide re-attempts is mediated by these improvements.
Aim 3. Cost-Effectiveness. The exploratory aim of this study is to estimate, from the perspective of an
ASSIP provider, the incremental cost per suicide attempt averted by delivering ASSIP to supplement usual care
following a suicide attempt. We will gather pre-implementation accounting data, personnel time logs, and 12-
month medical record reports of emergency and inpatient psychiatric visits. We will use these data together
with effectiveness results to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). This time-sensitive study
builds effectiveness research into a federally-funded Zero Suicide grant to New York state, consistent with a
specific request from NIMH for such applications. If hypotheses are supported, the study will provide evidence
of a brief, practical, and novel therapy that reduces suicide reattempts in a real-world health setting.

10819509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Incarcerated people are one of the key populations at the center of the HIV epidemic in Zambia and sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) in general. The periods during and after incarceration likely represent times of significant HIV risk,
yet little is known about HIV infection vulnerability during these times or how best to provide incarcerated people
with HIV prevention services such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce HIV risk. To address these
knowledge gaps, we propose the Prison PrEP Values, Adherence, and Implementation in Lusaka (PreVAIL)
study. Our scientific premise is that providing effective combination prevention to incarcerated and justice-
involved populations requires understanding both temporal changes in their HIV risk and patterns of their PrEP
uptake, adherence, and persistence. The long-term goal of this work is to optimize the timing and delivery of
PrEP, as part of combination prevention, for justice-involved persons in Zambia. The objective of this R21 is to
characterize PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence, as well as HIV risk perceptions and behaviors, among
justice-involved persons during incarceration and transition to the community.
PreVAIL builds on a robust platform for corrections-health research and service delivery in Zambia. The TasP
study (Co-PI: Herce) was the first to assess universal test and treat for HIV for incarcerated people in SSA, the
NIH-funded CONTINUUM study (PI: Herce) was one of the first studies to follow incarcerated people after
release in SSA, and the CDC/PEPFAR-funded CIRKUITS project (PI: Claassen, Co-PI: Herce) is conducting
one of the first demonstrations of PrEP for justice-involved people in SSA.
In Aim 1 we will assess PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence, as well as HIV risk factors and
perception of HIV risk, among justice-involved people during incarceration and post-release. We will
prospectively enroll a cohort of 800 HIV-negative and PrEP-eligible incarcerated people at prison entry and offer
them oral PrEP. We will follow all cohort members for 12 months regardless of PrEP status, both during
incarceration and following release. Primary outcomes include PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence, as
well as HIV status, HIV risk behaviors and risk perception. PrEP adherence will be assessed through self-report
and a novel point-of-care urine tenofovir test.
In Aim 2, we will use qualitative research methods to explore and understand barriers and facilitators of
PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence during incarceration and after release. We will purposively
sample 40 participants from our cohort for theory-informed longitudinal in-depth interviews to understand multi-
level barriers and facilitators to efficacious PrEP use, as well as PrEP method and service delivery preferences.
This study will provide new insights into HIV risk for justice-involved people in Africa and quantify the magnitude
of the gap in HIV prevention service continuity, leading to a future, efficacious PrEP differentiated service delivery
model to support justice-involved people in Zambia during the period spanning incarceration and post-release."
10902080,"Abstract: OVERALL - Strengthening Indigenous Health and Science Research: NW NARCH Program
In response to the national NARCH programmatic objectives, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board
has established the NW NARCH to form a tribal-academic partnership for health research focused on
eliminating racial health disparities and will continue this partnership with this application. The NW tribal
communities represented by the Board have a long track record of coordinated efforts to improve their health
status. Our tribal-academic partnership will build a wide-reaching and multi-layered infrastructure to increase
the skills of AI/AN researchers, and address health problems of critical importance to the tribes regionally, as
well as those priority health issues of AI/ANs nationwide.
In this application, we have defined multiple aims in two training projects that are consistent with the
national NARCH programmatic emphasis. For our graduate and undergraduate support fellowship grant
(Project 1), our key aim is to support research training that is conducted in a scientifically rigorous training
program, in partnership with accredited programs locally and regionally, so that trainees will develop skills to
conduct population health sciences research and address health-related issues of major importance to tribal
people. For Project 2, we aim to reach further up ‘the pipeline’ and provide population sciences training and
hands-on research experiences for tribal high school seniors and juniors in an enrichment program that
includes hands-on, mentored research - and will continue to nurture them as they progress in academia. This
is a new area for our NARCH, but the Board, OHSU, and PSU faculty and consultants on this grant have vast
experience with this demographic group. The specific aims for each project are presented in detail in their
individual grant sections. These proposals are in exact alignment with the NIH Strategic Plan for Tribal Health
Research FY 2019-2023.
Impact: We have planned an exciting set of projects in collaboration with university partners at OHSU and
PSU, with Advisory Board members, and with highly qualified and experienced (mostly tribal) consultants. Our
plans build on strengths we developed in the first ten cycles of NARCH funding. We have made some
innovative changes for this round of applications and are pleased that our projects will include involvement of
AI/AN personnel in key roles—including former NARCH-funded students and fellows in key roles. Our
program leadership is experienced in AI/AN health research, our advisory committee is enthusiastic about
assisting our efforts, and our tribal communities are fully supportive of our plans. We predict that our program
will address some of the health disparities experienced by AI/AN communities, and that we will help bridge the
gap between academia and the tribal communities through our diverse activities."
10805354,"Talaromyces marneffei (Tm) is one of seven dimorphic human fungal pathogens that cause substantial
global morbidity and mortality in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Tm is
endemic throughout Southeast Asia where it is a leading cause of death with an on-treatment mortality
of 30% in people with advanced HIV disease. A critical barrier to reducing mortality is our inability to
make an early diagnosis. The disease is insidious, and early symptoms are non-specific. Diagnosis
relies on culturing the organism from clinical specimens which is only positive during advanced stage
of disease and takes up to 14 days to identify. Consequently many patients die before a culture
diagnosis is made. This project aims to reduce Tm mortality by introducing a novel sensitive antigen
detection method and by testing an innovative concept that will enable early disease screening and
treatment. We have preliminary data that a novel enzyme immunoassay (EIA) detecting a Tm-specific
abundantly-released cell wall protein Mp1p is highly specific and is more sensitive than blood culture
for Tm detection. This project will drive the translation of this new technology into improving patient
care, testing its clinical utility as a rapid diagnostic test, and establishing a proof of concept that infection
can be identified early during pre-clinical stage. This would create new opportunities for disease
screening and prevention strategies. To do this, we will establish a cohort of febrile AIDS patients for
the evaluation of diagnosis utility and will establish a cohort of asymptomatic AIDS patients starting
HIV therapy for evaluation of early disease detection. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) the
Mp1p EIA is at least 20% more sensitive than conventional cultures and reduces time to diagnosis; 2)
Mp1p antigen precedes development of talaromycosis in asymptomatic patients and is associated with
morbidity and all-cause mortality; 3) the Mp1p EIA has similar sensitivity and specificity in the urine
compared to plasma/sera samples of patients. We have established a team of investigators from Duke
University, University of Hong Kong, and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit and its partner
hospitals in Vietnam with expertise and experience in the development and clinical evaluation of
diagnostics. Upon completion of the project, we expect to provide robust data to support the integration
of the Mp1p EIA into routine Tm diagnostic algorithm. Data generated from these studies have the
potential to shift the current treatment paradigm from treating advanced disease to preventing disease
development through a screen-and-treat approach. We expect our strategy will substantially impact
disease burden."
10814208,"ABSTRACT
Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair
recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Additional
specific risks in elder surgical patients include delirium and falls. Currently prejudice rather than evidence guides
the complex problem of elder perioperative pain management. Given the gravity of the US opioid epidemic,
policy makers are quickly establishing rules and regulations for opioid prescribing. These policies are blanket
regulations that neglect emerging evidence regarding the need for differential opioid prescriptions based on
clinical and patient factors, particularly in elders. Currently, there lacks tools to identify elders at high risk for
adverse pain outcomes. Such tools are needed to provide critical evidence on pain management to stakeholders
and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ elder patient to pain treatment for an individual. In
this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain in elders.
Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes in elders. We
will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key
discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk
stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes
developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through
open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from
real world evidence to identify elder patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can
potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic."
10799616,"Protein Kinases C (PKC) define a family of lipid-activated kinases that are key effectors of phosphoinositide
signaling – a major intracellular signaling pathway of eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this central activity,
dysregulation of PKC signaling is implicated in cancer progression, cardiac disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's
disease. Because of the fundamental role of PKC in signal transduction, the development of modulators of
PKC activity – both for therapeutic and basic research purposes – is widely recognized as one of the major
challenges in the field. Addressing these challenges requires an atomic-level understanding of PKC control –
in particular, how lipids regulate PKC activity. This subject defines a major gap in understanding of PKC
regulatory mechanisms. The central objective of this research proposal is to decipher the mechanism of the
key event that triggers activation of PKC – its interaction with diacylglycerol (DAG). It is currently unknown
how DAG is recognized and captured in membranes by the conserved homology 1 (C1) domains of PKC. To
address this critical gap in knowledge, a synergistic combination of advanced solution NMR approaches,
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical strategies will be applied to address the following
Specific Aims: (1) to understand the molecular basis of diacylglycerol recognition by C1 domains, (2) to
decipher precisely how C1 domains are initially recruited to membranes, and (3) to determine how tandem C1
domains execute a coincidence detection of DAG and anionic phospholipids. Insights into the DAG-sensing
mechanism obtained from the proposed studies will have impact that extends beyond the already large
problem of PKC regulation. The atomic-level information regarding C1-DAG interactions will be directly
applicable to five other large families of signaling proteins that rely on C1 domains for regulation of their DAG-
dependent activities. This information will also facilitate the design of pharmacological agents for rational
modulation of PKC function by direct targeting of its C1 domains."

In this application for a 5-year K25 Career Development Award, I propose a mentored research and career
development plan providing a foundation for a future career as an independent investigator in kidney disease.
The goal of this research project is to develop and test polygenic risk scores for chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and its glomerular subtypes, such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN)
and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Although traditionally genetic studies have been focused largely
on rare genetic variants associated with a high risk of disease, there is mounting evidence that common variants
have substantial polygenic contributions to the risk for common chronic diseases and these findings may have
a significant public health impact. Recent studies demonstrate that individuals in the top 1-5% of polygenic risk
score distribution have disease risk equivalent to many of the rare variants currently tested for clinically, including
mutations that are causal for diseases such as obesity, breast cancer, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,
atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease. For example, a genome-wide polygenic risk score for BMI has been
developed and validated that uses 2.1 million common genetic variants to accurately predict the development of
severe obesity early in life. This proposal will apply similar methods to evaluate polygenic contributions to CKD
and its various subtypes for which new powerful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets are
presently emerging from our lab (I am co-author of most of the studies by contributing data from eMERGE and
UK biobank consortia). With guidance from my mentors, I have drafted a 5-year career development plan that
includes training in clinical domain knowledge of kidney disease and its subtypes including familiarity with the
pathogenesis models for common kidney disorders and potential clinical applications of polygenic scores in
nephrology (primary-mentor: Dr. Krzysztof Kiryluk), biomedical informatics (co-mentor: Dr. Chunhua Weng) and
novel statistical genetics methods for the analysis of multidimensional genetic and phenotypic data (Dr. Iuliana
Ionita-Laza). In the last two years of the award I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The
proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented and biomedical research to discover novel genetic
risk factors for CKD and early diagnosis strategies for CKD and its major subtypes."

10892997,"Suicide is a major and growing public health problem among youth in the United States. Integrating suicide
prevention strategies as a core component of health care delivery and providing access to health services for
individuals at risk for suicide is a primary goal of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (NAASP).
Lack of prevention strategies universally assimilated into routine health care is an obstacle to achieving
meaningful reductions in youth suicide. To address this problem, we propose to develop the Center for
Accelerating Suicide Prevention in Real-world Settings (ASPIRES) to hasten the implementation of effective
and scalable evidence-based interventions to reduce youth suicide. ASPIRES will focus on integrated
programs of research that span the continuum of care from early identification in primary and specialty health
care settings, to acute and transitional care, and back into the community as part of routine health care
practice. The target population is youth at elevated risk for suicide, the majority of which are from lower
socioeconomic households experiencing significant health disparities. The specific aims of ASPIRES include:
(1) Create an infrastructure to foster innovative, transdisciplinary approaches to accelerate the implementation
and utility of youth suicide prevention interventions in real-world settings; (2) Conduct integrated programs of
high-impact research to improve risk detection and deploy innovative interventions that have strong potential
for scalability and sustainability in real-world settings; (3) Characterize the implementation context to generate
recommendations for contextually sensitive implementation strategies for varied healthcare settings; (4)
Cultivate the next generation of emerging and advanced scholars from diverse backgrounds to conduct state-
of-the-art suicide prevention research; (5) Coordinate a program of pilot studies that test the most promising
ideas to accelerate innovations in practice-based youth suicide prevention; and (6) Communicate and
disseminate center-related findings to key stakeholders and promote data sharing. The center’s planned
portfolio of science includes integrated efforts promoting accelerated research across a continuum of health
care settings that could not be accomplished using individual project mechanisms. The signature (R01-level)
hybrid effectiveness-implementation project focuses on universal suicide risk screening and enhancing quality
improvement in pediatric primary care settings. Three exploratory projects include: 1) testing an established
intervention in a specialty care setting to address young children at high familial risk for suicidal behavior; 2)
testing an evidence-based treatment alternative to inpatient hospitalization that targets family functioning to
reduce youth suicidal behavior in an acute care setting; and 3) developing a technology-based intervention to
promote lethal means restriction during the “high-risk” transitional care period following discharge from a
psychiatric hospital. The project team is well-suited to run the proposed center with expertise from multiple
disciplines and an extensive community-based stakeholder and patient network."
10630248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is the most important cause of chronic infectious disease death in the US,
with over 2 million people infected and nearly 20,000 dying annually. The greatest burden; occurs among “baby
boomers,” born 1945-1965 (75% of those infected). HCV disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities (25%
of those infected are Blacks; Black mortality is 87% and Hispanic mortality 43% higher than among Whites),
persons with HIV disease and injection drug users. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy recently became
available; it can cure >95% of people with HCV, but only half have been diagnosed and a much smaller proportion
treated. CDC’s National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (NVHAP) calls for identification and treatment of all those
infected, but access for racial/ethnic minorities is problematic, due to costly medicines, stigmatization of those
with HCV, variable access to specialists, inconsistent provider awareness of need to diagnose and treat, and
variable coverage of treatment, particularly by state Medicaid plans. We propose to use an exploratory sequential
mixed methods design to analyze HCV testing and treatment patterns among US baby boomers, tracking the
diffusion of DAA therapy nationally and across demographic groups since initial licensing in 2014, and to conduct
qualitative work and surveys of patients and physicians to explore factors contributing to disparities in care.
 The Specific Aims are: 1) To use national and state-level publicly-administered health insurance claims data
to describe variations in HCV screening and treatment among the baby boomer cohort by a) examining
differences in HCV screening rates across race/ethnicity, community socioeconomic status (cSES), and primary
care utilization; b) evaluating the time between HCV diagnosis and antiviral treatment initiation among individuals
with a new diagnosis of HCV, by race/ethnicity and cSES; and c) evaluating time between FDA approval of the
first DAA HCV treatment, and initiation of DAA treatment for the prevalent population of baby boomers with
chronic HCV, by race/ethnicity and cSES; and, informed by these findings 2) To assess the contribution of patient
and provider factors to shaping disparities in diagnosis and treatment of HCV by adapting existing measures
and/or developing novel measures, and administering these to samples of HCV patients and providers, by a)
using patient focus groups and participatory feedback to adapt measures of stigma and discrimination in health
care and other settings, knowledge and beliefs about HCV and its treatment, and barriers to care (competing
needs, depression, drug use, access, patient costs, distance to care), then administering them to diverse HCV
patients in two US regions; and b) developing measures of HCV knowledge, attitudes, experiences and practices
among physicians, then administering them to primary care, gastroenterology, hepatology, and infectious
disease physicians in two US regions. We will share study instruments and results with community partners, who
will be very involved in all phases of the research, and with other key stakeholders and investigators, to facilitate
the development and evaluation of interventions to address the problems identified in this study."

Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments
to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become
an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic
network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and
neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods
development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative
metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of
epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk
for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of
ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms
by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and
ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that
are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood
Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the
Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of
children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and
metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize
dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of

achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis
and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological
and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative
network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of
new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible
conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts
in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her
strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham
and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art
multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD
comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge."

Pregnancy and inflammation (due to infectious diseases) are each known to alter drug pharmacokinetics (PK) by
changing the expression and activity of transporters and/or drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g. CYPs). Quantifying
changes in drug PK caused by pregnancy and/or cytokines (elevated during inflammation) is important for
rational design of dosing regimens of drugs for pregnant women with infectious diseases. While changes in the
PK of CYP-cleared drugs by pregnancy and cytokines have been well-delineated using CYP probe drugs, such
data are sorely missing for transporters. However, obtaining data of changes in drug PK by pregnancy and/or
pro-inflammatory infectious diseases for every possible transported drug administered to pregnant women (with
or without infection) is logistically impossible. Therefore, alternative approaches that can generalize across
drugs, transporters and pro-inflammatory infectious diseases are urgently needed. These approaches should
accurately predict the alteration in in vivo activity of transporters by pregnancy and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
In this proposal, we propose a systems pharmacology approach to predict the effects of pregnancy and/or
pro-inflammatory infectious diseases on transporter-mediated drug PK. Our hypothesis is that the
magnitude of change in drug PK by pregnancy and/or cytokines can be predicted through clinical PK studies
using probe drugs and in vitro experimental data as well as Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
modeling and simulation (M&S). While probe drugs can yield clinically significant and valuable data, transporter
probe drugs, unlike CYP probe drugs, have the limitations that they are not selective. Therefore, to overcome
this limitation, we propose a two-pronged approach which utilizes both primary human cells (e.g.
hepatocytes, renal epithelial cells, intestinal enterocytes) and transfected cells expressing individual
transporters of interest. Using quantitative targeted proteomics, the human cells will allow us to determine
the effect of pregnancy hormones or cytokines, on the expression of transporters in these cells. The transporter-
transfected cell studies will allow us to determine the intrinsic transport clearance of a drug by a single
transporter per pmol of a transporter. Combined, these data will allow us to predict, through PBPK M&S,
transporter-mediated clearance of drugs in pregnant women with and without infection. These studies will
address a critical gap in our understanding of the effects of pregnancy and/or pro-inflammatory
infectious diseases on transporter-mediated drug disposition. Since our approach can be applied to other
drugs and other inflammatory diseases, its significance goes well beyond the drugs and inflammatory diseases
investigated here. We would like this application to be considered under the NIH-FAPESP initiative (NOT-TW-
16-001). Under this initiative, the clinical PK studies will be conducted in pregnant women with infectious
diseases in Brazil, and the clinical PK data obtained will be used to verify our PBPK model predictions."

Asthma has become increasingly common in the past decade. Co-exposure to environmental pollutants and
allergens can exacerbate allergic sensitization and induce key characteristics of severe asthma. Cockroaches
are a potent source of allergen that can induce sensitization and drive allergic respiratory symptoms.
Interestingly, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are diesel exhaust particulates
(DEPs)-derived toxins, can increase the likelihood of developing cockroach allergy and asthma. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms are currently not well-established. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the
fundamental mechanisms by which environmental pollutants enhance cockroach-induced allergic inflammation
and identify novel therapeutic targets for allergic asthma. Our more specific aims are to address the hypothesis
that alterations in recruitment and function of mast cells play a heretofore underappreciated role in the positive
interactions between environmental pollutants and airway allergic inflammation. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
is a receptor for common environmental contaminants. AHR has been shown to be a key receptor in driving
environmental pollutant-enhanced allergic lung inflammation. We have recently made significant contributions to
unraveling the function of AhR signaling in mast cell activation and allergic inflammation. We were the first to
characterize the essential role of oxidative activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (ox-CaMKII) in
AhR mediated mast cell activation and ROS production. Furthermore, recent discoveries suggest that
mitochondrial-targeted inhibition of CaMKII in airway epithelium suppresses mitochondrial ROS generation and
protects against allergic asthma. Thus, these findings raise the possibility that CaMKII is a central player sensing
“upstream” ROS and controlling “downstream” mitochondrial ROS generation, mast cell activation and
characteristic features of allergic asthma. These exciting new data set the stage to test our central hypothesis:
AhR mediates environmental pollutant-potentiated allergen-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative
activation of CaMKII, which are essential for mast cell activation and development of allergic asthma. Three
independent yet related specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 proposes studies to determine whether epithelial AhR
plays a role in mediating environmental pollutant-enhanced allergen-induced epithelial mitochondrial ROS
generation, cytokine release, and mast cell recruitment in asthma. Aim 2 proposes experiments to define whether
AhR on mast cells mediates environmental pollutant-enhanced allergen-induced mitochondrial CaMKII that
contributes to ROS generation and oxidative activation of CaMKII. Aim 3 proposes studies to elucidate the role
of oxidative activation of CaMKII in mast cell activation and allergic asthma and to explore the possible
mechanisms. The proposed research is significant as it will provide a conceptual framework linking the
environmental pollutant/allergen-AhR-ROS-ox-CaMKII axis to mast cell activation and development of allergic
asthma. These studies may ultimately allow for the development of new therapeutic targets for allergic asthma."
10415196,"The proposed project stems from two decades of my research experience in Neuro-Virology and Neuro-
Immunology, but involves a new and bold line of investigation. This new direction will allow me not only to
contribute to HIV/AIDS research, but it will also help develop the nascent field of “Viromics, and define its impact
to elucidate the pathogenesis associated with drug use. The key gap in our knowledge is the contribution of
ALL viruses, defined as the “Virome”, to HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, and whether it is associated with drug use.
However, deep sequencing alone (also called Next Gen sequencing) is sub-optimal for viral studies due to the
enormous imbalance between size and abundance of human genomic DNA/RNA and viral nucleic acids.
Furthermore, accessing brain areas of interest or CSF samples for targeted virological studies in the CNS
represents another major obstacle. We have developed a novel target-enrichment deep sequencing-based
platform for detection of the entire Virome in clinical samples, named “ViroFind”. This assay can detect all 561
DNA or RNA viruses known to infect humans, and potentially, yet undiscovered viruses. Compared to deep
sequencing alone, ViroFind could enrich viral sequences present in brain samples up to 127-fold.
We will define the entire Virome in the brain, CSF and blood of HIV/AIDS patients with and without drug use,
using ViroFind. These include known viruses, viral variants and potentially yet unknown viruses. We will use
banked samples of several cohorts of HIV/AIDS patients, as well as CSF samples from HIV+ patients seen at
Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) and at my Global Neurology Program in Zambia. We will also determine
the expression pattern of viral species formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and characterize their cellular
localization in the brain.
The major challenge that needs to be addressed is to go beyond the mere characterization of viral sequences,
and to develop the nascent field of “Viromics”. This will allow us to integrate virological data together with
genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, immunomics and pathobiology in the human host using a systems
biology approach, aiming to define possible interventions and therapeutic targets. The Avant-Garde mechanism
will allow me to leverage my previous research achievements and my access to collections of post mortem
samples as well cohorts of HIV-infected patients with and without drug use at RUMC and Zambia. It is also suited
to my new position as Chair of Department of Neurology at RUMC, and will give me the freedom to move the
field of Viromics forward in a truly transformative way. By integrating the field of Viromics with other “omics” these
studies will not only advance HIV/AIDS and drug use research, but also pave the way for delineating druggable
targets and developing novel therapies for viral diseases. The proposed studies are in line with the Office of
AIDS Research new priorities including HIV co-infections, co-morbidities and complications (CCC)."
10840777,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) walk predominately in low intensity stride rates with little
variability, thus limiting their walking activity and ability to participate in daily life. In contrast, typically
developing (TD) children engage in short bursts of intense walking activity interspersed with varying intervals of
low intensity walking within daily life. In order to optimize motor learning, active participation, task-specific
training and multiple repetitions or massed practice is required to learn new motor skills. Short bursts of
vigorous intensity locomotor treadmill training (SBLTT) alternating with low/moderate intensity was specifically
designed to mimic activity patterns of TD children in a massed practice format. Pilot data suggests that SBLTT
is feasible and enhances walking capacity and performance in daily life for children with CP. The objective of
this application is to examine the effect of SBLTT versus an equivalent dosage of traditional locomotor
treadmill training (TLTT) on the primary outcomes of walking capacity and performance in children with CP.
This protocol will also examine whether the effects of SBLTT on walking capacity and performance are
mediated by improvements in in muscle power generation. The scientific premise is that SBLTT, that
approximates the walking intensity patterns of typically developing (TD) children through a clinically feasible
massed practice protocol, will be more effective than TLTT in improving walking capacity and performance. We
hypothesize that SBLTT strategies for children with CP modeled on activity patterns in TD children, will be
positively mediated by muscle power generation and subsequently improve walking capacity and community
walking performance and mobility. We will test the following specific aims. Aim #1. Determine the immediate
and retention effects of short-burst interval LTT (SBLTT) on walking capacity in ambulatory children with CP.
Walking capacity will be measured by self-selected gait speed and the one minute walk test. Aim #2. Examine
the effects of treatment on community-based walking activity performance and mobility. Walking activity
performance will be captured by accelerometry. Community walking mobility individualized by home versus
community locations will be measured with a novel combination of global position system and accelerometry.
Aim #3. Explore whether the effects of SBLTT on walking capacity and performance are mediated by muscle
power generation. This project is innovative because it focuses novel task-specific approach for addressing
walking limitations in children with CP and implements an individualized community locations outcome. The
proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to
direct locomotor training protocols and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effecting the
community walking performance and mobility for children with CP. Increased understanding of the muscular
mechanisms by which children with CP respond to SBLTT are expected. Such knowledge has relevance to the
health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span."
10615013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), increased serum phosphate, and anemia are
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) progression in children. Current treatment strategies for CKD-mineral bone disorder and CKD-related
anemia include 1,25D, binders, iron, and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). However, 1,25D therapy
further increases circulating and bone FGF23 levels, and iron deficiency and ESA treatment both also
stimulate FGF23 production. A novel paradigm in earlier CKD has been suggested with the use of phosphate
binders with or without an inhibitor of enteral phosphate absorption, when serum phosphate levels are
within the normal range, to lower FGF23 and to raise endogenous 1,25D levels. However, such approach led
to inconsistent results. Therapy with ferric citrate (FC), on the other hand, has been shown consistently to
lower FGF23 and phosphate levels while improving indices of iron metabolism in adults with CKD stages 3-4.
Furthermore, FC decreased serum phosphate levels, improved iron parameters and was well tolerated in
pediatric dialysis patients. Thus, FC may have added value especially for children with pre-dialysis CKD in
whom iron deficiency anemia and elevated FGF23 levels are highly prevalent. Moreover, iron deficiency is a
potent driver of FGF23 production. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with FC will lower intact FGF23
levels during a 12-month period in a randomized, double-blinded, two -arms parallel study in 160 pediatric
patients with CKD stages 3-4 and normal serum phosphate levels. The multi-site trial will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of FC to lower serum intact FGF23 levels (primary
endpoint) in pediatric patients with CKD 3–4 over 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of the
interventions on anemia, kidney function, and indices of bone and mineral metabolism (secondary end-points).
Additionally, we will perform pre- and post-treatment bone biopsies to assess bone histomorphometry and
FGF23 expression in a sub-cohort of 24 UCLA patients. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and
tolerability of FC in pediatric CKD 3-4 patients. If our hypothesis is confirmed, then a new treatment paradigm
would emerge in which therapy with FC will be initiated early in CKD, when patients are normophosphatemic,
slowing progressive increases in FGF23 and blunting FGF23-associated adverse renal and CVD."

Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and
treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team
of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative
evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be-
tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent
and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten-
tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and
costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan
time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which
negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of
multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution
in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to
train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative
imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop-
ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall
objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the
same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve
overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging
sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine
ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day
clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will
be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils.
Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion
signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re-
sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise,
which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis-
tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate
the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much
more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease."
10690469,"PROJECT SUMMARY
50% of cancer patients require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10-40% of patients
in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), have access to it. A shortfall in the specialised workforce to
deliver radiotherapy has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity.
The current radiotherapy workflow is inefficient requiring several labor intensive processes and takes
weeks to months to deliver in LMICs. The growing demand for cancer treatment means that the ratio of
incidence to mortality will continue to worsen without a scalable solution.
Artificial intelligence (AI) based software has been developed to automate two components of the
radiotherapy planning pathway 1. Delineation of anatomical areas that are at risk of tumour spread and at
risk of radiation damage. 2. Definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed
advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to less
than a day) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy.
We propose a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI based
automated radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer and head and neck cancers, which are endemic in
LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 706
patients (353 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan
acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures to establish
the cost and resource impact of automation using the time-driven activity-based costing model.
The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia
(n=1), and South Africa (n=2) to ensure we include a broad range of patients and the representativeness of
the findings will support implementation of the software in LMICs.
If the study objectives are met, the AI based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to
public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving
access, and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control."

 The two-phased research mechanism will permit us to design, pilot test, and validate the
efficacy of innovative new multivariate protocols for estimating actual risk for the birth of a
child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). In the R61 Phase we will research, create,
design, and pilot test new protocols for: 1) interviewing mothers (with biomarker validation) to
determine maternal alcohol consumption on a daily/weekly basis across pregnancy and
postpartum alcohol use during breastfeeding to assess their specific contributions to child traits
and severity of FASD outcomes; 2) determining maternal experience with stress, trauma, and
mental health status during pregnancy and their contribution to the severity of effect on FASD
diagnostic traits; 3) interviewing fathers regarding paternal traits that contribute to the risk for
FASD from exposure to teratogens such as alcohol, other drugs, and environmental toxins during
pre-conception; and 4) establishing a comprehensive, summary FASD risk score from the above
innovations when combined with multiple other empirically-established proximal and distal
variables of risk.
 The R33 Phase will then initiate an exploration of a multivariate, comprehensive
approach to FASD risk via two applications for better understanding FASD etiology. One
application is prospective and the other retrospective. In the prospective study, 200 women (and
as many of their partners as we can consent) will be recruited from prenatal clinics, and their
offspring will be assessed at six weeks and nine months postpartum and diagnosed by pediatric
dysmorphologists and a multidisciplinary team. The second application of the new methods will
gather the new data retrospectively and link the data to two existing cohorts of maternal/child
dyads whom we have followed over time to assess their FASD status and the severity of their
physical, neurodevelopmental, and behavioral traits. Both of these studies will add new insight to
our long-term quest to understand more completely the respective contributions of a broad range
of host, agent, and environmental factors to the etiology of FASD. This R33 Phase will provide
substantial validation of the weekly alcohol use data, mental health status assessments, paternal
questionnaire, and FASD risk score innovations via the clinical assessment of the offspring of
each pregnancy. In developing this more comprehensive approach to FASD risk, both study
phases draw on our existing clinical epidemiology infrastructure, the experience of our multi-
disciplinary team, and the participants in existing longitudinal cohorts."

Cell to cell communication is critical for function in all multicellular organisms. A key factor for intercellular
communication is regulation by Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a
Ca2+ sensitive enzyme that is encoded by four genes in mammals: α, β, γ, and δ. There is an incredible amount
of diversity generated from the four vertebrate CaMKII genes. Alternative splicing produces up to 386 transcripts,
which leads to the production of 386 proteins that are then differentially post-translationally modified, and mix to
form hetero-oligomeric complexes, ultimately culminating in thousands of chemically distinct CaMKII
proteoforms. We are specifically interested in the crucial roles CaMKII plays in long-term memory formation
(neurons: α, β), fertilization (oocytes: γ), and cardiac physiology (cardiomyocytes: δ). Intriguingly, these cells all
communicate using Ca2+ oscillations but on vastly different timescales (minutes to milliseconds). How does one
enzyme accommodate this multifunctionality? We hypothesize that selective splicing and modification creates a
unique set of CaMKII variants expressed in specific cell types, thereby leading to differential functional outputs.
Fully elucidating these complex biological roles requires a deeper understanding of CaMKII variation at the
sequence and protein level, structural and conformational ramifications of these variations, and how these
variables affect CaMKII interactions within the cell. In this proposal, we seek to expand our understanding of
CaMKII function inside cells using a combinatorial approach of sequencing, biochemistry, structural biology, and
cellular assays. Completion of the proposed work will allow us to uncover the molecular basis for the many roles
of CaMKII in neurons, cardiomyocytes, and oocytes – with far-reaching implications on therapeutic intervention
for neurologic disease, cardiac dysfunction, and infertility."

Pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN) represents a common incidental finding in the population. Branch-duct
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), the most common incidentally discovered PCN, have a risk of
malignancy approaching 15%within 15 years of diagnosis. The performance of existing guidelines for identifying
early cancer is poor, and results in both surgical overtreatment and missed opportunities for early diagnosis.
Effective screening biomarkers are needed to accurately differentiate high-risk PCN that require close
surveillance from low risk lesions with little chance to progress.
In this proposal, we will test and validate of three novel blood-based biomarkers and one cyst fluid biomarker for
the detection of early PDAC in patients with PCN. The proposed markers, developed in both academic and
industry settings, show promise in preliminary studies, with sensitivity and specificity sufficiently high to warrant
further evaluation. We will incorporate prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation
(PRoBE) standards to rigorously test the performance of these biomarkers with samples collected from three
cohorts: 1) stage I/II PDAC and controls; 2) Patients with PCN who undergo surgical resection; 3) Patients with
PCN ≥ 2.5 cm or main pancreatic duct ≥ 5 mm under surveillance with serial imaging and sample collection. We
will test performance of the biomarkers individually, and as part of multi-variable models in combination with
each other, with the added information of germline testing and clinical laboratory values (CA19 -9, HbA1c), and
with specific PDAC risk factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, pancreatitis history).
Key components of our research strategy to tackle this recalcitrant problem include: 1) rigorous testing of several
promising blood-based biomarkers, individually and in combination, through a unique collaboration between
industry and academic partners; 2) testing of a novel platform for advanced cyst fluid analysis for early detection
of PDAC and comparison of its performance to blood-based biomarkers; 3) a large number of retrospective and
prospective samples interrogated using the PRoBE design, with statistical rigor for biomarker validation; 4)
resources leveraged from the established Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection (PRECEDE) Consortium including
standardized collection of germline genetic testing, clinical, and laboratory data with blood and cyst fluid
biosampling in accordance with PCDC protocols; 6) collection of a large set of de-identified partnering pancreatic
images (MRI/MRCP, CT and EUS) and digitized pathology slides on a funded cloud-based platform for
collaborative opportunities using artificial intelligence and machine learning strategies, and 7) multimodal data
integration for model development. Longitudinal biospecimens will be shared with the PCDC to support the
Signature Cohorts, and de-identified stored images (MRI, EUS, digitized pathology) will be available for
collaborative consortium efforts."
10629451,"Abstract
Complete removal of tumor lesions with surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with early
stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as with many other types of cancer. It often results in
cancer cure. However, substantial proportion of patients develops local or distant recurrences within
several years. It is widely accepted that small numbers of tumor cells disseminate from primary tumor site
early on during tumor development and persist in dormant state until cells re-enter the cell cycle. Cancer
cell dormancy can also be the response to radiation and chemotherapy associated with DNA damage,
which explains recurrence even after a complete response to therapies. Those dormant cells usually have
characteristics of senescent cells, thus this phenomenon is often referred as “therapy-induced senescence”
(TIS). Although signaling in dormant and senescent tumor cells is relatively well understood, much less is
known about the mechanisms that evade dormancy to form local recurrence or distant metastases years
after complete elimination of primary tumor. In this application, we model tumor cell dormancy by using two
experimental systems. The first is the induction of dormancy by regulation of the expression of tumor
suppressor gene p53 in lung cancer cells. This model allows for the study of tumor dormancy, which is not
induced by treatment with chemo- or radiation therapy and may reflect changes in tumor cells after
dissemination to tissues. The second is the model of TIS in mouse lung and human ovarian cancer treated
with chemotherapy. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that neutrophils were able to induce proliferation
of dormant tumor cells. We found that this effect could be caused by neuroendocrine adrenergic hormones
as the result of prolonged stress. We suggest a novel concept of regulation of tumor recurrence. We
propose that adrenergic hormones cause a rapid release and autocrine/paracrine signaling by S100A8/A9
proteins heterodimer leading to up-regulation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in neutrophils. MPO and ROS
contributed to formation of oxidized lipids by neutrophils, which directly activated dormant tumor cells. The
main goal of this study is to identify the mechanism of recurrence in cancer and to determine therapeutic
targeting strategy to control this process and ultimately eliminate dormant tumor cells to prevent
recurrence. To achieve this goal, we propose the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. To identify specific mechanisms of neutrophil-mediated reactivation of dormant tumor
cells.
Specific Aim 2. To determine signaling in dormant tumor cells responsible for their reactivation, to identify
clinical significance and therapeutic targeting of reactivation of dormant tumor cells."

Marijuana use during pregnancy is increasing rapidly in the US. The spreading legalization and growing
acceptance, accessibility, and use of marijuana during pregnancy raise important public health concerns for
pregnant women as our understanding of the developmental, behavior, and mental health impacts on children
exposed to marijuana in utero is alarmingly inadequate. To address this critical research gap, we propose a
longitudinal birth cohort study of over 420,000 children born between 2010-2021 at Kaiser Permanente
Northern California (KPNC) hospitals. We will leverage data from KPNC's comprehensive electronic health
records (EHR) and unique universal prenatal drug use screening program which screens 40,000 women
annually via “gold standard” self-report and urine toxicology tests for marijuana and other substance use. As
part of standard care, all children are universally screened for developmental delays at well-child visits and as
they grow older universal mental health screening captures depression and substance use disorders.
Information on child neurodevelopment, behavior and mental health screening outcomes and diagnoses will be
ascertained from KPNC's EHR and through linkage to California's Department of Developmental Services. We
will ascertain information on important confounders (e.g., maternal mental health, maternal age, tobacco and
other substance use, preterm delivery) from KPNC's EHR. Children born to women with singleton gestations
who are screened for prenatal marijuana and other substance use will be included. We will evaluate
associations between prenatal marijuana exposure and the risk of neurodevelopmental impairments,
behavioral disorders, and mental health outcomes from birth to 13 years of age, after accounting for potential
confounders. We will also test for sex differences in these associations. Additional analyses will assess the
effects in children whose mothers screened positive for marijuana only during pregnancy (i.e., no other
prenatal substance use). The proposed study leverages a diverse population, and with high generalizability,
will be the largest to date. Findings will have significant public health and clinical implications and can be used
by women to make informed decisions about marijuana use during pregnancy. Additionally, the study cohort
will be a valuable resource for future research on the longer-term impact of prenatal marijuana use on
children's health."

The Achilles Tendinopathy Center of Research Translation (AT-CORT) at the University of Pennsylvania will
foster fundamental discoveries to guide clinical translation, as well as develop and employ novel translational
resources, models and technologies, to address the highly significant research and clinical challenge of Achilles
tendinopathy. Despite the high frequency and increasing prevalence of tendinopathy in young and old patients,
and the significant pain and disability that arises from this condition, as well as the associated high cost to society,
effective treatment modalities have stagnated over the last two decades. This is due to the lack of fundamental
understanding of tendon disease etiology and pathogenesis, which limits development of novel treatment
modalities. At present, beyond surgical intervention for late-stage disease, the only approved clinical therapy
involves physical interventions via controlled rehabilitation mechanical loading of the tendon. While efficacious
in some patients, outcomes of this intervention do not stem disease progression in most patients. Given the
central mechanical role of the Achilles tendon, and the critical role of mechanical loading and mechanobiology
on tendon cell homeostasis, it is critical that we develop and expand our understanding of the role of mechanical
forces in disease onset and progression to optimize existing and inform new treatment strategies. Our proposed
AT-CORT is uniquely positioned with a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with strong
interest and expertise in these and related areas. The Overall goal of the AT-CORT is to develop new insight
and technologies that uncover the mechanobiologic basis of Achilles tendinopathy across length scales, from
the nucleus, to the cell, to the tissue microenvironment to patients. We will assess these critical elements during
disease onset and progression, informed by both vivo animal models that replicate disease processes and
source material and real-world loading data from living human subjects. The AT-CORT is comprised of four
independent and yet interactive elements, including an Administrative Core to oversee and guide interactions
and primary Research Projects focused on the transfer of information from the external tendon cell
microenvironment through the cytoskeleton (Project 1) and on chromatin remodeling and mechano-epigenetic
regulation of tendon cell phenotype (Project 2). Using cells, tissue, and loading information derived from both
human and animal tendinopathic models (Tissue Core), these research projects will advance our knowledge of
the origins of tendinopathic disease and define new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Together, our highly
interdisciplinary team, innovative tools, and outstanding and interactive Research Projects and Cores will
dramatically advance knowledge, develop innovative tools and insight, and provide new directions for translation

10769709,"The Achilles Tendinopathy Center of Research Translation (AT-CORT) at the University of Pennsylvania will
foster fundamental discovery research to guide translation, as well as employ and develop translational
resources, models and technologies, to address the highly significant research and unmet clinical challenge of
Achilles tendinopathy. Despite the high frequency and increasing prevalence of tendinopathy to young and old
patients alike, the significant pain and disability, as well as the associated high cost to society, evaluation and
development of effective treatment modalities is hindered by the lack of fundamental guiding data on the
mechanobiology of tendon etiology and pathogenesis. At the University of Pennsylvania, we are uniquely
positioned with a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with strong interest and expertise in
these and related areas. The Center’s efforts will span from the nucleus, to the cell, to the tissue, to in vivo
animal models and to living human subjects in a coordinated “back-and-forth” manner across scales to guide
innovative approaches to Achilles tendinopathy. The Center’s research will discover fundamental physiologic
processes to guide translation. It will also as serve as a test bed for defining the role, as well as the scientific
and translational rigor, of a repetitive use Achilles tendinopathy animal model through implementation of an
exciting series of in vivo longitudinal assays to be conducted in parallel in both animal and human subjects.
The Specific Aims of this Administrative Core are to: Aim 1: Provide leadership for Center components and
activities and advise the Center Director regarding current or potential future activities of the Center; Aim 2:
Manage, evaluate and monitor the Center components and activities; Aim 3: Communicate the Center’s
activities to the scientific, clinical, and lay communities; Aim 4: Administer the Pilot and Feasibility Grant
Program and its associated funding and reporting; and Aim 5: Implement an Enrichment Program. The Core
and Research Projects have been carefully developed in concert to bridge the fundamental and applied while
being highly interactive. With regular guidance from our Committee structure (External Advisory, Executive,
Communication, Enrichment), we will adapt our efforts to address our translational theme in the most efficient,
effective, and productive manner possible. Our Pilot and Feasibility Grant program will foster new and
innovative project directions consistent with our theme as well as support development of novel technologies to
bring to our projects and for translation of our efforts. Our approach will serve as a critical paradigm for other
tendon and indeed other musculoskeletal disorders and we will build on these efforts. A well organized and
well-structured Administrative Core is absolutely essential to accomplish the Aims of the Center’s highly
interdisciplinary and interactive Research Projects and Core, and to maximize research activity, efficiency,
productivity, communication, and ultimate impactful translation of our efforts to the scientific and lay

10769710,"Research Core Summary
 Achilles tendinopathy is a painful, debilitating, and chronic tendon condition. Patients receive physical
therapy as the first step in conservative treatment. These physical therapy protocols – which are the only non-
surgical treatments paid for by most insurers – prescribe mechanical loads as a therapeutic agent. However,
sixty percent of patients continue to report painful symptoms after 5 years, and fifty percent of patients seek
surgical treatment after conservative treatment fails. Therefore, maximizing the therapeutic effectiveness of
mechanical loading is critical towards improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for costly and often
ineffective surgical treatments. To meet this unmet clinical need, our proposed Research Projects will establish
the mechano-responsiveness of tendon cells throughout tendinopathy disease progression and elucidate the
mechanotransductive mechanisms that regulate cell fate and tissue homeostasis to attenuate disease
progression and improve tendon healing. To accelerate clinical translation, the overall objective of this Achilles
Tendinopathy Tissue Core is to provide patient and clinically relevant rat tendon samples, ranging from healthy
to degenerated, combined with the most complete set of longitudinal in vivo assays to maximize the translational
impact of our Research Projects proposed in this P50 application, as well as numerous NIH funded projects at
Penn aimed at improving tendon healing by our P50 team of investigators. In Aim 1, we will retrieve patient
tissues to investigate end-stage Achilles tendinopathy mechano-sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will leverage a
tendinopathy preclinical model to investigate disease pathogenesis. These 2 aims will utilize an extensive battery
of in vivo assays including gait analysis, loading monitoring, joint mechanics, ultrasound imaging, and
metabolomics to maximize research translation from our exciting Research Projects to clinical populations. In
Aim 3, we will develop novel techniques to translate preclinical findings to improve patient care. These
translational tools are necessary for follow-up animal experiments and clinical trials that will test the effectiveness
of personalized rehabilitative care at improving tendon healing and outcomes while addressing existing
inequitable care delivery for patients with Achilles tendon injuries. We will accelerate fundamental discovery
research and translation through preclinical studies to clinical populations. By establishing the Achilles
Tendinopathy Tissue Core, we will provide unique and rigorous techniques and expertise, as well as carefully
controlled and characterized study material to tendon researchers locally, and ultimately nationally, while
developing critical new technologies to improve patient care in future clinical research. We selected Achilles
tendinopathy to address a common and debilitating condition while demonstrating the proof-of-concept model
paradigm that leveraging patient tissues with preclinical models will accelerate fundamental discovery to more
effective and equitable musculoskeletal care."
10769711,"SUMMARY
Current treatment strategies for Achilles tendinopathy seek to modulate the tendon mechanical environment to
promote healing and regeneration. However, a lack of fundamental understanding of tendinopathic
mechanobiology limits optimization of rehabilitation strategies and impedes development of targeted mechano-
therapeutics. This proposal will address these gaps using orthogonal experiments across human tendinopathy,
rat overuse, and mechanistic mouse models. The proposed studies will establish a framework to inform
mechanotherapeutic strategies and identify novel signaling targets. Tendinopathy, particularly caused by
overuse, often results in tissue microdamage. This microdamage, in turn, impairs transmission of tensile
mechanical signals through the tissue, resulting in under-loading of endogenous tendon cells. Our preliminary
data show that tendon cells exhibit a biphasic response to tendon de-tensioning. De-tensioning causes a
transient loss in cytoskeletal tension and mechanotransductive signaling, resulting in upregulation of matrix
degrading enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases. Subsequently the tendon cells attempt to re-tension the
matrix by cytoskeletal contraction and matrix re-organization. This biphasic response represents a novel
framework for understanding the development, progression, and translational intervention of tendinopathy. In
the proposed studies, we will 1) determine how tendinopathic disease impacts Achilles tensional homeostasis
across the spectrum of disease, 2) define the mechanotransductive mechanisms, and 3) determine how
rehabilitative loading restores Achilles tensional homeostasis for translational impact. Using our expertise in
tenogenesis and tendinopathy (Dyment) and mechanobiology (Dyment/Boerckel), this translational project will
provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanotransductive mechanisms that drive aberrant and
chronic matrix remodeling during Achilles tendinopathy, define mechano-response benchmarks in controlled
assays that may predict clinical patient outcome, and identify potent drug targets for the next generation of
tailored mechanotherapeutics to complement the current gold standards of physical therapy and surgery."
10769712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Achilles tendinopathy is a very prevalent and costly clinical problem. However, current surgical and drug
strategies for tendon repair are limited, and non-surgical strategies to treat disease focus on stimulating tendon
repair through physical therapy. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to improve treatment strategies for tendon
injuries. Tendon degeneration alters the chemo-physical environment and changes biophysical inputs to resident
cells (called tenocytes). Both normal and aberrant phenotypes in tendon cells are defined by the dynamic spatio-
temporal organization of their genome, and so it will be important to understand how 3D genome architecture in
tendon cells changes with Achilles tendinopathy and how chemo-mechanical cues regulate transcriptional and
chromatin profiles in degenerative cells to develop better therapeutic strategies for tendinopathies. Furthermore,
the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the tendon phenotype change in degenerative environments are
underexplored. Epigenetic drugs are available and have been used for therapeutic purposes and likely also
constitute a promising avenue for treatment of tendinopathies through manipulation of the epigenetic landscape
and 3D chromatin architecture of tendon cells to lock in proper cell phenotype. To address these open questions,
the overall goal of Research Project is to test our hypotheses that Achilles tendinopathy alters epigenetic
landscape, 3D chromatin architecture, and transcriptional signatures in tenocytes impacting their phenotype, and
that these alterations can be manipulated and restored via the combination of biophysical cues and epigenetic
modifiers. The proposed work is significant as it will generate new knowledge about how changes in mechanical
loading and mechano-signaling across the spectrum of disease impacts genome organization and tendon cell
phenotype, and how these changes define disease progression and therapeutic interventions. Our Aims are:
Aim 1: Determine how Achilles tendinopathy alters the nanoscale chromatin organization and accessibility
landscape of tenocytes, impacting their phenotype. Aim 2: Identify whether biophysical cues and epigenetic
modifiers restore ‘healthy’ tenocyte genome organization in ‘degenerative’ tenocytes to improve therapeutic
strategies. The proposed research is innovative as we will use cutting-edge genome wide and single cell
analyses to study, for the first time, how Achilles tendinopathy regulates nanoscale chromatin states and
transcriptional activity, using single-cell based imaging and sequencing technologies. These studies will identify
novel epigenetic mechanisms of Achilles tendon pathology and disease onset, new mechanical loading
paradigms, and small epigenome-modifying molecules, providing critical and novel information to support new
mechano-epigenetic strategies to improve the efficacy of targeted physical therapy protocols."
10625840,"Background: The number of Veterans living with dementia (VLWD) will increase by 2030 to
nearly 340,000; these VLWD and their caregivers often have complex psychosocial and health
needs. Coordinating this care is complicated by the fact that most VLWD are Medicare-eligible
and therefore use care both through the VA and Medicare. Unfortunately, dual use is often
associated with duplication of services and potentially inappropriate care. In light of these
complexities, VHA Directive 1140.12 from October 2019 mandated that VA facilities establish a
Dementia System of Care to provide person-centered services for these VLWD. Because the
design of dementia care services is left to individual VA facilities, national variation affords a
unique opportunity to learn from particularly successful facilities.
Significance: The proposed study will provide important new knowledge to advance the
HSR&D priorities of long-term care/aging, access to care, and primary care practice. This
knowledge will be achieved by linking patient-level VA data, Medicare claims, and the GECDAC
Residential History File, enacting the VA Office of Research and Development’s Research
Priority of putting VA data to work for Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: This will be the first: (1) comprehensive analysis of non-VA care used
by VLWD, including both Medicare- and VA-reimbursed community care; (2) analysis of dual
use at the VA facility level, which is critical data for operational purposes; and (3) analysis of
dementia care since the VHA Dementia System of Care directive. Finally, we will include the
voice of VLWD and caregivers in both facility interviews and as Stakeholder Panel members.
Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the associations of dual use and continuity of care with the
Veteran-centered outcome of home time and how home time varies across VA facilities. (2)
Assess facility-level strategies that promote home time and the acceptability of these strategies
to Veterans and caregivers. (3) Develop a toolkit of dementia care strategies that facilities can
use to enhance VLWD care delivery.
Methodology: In this explanatory sequential mixed methods study, we will first identify
community-dwelling VLWD and link their VA data and Medicare claims with the GECDAC
Residential History File. Then, we will examine the association of dual use of outpatient and
prescription medications with home time, and whether this is moderated by continuity of care.
We will collapse these findings to examine dual use, continuity of care, and home time at the
facility level. With input from a Stakeholder & Expert Panel, we will identify four high- and four
low-performing VA facilities and conduct semi-structured interviews focused on local dementia
care strategies with VA providers, VLWD-caregiver dyads, and a non-VA community care
coordinator (n=9 interviews per facility). Finally, we will integrate our Aims 1 and 2 findings and,
with Stakeholder & Expert Panel input, develop a dementia care toolkit consisting of strategies
and tools that VA facilities can use to help implement their local Dementia System of Care.
Next Steps/Implementation: The 2019 VHA Directive directing VA facilities to establish a local
Dementia System of Care was not optional, but some facilities may have launched their
systems more successfully than others. The toolkit developed during Aim 3 will provide
additional guidance for challenging work facilities are already doing to improve the quality of
care provided to VLWD."

Stigma and discrimination related to HIV and AIDS (“HIV-related stigma”) have been identified worldwide as
major barriers to HIV treatment and care, posing challenges to HIV prevention efforts and provision of adequate
care, support, and treatment. Despite decades of global efforts to tackle HIV-related stigma, previous
interventions designed to reduce stigma have been largely ineffective. The knowledge gaps and challenges for
combating HIV-related stigma are partly rooted in the complexity and diversity of the stigma and partly in the
limitations in current conceptualization of stigma reduction efforts. Recent research, including our own
preliminary data, has shown the promise of resilience approaches that focus on the development of strengths,
competencies, resources, and capacities of people living with HIV (PLWH) and those of their real or surrogate
family members and healthcare facilities to prevent, reduce, and mitigate the negative effects of stigma. However,
the resilience approach, while hypothesized, has not been widely tested in intervention trials. In the current
application, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-guided, multilevel multimode resilience-
based intervention via a stepped wedge randomized trial among 800 PLWH and their real or surrogate family
members as well as 320 healthcare providers in Guangxi, China where we have built a strong research
infrastructure and community collaboration through NIH-funded research since 2004. The primary outcome will
be viral suppression among PLWH, and the intermediate outcomes will include resilience resources at the levels
of individuals, the real or surrogate family members, and healthcare facilities as well as chronic stress response
and adherence to treatment and care. The proposed study is innovative as it addresses a number of knowledge
gaps in HIV-related stigma reduction intervention research based on both a conceptualization of stigma reduction
and advancement in intervention research methodology (e.g., multilevel and multi-component intervention
modality, a stepped wedge design, addition of biomarkers to assess the effects of stigma, and targeting primary
HIV clinical outcomes such as viral suppression). The proposed research is significant as it addresses a critical
public health issue in the US and globally. The proposed intervention protocol, if proven efficacious, has the
potential to be replicated in other low- and middle-income countries to mitigate the negative impact of stigma on
the HIV treatment and care continuum."

Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a leading contributor towards back pain, an epidemic that costs
billions of dollars in the US. The IVD consists of a proteoglycan(PG)-rich nucleus pulposus (NP) surrounded
by a collagenous annulus fibrosus (AF) that together provide support and transmit complex loads. The IVD
degenerative cascade involves a multifactorial progression of biological, biochemical, and structural changes
that lead to the collapse of the disc structure and to compromised mechanical function. Despite its significant
public health impact, the pathophysiology of disc degeneration remains unclear.
 The accumulation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) is associated with aging and
diabetes. Increased AGEs has also been associated with IVD degeneration. AGEs form through
nonenzymatic glycation, where extracellular sugars undergo Maillard rearrangement with amino acids to
become protein adducts and crosslinks. AGES are known to impair the mechanical function of matrix proteins.
Beyond matrix modifications, AGEs activate the cellular Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts
(RAGE), and RAGE signaling perpetuates immune and inflammatory responses. Because the IVD is avascular
and has relatively low tissue remodeling, IVD tissues are susceptible to accumulate AGEs. Despite these
observations, it is not known whether AGEs or RAGE signaling have a causal role in IVD degeneration.
 In this R01 application, we will determine the AGEs- and RAGE-mediated events as disease mechanisms
for IVD degeneration. Specifically, we will identify the role of AGEs in altering IVD structure and function and
define the necessity of RAGE-signaling in AGEs-mediated degeneration. If our hypotheses are supported, this
will provide the putative targets to alleviate the degenerative cascade. The combination of in vivo and ex vivo-
in vitro approaches will enable us to carefully dissect the systemic effects of high AGE-loads from tissue-
specific effects of AGEs. We also will further develop the in vivo contrast-enhanced microCT of the
intervertebral disc as a key technological innovation. This approach provides a resolution that significantly
advances the current state-of-the-art compared to microMRIs. We believe that the successful completion of
the proposed aims will significantly advance our knowledge of intervertebral disc biology and intervertebral disc
imaging."

Obesity in adolescence and young adulthood is epidemic, leading to increased metabolic risk later in life. The
extent of weight loss through lifestyle interventions is variable and difficult to sustain. Existing medical
therapies for adults, which are often not FDA-approved in children, may lead to modest weight loss, but effects
are difficult to sustain, and these medications are limited by their tolerability. Oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic
hormone that regulates food intake and energy metabolism, is an exciting potential novel therapeutic in this
population. Intranasal (IN) OXT induced marked weight loss and was well tolerated in a small 8-week study of
adults with obesity. Our preliminary data show reduction in BMI SDS with excellent tolerability with 6-months of
IN OXT in 5-18-year-old children across a range of BMIs. Data in rodent and nonhuman primates indicate that
OXT drives weight loss by reducing food consumption and increasing energy expenditure. Importantly, OXT
also has the potential to reduce metabolic risk through reduction in visceral and hepatic fat, reduced
inflammation, and improved lipids. In fact, OXT has recently been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, and
hypothalamic inflammation in rodent models with obesity. We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled study
of twelve weeks of IN OXT vs. placebo to determine whether OXT reduces weight and metabolic risk markers
in adolescents with obesity as it does in diet-induced obese animal models. We will also investigate underlying
mechanisms driving OXT effects using cutting-edge imaging and metabolic assessments. In a study of 75
adolescents with obesity, we hypothesize that twelve weeks of IN OXT compared to placebo will result in (1)
reduced BMI SDS from (a) decreased food intake in the fasting state and in the absence of hunger, and (b)
increased resting energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis, mediated by reduced measures of
hypothalamic inflammation; and (2) reduced visceral and intrahepatic fat with relative preservation of
lean/muscle mass, associated with reduced systemic inflammation and an improved lipid profile. This study will
be the first to systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of OXT as a novel therapeutic agent to induce
weight loss and improve indicators of metabolic risk in adolescents with obesity."

Transmission remains the driving force behind the global drug resistant Tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. This occurs
despite the observation that the acquisition of drug resistance has a fitness cost on the pathogen. Fitness costs
have been associated with rpoB mutations which confer resistance to rifampicin. The physiological basis of the
mutant rpoB induced fitness cost remains largely unknown with the exception that compensatory mutations have
been found to ameliorate the fitness cost and have been associated with transmissibility. The current
advancements in next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables us to generate and compare the
transcriptomic profiles of rpoB mutations with various levels of fitness. Using this technology, we aim to elucidate
how different resistance-conferring rpoB mutations alter the function of RNA polymerase and thereby the
transcriptome, how a transcriptome evolves with the addition of a compensatory rpoC mutation and whether the
combination of these events alters fitness and the propensity of the isolate to not only acquire additional
resistance but also to influence drug susceptibility to second-line drugs. Furthermore to elucidate how different
fitness mutations influence their respective transcriptomes to ensure survive within the host environment as well
as to determine the host gene expression response to the mutated M. tuberculosis (MTB). We propose to
address these questions using the following three aims: 1) Determine how the combination of different rpoB
mutations with or without a compensatory (rpoC) mutation influences the transcriptome of MTB, 2) Determine
the in vivo transcriptome of MTB harbouring different fitness rpoB mutations with or without a rpoC mutation and
3) Determine whether poor treatment outcome of rifampicin-resistant MTB is related to rpoB mutations
influencing the MIC of second-line anti-TB drugs in vivo. To achieve these aims we will select rpoB in vitro
mutants with a clinically relevant genetic background which has been associated with TB outbreaks and a
predisposition to develop multidrug resistance. Competition fitness assays will be used to select isolates
harbouring rpoB mutations spanning the spectrum of in vitro growth fitness phenotypes. Mutations in rpoC will
be engineered into the selected rpoB mutants, and RNA-seq will be used to determine the transcriptomic profiles.
Macrophages will be infected to determine how stress changes the transcriptome of the bacteria and whether
these mutants have an effect on the macrophage itself using dual RNA-seq. Genes governing and compensating
for fitness together with regulatory genes (as seen in preliminary data) will be identified using a in silico modelling.
Lastly, mutants will be exposed to second-line drug to determine whether they more rapidly acquire additional
resistance and decreases susceptibility to second-line drugs thereby resulting in poor treatment outcome for
MDR strains. Understanding how pathogenicity of fitness, drives the evolution of resistance acquisition and
transmission of rifampicin resistance strains, thereby adapting patient management programs."

The mission of the Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to train clinician-scientist leaders
of the future. Our program is designed to mentor a diverse group of trainees whom we individually guide on
their journeys to develop the technical, operational, and professional skills to support a productive career in
which they integrate research and clinical activities to advance biomedical science. In order to fulfill our mission
of developing these future clinician-scientist leaders, we propose four measurable objectives that will serve as
the foundation of our program: 1) To provide a fully integrated scientific and clinical training program that will
help trainees develop the skills needed to recognize and address important clinical problems while
simultaneously enabling our graduates to move easily between research and clinical environments; 2) To
develop a diverse group of future leaders who possess the self-confidence and communication skills to share
scientific concepts with colleagues and individuals at all scientific levels as well as scientific and political leaders;
3) To encourage trainees to develop self-reflective skills that will lead to rigor in their own science and recognition
of instances where rigor and reproducibility tenets may be lacking; and 4) To provide trainees with experiences
that reflect their own long-term scientific goals in academia or other careers. This MSTP admits nine MD-PhD
trainees per year from a pool of over three hundred applicants. Ninety-six carefully vetted and trained laboratory
mentors will provide a safe learning environment and guide rigorous research. The co-Directors, Drs. Schimmenti
and Kaufmann, have over thirty years of combined experience in MD-PhD leadership and are committed to the
success and well-being of every trainee. Under-represented trainees make up seventeen percent of the trainee
cohort, with planned enrollment of twenty percent at the end of the 2021 admissions season. Mayo Clinic’s three-
part mission comprised of patient care, research, and education, provides a rich environment for training. The
average time to degree for the last ten years of graduates is 8.18 years, with a mean of 4.3 first author papers
per trainee and 8.7 total papers per trainee. Trainees are required to submit an F award or equivalent; and the
success rate over the last ten years has been 58%. Trainees match well, with three of five trainees matching in
physician scientist training programs in 2021. A self-reflective iterative evaluation process has been developed
and implemented to support cycles of program improvement with goals to support rigor and reproducibility
training, trainee retention, a diverse learning community, decreased time to degree, scholarship, and career
satisfaction. The long-term goal of the program is to provide each dual-degree graduate a firm foundation for a
lifetime of career success in research and research related fields."

Our studies in mice show that inhaled exposures during development to concentrated ambient ultrafine particle
(UFP) air pollution produces neuropathological and behavioral features common to 3 male-biased disorders,
i.e., schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
providing biological plausibility to a growing epidemiological literature linking these disorders to air pollution. In
fact, the observed features in mice are intriguingly similar to those of SCZ. Our studies were not specifically
designed to test these connections. Therefore, the proposed application seeks to determine the specific
contribution of developmental UFP exposures to SCZ and the mechanisms initiating these adverse effects and
their sex-dependency. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that developmental UFP exposures will produce, in a UFP
concentration-dependent manner, classic as yet unexamined characteristics of SCZ (alterations in cytokine
profiles, reductions in parvalbumin interneurons and synaptic density and altered pre-pulse inhibition). SCZ has
been linked to increased serum copper (Cu), and markedly elevated brain Cu levels in mice were found after
developmental UFP exposure. Excess brain Cu can also produce neurotoxic features consistent with SCZ.
Consequently, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that elevated Cu contamination in ambient UFP is a specific driver of
the observed SCZ features. Brain microglial colonization and activation is higher in male brain during the
period of our UFP exposures. Given the critical role of microglial activation and inflammation in SCZ, ASD and
ADHD, and the inflammatory and redox properties of AP and of Cu, Aim 3 tests the mechanistic role of
microglial activation as the initiating mechanism of neurotoxicity in males by administration of the microglial
activation inhibitor, minocycline. During adolescence, female brain exhibits greater microglial number/activation
state. Thus, Aim 3 also tests the hypothesis that adolescent UFP exposure will enhance vulnerability of
females. Findings from these studies assist in defining mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders and the
basis of their differential vulnerability by sex and a potential need for additional regulation of air pollution for
public health protection."
10620728,"Background: Our recent research demonstrated racial disparities in cesarean section delivery rates
among Veterans of color utilizing VA maternity care coordination (MCC) and delivering at community-
based hospitals. Disparate birth outcomes likely result from various factors that impact the Veteran at
multiple timepoints during the perinatal period; however, an in-depth examination of the social
determinants of health that may contribute to these disparities has yet to be conducted among
Veterans. This study will conduct an in-depth examination of the social and clinical factors leading to
cesarean deliveries among Veterans of color and test the feasibility of doula services to enhance VA
MCC in an effort to mitigate disparities in childbirth delivery outcomes among Veterans of color.
Significance: This novel study intensely examines the impact of the social determinants of health on
prenatal, labor & delivery, and postpartum care among Veterans of color in effort to mitigate
disparities in childbirth outcomes. This is the first study to test the feasibility of an enhanced MCC
model that incorporates doula services to improve pregnancy outcomes. The proposed study is
directly responsive to several HSR&D priorities including health equity, women Veterans’ health,
access to care, and care coordination.
Innovation and Impact: This is the first VA study to examine social determinants of health among
Veterans of color who have delivered babies using the VA Maternity Care benefit. It is also the first
study to examine the feasibility of a doula program that complements VA MCC support for Veterans of
color, who are at an increased risk for cesarean delivery.
Specific Aim 1: Conduct an in-depth investigation with Veterans of color to better understand their
recent cesarean deliveries, using semi-structured interviews and systematic obstetrical chart reviews.
Specific Aim 2: Test the feasibility of an enhanced VA Maternity Care Coordination program which
incorporates doula care to ensure Veterans of color are receiving continuous support throughout
pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period.
Specific Aim 3: Share our study findings (Aims 1 & 2) with VA stakeholders, including Women’s
Health Services leadership, through expert roundtable sessions. Utilize the qualitative data from these
proceedings to further inform a larger intervention that will seek to reduce childbirth delivery disparities
among Veterans of color.
Methodology: This is a mixed methods study that will utilize existing survey data and obstetrical chart
audits to augment qualitative interviews in an effort to better understand the impact of social
determinants of health and the role continuous perinatal support has on Veterans.
Next Steps/Implementation: We plan to disseminate findings among our key stakeholders through
expert roundtable discussions. The findings from these sessions will promote and inform a larger VA
intervention that will seek to further mitigate childbirth delivery disparities among Veterans. Our
findings may result in (1) an improved understanding of the impact of the social determinants on the
prenatal and childbirth labor and delivery outcomes among Veterans of color; (2) an understanding of
the feasibility of collaborative teams comprised of VA Maternity Care Coordinators and doulas in
providing continuous prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum support to Veterans; (3) a
stakeholder informed intervention developed to address the social determinants of health in effort to
improve the quality of care for racial and ethnic minority pregnant Veterans."

The ability to localize sound sources and detect temporal features of sound is fundamental to
hearing. Encoding this information within the first few auditory processing stations requires
reliable and precise synaptic transmission in response to rapid and large fluctuations of upwards
to the kilohertz range in action potential (AP) firing rates. However, the number of synaptic
vesicles (SVs) available for AP-evoked release is limited. Many auditory brainstems synapses
must sustain fast and repetitive SV release to encode sound information. Therefore, sound
encoding places great demands on the temporal dynamics of SV release and replenishment. A
key step regulating AP evoked SV release is priming, the process that creates fusion competent
SVs in close proximity to voltage-gated CaV2 channels (CaV). The rate of priming and SV
replenishment is highly dependent on the magnitude of presynaptic Ca2+ through CaV2 channels.
Human mutations in the molecules regulating priming result in dysregulation of SV release which
is the cause of many auditory and neurological disorders.
In mammals, the pathway between the globular bushy cells (GBCs) and the medial nucleus of
the trapezoid body neurons (MNTB) is critical for encoding sound localization and temporal
features of sound in music and communication found in animal vocalizations to human speech.
The GBC axon forms the calyx of Held, a glutamatergic presynaptic terminal, that is the sole input
that drives AP spiking in the MNTB. The calyx uses fast SV release kinetics to relay the patterns
of afferent AP spikes in the cochlear nucleus to the MNTB. This, in turn, results in rapid and
precise inhibition of key mono- and binaural cell groups. It is emerging that aberrant MNTB
signaling underlies sound localization and speech perception defects in the aging population and
can contribute to central auditory defects found in neurological disorders. Therefore, our goal is
to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the temporal dynamics of SV release and
replenishment required for proper auditory information processing. Given the importance of
priming in synaptic transmission, as well as the pathological consequences of aberrant SV
release, our findings will provide fundamental insights into how information is encoded by the
nervous system and are expected to facilitate the development of treatments for a wide range of
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Dexterous manipulation of objects relies on brain computations that integrate neural signals encoding tactile
signals on the skin with the proprioceptive state of the hand. In particular, neural ensembles that encode tactile
motion on the skin are critical because they provide feedback signals to motor planning areas to indicate whether
an object is slipping from the hand. Although we have a good understanding of how tactile motion signals are
represented in the brain, this knowledge has been accrued from studies that placed the hand in a fixed position.
Indeed, all studies that have investigated tactile motion mechanisms at the single-cell level have done so in
animals not performing a motion discrimination task, and with their hands placed in a fixed posture. These studies
show that tactile motion can be represented in area 1 by cells that integrate different tactile cues of the object
(e.g., direction, speed, and saliency). However, our recent work in humans shows that perception of tactile motion
on a finger is modulated by the proprioceptive state of the hand, and the body part location in which motion
judgements are made relative to (i.e., the reference frame). These findings indicate that current models of
tactile motion require major revisions. That is, neural models of tactile motion should take into account how
motion representations in touch are transformed by proprioception and/or reference frame signals. Thus, the
overarching goal of this application is to determine the neural areas and mechanisms that generate
reference frame-specific representations of tactile motion.
Key to determining the single-cell mechanisms that mediate reference frame-specific representations of tactile
motion is to record activity in non-human primates (NHPs) discriminating tactile motion stimuli in different
reference frames, and with their hands placed in different postures. Unfortunately, our field does not have an
established paradigm, or training regime, to study these motion mechanisms in a NHP. In Aim I, we develop a
behavioral paradigm to train NHPs to discriminate the motion direction of stimulus on a finger (e.g., index finger)
in different reference frames (e.g., relative to the center of the body, or the thumb), while their hands are placed
different proprioceptive states (e.g., pronated vs. supinated). In Aim II, we will record single-unit activity in
somatosensory cortex (area 1) in trained NHPs to determine the neural computations that generate reference
frame-specific representations of tactile motion. Our behavioral experiments will test that perceptual
representations of tactile motion are conserved across NHPs and humans, demonstrating that NHPs are a viable
species to study neural mechanisms of tactile motion at the single cell level. Our neurophysiology experiments
will test whether motion selective neurons in area 1, the tactile analogue of medial temporal (MT) cortex for visual
motion, flexibly represent motion in different reference frames. This project will demonstrate, for the first time,
behavioral and neurophysiological evidence of NHPs performing tactile motion discrimination tasks, a crucial
prerequisite for a competitive R01-type application."

Undiagnosed diseases clinics and newborn intensive care unit rapid genome sequencing programs have
emerged as the primary settings for diagnosing patients with complex phenotypes. Subspecialty clinics,
pharmaceutical companies, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies are increasingly adopting these
technologies for diagnosing patients, or studying disease with the goal of developing treatments. In all cases, a
diagnostic, or research analysis approach based on comprehensive genomic sequencing data, and, crucially,
collaborative analysis by expert teams has been adopted. The team-based approach leverages the expertize
of a wide array of specialists, for example, the physician's knowledge of the patient's phenotypes and family
history; the medical geneticist's knowledge of genetic diseases; the bioinformatician's and variant scientist's
expertise in interpreting the potential diagnostic role of individual genetic variants; the genetic counselors
expertize in synthesizing all available data, and coordinating with patients, families and treating physicians. A
patient's phenotypes, and more frequently, the myriad sources of evidence used to support the diagnostic role
of variants, genes, and their associations with disease evolve over time, and consequently research and
diagnostic analysis is a long-term process. Existing tools focus on analysis at a single point in time, and require
over-burdened genetic counselors to manually evaluate cases for changes, or miss the opportunity for
diagnosis due to a lack of evidence at the time of evaluation. Here, we propose to build a commercial software
system to address two pressing needs faced by consumers of genomic sequencing data. First, a complete
end-to-end bioinformatic pipeline to process raw sequencing data to lists of prioritized genetic variants, and
structural variant calls, which explicitly includes an automated (or manually triggered) data re-analysis pipeline
to support long-term genomic care. Second, a comprehensive, versatile, and yet easy-to-use visualization
platform will seamlessly display all genomic data and metadata to the analysis teams in web applications
custom designed to address the needs of the diverse experts collaborating on these projects. We will evaluate
and refine this product in our undiagnosed diseases clinic and our newborn intensive care unit, ideal settings to
garner critical feedback and suggestions from teams representative of the initial target market for this tool."

The Penn Diabetes Research Center (DRC) participates in the nationwide interdisciplinary program established
over four decades ago by the NIDDK to foster research in diabetes and related metabolic disorders. The mission
of the Penn DRC is to support and develop successful approaches to the prevention, treatment, and cure of
diabetes mellitus. Administered by the University of Pennsylvania, the Penn DRC currently serves 134 diabetes-
oriented investigators, primarily from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School
but also from other Schools within the University as well as collaborating local institutions including Thomas
Jefferson University, Temple University School of Medicine, the Monell Chemical Senses Institute, the Wistar
Institute, Drexel University, and Rutgers University. Overall direct costs of $89M support the work of these
investigators. The Penn DRC is highly interactive and interdisciplinary, representing many basic science and
clinical departments. The Research Base of the Penn DRC is organized in 4 Units: 1) Type 1 Diabetes, with a
focus on beta cell biology and Pathology; 2) Type 2 Diabetes, focused on signaling by insulin and other
hormones; 3) Obesity; and 4) Complications. The Complications Unit includes Programs in Cardiovascular
Metabolism and Diabetic Nephropathy. The Penn DRC facilitates and supports diabetes research in a variety of
ways. Six Biomedical Research Cores facilitate the work of Penn DRC investigators: Functional Genomics Core;
Islet Cell Biology Core; Rodent Metabolic Phenotyping Core; Radioimmunoassay/Biomarkers Core; and
Transgenic Mouse Genome Editing Core. Collaborative research and application of emerging technologies to
diabetes investigation are further promoted by the Regional Metabolomics and Fluxomics Core at Princeton. A
Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program that has been highly successful over decades serves to nurture new
investigators and to foster new initiatives in diabetes research. A broad and intensive Enrichment Program
organizes weekly Diabetes and Endocrinology Research seminars, special events, and an annual Spring
Diabetes Symposium, all designed to enhance communication and collaboration of Penn DRC investigators
while keeping them abreast of the latest discoveries. Penn DRC investigators mentor trainees at every level
(undergraduate, predoctoral, and post-doctoral Ph.D., M.D., and combined M.D./Ph.D.), and the Enrichment
Program provides a superb environment for training in diabetes research. The Biomedical Cores, Pilot and
Feasibility Grant Program, and Enrichment Program are coordinated and publicized by an Administrative Core
that governs the DRC. Its organizational structure, including the Director and Associate Directors, Executive
Committee, Committee of Core Directors, Academic Enrichment Program Directors, and external as well as
internal advisory boards, functions to maintain the diabetes-related research at the Penn DRC at the forefront of
biomedical science."

Organ-specific autoimmunity requires a series of precise cellular interactions to coordinate target cell destruc-
tion within complex tissues. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease of the skin in which cytotoxic CD8+ T cells target
pigment-making melanocytes, which results in disfiguring white spots that are particularly devastating for those
with darker skin. Vitiligo is an ideal disease in which to investigate mechanisms of organ-specific autoimmunity
because disease phenotype can be directly correlated to molecular pathways. That is, affected skin can be ob-
served and sampled, target cells and antigens are known, and translational research tools are available. Viti-
ligo shares genetic risk alleles and other mechanisms with autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and mul-
tiple sclerosis, which are more difficult to study in human patients. Through vitiligo we can develop a compre-
hensive understanding of organ-specific autoimmunity as it progresses within human tissue.
Our objective is to determine the mechanisms by which autoreactive T cells navigate the skin, communicate
with neighboring cells, engage and destroy melanocytes, and create long-term memory of autoimmunity di-
rectly within vitiligo lesions. We generated an extensive set of high-resolution, translational multiomics data
from vitiligo patient skin and assembled it into an integrated communication network among multiple cell types
that coordinate disease progression. This provides clues into vitiligo pathogenesis that must now be validated,
dissected, and reassembled to reveal fundamental concepts of autoimmunity. Thus, we hypothesize that auto-
reactive T cell function is carefully coordinated by cellular signals within the microenvironment of the epidermis.
To test this hypothesis, we will leverage existing data, a multidisciplinary team of leading investigators, cutting
edge tools designed for discovery, and an innovative strategy to discover how skin cells coordinate autoim-
munity during vitiligo. Project 1 will investigate Autoreactive T cell Function in Vitiligo to determine how autore-
active T cell clonal diversity and localization define the clinical disease phenotype and coordinate melanocyte
destruction. Project 2 will focus on Cell-Cell Communications and Tissue Memory in Vitiligo to dissect the
mechanisms by which ligand-receptor interactions coordinate T cell localization, function, and inflammatory
memory. These projects will be supported by the High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics Research Core us-
ing seq-FISH+ to translate our vitiligo multiomics data into a complete spatial understanding of cellular position
and communication within vitiligo lesions. The Administrative Core will promote communication, ensure scien-
tific achievement, and monitor fiscal management to support focus on research goals and implementation.
We expect to create an integrated understanding of coordinated cellular communications and interactions that
drive vitiligo pathogenesis. This will reveal fundamental mechanisms of autoimmunity and support better thera-
peutic approaches for these devastating diseases. The unique characteristics of vitiligo as well as our prelimi-
nary data, investigative team, and innovative plan provide us with an unparalleled opportunity for discovery."
10929327,"The overall goal of this Center of Research Translation is to utilize biomarker tools and other translational
research observations to discover new therapies for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This goal can be
broken down into four intermediate objectives: understanding pathogenic pathways through translational studies,
identifying informative biomarkers for SSc complications, applying bioinformatics and systems biology
approaches to interpret translational and biomarker data, and developing novel targeted therapeutics. Among
current obstacles to progress in finding new drugs for SSc patients is the continuing limited understanding of
SSc pathogenesis, in part due to its complexity and heterogeneity, and in part due to the lack of good animal
models. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine stands in a unique position for informative translational
studies into SSc due to special resources and intellectual talent. It has very large, longitudinal clinical-biological
SSc repositories in rheumatology and pulmonary divisions; it has the only large national experience in single
cell studies in both SSc skin and lungs; it has a strong experience in studying lung proteomics; it has pulmonary
experts in modeling lung disease using in vitro precision cut lung slices and ex vivo lung perfusion; it has a
highly sophisticated program studying pediatric localized scleroderma, as well as pediatric SSc; it has an
experienced and innovative systems biology group; and it has a vigorous drug discovery platform. In Project 1
investigators will expand preliminary observations using single cell RNA-seq, to understand the transcription
factors (TFs) associated with myofibroblast differentiation and discover latent factors/cytokine mediating
macrophage-fibroblast interaction in SSc and pediatric LS. In Project 2 investigators will examine the genomic
and proteomic landscape of patients with SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. Project 2 will also screen
and carry out preclinical studies of Smad3 translocation inhibitors using precision cut lung slices. In Project 3
investigators will study altered platelet energetics and utilize 18F-fluoroglutamine PET imaging to understand
the role of metabolic reprogramming and glutaminolysis in SSc-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Project aims will be supported by two resource cores: a Clinical and Biospecimen Core and a Systems Biology
Core. The former will include collecting comprehensive clinical data, acquiring skin biopsies and lung explant
tissue, and preparing precision cut lung slices. The latter will use a broad range of bioinformatics tools, including
novel methods for detecting stereospecific TF binding sites, and for discovering latent factors mediating cell-
cell interactions in scRNA-seq/multiome datasets. The Systems Biology Core will also synthesize proteomic
and genomic data in project 2, and integrate data from each project and across projects to develop models for
common molecular pathways associated with different disease manifestations. The focus of each of the
projects on different SSc clinical manifestations, mediators of disease, and drug inhibitors will provide a rich,
highly collaborative environment for fundamental discovery within bridging project topics and core resources."

Exposures to environmentally relevant chemicals, drugs, medications, and the ingestion of nutrients, and
how they perturb endogenous metabolism have been linked with many types of adverse health outcomes.
Our Hub has the resources, skilled staff, and knowledge to immediately provide Exposome services to
clients of the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) Program (RFA-ES-18-012). We initiated
our Untargeted Analysis Core in 2012 through a grant from the NIH Common Fund (C-F) Metabolomics
Program, and have established and applied metabolomics methods to hundreds of studies with over 30
organizations across the United States. These studies have included analysis of a wide range of
biospecimens (e.g., urine, serum, plasma, sweat, feces) with anchors to numerous types of health outcomes
in studies of maternal and child health, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes, and
response to treatment. The success of the NIH C-F Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics
Resource Core (ERCMRC) led to our establishing a Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource
(CHEAR) Hub as part of the NIEHS CHEAR Program. Under the CHEAR Program, we successfully
executed our goals, which included a) expanding our services to include high-throughput analysis of the
Exposome using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry, b) establishing an extensive in-house physical
standards library of exogenous and endogenous compounds run on the untargeted platform, and c)
participating in cross laboratory comparisons to reveal the range of environmentally relevant analytes
identified on our untargeted platform. Our untargeted methods result in tens of thousands of signals that are
annotated by matching to public databases, and annotated and identified against our in-house physical
standards library, using Big Data Analytics. Our core led the development of an evidence-based Ontology
System for the CHEAR Program, which ensures that the confidence in annotations and assignments will be
clearly communicated between Hubs. We have in place over 100 fine-tuned protocols that span the workflow
from receipt of samples through reporting data, and that have quality control/assurance procedures in place
for all steps of the workflow. The HHEAR Untargeted Hub will work within the HHEAR Network and other
HHEAR Hubs, the HHEAR Data Analysis Center (DAC), and the HHEAR Coordinating Center (CC) to
provide client services for Untargeted Analysis, and to work across the consortium to harmonize and
integrate results. The HHEAR Hub will be led under a Multiple PI Leadership Plan by Dr. Timothy Fennell
(Director, Administrative Core and the Development Core), Dr. Susan Sumner (Director, Untargeted Analysis
Resource), and Dr. Xiuxia Du (leader, Computational Exposome workflow). We are ready to provide
untargeted analysis for epidemiology investigations using a wide range of biospecimens and state-of-the-art
technologies, and analysis approaches to reveal the influence of the environment on disease."
10875597,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) encoding structural proteins of the nuclear lamina are responsible for
up to ten percent of cases of inherited dilated cardiomyopathy. The disease is often referred to as cardiac
laminopathy. Experimental evidence partially supports various pathogenic mechanisms of how defects in nuclear
structural proteins cause cardiomyopathy, including that they lead to abnormalities in cell mechanical stability,
dysregulation of gene expression and altered cell signaling. However, there is no unifying hypothesis integrating
these defective processes and explaining exactly how they lead to cardiomyocyte damage and dysfunction. We
recently found a surprising relationship between aberrant extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
signaling and altered nuclear positioning in cardiac laminopathy. This has led us to hypothesize the existence of
a mechanic checkpoint in which alterations in the nuclear lamina upregulate ERK1/2 activity, which causes
mispositioning of the nucleus by phosphorylating and inactivating the actin bundling activity of the formin
homology domain-containing protein (FHOD). Inactivation of FHOD prevents the linker of nucleoskeleton and
cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which spans the inner and outer nuclear membranes and connects to actin
filaments, to mediate nuclear positioning. Normally, the mechanical checkpoint acts to prevent excessive force
from being applied to the nucleus in contracting cardiomyocytes. However, with permanent alterations in nuclear
structure resulting from LMNA mutations, the persistently activated checkpoint becomes maladaptive, resulting
in abnormal nuclear positioning, nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage and defects in sarcomere function. This
Project is designed to prove the nuclear mechanical checkpoint hypothesis and determine its role in the
pathogenesis of cardiac laminopathy. In Aim 1, we will examine how activation of the mechanical checkpoint for
nuclear positioning alters cardiomyocyte biology. We will directly measure force on the nucleus using a nesprin-
2 actin tension sensor. As recent data suggest that the nucleus contributes to normal sarcomere, we will test the
hypothesis that persistent mechanical checkpoint activation and nuclear mispositioning leads to defective
sarcomere assembly and function in cardiomyocytes. In Aim 3, we will determine how altering the mechanical
checkpoint affects the heart in vivo. We will test if expressing a phosphomimetic FOHD variant (checkpoint
activation) in the heart induces cardiomyopathy in wild type mouse hearts and if a non-phosphorylatable variant
(checkpoint inactivation) ameliorates pathology in a mouse model of cardiac laminopathy. Proving the existence
of a novel nuclear mechanical checkpoint and establishing its role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy caused
by LMNA mutations will shift research directions in the field and potentially lead to new treatments for this life-
threatening inherited heart disease."

This is a resubmission of R01 application AG062637 that is retitled to, “MIND Diet and Dementia Prevention in
Ischemic Stroke Patients.” The application is a Phase III randomized-controlled trial designed to test the effects
of a 3-year intervention of the MIND diet plus usual post-stroke care versus usual post-stroke care on cognitive
decline, brain biomarkers of AD and vascular disease, and on functional disability and depression in 500
patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke, aged 60-80 years and without dementia who are discharged
home following hospitalization. More than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke every year, the majority of
which (87%) are ischemic. The estimated cost is $34 billion each year. Stroke is the leading cause of serious
long-term disability. It is estimated that about half of survivors will experience cognitive impairment and
depression, and one third will develop post-stroke dementia. Dementia is a major and growing public health
problem that is amplified by the lack of effective cures or therapies to ameliorate the disease progression and
symptoms. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary interventions using the DASH and Mediterranean diets,
have been demonstrated to preserve or improve cognitive function and depression in older adults at high
cardiovascular risk, however, it is unknown whether diet is an effective therapeutic intervention in stroke
survivors. Importantly, dietary recommendations are highly desired by stroke patients and their families. The
MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) is a hybrid of the Mediterranean
and DASH diets but with selected modifications based on foods and nutrients that are important to brain health.
The MIND diet has the same basic components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, such as emphasis on
natural plant-based foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods, but uniquely specifies green leafy
vegetables and berries as well as food component servings that reflect the nutrition-dementia evidence. The
trial will employ a parallel group design comparing the effects of the MIND intervention (3 months of delivered
MIND meals followed by dietary counseling) versus usual post-stroke care (3 months of delivered self-selected
meals followed by general stroke health counseling) on decline in cognitive function and functional abilities,
and depressive symptoms. Biological effects of the MIND diet will be assessed by change in measures of
retinal imaging-derived amyloid beta plaque accumulation, and MRI-derived brain macro- and micro-structural
integrity in 300 randomly selected participants. Other biochemical markers will be assessed over the treatment
period in the entire cohort of 500 participants, including: plasma Abeta 42/Abeta 40, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, the trial will examine
potential effect mediators and modifiers by a number of cardiovascular risk factors, AD biomarkers, and
biological mechanisms. The proposed study has three recruitment sites at comprehensive stroke centers in
Chicago and one clinical site at Rush University.

10660937,"Background: This CDA will provide me, Megan E. Vanneman, PhD, MPH, with the training and
experience to become an independent health services researcher who applies decision science and
informatics to improve Veterans’ access to and engagement in high-quality care. To help achieve this goal, I
will work with my mentors, consultants, and operational partners to develop and evaluate an information and
decision support tool to improve VA leaders’ understanding and decision-making about VA enrollment and
reliance (proportion of care received at VA) on primary and mental health care.
 Significance/Impact: This research will have a positive impact on VA leaders, Veterans interested in
enrolling in VA health care, and Veterans needing primary and mental health care, by increasing
understanding of how access, quality, enrollment, and reliance can be optimized to better meet Veterans’
needs. As the VA moves from a more closed, integrated healthcare system to providing care through networks
that include community partners, VA leaders need to better understand enrollment, reliance, access, and
quality at their local facilities and VISNs, particularly for “foundational services,” such as primary and mental
health care. The CDA strongly aligns with top VA priorities – increasing choice for Veterans, modernizing the
VA system, using VA resources more efficiently, and improving timeliness of services.
 Innovation: While we know that about 50% of Veterans enroll in VA and that about 50% of care for these
enrollees is provided in the VA, we have little understanding of what drives these decisions for recently
separated Servicemembers – those who participated in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Preliminary studies
show that there is wide variation in VA facility enrollment rates, but we do not have data on variation in VA
facility reliance rates. Furthermore, we do not understand what drives these differences. Although there is
some understanding of individual (e.g., age) and community-level (e.g., non-VA provider supply) factors that
influence VA enrollment and utilization, we lack understanding of facility factors that can be modified to
appropriately connect Veterans to VA and needed services thereafter.
 Specific Aims: The research plan has three primary goals: 1) Learn what information and resources VA
facility and VISN leaders need to better understand and manage enrollment rates and reliance rates for
primary and mental health care; 2) Derive insights on facility factors by evaluating relationships among
enrollment rates, reliance rates, access to care, and quality of care for primary and mental health care; and 3)
Develop or modify existing information tool(s) to assist facility and VISN leaders to manage enrollment and
reliance rates for primary and mental health care.
 Methodology: This CDA seeks to fill the gap in understanding on enrollment and reliance for primary and
mental health care through a mixed-methods approach by: producing descriptive data on facility enrollment
and reliance rates (Aim 1.1); qualitatively studying Veterans’ insights on their decisions regarding enrollment
and reliance in interviews involving VA enrollees and non-enrollees (Aim 1.2); interviewing VA leaders about
their information needs regarding enrollment and reliance (Aim 1.3); using hierarchical modeling to understand
what modifiable facility factors on access and quality are associated with enrollment and reliance rates (Aim 2);
and developing, testing, and implementing a tool to assist VA leaders to improve enrollment and reliance rates
(Aim 3).
 Next Steps/Implementation: Study results will help VA healthcare leadership target changes that they
can make to manage enrollment and retention of Veterans in the VA healthcare system and deliver needed
foundational services. Results will also inform my future work on information and resource allocation tools to
support Veterans’ and leaders’ decision making."

Basic research on newly discovered immune systems has led to the development of important molecular tools
for use in science and medicine. For example, eukaryotic antibodies are used to diagnose and treat disease,
prokaryotic restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA sequences in vitro, and prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas
adaptive immune systems are revolutionizing genome editing, gene therapy, and disease diagnostics.
Recently, several new immune systems have been discovered for which their function remains unknown. The
emphasis of this proposal is to determine the structure and function of two newly discovered CRISPR-Cas
adaptive immune systems with the primary objectives to (i.) fill gaps in our understanding of these biological
systems and (ii) provide the basic mechanistic knowledge necessary to develop these immune systems into
new life science tools. To better understand the function of these immune systems we are using cell-based and
biochemical assays, as well as structural methods such x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. We hope to
determine how these systems identify their targets, how they distinguish self from non-self, and how their
distinct genetic differences (protein domains and genes) impact their function.

10884893,"The pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been unknown, resulting in a lack of innovative
therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action. The Conte Center for Neuroimmune Studies was
created to build on our discovery that the biology underlying the most significant schizophrenia
common genetic risk variants involves neuroimmune mechanisms of synaptic pruning. We have
found that risk variants of the complement component C4 genes are correlated with increased
C4A expression in the brain and CSF, and that overexpression of human C4A in a mouse model
results in excess synaptic pruning and social behavioral deficits. We have further shown that
additional neuroimmune molecules encoded at schizophrenia risk loci, CD47 and CSMD1,
influence synaptic pruning and complement activity. Lastly, schizophrenia is unusual among
neurodevelopmental disorders in its late-adolescent/early-adult onset, and childhood adversity is
a major non-genetic risk factor for schizophrenia; yet the biological underpinnings of adolescent
psychiatric vulnerability are wholly unknown. We have identified a critical period of circuit
refinement in the mouse frontal cortex that we propose can be exploited to better understand the
unique vulnerability of adolescent brain development to psychiatric risk factors.
 The goals of the Center in our next five years are to both deepen the focus on C4-mediated
synaptic pruning as a pathophysiological mechanism, and expand the scope of our investigations
to create a fuller picture of neuroimmune pathways, their upstream regulators, their cellular
effectors, and their downstream circuit-level and behavioral impacts. Project 1 will investigate the
role of astrocytes, the main source of C4 in the brain, by manipulating schizophrenia risk genes
in these cells and assaying the impacts on synapse formation and function. Project 2 will spatially
map the brain’s transcriptional response to C4 overexpression, and test the therapeutic
hypothesis that inhibition of C4 activity may rescue over-pruning and associated behavioral
phenotypes. Project 3 will examine the circuit specificity of the adolescent critical period, the
impacts of gene-by-environment risk factor interactions, and the roles of the brain borders. Project
4 will explore circuit-level interactions between the basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the context
of adolescent development, psychiatric risk factors, and risk/reward decision-making. We will also
lay the groundwork for expanding neuroimmune studies of psychiatric risk to a non-human
primate model, the marmoset. Finally, our Administrative Core will facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration that exploits the full range of expertise across the four labs, and coordinate outward-
facing activities including the annual research symposium."

TRANSLATIONAL BIOSPECIMEN AND IMAGING BIOMARKER CORE
SUMMARY
The Translational Biospecimen and Imaging Biomarker Core Component (Core 2) is a unique, centralized
resource to support biospecimen and imaging data collection from radiation-treated patients and will provide
sample collection, processing, and sharing. These activities will be carried out for patients enrolled in clinical
trials of experimental radiotherapy at the two partnering sites using standardized protocols and procedures. This
core will 1) obtain voluntary, informed consent from oncology patients who will undergo or be evaluated for
radiation therapy to allow for: (i) identification, storage, and use of patients’ blood, tissue, and clinical information
for research purposes, (ii) linkage of clinical information to results from research performed on biospecimens in
cooperation with core 1, (iii) sharing and publication of de-identified data generated from scientific study; 2)
provide a comprehensive, secure and standardized process for collecting, annotating and storing imaging
biomarkers and biological specimens from patients who have undergone, will undergo or be evaluated for
radiotherapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Centers (UTMDACC); and 3) facilitate the conduct of basic and translational research to further personalize
therapy using imaging and blood biomarkers collected during the course of clinical care together with clinical
data. Core 2 will support innovative approaches in the projects, such as multiplexed protein analyses and
immunophenotyping and new imaging methods. The Core will facilitate translational biomarker studies based on
understanding of intrinsic tumor biology and lymphocyte alterations following proton versus photon radiotherapy,
which remains largely uncharacterized in the field of particle therapy. Moreover, supporting Project 1, the use
of imaging biomarkers to gain information on the effects of proton therapy on normal tissues as a function of
both dose and LET is highly innovative, as is the development of AI-based autosegmentation algorithms for MRI
and XNAT image analysis pipeline, including the voxel-based analysis of functional imaging for liver, central
nervous system and lung. Core 2’s support will enable novel understanding of the interaction of the immune
system with proton versus photon radiotherapy in Project 2. Project 3 will rely on Core 2 to provide human
tissue specimen for the creation of PDX models and a catalogue of cell lines available for preclinical research
across institutions, thereby harnessing the strengths of MGH and UTMDACC. The strength of Core 2 is that it
leverages the unique patient population and capabilities at the two Cancer Centers. The MGH site will contribute
20 years of expertise in circulating biomarker studies in over 40 clinical trials, while the UTMDACC site will
provide extensive experience in leading nationwide multicenter collaborative proton versus photon therapy
clinical and translational research that includes standardized procedures of patient enrollment, patient consent,
and biospecimen collections. Both sites will also provide superb imaging biomarker study capabilities and the
core will facilitate transfer of these datasets between the two centers."
10781885,"ABSTRACT
Although an orphan disease in the US with ~110,000 affected individuals, sickle cell disease (SCD) poses a
major medical-economic problem, with hospitalization costs of >$1 billion annually. Patients with SCD suffer
frequent vaso-occlusive pain episodes due to microvascular occlusion, hemolytic anemia, and a chronic
inflammatory state precipitated by ischemia-reperfusion injury, culminating in organ failure and a shortened life
expectancy. There are only four FDA-approved disease-modifying agents for SCD, including hydroxyurea (HU)
in 1998, Endari® (l-glutamine) in 2017 and more recently Adakevo® (crizanlizumab) and Oxbryta® (voxelotor)
in 2019. HU primarily acts by reversing the perinatal switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin (Hb) expression;
increasing the fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) content in red blood cells (RBCs) exerts a potent anti-sickling effect.
Long-term beneficial effects of HU on survival and preservation of organ function was documented in Multi-
Center Study of Hydroxyurea, based on a 17-year follow-up, and many other studies in adults and children with
SCD; despite these benefits, HU is underutilized in SCD. While the reasons for underutilization of HU are being
investigated in eight Centers in an NHLBI-funded implementation study, clinical experience suggests patients
have concerns about side effects, fertility, and carcinogenicity related to HU, thus creating an unmet need for
additional disease-modifying anti-switching therapies. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown
to induce Hb F expression in erythroid cultures, and in preclinical studies in mouse models of SCD, primarily by
inhibiting epigenetic silencing of the fetal (γ) globin genes via acetylation of histones and opening γ-globin genes
chromatin to activate transcription. We previously conducted an investigator-initiated phase I trial of the pan-
HDACi panobinostat in adults with SCD. Nine patients were treated with panobinostat 10 mg MWF, in three
cohorts on different dosing schedules. The drug was well tolerated without toxicities or side effects. A slight
increase in Hb F and F-cells was noted in the 10 mg MWF continuous treatment dose. To test the efficacy of
panobinostat, we propose to complete three Specific Aims: 1) Complete a phase I trial with escalating
panobinostat doses (18 total patients at 15 mg or 20 mg MWF on intermittent or continuous treatment). The
primary end-point is to establish the safety and tolerability of panobinostat in SCD patients. Secondary endpoints
will include monitoring changes in Hb F and F-cells. 2) Initiate a novel intervention to support study adherence,
Motivational Interviewing, which has been shown to be effective in helping individuals overcome barriers to
medication and treatment adherence in a variety of settings. 3) Define biomarkers predictive of panobinostat
treatment response. The acetylation of non-histone proteins including NFkB, STAT, and p53 and inflammatory
markers will be investigated. Furthermore, genome-wide biomarkers of histone acetylation will be discovered by
ChIPSeq and differentially expressed genes by RNASeq. This study will establish the safety of panobinostat in
SCD and will provide proof-of-concept for targeting multiple pathways to expand treatment options."

CFTR’s complex folding scheme leads to near-complete ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of the
common CF disease mutant, F508del CFTR, and of a significant fraction of the WT protein. Defects in protein
folding and aggregation underlie a diverse set of ~100 diseases, and their treatment requires an understanding
of the checkpoints that determine protein fate. We previously identified novel physical and functional
interactions of CFTR with the small heat shock protein (sHsp), Hsp27, which led to mutant CFTR conjugation
with the small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO. F508del CFTR was selectively degraded by this Hsp27/SUMO
pathway, by involving a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, to target mutant CFTR linked to SUMO-2/3
poly-chains. These findings identified the first nonnuclear pathway for SUMO modification and degradation of
an integral membrane protein. Protoarray analysis for SUMO binding proteins identified the SUMO E3 enzyme,
PIAS 4, which modifies CFTR with SUMO-1, a paralog that cannot form poly-chains, and therefore obviates
RNF4-mediated degradation. PIAS4 stabilizes the immature forms of WT, F508del and numerous rarer CFTR
misfolding variants, and it increased the efficacy of correctors of F508del CFTR trafficking to the plasma
membrane. With this Preliminary Data, the current proposal will evaluate the hypothesis that different SUMO
paralogs mediate CFTR biogenesis vs. degradation using different components of the SUMOylation pathway.
Aim 1 focuses on the mechanisms of PIAS4/SUMO-1 induced CFTR biogenesis. It asks whether and how
SUMO-1 modification stabilizes F508del, and it relies on purification of WT CFTR and its NBD subdomains, as
well as limited proteolysis to assess the mechanistic basis of PIAS4-induced stability. This aim examines the
mechanism of the SUMO paralog switch determines CFTR fate: biogenesis vs. degradation. Aim 2 explores
the generality of the ability of PIAS4/SUMO-1 to enhance corrector action for numerous rarer folding mutants,
which has allowed their partitioning into three classes of corrector response. Selected variants from these
groups will be examined to ask whether their behavior correlates with inherent differences in stability and
protease sensitivity. Aim 3 uses results from the SUMO Protoarray to identify HDAC6 as a mediator of non-
proteasomal degradation of specific mutants with the hypothesis that chaperone-mediated autophagy is
required for their disposal, and it will evaluate the ability of current small molecules to provide therapy of these
variants. It is critical that these studies of CFTR fate are performed in airway cells and wherever possible, in
differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelia (HBE), whose phenotype has been predictive of
small molecule efficacy in clinical studies. This project will provide a mechanistic understanding of new quality
control pathways and define their impact on the conflict between protein folding and degradation."

Conventional views of cancer as a predominantly genetic disease that proceeds in a step-wise, linear manner,
have ceded to an understanding that tumor progression involves a multifaceted set of tumor cell-intrinsic and
micro-environmental adaptations that co-evolve dynamically and non-linearly. However, much remains to be
discovered about how different cell populations in the local environment drive metastatic behavior at different
stages of tumor progression. Primary melanomas that are only millimeters thick can disseminate to lymph nodes
and distant organs. This clinical feature suggests that egress of tumor cells from a primary site occurs early in
melanoma development making melanoma an exceptional model to study these dynamic adaptations during the
earliest stages of tumor progression. Our central hypothesis is that melanoma metastasis is driven by a
combination of tumor cell–intrinsic features and interactions with micro-environmental compartments
that govern early dissemination and immune evasion in the regional draining lymph nodes. To test this
hypothesis, we propose three inter-related projects, supported by three cores that will collectively build an in-
depth transcriptional and cellular map of critical compartments in the tumor microenvironment during early
melanoma dissemination, in both mouse models and patient biospecimens. Successful completion of these
projects will identify genes and transcriptional programs within those compartments that drive and maintain
tumorigenic adaptations and ultimately metastatic dissemination. Our aims are to: 1. Map the cellular and
molecular evolution of primary melanomas and their local and regional microenvironments to identify critical
‘switches’ that drive non-linear tumor progression; 2. Mechanistically dissect the emergence and functional
relevance of transcriptionally defined cell state heterogeneity of malignant and non-malignant cell populations;
3. Identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities to intercept early dissemination, mobilize systemic immune
surveillance, and improve patient outcomes; and 4. Leverage the information gained to define new biomarkers
of melanoma metastasis. We expect that knowledge generated through our approach may define new
biomarkers of melanoma metastasis and therapeutic strategies to manage early disease. Our approach can
serve as a roadmap to study early tumor progression at an unprecedented level of cellular, spatial and temporal
resolution. It will provide a comprehensive picture of interactions both within the tumor microenvironment and
tumor draining lymph nodes that influence tumor cell behavior and condition the host to be receptive to metastatic
spread. We will leverage the complementary and synergistic expertise of our research team with an established
record of productive collaboration, our novel genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates early
progression of human melanoma, and our access to high quality, clinically annotated patient samples from over
4,700 patients enrolled in a prospective clinicopathological database. The scope and scalability of the knowledge
gained will serve other sites of the Metastasis Research Network."

Despite chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)
frequently suffer incurable disease relapse. Immune checkpoint blockade is a promising new therapeutic
approach for patients with UPS which promotes T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity. Still, the majority of
patients do not benefit. Radiation therapy (RT), a cornerstone of preoperative treatment of UPS, can instigate
T cell anti-tumor responses and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. But RT can also result in the
recruitment of immunosuppressive, pro-tumor myeloid cells that restrain anti-tumor T cell responses. This is
particularly relevant in UPS, which is characterized by a brisk myeloid cell infiltrate. The candidate
hypothesizes that reprogramming RT-induced myeloid cells toward an antigen-presenting, pro-inflammatory
phenotype will promote T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in UPS.
To investigate the hypothesis the candidate proposes studies using BO-112, a synthetic nanoplexed version of
poly I:C that activates double-stranded RNA sensing pathways, which are highly active in myeloid cells. These
studies will be conducted in murine models of UPS (Aim 1) as well as in UPS patients (Aim 2). In Aim 1, the
candidate will determine the impact of BO-112 on the fate, phenotype and immunomodulatory function of RT-
induced myeloid cells. In Aim 2, the candidate evaluates the capacity of BO-112, RT, and anti-PD1 immune
checkpoint blockade to remodel the myeloid compartment and instigate anti-tumor T cell responses in UPS
patients enrolled on a window of opportunity phase 1 clinical trial. These studies will provide key insight into
plasticity of RT-induced myeloid subsets, and their role in T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity, especially in
response to BO-112.
The candidate is an Assistant Professor in Radiation Oncology at UCLA specializing in the treatment of
sarcoma. His scientific track record in tumor immunology and cancer immunotherapy highlights his
commitment to an academic career in this field. The candidate's time is protected for research and career
development (80% effort), and he has the space, equipment, personnel and resources necessary to complete
the proposed studies. Along with his mentor, Dr. Antoni Ribas, and co-mentor, Dr. William McBride, the
candidate has developed a comprehensive career development and training plan that will build expertise in
four areas: (1) myeloid cell biology and plasticity, (2) genetic mouse models as tools to study sarcoma and the
immune system, (3) analysis and interpretation of high-dimensional single cell phenotyping and transcriptomic
data, and (4) conduct of a translational phase 1 clinical trial. These career development activities will support
completion of the proposal and facilitate the transition to an independent scientific career conducting bench-to-
bedside research, with an emphasis on leveraging translational immunology to transform the care of patients
with sarcoma."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurodegenerative condition that affects young adults
around the world. Despite enormous efforts for treatment discovery, progressive disability, accompanied by very
significant adverse personal, medical and economic costs, remains very common. An important reason that
contributes to the unenviable track record of clinical trial failure for progressive MS is our inability to monitor in a
precise manner the status of MS at any given time. Although it has been established that the inflammatory cells
within the brain, known as microglia, are active in the progressive phase of the disease and most likely dictate
outcome, we remain unable to differentiate between MS-mediator and reparative microglia. Therefore, there is
a dire need to develop techniques that identify the subsets of microglia in order to stratify patients and offer them
adequate treatment.
Positron emission tomography (PET) has recently gained huge success as a non-invasive imaging approach to
accurately quantify biological processes within the brain. Thus far, PET imaging in MS patients has been
restricted to imaging a radioactive molecule, i.e. radioligand, that binds to a protein known as TSPO. However,
the recently observed variation of the TSPO gene, with some patients lacking binding of the radioligands, and
its inability to distinguish the activity of microglia limits its utility as a clinical and research tool. Building on our
previous results showing the selective upregulated expression of a protein by reparative microglia, we will
develop radioligands that bind to this protein and can be used for diagnostic purposes via PET. This highly
translational research plan will enable clinicians to classify MS in novel ways to guide therapeutic intervention in
MS patients in ways not previously possible.
The specific aims of this project are to (i) design and synthesize next-generation radioligands with optimized
binding and CNS penetration; (ii) generate radioactive versions of leading compounds; (iii) validate the
radioligands in MS mouse brain slices and assess them by PET in MS mouse models.
Outcome: This work will result in a diagnostic reagent that, using imaging equipment, will help clinicians monitor
the status of progressive MS in patients being treated in a manner that has never been possible before and
improve the success rates of new MS drugs being tested in clinical trials."

Aging and age-related cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, along with their risk factors (e.g., insulin resistance,
inflammation, dyslipidemia, etc.), result from the complex interplay between genetic, lifestyle, and
environmental factors. American Indians (AIs) suffer disproportionately from these chronic cardiometabolic
conditions. Gut microbiota (bacteria, viruses, fungi, multicellular parasites, and archaea in our intestine) has
emerged as a novel, metabolically active “organ” that regulates many key biological processes and
physiological functions. Gut dysbiosis (imbalance in gut microbial community, e.g., loss of microbial diversity or
beneficial microbes, expansion of pathogenic microbes) has been associated with chronic metabolic disorders.
However, several fundamental knowledge gaps exist, e.g., what are the key microbial signatures associated
with aging and CMDs? What host factors shape the gut flora and how? What are the specific microbes or
microbial species in human gut, and how does their composition and function differ across different
populations/ethnic groups? Is the variation in human gut microbiota influenced by host genome, and if so, to
what extent? Despite these unknowns, it is well accepted that the gut microbiome varies significantly among
individuals and its composition heavily depends on an individual’s age, gender, geography, dietary preference,
lifestyle, health status, etc. Since AIs suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes, live on reservations or
other tribal lands, eat traditional food and medicine, and practice other unique lifestyles, it is possible that they
harbor different sets of disease- and health-associated gut microbiomes compared to other populations/ethnic
groups. The objectives of this study are to address these fundamental questions by generating the first
complete map of the human gut microbiome and identifying key microbial features associated with aging and
CMDs in American Indians. To achieve this, we will leverage the parent SHS Phase VII (funded by NHLBI as a
contract, 2019-2026) that will re-exam all living participants (N~=3,000) in 2020-2024 to collect stool samples
from 1,500 well-phenotyped AI participants. We will conduct whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing
and perform innovative statistical analyses to: (1) identify key age-related gut microbiome features associated
with biological aging (assessed by leukocyte telomere length) and CMDs (Aim 1); (2) identify host factors that
shape the human gut microbiota in AIs (Aim 2); (3) explore the mechanistic links between gut dysbiosis, aging,
and CMDs (Aim 3). Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms through which gut microbes interact
with host factors in leading to accelerated aging and CMDs, with an ultimate goal to develop novel, precision
therapeutic interventions (e.g., diet, drugs, live organisms, fecal microbiota transplantation) to promote healthy
aging and improve cardiometabolic health."

Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a lifetime prevalence of nearly 30%, with 14.4 million adults in
the US currently in need of treatment. Even with treatment, 50-80% of individuals relapse within a year.
Mechanisms underlying recovery are still not well understood, specifically individual differences underlying
relapse risk. Preliminary data: The work of others and our preliminary data support the involvement of at least
three neuro-behavioral mechanisms in the maintenance of AUD: 1) reward reactivity, 2) aversive reactivity and
3) executive control. Using a data-driven machine learning approach in a non-clinical community sample
(N=1204; 46% male), we demonstrated that the top predictors of alcohol abuse constituted independent,
additive factors of this three-domain model. Our preliminary analyses on subtyping in chronic poly-drug users
(N=40; 75% male) and individuals with past AUD (N=74; 32% male), demonstrated that data-driven machine
learning approaches can be used to study individual differences in these multi-factorial impairments. We found
three distinct ‘subtypes’ in AUD: a “reward drinker” type (increased reward reactivity), a “relief drinker” type
(increased aversive reactivity) and a “low functioning drinker” type (low executive control). Goals and
Hypothesis: The immediate goal of this project in AUD is to develop a sparse personalized relapse prediction
tool that can be employed in a treatment setting to continuously track relapse risk over time. The long-term
goal is to determine if relapse prevention interventions can be personalized. The underlying hypothesis is that
different combinations of independent factors underlie AUD maintenance and relapse per individual. We will
test this by Aim I: determining individual differences in function on three domains (reward reactivity, aversive
reactivity, executive control), and Aim II: evaluating the predictive power of subtype- or domain-specific relapse
prediction models versus an AUD-general model, to determine their respective clinical utility. Specific Aims: In
Aim 1, we will assess individual differences underlying AUD across the three domains of interest using a multi-
method approach (personality, neurocognition, clinical assessments, task/resting fMRI brain function) in a large
treatment cohort (N=200 AUD, 2-5 weeks into treatment, >40% female; N=100 controls). In Aim 2, we will
follow our sample clinically (+6, +12 months) and employ machine learning methods to evaluate if the patterns
of impairments underlying relapse risk are distinctly different between individuals. Innovation: This study
provides a) a systematic, multi-method assessment of the individual heterogeneity in the neuro-behavioral
mechanisms underlying AUD; b) an application of big data analytical approaches for relapse prediction to an
AUD dataset; and c) the development of sparse yet highly informative personalized relapse prediction tools.
Summary: This study will pave the way for the development of personalized relapse prediction tools that track
relapse risk in AUD over time. This can ultimately lead to the development of personalized treatment
approaches, with the potential to dramatically transform the current treatment landscape."

RNA viruses have had an immense impact on human health. SARS-CoV-2 is only the most recent of many RNA
viral zoonoses, and, even disregarding pandemics, the health burden of endemic RNA viruses, particularly in
vulnerable populations, is substantial. Epithelial cells, abundant and exposed at mucosal surfaces, are often the
first to be infected by RNA viruses, and are therefore often the first cell type to detect and respond to viral
infection. However, unlike circulating immune cells, their in vivo behaviors cannot be measured from blood
draws, and their behavior ex vivo may poorly correlate with in vivo dynamics. Our long-term goal is to understand
how epithelial cells coordinate anti-viral responses in a whole-animal setting.
 Our previous work demonstrated that the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) DRH-1 in the nematode C. elegans
activates an anti-viral transcriptional response in intestinal epithelial cells that we named the Intracellular
Pathogen Response (IPR), which protects against infections by viruses and other intracellular pathogens. We
found that DRH-1 responds to infection with Orsay virus–a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that
naturally infects C. elegans intestinal epithelial cells.
 The objective of this proposal is to determine where and how DRH-1 triggers resistance to Orsay virus
infection, and investigate whether in C. elegans, which lacks identified homologs of interferons, there is a role
for bystander cells in mounting an immune response. The central hypothesis is that upon Orsay virus infection,
DRH-1 in intestinal epithelial cells detects viral replication and induces the IPR, signaling to neighboring cells
through an as-yet undescribed pathway. The rationale is based on our genetic analysis of DRH-1 and its role in
anti-viral responses, and our visualization of IPR gene expression and DRH-1 localization dynamics in the
context of infection. Our work is innovative because we are pursuing the IPR, which shares similarity with the
type-I interferon (IFN-I) response in humans, but excitingly, appears to signal through novel factors, as homologs
of MAVS, IRF3, NFkB, TNF-alpha and IFN-I itself are absent from the C. elegans genome.
 We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims: Aim 1) Where and how does DRH-1/RLR promote
anti-viral defense in C. elegans? Aim 2) What signaling pathway is activated downstream of DRH-1/RLR in C.
elegans? Aim 3) Which host cells mount an anti-viral immune response in C. elegans? The expected outcomes
are to establish the signaling cascade used by DRH-1/RLR to trigger the protective IPR immune response in
intestinal epithelial cells of C. elegans, and to identify the components of a systemic defense system. The
proposed research is significant, because it could lead to new treatments for infections by RNA viruses, as well
as a better understanding of epithelial immune defense and inflammatory diseases."

Hypertension is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Longstanding racial and ethnic
disparities in hypertension prevalence and outcomes persist, in part because interventions shown to be
effective in clinical trials have not been translated into clinical practice. The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)
degree prepares experienced nurses to expertly manage chronic conditions and improve healthcare delivery
through continuous translation of emerging evidence into clinical practice. The number of DNP graduates is
growing, but structured translational research training opportunities with expert mentors in clinical settings are
lacking, and DNP graduates report the need for additional didactic and hands-on skill building.
The overarching goal of the Translational Research and Implementation Science for Nurses (TRAIN) program
is to prepare DNP students for leadership in translational research to improve hypertension outcomes and
reduce disparities therein. TRAIN is a novel 12-week summer program that will offer 8 DNP students an
enhanced curriculum incorporating translational research methods with a special focus on implementation
science related to hypertension prevention and management in diverse communities. The objectives TRAIN
are to: (1) pair motivated DNP students from diverse backgrounds with mentors to gain direct experience on a
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute mission-relevant clinical or health services research project; (2)
provide participants with a didactic curriculum that enhances training in the principles and methods of
translational research; (3) enhance participants’ research-related technical, communication and career-building
skills and confidence to facilitate successful participation and leadership in translational research; and (4)
encourage sustained mentorship and professional network building by establishing forums for ongoing contact
and collaboration between program faculty, alumni, and current participants.
The specific aims of TRAIN are to: (1) Develop, implement, iteratively refine, and sustain the 12-week summer
program delivered via hands-on mentored research experience and classroom instruction; (2) Recruit and
retain diverse cohorts of DNP students from underrepresented communities and disadvantaged backgrounds
in the New York Metropolitan region via existing partnerships with schools of nursing; (3) Establish a network
of TRAIN alumni and disseminate program resources to support training for diverse cohorts in other healthcare
settings nationally; and (4) Evaluate the impact of TRAIN on student competencies, self-efficacy, and career
trajectory using pre- and post- self-assessments, faculty assessments, and career goal assessments. The
TRAIN Program will leverage the extensive research education resources of the Center for Nursing Research
and Innovation at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai."

During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of
measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain
function both in healthy and diseased individuals. While functional MRI (fMRI) provides a wealth of information
by measuring the indirect slow hemodynamic signals. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the
electrophysiological activity directly with a millisecond resolution. During the past twelve years we have
developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing,
source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain
regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented
interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend
our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in MEG/EEG as well
as in invasive electrophysiological recordings. Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPMs) are sensitive room-
temperature magnetic field sensors that have begun to provide movable, flexible, lightweight, on-scalp MEG
systems, and may soon provide higher signal-to-noise ratio and more complete spatial frequency sampling
than SQUID-based systems. However, analysis tools optimal processing of OPM-MEG data are largely
missing. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will introduce tools for High-Resolution On-Scalp OPM-MEG Data Analysis.
Electrocorticography (ECoG) and subcortical EEG (sEEG) provide focal spatial measurements of the
electrophysiological activity. In Aim 2, we will develop sEEG and ECoG workflows, which includes electrode
localization and intracranial inverse and forward modeling. Recent methodological advances by our group and
the availability of on-scalp OPM-MEG systems (Aim 1) and ECoG/sEEG (Aim 2) have expanded the
possibilities for improved localization of deep (cortical and subcortical) sources in basic and clinical research
applications. In Aim 3, we will introduce these methods to the repertoire of MNE-Python and will use phantom
recordings, human data with known ground truth, and existing MEG databases to validate the new methods.
Finally, in Aim 4, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring
multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training
workshops."

The precise and largely stereotyped connectivity patterns of neurons underlie simple knee-jerk like reflexes and
complex behavior, like playing the violin. While we have a good understanding of the conserved genetic and
molecular mechanisms that drive the initial steps of nervous system formation, we possess a far more
rudimentary knowledge of those that drive neural circuit formation and animal behavior. By focusing on the
development and function of the Drosophila adult ventral nerve cord (VNC), which controls behaviors, such as
walking, flying, and grooming, our research leverages the power of the fly model system to dissect the genetic
and cellular basis of neural circuit formation and behavior.
Like the vertebrate spinal cord, the Drosophila adult VNC is composed of segmentally repeated pools of lineally
related neurons. In Drosophila, these pools of neurons are termed hemilineages and are the basic developmental
and functional unit of the VNC. We have previously mapped the embryonic stem cell origin, axonal projection
pattern, transcription factor expression, and neurotransmitter usage of all 34 hemilineages that comprise the
adult VNC. In general, however, we lack a clear understanding of the behaviors each hemilineage regulates, the
neural circuits within which each hemilineage resides, and most of all the genes that act within each hemilineage
to regulate its connectivity and associated behaviors. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the functions of
two conserved transcription factors – the homeodomain-containing protein Hb9 and the Pou-domain containing
protein Acj6 – in regulating neuronal connectivity and behavior in each of the six hemilineages in which they are
expressed (aim 1), to map each Acj6- or Hb9-positive hemilineage to its associated neural circuit and behavior(s)
(aim 2), and to construct a split-GAL4 library that will allow one to uniquely target gene and cell function in every
hemilineage in the adult VNC (aim 3). Successful completion of these aims will initiate a systematic dissection
of the transcriptional regulatory networks that act within the adult VNC to govern neuronal connectivity and
behavior and help build a comprehensive map that links all VNC hemilineages to their associated neural circuits
and behaviors. It will also create a genetic toolkit that will allow any lab to dissect gene and cell function in
essentially any hemilineage of the adult VNC, facilitating the elucidation of the genetic and cellular basis of
behavior. Given the strong parallels between the molecular pathways that govern CNS development in flies and
vertebrates, our research holds great potential to uncover conserved genetic principles that underlie neural circuit
formation and behavior from flies to humans."
10789843,"Ductal carcinoma is the most common form of breast cancer and progresses to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
when the carcinoma invades through the basement membrane (BM) into the stromal tissue. Invasion is a key
step in ductal carcinoma progression that is associated with an increased likelihood for metastasis, the most
deadly aspect of breast cancer. During metastasis, cancer cells must also invade BM during intravasation and
extravasation. The overall goal of our work is to determine how matrix mechanical plasticity (malleability)
regulates breast cancer invasion and migration. In the initial 5-year phase of this R37 award, we found that breast
cancer tissue is mechanically plastic, and that individual breast cancer cells can migrate through nanoporous
matrices independent of proteases using invadopodia if the matrix exhibits sufficient matrix mechanical plasticity.
We also found that increased covalent crosslinking of the matrix or increased stiffness inhibits invadopodia
formation, and that cancer cells can utilize filopodia to migrate along soft basement-membrane-like substrates if
the substrate is sufficiently viscoelastic or malleable. We have also pursued related lines on inquiry, finding that
extracellular matrix viscoelasticity regulates cell-cycle progression, that cancer cells generate force in order to
undergo mitotic elongation and divide in confining type-1 collagen rich matrices, that increased stiffness
regulates breast cancer progression through a YAP-independent mechanism, and that increased stiffness
induces broad changes in the epigenome that functionally mediate a stiffness-induced malignant phenotype in
mammary epithelium. While our initial studies on the role of malleability in invasion focused on single cell invasion,
initial invasion of the BM during cancer progression is thought to be collective in nature, involving the coordinated
activity of multiple cells. The specific hypothesis to be tested in this R37 extension application is that matrix
mechanical plasticity (malleability) is a key physical parameter mediates collective invasion of the BM and
subsequent migration through the type-1 collagen rich stromal matrix during cancer progression. This hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Determine how basement membrane mechanical
plasticity (malleability) mediates collective cell invasion; (2) Determine how mechanical plasticity (malleability) of
type-1 collagen rich matrices mediates collective migration of breast cancer cells. This approach is innovative
because of its focus on understanding the role of malleability in mediating protease-independent and -dependent
invasion and migration, as malleability is a physical characteristic of ECM, related to matrix viscosity but distinct
from elasticity or density, which has been largely ignored in studies to date. This work is also innovative in its
focus on collective invasion of the basement membrane instead of single cell invasion. The proposed research
is significant because it will reveal the role of ECM malleability in mediating both protease-dependent and
protease-independent collective invasion and migration by breast cancer cells, potentially uncovering previously
un-described modes of invasion or migration."

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is recognized as a primary barrier to the safe, effective management of blood glucose
in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In previous experiments in the dog, we observed that C-peptide infusion
augmented glucagon secretion and hepatic glucose production during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The
proposed experiments will determine the translational impact of this finding in patients with and without T1D.
We will also use the canine model to further explore the mechanistic basis of this protective effect.
Specific Aim #1 is to determine, in healthy control subjects, the effect of C-peptide co-infusion with insulin on
endogenous glucose production (EGP) and counterregulatory hormone levels during hypoglycemia. This will
be addressed by studying a single group of healthy subjects two times. In both studies, hypoglycemia will be
induced with an intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin. During one study, C-peptide will be infused during the
hypoglycemic period, and in the other study, saline will be infused. EGP is our primary variable, with secondary
analyses including counterregulatory hormones and metabolic substrates.
Specific Aim #2 is to determine, in T1D patients, the effect of C-peptide co-infusion with insulin on EGP and
counterregulatory hormone levels during hypoglycemia. The research plan for this Aim is very similar to that of
Aim #1, with the main exception being that we will study T1D patients instead of healthy controls (e.g., two
hypoglycemic clamp studies where C-peptide is administered during one study and saline during the other). In
addition, the glycemic levels of these T1D patients will be monitored for 10 days prior to this visit to ensure that
they do not experience hypoglycemia which could confound the data for the metabolic studies. Similar to Aim
#1, EGP is our primary outcome variable, with secondary analyses including hormone and substrate levels.
Specific Aim #3 is to determine, in T1D patients, the impact of C-peptide infusion on glucoregulatory responses
to a mixed meal challenge. For this Aim, we will work with the same T1D subjects we did for Aim #2. Subjects
will undergo two visits. During both visits they will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). During one
MMTT we will infuse C-peptide and during the other we will infuse saline as we monitor the glucoregulatory
responses to the oral glucose challenge. The primary variable will be glucose responses to the MMTT, while
secondary analyses will include hormone and substrate levels.
Specific Aim #4 is to determine, in canines, the role of hyperglucagonemia in the increased HGP that occurs
when C-peptide is co-infused with insulin during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Experiments for this aim will be
done at Vanderbilt and utilize the canine model to more closely examine the role that glucagon plays in the C-
peptide induced enhancement in hypoglycemic counterregulation. For this Aim, we will use somatostatin to
regulate pancreatic hormone levels during C-peptide infusion, thereby allowing us to determine their function."

ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is the most frequently mutated
epigenetic regulator across human cancers. Most notably, inactivating mutations in ARID1A occur in ~50% of
ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC) and ~30% of ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (OEC). There is an unmet
need for effective treatment modalities for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. For example, OCCC is generally
refractory to standard agents used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer, and when diagnosed in advanced stages,
OCCC carries the worst prognosis of all ovarian cancer subtypes. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop
the first combinatorial targeted approach for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers with a durable outcome. We
show that the inhibition of EZH2 is synthetically lethal with ARID1A mutation. We also show that ARID1A
mutation is synthetically lethal with the inhibition of HDAC6. The objectives of this application are to
investigate mechanisms underlying this newly discovered synthetic lethality and to investigate a combination
therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer. Our central hypothesis is that targeting EZH2 and
HDAC6 using clinically applicable small molecule inhibitors can achieve a durable therapeutic outcome for
ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer. Three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 is to investigate the p53-dependent
mechanism by which ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells are selectively sensitive to the inhibition of HDAC6;
Aim 2 will investigate the role of the SWI/SNF complex catalytic subunits switch in determining the sensitivity to
EZH2 inhibitors in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells; and Aim 3 will investigate the combinatorial therapeutic
strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer by simultaneously inhibiting HDAC6 and EZH2. The proposed
studies are highly innovative because they challenge current research/clinical paradigms and utilize innovative
methods to explore new intervention strategies for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. The research proposed
is of high impact because it has the potential to develop the first synthetic lethality-based, combinatorial
therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer with a durable outcome. Since ARID1A is the most
frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across human cancers, the mechanistic insights gained from the current
studies will have broad implications for many different types of cancers as well."

Tobacco smoking is the number one preventable cause of death, causing a myriad of health problems. The primary
compound responsible for tobacco use is nicotine. Although nicotine use had been on the decline, it is increasing recently
with the rise of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS or e-cigarette) use, particularly in youth and young adults.
Nicotine in ENDS can make young people more likely to use combusted tobacco cigarettes as well as use drugs of abuse,
and cause persistent changes in brain development. Furthermore, women become dependent on nicotine more quickly and
have a harder time quitting. Pre-clinical models are critical to examine the complex factors that can impact nicotine uptake
and relapse. Current pre-clinical models of rodent electronic cigarette use have multiple limitations, however, including
use of the whole-body exposure vapor chamber method, which coats the rodent in the e-liquid and nicotine solution and
confounds measures of intake and physiological impact, and extended non-voluntary exposure to vapor while the chamber
is cleared. With our Rodent ENDS (RENDS), rats can voluntarily access flavored vapor through a special nose port, thus
exposing only the snout of the animal and only for the exact duration the rat chooses. Aim 1 will focus on acquisition
and maintenance of RENDS use with young adult rats by examining 1) self-administration 2) cotinine (nicotine
metabolite) blood levels and 3) somatic withdrawal across different nicotine doses. The involvement of A) epigenetic
modifications during acquisition and maintenance will be preliminarily examined by systemic injection of the histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiter sodium butyrate (NaB), which impacts epigenetic processes. To isolate the roles of B)
nicotine and fruit flavor, rats will self-administer a) nicotine salt without added flavor, b) fruit flavor without added
nicotine, or c) nicotine salt + fruit flavor. Both male and female rats will be studied to examine the influence of C)
biological sex. Aim 2 will focus on the cessation and relapse of RENDS use with young adult rats by examining 1) self-
administration 2) cotinine blood levels and 3) somatic withdrawal during acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement by
systemic injection of nicotine. We will investigate the involvement of A) epigenetic modifications during extinction and
reinstatement (relapse) by nicotine and isolate the roles of B) nicotine and flavor and C) biological sex. We suggest that
robust self-administration of flavored nicotine reflects nicotine's dual reinforcing actions: nicotine serves as a primary
reward, and in addition, increases the reward value of the flavored vapor. We hypothesize that nicotine will serve as a
reinforcer as well as reward enhancer in the RENDS. Furthermore, we expect to show that RENDS use results in
meaningful cotinine levels, somatic withdrawal, and will be blocked by histone deacetylase inhibition (epigenetic
modification). This R21 CEBRA proposal will validate the RENDS to increase the accessibility and scope of research into
nicotine reinforcement in rodents as well as begin an investigation into the role of biological sex, fruit flavor, and
epigenetic modification in the reinforcing effects of nicotine. These findings may ultimately influence the development of
therapies, medications, and policies to prevent and treat ENDS addiction and thus improve human health. Our long-term
goal is to elucidate and mitigate the role of epigenetics in nicotine taking and relapse."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rapidly fatal disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of malignant
cells in the blood and the bone marrow, is the most common acute leukemia in adults. The 5-year survival rate
remains poor (23.4%) and drops precipitously to 5% for those over age 65. Prognosis is particularly dismal for
patients with refractory disease or those who relapsed within one year of initial treatment. The standard of care
high dose chemotherapy has limited efficacy and high morbidity in this setting. Thus, this is an area with an
urgent unmet clinical need. Prior research has demonstrated that the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET
axis to be important for leukemia blasts survival. Based on this finding, we conducted a phase I clinical trial
using a monoclonal antibody against HGF combined with chemotherapy. This study has produced clinical
responses of ~ 55%, compared with historical response rates of only 20-25% using similar eligibility criteria
and chemotherapy backbone. Using high-dimensional, single-cell analyses of prospectively-collected
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, attenuation of p-S6 was identified as a biomarker of response and a pro-
inflammatory, type I interferon (IFN) signature and persistently elevated HGF as adverse prognostic indicators.
Differential gene expression profiling between AML cells treated in the presence and absence of the c-MET
inhibitor crizotinib suggests that the elevated HGF expression in the clinical non-responders may be mediated
by the BCL6 corepressor protein (BCOR), a member of the Polycomb complex. Our proposed study will
leverage prospectively-collected patients samples linked to annotated outcomes from this clinical trial, a novel
spatial profiling technology, and preclinical genetic models 1) to study the functional consequence of BCOR
loss on HGF expression and AML development in vivo, 2) to test the therapeutic efficacy of combining
epigenetic modulators with ficlatuzumab to treat AML and elucidate the effect of this combination on the global
chromatin state and the tumor immune microenvironment. Results generated from this study will inform
biomarker discovery for future patient stratification of clinical response and disease monitoring. This work may
also nominate potential rationale combination therapies to improve responses to the HGF antibody for patients
with de novo resistance, thus improving quality of life and overall survival for patients with AML."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases and causes progressive neurodegeneration
that ultimately leads to death. While the number of US people with late-onset AD is expected to reach 13.8 million
by 2050, its prevention and treatment remain only modestly effective. Many efforts have been made to study AD
pathophysiology by collecting and curating rich omics data from AD-affected or unaffected human brains, e.g.,
the National Institute on Aging's Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) project.
Most of those omics data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and proteomics, are collected at the tissue
level, and thus the cell-type-specific (CTS) signals are masked. Recently, with the emerging single-cell
techniques, single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation data have been generated. However, given the difficulty
of quantifying a small number of molecules and associated high costs, single-cell data suffer from high technical
variation and are constrained to a small number of samples that lack representativity. To address these issues
in AD research and accelerate our understanding of cellular multi-omics mechanisms underlying AD, we aim to:
1) Improve estimation of cellular fractions in brain tissue samples by the ensemble over existing methods and
considering cell-type hierarchy. 2) Identify CTS differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with AD. We
will consider the spatial correlation of CpG sites and cell-type specificity. 3) We will further build statistical models
to systematically integrate those CTS omics estimates via omics-wide association studies and causal mediation
analyses. Through extensive analyses of several large cohorts in AMP-AD datasets, we will produce statistically
significant and biologically meaningful omics results at an unprecedented population-scale and cell-type
resolution, which will improve our understanding of complex AD biology. We will validate our findings using
additional data available within and outside the AMP-AD project, including single-cell multi-omics data. The
resulting methods will be implemented as efficient computational algorithms via public software readily available
to the research community. Successful completion of this project will provide state-of-the-art methods for cell-
type deconvolution and integrative multi-omics analyses and advance our knowledge of genes/proteins
contributing to AD in selectively vulnerable brain regions and cell types."

In spite of recent advances, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, and there is an
urgent need for new therapies. Genome-wide studies of hundreds of human tumors have revealed pre-mRNA
splicing as a critical pathway for cancer cell growth, and thus an attractive target for new therapies. Many of the
proteins involved with pre-mRNA splicing lack enzymatic activity, and therefore are unusually difficult to target
with small molecule drugs. We have recently discovered a class of anticancer sulfonamides that target pre-
mRNA splicing which we refer to as SPLAMs (SPLicing inhibitor sulfonAMides).
SPLAMs act by recruiting RBM39 (RNA binding motif 39) as a neo-substrate to DCAF15 (DDB1/CUL
Associated Factor 15). DCAF15 is part of a CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase receptor complex. As a consequence,
recruitment of RBM39 to DCAF15 leads to RBM39 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. RBM39 is
important for pre-mRNA splicing of select introns and exons. Therefore, as a consequence of SPLAM
treatment, RBM39 degradation leads to pre-mRNA splicing defects. The mechanism of action of SPLAMs is
similar to the FDA approved drugs, thalidomide and lenalidomide (also known as IMiDs). IMiDs recruit
neosubstrates to cereblon, which is another member of the DCAF family of proteins. IMiD binding to CRBN has
pleiotropic effects which are either the result of targeting unique neo-substrates or inhibiting the endogenous
activity of cereblon.
Currently, it is not known as to what effects SPLAM binding to DCAF15 has on alternative neo-substrates and
endogenous activity. In our first aim, we propose to identify a DCAF15 mutation that is resistant to SPLAMs in
order to identify on-target cellular pathways influenced by SPLAMs. In our second aim, we propose a set of
experiments to identify both DCAF15 endogenous substrates as well as neo-substrates other than RBM39.
The clinical development of a SPLAM based therapy will require identifying which patients are most likely to
respond. We have found that RBM39 degradation only causes cell death in a subset of cancer cells. In our
final aim, we propose a set of experiments to understand the basis for this selectivity by studying the function
of RBM39 in SPLAM-sensitive and insensitive cells. In particular, our preliminary data suggests that cancer
cells with mutations in splicing factors that are also found in human cancers are sensitive to SPLAMs. We
propose a set of experiments to study RBM39 biology and SPLAM sensitivity in models of human cancer
harboring these splicing mutations."

Non-primary visuospatial deficits are common after right-hemisphere (RH) injury, and they are known
predictors of long-term disability after stroke. However, compared to impairments of language and motor
function, they are less obvious and receive less attention in stroke research, diagnostics, and rehabilitation,
resulting in underdiagnosis and undertreatment of RH stroke. Part of the problem is that these deficits and their
neural bases are poorly understood, not least because of the heterogeneity of the tests used to assess them
and a lack of agreement on their definition, which hamper comparison across studies.
Based on our preliminary data and a review of the literature, we posit that these deficits, which are often
subsumed under “spatial neglect”, reflect four core factors: lateralized perceptual-attentional, lateralized motor-
intentional, non-lateralized attentional, and constructional. We further posit that they can be dissociated with
appropriate assessments, are associated with different lesion sites, and respond to different treatments.
To pave the way for better assessments and effective individualized treatments, the proposed research seeks
to identify the core factors underlying visuospatial deficits, the assessments most sensitive and
specific to them, their associations with functional outcomes after stroke, and their neural bases.
SA1: Identify core visuospatial deficits and tests that are sensitive and specific to them and determine
their association with long-term stroke outcomes. Assess long-term survivors of RH vs. LH stroke and
matched Controls with a comprehensive battery of visuospatial tests. Use factor analysis to confirm that
performance is better described by a model assuming multiple different rather than one unitary underlying
deficit. Demonstrate that core deficits (captured as composite scores across battery subtests) are more severe
in RH than LH stroke, and determine which best predict functional ability and self-reported quality of life.
SA2: Identify neural bases of visuospatial deficits and their recovery. Acquire functional and anatomical
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from MRI-eligible participants of SA1. Using novel lesion-symptom
and functional-anomaly mapping methods, test hypotheses regarding associations between specific lesion
locations and deficits. Confirm that, in analogy to findings from aphasia research, stroke survivors with
visuospatial deficits show increased contralesional task-evoked activation, and that it relates to performance.
In addition to identifying the fundamental and dissociable components of visuospatial ability and their neural
basis, the results will allow us to (1) improve RH stroke diagnostics of by identifying tests that are highly
sensitive and specific to RH stroke, (2) provide more accurate outcome prognoses based on test results and
lesion characteristics, and (3) customize rehabilitation based a patient’s visuospatial profile. They will also lay
the basis for clinical trials evaluating noninvasive neurostimulation (rTMS, tDCS) for boosting rehabilitation of
visuospatial deficits by modulating contralesional brain activation."

Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality remain significantly higher in African American (AA) men
compared to Caucasians (CA). Although socioeconomic factors may contribute to such differences, recent
studies suggest that biological factors could potentially explain racial disparities (RD) in PCa. A few high-
penetrance genes (HPG) have been found to predispose to high risk of PCa in AA men. These include EphB2
mutations. EphB2 is a tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor that binds to the Ephrin ligand and initiates bidirectional
signals that affect both receptor (forward signaling) and Ephrin-expressing cells (reverse signaling). Our
preliminary observations suggest a potential supportive role of Ephrin signaling activation within stromal cells in
the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to the pathogenicity of these EphB2 genetic alterations. However the
functional consequences of EphB2 alterations on prostate cancer cell biology have not been experimentally
validated. To better understand the intrinsic mechanism(s) responsible for these pathogenic effects we
hypothesize that EphB2 alterations commonly seen in AA men may induce aberrant “forward signaling”
reducing its tumor suppressor function in cancer cells and abnormal “reverse signaling” increasing the
activation of stromal in the TME, overall resulting in support for PCa progression. This proposal seeks to
understand the downstream molecular effectors of disrupted Eph-Ephrin signaling in AA men in both tissue
compartments (epithelium and stroma) on PCa progression.
The long-term goal is to identify novel targetable molecules within the cancer and/or stromal compartment
that can be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients at high-risk of developing aggressive PCa
disease in AA men.
Three complementary areas will be investigated:
1. Determine the functional effects of racial EphB2 alterations on PCa progression. We will study the
functional consequence of common EphB2 alterations seen in AA men with PCa, on proliferation and motility
of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of EphB2 in PCa cell biology is unknown.
2. Determine the role of Ephrin reverse signaling on CAF activation in the TME of AA men. We
observed increased expression of EphB2 ligands in the TME of AA compared to CA men suggesting a
dysfunctional regulation of Ephrin-reverse signaling. In addition we observed that prostate stromal cell from AA
patients with PCa induce increased proliferation and motility of PCa cell lines in vitro and in vivo.
3. Evaluate the utility of targeting the Eph-Ephrin signaling to inhibit PCa progression. It has been
shown in experimental models that normalizing Eph-Ephrin signaling can reduce colon cancer progression.
The utility in PCa has not been previously studied. Using an in vivo PCa model, we will assess the feasibility of
targeting Eph-Ephrin signaling frequently altered in AA men to inhibit PCa tumorigenesis."

grant to examine how tobacco policies interact to affect youth smoking disparities, and how
tobacco control policies affect youth e-cigarette use and related disparities. The parent grant
investigates how tobacco control policies affect smoking initiation and cessation differentially by
sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic. The MERIT extension would expand upon the work of
the original award by (1) analyzing the potential for different tobacco control policies to interact
to affect youth smoking initiation and disparities in initiation, and (2) examining how the
implementation of tobacco control policies impact the use of e-cigarettes among youth, and

Glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer, is defined by the invasive nature of its cells.
Invasion in the brain follows distinctive routes that correlate with interstitial and bulk flow
pathways. In brain cancer, increased interstitial fluid flow develops due to the increase in
interstitial pressure in the tumor bulk interfacing with the relatively normal pressure of the
surrounding brain tissue, or tumor microenvironment. This differential leads to fluid transport
specifically across the invasive edge of the tumor where cells are prone to both interact with the
surrounding brain tissue and to evade localized, transport-limited therapies. To examine how
interstitial fluid flow affects the invasion of brain cancer cells, we have developed in vitro and in
vivo methods to examine fluid flow responses. In vitro, we have found that interstitial flow
enhances invasion of brain cancer cells using both cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells
in tissue-engineered models of the brain-tumor interface via the chemokine/receptor pair
CXCL12/CXCR4. In vivo, we have seen interstitial flow and increase invasion of implanted cancer
cells through the brain in part through this same mechanism. By conducting in vivo measurements
of interstitial flow using MRI we have correlated regions of interstitial fluid flow, glioma invasion,
and glial gene expression of the receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate 3. In this proposal, we will
examine the role of interstitial fluid flow as a driving factor of glioma invasion. To make a case for
the importance of interstitial flow in regulating GBM invasion first, we will elucidate the true nature
of interstitial flow in the in vivo GBM microenvironment. We will accomplish this utilizing clinically
relevant imaging and computational tools to probe the prevalence of flow as the tumor develops,
and determine regions in which flow is the highest. Second, we will determine the contributions
of interstitial flow at the level of cancer cell invasion. We will observe invasion patterns of multiple
patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells in the specifically interrogating the mechanism of
CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated autologous chemotaxis, a novel mechanism of invasion only possible
under flow. Finally, we will use our unique ability to tissue engineer the glioblastoma
microenvironment to examine the role of glial-expressed S1PR3 under flow on glioma invasion.
Altogether, these reports will advance the importance and strategies for mitigating interstitial flow
and its effects in GBM and offer modalities by which to study further effects of flow on therapeutic
response. Understanding the impact of interstitial flow will ultimately help predict areas of GBM
progression and recurrence.

The lifetime prevalence of voice disorders in the adult United States population is 30% with point prevalence
rates of 6.6% to 7.5%1,2. Point prevalence and census estimates suggest that nearly 20-23 million adults may
experience dysphonia annually, with the cost of treatment and lost wages approaching $13 billion dollars3. These
annual direct costs are comparable to those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
diabetes, and allergic rhinitis3. Thus, improving the care of patients with voice disorders remains a significant
public health need. To address this need, over the last 17 years, our research program has initiated systematic
studies in the understanding of the cellular and molecular pathophysiology underlying vocal fold tissue changes.
Our studies to date have provided critical new insights into the cellular and molecular sequalae regulating vocal
fold permeability. Over the last 5 years, we have focused our studies on the safety and efficacy of
pharmacological treatments for voice disorders. Our preliminary data have revealed mechanisms regulating
permeability of the vocal fold epithelial barrier from a class of steroid hormones ubiquitously found in most cells
in the human body. Beyond the anti-inflammatory actions of these glucocorticoids, emerging evidence in our
laboratory supports a role for glucocorticoids in the regulation of the vocal fold paracellular pathway. These
preliminary data have led to an overarching hypothesis that vocal fold epithelial permeability can be
selectively regulated using pharmacological approaches that target the paracellular pathway. This novel
treatment concept provides exciting new possibilities in the management of vocal fold disease by providing
pharmacologic access to the subepithelial space–and a means for transepithelial delivery of commonly available
fillers and biomaterials to the vocal folds. Over the next five years, we will converge our next series of
studies on the selective regulation of vocal fold epithelial permeability using a combination of in vitro
and in vivo experiments. The current R01 builds on a programmatic series of investigations which have
provided the necessary preliminary data to support selective permeability of the vocal fold paracellular pathway.
The goal of this R01 proposal is to empirically quantify the effects of methylprednisolone on selective regulation
of the vocal fold paracellular pathway. These pre-clinical studies are necessary to provide indications for use,
safety, and the demonstration of therapeutic efficacy prior to human trials. The specific deliverable upon project
completion will be the preliminary studies necessary for rigorous testing in phase I/II/III human trials."

 The DIAN-TU platform was formed to design and manage interventional therapeutic trials and find a
treatment that provides cognitive benefit for those certain to develop dominantly inherited AD (DIAD). The
DIAN-TU trial platform is now fully operational in 6 countries and 24 sites with another 13 countries and 26
sites in start-up. The current DIAN-TU-001 trial will accommodate 11 languages and has three different
therapies being tested in secondary prevention (i.e. cognitively normal participants with substantial AD
pathology). NIA funding for the DIAN-TU trial platform established the infrastructure and operations for
executing clinical trials in DIAD and acknowledged the need for evolution within this platform.
 The DIAN-TU Primary Prevention Trial is a first of its kind, phase II/III, 4-year randomized, blinded
placebo-controlled (1:1) trial in 160 asymptomatic dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease mutation carriers
who are more than 15 years before the estimated year of symptom onset (EYO) and have minimal to no Aß-
PiB plaque burden at trial entry. Current trials in asymptomatic individuals target Aß after pathology is
established; these secondary prevention efforts are likely more effective than treating at later more
advanced stages, however the most effective approach is to prevent AD pathology from forming. The goal of
this proposal is to implement a placebo controlled biomarker endpoint clinical trial targeting amyloid
deposition in subjects at risk for DIAD, prior to onset of significant Aß pathology.
 In this study, we will test if it is possible to prevent Aß deposition in DIAD mutation carriers and if doing so
will prevent the cascade of pathology associated with AD and, ultimately, dementia in a population that is
otherwise certain to get the disease. Regardless of the outcome of this study, it will be highly impactful on the
AD field in assessing the ability to prevent amyloidosis and the consequences of doing so at the earliest
stages of the AD pathological cascade. If the prevention of Aß pathology in DIAD is accomplished, it will lay
the foundation for the ultimate test of the amyloid hypothesis and provide the best opportunity to prove that
dementia in this highly vulnerable population, and possibly in sporadic AD and Down syndrome, can be
dramatically modified. Should preventing amyloid pathology from developing have no impact on the course of
the disease, particularly in this population, this would direct future research and therapeutics towards other
mechanisms and pathologies."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients remains dismal. Effective therapy is clearly an unmet medical need
for these patients. Aside from surgery which benefits a small fraction of patients, current standard treatment
consists of strong chemotherapy that is highly toxic and with less than 50% chance of working. For those who
initially benefit from chemotherapy, rapid progression is inevitable. The promise of immunotherapy, while already
realized in other cancer types, has failed to show benefit for pancreatic cancer patients. Therapeutic
breakthrough must therefore come from novel discoveries in the biology of pancreatic cancer. We now recently
found, for the first time in literature, that pancreatic cancer cells “armored” themselves by activating the innate
immunity, a self-defense mechanism that is usually summoned when cells are injured or invaded by
microorganisms. In doing so pancreatic cancer cells become highly aggressive and resistant to
chemotherapeutics. Our approach is to “deactivate” such defense mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells by
inhibiting Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), the master switch that controls the innate immune
pathway. By doing so we found that pancreatic cancer cells become greatly weakened and are much more
vulnerable to chemotherapy. On this premise we have now made further potentially impactful findings that we
plan to confirm and pursue in the following three aims:
 1. Aim 1: We found that presence of IRAK4 is essential for supporting transformed growth and cellular
 signaling driven by oncogenic KRAS, a genetic event that is present in almost all pancreatic cancer. We
 will explore the mechanistic detail and determine whether loss of IRAK4 will impede KRAS-driven
 pancreatic tumorigenesis using human pancreatic cancer cell lines and state-of-the-art genetic mouse
 models. If shown to be true, these results could have impact on other KRAS-mutant cancer types.
 2. Aim 2: We have generated an IRAK4-deficient pancreatic cancer mouse model that we plan to
 characterize to understand the consequence of global IRAK4 loss, as will happen with pharmacologic
 inhibition, in pancreatic cancer progression. In addition, we will specifically study the role of immune
 IRAK4 in pancreatic cancer growth, which will yield clinically useful information if IRAK4 inhibitors are
 advanced into clinical trials in the future.
 3. Aim 3: Our preliminary data shows that IRAK4 inhibition renders immunotherapy effective in genetic
 mouse model. In this aim we will test two novel, highly potent IRAK4 inhibitors, with the ultimate goal of
 translating these findings into clinical trials."

 This proposal is a renewal for the tremendously successful two-day symposium “Chemistry and
Pharmacology of Drugs of Abuse” (CPDA) symposium that first took place in 2016 under the auspices of the
Center for Drug Discovery (CDD), Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. The primary aim of the
symposium is to serve as an interdisciplinary exposition of the most recent, important, research-related advances
in (pre)clinical research related to Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and
addiction are pervasive threats to global public health and the nature of the threat is ever evolving and
changing. Our goal is to address gaps in current knowledge concerning SUD disease mechanisms and
treatments that are at the root of our limitations in solving these medical challenges.
 A major theme is the integration of medicinal chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology, behavioral
pharmacology and clinical practice to inform the design, synthesis, optimization, and (pre)clinical profiling of new
agents for their therapeutic potential. SUD biology and etiology are complex. Behavioral, environmental, and
(epi)genetic factors conspire to modulate neuronal circuits to affect vulnerability, cognition, social behavior, and
emotional state in ways that help establish a SUD phenotype. The details of these neurobiological processes
are not well understood. In addition, better standardized animal paradigms of drug-seeking and -taking are
required that better model clinical SUD pathology and can be used to accurately assess the potential of novel
SUD drugs. Despite significant advances, there is a frustratingly limited number of safe and affective
pharmacotherapies available to attain durable abstinence. Our continuing aim is to focus the meeting entirely on
Substance Use Disorder and bring together leading practitioners from each of these fields. Moreover, there are
emergent threats to at-risk SUD populations such as “designer drugs” that lack affective pharmacotherapy and
require ongoing vigilance and effort to combat. We aim to include topics that address emergent issues in each
year’s program as identified by NIDA community leaders and leading research. Such a gathering offers a rich
opportunity to expose young scientists to the field. We aim to inspire and encourage the next generation of
researchers to devote themselves to this endeavor. We have made considerable efforts to welcome scientists
from underserved and underrepresented populations and we aim to expand these efforts.
 A focused meeting on SUD responsive to emergent threats is of high value and has garnered much
support by the SUD research community and diverse constituencies, from basic researchers to healthcare
providers and public-health officials. This included scientists from biotechnology (e.g. Astraea Therapeutics),
leading biomedical research centers (e.g. Scripps Research Institute), research-intensive clinical centers (e.g.,
McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) and representatives from
the City of Boston Mayor’s office. Our goal is to further raise the public profile of our symposium."
10645160,"The Fernald Community Cohort (FCC) consists of the 9782 persons who participated in the Fernald Medical
Monitoring Program (FMMP) from 1990-2008. The FMMP was an 18-year medical surveillance program for
community residents living near the former US Department of Energy uranium processing site at Fernald (near
Cincinnati), Ohio. Although eligibility for the FMMP was based on living within 5 miles of the plant, much of the
cohort never received radiation exposure beyond the background exposure received by the general population.
At the end of the examination program, the study was renamed the Fernald Community Cohort (FCC). This
cohort embraces the complexity of discovery in environmental health. Multiple components of the exposure are
captured through the questionnaire data and exposure pathway modeling. The large collection of blood and
urine biospecimens obtained throughout the 18-year period can be used to measure exposure, early biologic
effects and disease biomarkers, and the periodic comprehensive medical examinations accurately assigned
phenotype. This cohort can be used to study a wide range of exposures and their health outcomes. The FCC
has an established procedure for providing access to data and biospecimens, which have been shared widely
and have been used in 80 research studies, resulting in 35 manuscripts published in peer-review journals.
 In this revised application, we incorporate biomedical informatics expertise to convert to codes standard
ontologies, create new portals to FCC metadata, and deposit our meta data into the NIH and other
repositories. Our Biomedical Informatics team will develop a new online portal for investigators to explore the
FCC individual and meta data (FCCPortal), which will also increase our efficiency in managing resource
sharing. We propose to:
Aim 1: Maintain the cohort while increasing the value to the scientific community, by updating health status
information, enrolling 800 “next generation” of cohort members and collecting their data and biospecimens,
maintain our biorepository with periodic quality assurance assessments, and increase communication cohort
members and with community physicians regarding our research activities and findings.
Aim 2: Enrich the cohort through obtaining new health outcome and exposure data, converting our codes for
medical terms, diagnoses, and medications to standard ontologies, developing new biomedical informatics
tools and by exploring the feasibility of using banked samples in new technologies(ccfDNA for DNA
methylation biosmarkers; exosomal miRNA for expression molecular markers).
 After 25 years of follow-up, the FCC is a primed research resource. Resources are well documented,
including a website with detailed information, searchable data dictionary, and extensive biospecimen inventory
database. With funding from NIEHS, we will be able to both maintain this valuable resource and increase its
value of the cohort for investigating generational effects of exposures, and serve additional research projects."

an analysis phase of identified clinical needs in the capstone design course. To further support our design teams
in addressing patient-oriented clinical needs and emerging opportunities involving health informatics and health
policy, we will include a senior student from nursing, health informatics or health policy into each design team,
based on a skill set analysis of each project. The design teams are supported by advising teams composed of
faculty from Bioengineering, Nursing, Health Informatics and Health Policy and by industry advisors selected
from our new industry advisory board, the Mason Bioengineering Alliance. Design teams will have access to
university and medical center resources and follow an industry standard product design and development
process. Our approach includes a practical early stage assessment of clinical importance and market potential
including the important aspects of intellectual property, regulatory considerations, ethics and reimbursement.

10817663,"Abstract/Summary: Mutations in KRAS are among the most common aberrations in cancer. Mutant KRAS
drives proliferation and survival through canonical RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-RSK (RAS-RSK) signaling. While
KRASG12D, a major mutation found in cancers remains undruggable, a smaller subset of patients carry KRASG12C
mutation for which new targeted drugs have emerged. Several KRASG12C inhibitors have been studied in pre-
clinical and Phase I/II/III studies and one such inhibitor sotorasib has received FDA approval for KRASG12C mutant
NSCLC patients. Despite this success, the objective response rates from sotorasib or other related inhibitors has
been modest and durability of response needs to be improved. A number of resistance mechanism have been
proposed and strategies to overcome therapy resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors is a topic of intense
investigations. We have discovered that proteins in the RAS can influence the nuclear protein transport. In normal
cells, the export of nuclear cargoes is mediated by the Karyopherin family protein exportin-1/XPO1 through
nuclear export signal sequence recognition and is facilitated by a RAS downstream effector RanGTP. This
makes RAN a mediator between growth signaling and nucleocytoplasmic transport that can be activated through
classical RAS-RSK pathway. Ran binding protein 3 (RanBP3) is recognized to be phosphorylated through RSK,
resulting in the promotion of RanGDP to RanGTP conversion through RCC1 thereby enhancing Ran-dependent
nucleocytoplasmic transport (schema). Such over-active nuclear export has been shown to promote therapy
resistance through mislocalization dependent inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins. More significantly, our
new findings show that specific inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds can enhance the efficacy of
KRASG12C inhibitors. We hypothesize that SINE-KRASG12C inhibitors could become a unique combination for
KRASG12C mutant tumors. Additionally, studying this unique combination will also help uncover the tangible link
between KRAS and nuclear protein export signaling. Our specific aims are Aim 1. Characterize the synergy
between SINE compounds and KRASG12Ci using high throughput strategies. Aim 2. Demonstrate synergy
between SINE KRASG12Ci using patient derived xenograft. Impact: Mutant KRAS remains an impenetrable
fortress and an unmet clinical need. This work will lead to the advancement of a novel combination that target
two highly sought after cancer targets i.e. KRASG12C and XPO1. Additionally, the proposed experiments will also
enhance the fundamental understanding of the interaction between mutant KRAS and nuclear protein export
pathways and its consequence of therapy resistance. The proposed pre-clinical studies will bring forward a new
and personalized therapy for KRASG12C mutant driven resistant tumors."
10668264,"Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment
as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support
pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG-
20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR
(electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible
information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In
addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic
implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be
implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be
accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this
development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different
patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut-
points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia
assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we
will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a
supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be
primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system
in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare
system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within
each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR
scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles
were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach
out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up
recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both
treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary
outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact
of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of
patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be
spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and
quality of life."
10818321,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies lead cancer deaths worldwide, killing ~3 million annually. In the U.S., only
colorectal cancers (CRC) are screened. Other GI cancers are not screened due to lack of accurate tests or because
prevalence is deemed too low for cost-effective screening. Consequently, most patients with GI cancers present at
late-stage and cure rates remain abysmally low. Effective early detection is desperately needed to improve
outcomes. Our group was central in development and validation of the FDA-approved multi- target stool DNA test
for CRC screening. We have begun to expand this approach, showing feasibility to detect supra-colonic GI cancers
by stool DNA testing. However, it is critical for a non-invasive molecular test to localize the site of a primary cancer
(“site-prediction”). Key preliminary data suggest that this may now be possible. First, we have completed
rigorous next-generation sequencing to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) which appear highly
discriminant for universal and site-specific detection of GI cancers. Second, we prioritized these DMRs by strict
filtering criteria and performed a confirmatory study with statistical cross-validation on an independent set of CRC,
gastroesophageal and pancreatico-biliary cancer, and normal control tissues. This showed that a panel of 8
selected DMRs could distinguish cancer from normal (95% accuracy) and assign organ site (94-95% accuracy for
each category) with overall site-prediction accuracy of 88%. Third, these findings have been confirmed with novel
DMRs assayed from stool specimens obtained from CRC and pancreatic cancer patients and normal controls (30,
each). Using a 2-stage analysis, cancers were distinguished from controls at 90% specificity in the first stage. At
stage 2, the markers accurately classified CRCs from pancreatic cancers with 90% accuracy. It is now our central
hypothesis that luminal and ductal adenocarcinomas can be detected and localized by stool assay of universal and
site-specific DMRs. This raises 3 key questions: 1) will stool assay of our novel DMRs show the high overall
cancer sensitivity and the site-prediction we have seen in preliminary data; 2) will the DMRs be specific for
cancer across a wide patient demographic spectrum and in the setting of non-malignant GI diseases; and 3) can
sensitivity and specificity be improved by novel assay technology? These will be addressed in the following
parallel, integrated, but independent specific aims: 1) Assess panel sensitivity and site-prediction accuracy in
stool specimens for adenocarcinoma at esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal sites; 2) Confirm and
evaluate DMR specificity in stool; and 3) Optimize novel assay conditions and marker selection for cancer
detection and site-prediction at esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal sites. With our team’s strong track
record, extensive stool archive, and unique access to a state-of-the art assay platform, we expect to demonstrate
in a cost-efficient manner the feasibility of a novel DMR panel for the detection and site prediction of specific GI
adenocarcinomas. Results will inform designs of future studies ranging from large- scale case-control studies
(phase 2) on early-stage cancer and pre-cursors to pivotal cohort validation (phase 4) of a non-invasive multi-GI
cancer screening test. The potential impacts on cancer control are far-reaching."
10758848,"ABSTRACT
Job loss is one of the most impactful, yet understudied, stressors associated with a breast cancer diagnosis.
Long-term financial consequences can include difficulty paying bills, accumulation of debt, and bankruptcy.
Importantly, bankruptcy in cancer survivors has been linked to increased mortality. Women with access to work
accommodations, such as schedule flexibility, are more likely to work during chemotherapy and to retain their
jobs in the long term. Similarly, women with adequate sick leave may choose to take time off while maintaining
job security. However, low-income minorities are less likely to have such accommodations, leading to higher
rates of job loss and financial distress. For these patients, finding a way to continue to work during treatment is
critical. In the Breast Cancer and the Workforce study, which focuses on immigrant and minority women, only
57% of pre-diagnosis employed low-income women retained their jobs after treatment completion, compared to
93% of higher-income women. Low-income women were less than half as likely as higher-income women to
have accommodating employers and only one-fourth as likely to retain their jobs. However, patients whose
confidence in asking for work accommodations improved over time were more than five times as likely to retain
their jobs than those whose confidence did not improve. Based on these data, we developed the Breast
Cancer and the Workforce Communication App. The goal of the parent study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
this app in promoting job retention among women undergoing adjuvant (curative) breast cancer chemotherapy.
For the proposed extension, we will build on the funded study by extending the follow-up of participants to 3
years, providing a long-term view of work in the post-treatment survivorship period. Additionally, we will
evaluate the effect of our app on overall financial hardship in the long term, providing critical knowledge that
will enhance our understanding of the relationship between work and financial hardship and of the role that
interventions focused on work (such as ours) may have in attenuating financial hardship. The proposed
extension has two main components that will allow us to study long-term work outcomes and better understand
the effect of decreased wages and job loss on long-term financial hardship. In Aim 1, we will extend post-
treatment follow-up to 3 years to 1) gain a longer-term perspective of work outcomes in breast cancer
survivors, 2) evaluate changes in access to accommodations over time, and 3) evaluate work outcomes based
on receipt of extended post-operative chemotherapy (which has become the standard of care for some
patients in the time since the parent study was funded). In Aim 2, we will measure the relationship between
work and financial hardship by correlating patient-reported changes in employment (work status, work hours,
and earnings) to subjective and objective indicators of financial hardship. Additionally, we will conduct semi-
structured interviews with a subset of study participants to identify pathways leading to financial hardship and
to better understand the relationship between work and financial hardship."

This proposal is being submitted to support the transition of Dr. Dominguez-Lopez from mentored trainee to
an independent investigator in the neurobiology of drug addiction, specifically studying the dopamine
microcircuits controlling drug-seeking behavior. Dr. Dominguez-Lopez works under the mentorship of Dr.
Michael Beckstead at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) investigating the role of
dopamine neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in methamphetamine (METH) self-
administration behavior. Dr. Beckstead is a recognized expert in dopamine synaptic transmission in the fields
of addiction. Dr. Beckstead’s laboratory combines mouse models of drug self-administration with patch-clamp
electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, providing a dynamic environment for Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to
become an experienced scientist. The submitted proposal incorporates scientific training in methodologies to
study mitochondrial metabolism, transcriptional analysis, bioinformatics and genetic labeling of active
neuronal populations. The applicant will be receiving training in educational methods, scientific writing, grant
preparation and other skills necessary to become an independent brain research scientist from an
underrepresented group. The proposed program includes mentoring interactions with Dr. Holly Van Remmen,
Dr. Willard Freeman, Dr. Linda Thompson, members of OMRF, and Dr. Rajeshwar Awatramani from
Northwestern University in Chicago. The short-term objective of this application is to enhance Dr. Dominguez-
Lopez’s knowledge of mitochondrial metabolism and single cell transcriptomics applied to dopaminergic
circuits. In the long-term, this will enable Dr. Dominguez-Lopez to secure protected time for training and
research activities, establish new collaborations, and pursue his novel independent research resulting in
competitive grant proposals. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Dominguez-Lopez indicates that prolonged
METH self-administration in mice produces a decrease of dopamine neurons in the VTA, decreases dopamine
cell excitability, increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and decreases levels of glutathione. These
observations are concurrent with increased drug-seeking behavior. This research proposal expands on those
findings to identify metabolic and molecular characteristics in dopamine circuits that provide resistance or
vulnerability to METH exposure. The central hypothesis is that a subpopulation of VTA dopamine neurons is
responsible for METH-seeking behavior, forming a microcircuit that is resistant to mitochondrial oxidative
stress induced by chronic METH exposure. The proposed aims are 1) Identification of VTA dopamine
microcircuits encoding METH-seeking behavior, and 2) Metabolic characteristics of VTA dopamine neurons
encoding METH-seeking behavior. Identification of the specific brain circuits responsible for METH addictive
properties is a first step to develop therapeutic strategies to help addicts recover from METH addiction."
10800642,"Abstract
Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart
disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in
saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While
socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare
healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context.
Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to
have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may
not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM)
have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities.
However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on
diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called
the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North
Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with
significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small
cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with
intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention
participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed
many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to
test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple
communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be
disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals
process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model.
Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an
implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding,
partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use
a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and
implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will
also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed
to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination."
10629289,"Endothelial cells (ECs) play a critical role in regulating vascular functions. We and others have demonstrated
that, through epigenetic and transcriptional regulations, laminar pulsatile shear stress (PS) induces athero-
protective genes to maintain EC homeostasis, whereas disturbed flow with oscillatory shear (OS) elevates
athero-prone genes to cause EC dysfunctions. We have performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
analyses to demonstrate that the transcriptomic effects of PS are distinct from those of OS. In addition, we have
shown that PS caused enrichments of histone active mark (H3K27ac) at genes related to EC homeostasis and
histone repressing mark (H3K9me3) at genes related to inflammation. We also demonstrated that the PS-
induced H3K9me3 is dependent on the nuclear envelop proteins lamin/emerin. These findings have led to our
hypothesis that PS and OS modulate EC functions through the coupling of lamin/emerin and chromatin to recruit
histone modifiers, thus leading to differential changes in histone epigenetics and the associated genomic and
transcriptomic regulations, and hence the opposite functional outcomes. The couplings between lamin/emerin
and chromatin/genome can transduce the mechanical signals from physical space into genome space for gene
and cell fate regulations. In order to test our hypothesis, we will conduct ChIP-seq to identify the lamin/emerin
associated genome regions (LEAGRs) under PS and OS, and determine the LEAGR-associated histone
modifications (i.e., epigenome). To visualize the differential flow-modulations of the dynamic interaction between
LEAGRs and lamin/emerin in single live cells, we will employ endonuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) together
with small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and engineered biosensors to track the dynamics of the histone profiles of
these genomic loci, particularly those related to EC homeostasis or inflammation. We will then determine the
roles of the locus-specific epigenetic profiles in regulating the transcriptome and cellular functions under different
flows. We will conduct studies in vivo on aorta arch (OS) and thoracic aorta (PS) in mice to validate our in vitro
results, and assess their impacts on atherogenesis by using atherosclerotic mouse models. Specifically, the MR
(magnetic resonance)-guided FUS (focused ultrasound) (MRg-FUS) system will be used to remotely and
noninvasively activate the inducible shRNA and CRISPRa/i (CRISPR activation or interference) systems to
manipulate lamin/emerin and locus-specific histone epigenetics at local tissue areas of mouse with partially
ligated carotid arteries to examine their functional roles in vivo. Accordingly, three specific aims are proposed: 1)
In vitro investigation of lamin/emerin and EC epigenome/transcriptome under different flows, 2) Imaging of locus-
specific epigenetic and chromatin remodeling in single live ECs, 3) In vivo examination and validation of the
epigenome/transcriptome regulation in mouse atherosclerosis models. With the integrated multi-omics, single-
cell imaging, and noninvasive locus-specific modulation, we will be able to identify and mitigate the key molecules
to develop mechanomedicine for vascular diseases."

This proposal outlines a plan to investigate the role of ceramide synthase 6 in alcohol-induced lipid droplet
biogenesis and as a potential diagnostic biomarker of pre- and post-liver transplant alcoholic liver disease (ALD)
recurrence. The research will use novel in vitro and in vivo model systems to investigate the hypothesis that
the ceramide synthetic enzyme ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) regulates alcohol-induced lipid droplet biogenesis
through the transcriptional regulation of the lipid droplet protein, Perilipin 2 (PLIN2). Furthermore, this proposal
will investigate the association between CerS6 upregulation in alcoholic steatosis and its use as an early
biomarker of ALD. The researcher aims 1) to determine the mechanisms by which CerS6 regulates PLIN2
and lipid droplet biogenesis; 2) to determine the effects of hepatocyte-specific CerS6 ablation on lipid
and glucose homeostasis in experimental ALD and 3) To determine if CerS6-ceramides are implicated in
early pre- and post-transplant human ALD. To accomplish these Specific Aims, the researcher proposes to
use genetically engineered mice and human ethanol-metabolizing VL17A cells to perform comprehensive
metabolic phenotyping, lipidomics analyses, and biochemical and functional assays. In addition, the researcher
aims to examine if CerS6 and its ceramide derivatives can be used to diagnose early ALD in both pre- and
recurrent ALD post-transplant. Results of this project will provide evidence for targeting CerS6 as a diagnostic
and therapeutic biomarker in post-transplant ALD recurrence."
10685437,"Project Summary
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that can affect almost every organ
in the body. Current treatments for SLE are often inadequate because they involve the chronic use of non-
specific, steroidal and cytostatic drugs that are associated with a wide spectrum of side-effects. However,
notwithstanding ongoing efforts to develop better therapies, there has only been one new, FDA-approved drug
for SLE in more than five decades. In this context, cyclosporine (CsA), a powerful suppressor of both humoral
and cell-mediated immune responses can be a potential candidate, but its efficacy as a stand-alone treatment
for SLE has never been demonstrated and often used to steroid tampering. Acknowledged reason for the lack
of success with the current commercial CsA formulations is due to poor/variable target (lymphoid) tissue
bioavailability with consequently differing biological activity and toxic to the kidneys. Targeting the lymphoid
tissue potentially enables rational design of therapeutics to modulate the immune system, representing an
innovative approach to treating lupus due to the fact that more than 75 percent of immune cells reside in the
GUT-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Moreover, GALT in lupus is larger compared to the healthy
individuals, making it an attractive site for targeting. The proposed study will generate paradigm-shifting, new
knowledge in the field of nano-medicines using unique periodic-functional-polyesters (P2s, unlike commercial
PLA/PLGA that are terminal functional), and investigate how the ligand density and composition influence the
CsA delivery to lymphoid tissue. The work is enabled by previous findings, in which highly potent lymphatic
system-targeting nanoparticle-CsA (called P2Ns-GA-CsA) specific to CD71 (transferrin receptor 1, TfR-1) on
lymphoid cells (T and B-cells) have outperformed ligand-free controls and commercial CsA product, leading to
better therapeutic outcomes. In this project, the technology is further developed by investigating how the
spatial size and composition of the spacer molecules affect the intestinal-receptor interaction and transport of
the nanoparticles facilitating customized dose-regimens. The project comprises of the following three aims,
Aim#1, to establish structure-activity relationships for P2Ns-GA-CsA in a murine lupus and TfR KO models.
Aim#2, to define the therapeutic dose of P2Ns-GA-CsA in a murine lupus model and Aim#3, to establish
survival rates in murine lupus models using the most efficacious P2Ns-GA-CsA."
10932385,"The new recreational marijuana markets are contributing to morbidity and mortality due to marijuana- and
polysubstance-impaired driving and other harms by selling a social intoxicant (i.e., marijuana) to already
intoxicated customers. Impairment increases when marijuana is combined with alcohol, making driving
particularly risky and also contributing to other injuries and violence. In recreational marijuana markets,
deterrence efforts to reduce impaired driving directed at drivers face challenges due to dispute over THC levels
in per se laws and lack of valid field sobriety tests. An alternative prevention approach is to decrease access to
marijuana by alcohol-impaired customers. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness of a policy and
training (PT) intervention in the state-licensed recreational marijuana market in Oregon, where state law bans
sales to obviously-intoxicated customers. It combines policy efforts by state regulators to increase deterrence of
Oregon’s law and motivate store management to comply and training of store personnel in skills to recognize
intoxication and refuse sales, using a responsible marijuana vendor online training developed by the research
team. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) conduct pseudo-intoxicated patron (PiP) assessments at state-
licensed recreational marijuana stores (n=213) in the greater Portland metropolitan area (i.e., Clackamas,
Multnomah, and Washington Counties) in Year 1; 2) implement a PT intervention in Year 2 designed to
increase compliance with Oregon law prohibiting sale of recreational marijuana products to obviously-
intoxicated customers with a subsample of stores (n=68), assigned at random, that intends to a) make
owners/managers of recreational marijuana stores aware of Oregon’s law prohibiting sales of marijuana to
obviously-intoxicated customers, b) increase their risk perception and motivation to comply with this law, and
c) train store personnel in skills needed to recognize signs of intoxication in customers and refuse sales; 3)
compare PT intervention stores to usual and customary policy and training (UC-PT) stores (n=145) in a
randomized controlled trial by posttesting state-licensed recreational marijuana stores in greater Portland with
PiP assessments for refusal of sales in Year 3; and 4) estimate impact of the PT intervention on refusal to PiPs
by implementing the PT intervention with the remaining stores in Portland in Year 3 in a partial cross-over
design and assessing state-licensed stores in greater Portland with the PiP protocol in Year 4 and in Year 5. The
research is innovative and high impact by testing one of the first interventions to prevent recreational
marijuana sales to obviously-intoxicated customers in one of the first states to ban such sales to reduce the risk
of poly-substance impaired driving and other harms. The design allows for reproducibility by using a partial
cross-over to enhance power with both between- and within-group comparisons. The PT intervention can be a
model intervention to improve compliance with regulations on recreational marijuana sales in other states that
have legalized recreational marijuana, now numbering 17 U.S. states, or that are considering legalization."
10909791,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent in U.S. military service members and Veterans due to the impact of
joint trauma and overuse injury. Its socioeconomic impact is substantial, estimated to approach $60 billion
per year, and no disease-modifying treatments exist. Collaborative programs (such as CaRe-AP) have been
proposed to develop a treatment for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) that will relieve pain and improve
function. The hypothesis that PTOA is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the
pro-inflammatory pathways of innate immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural
decline have been broadly accepted. To this end, OA has long been characterized as a ‘wear and tear’
disease but is now considered a cell-mediated condition involving low-grade innate inflammation affecting
all tissues of the joint (cartilage, bone, synovium, fat pads). Inflammatory processes increase the risk of
knee OA (kOA) onset and progression, though the role of inflammation in the kOA, and as a determinant in
successful treatments is unclear. Further, correlation of structural changes that result in progression of
degeneration in kOA with those that serve as pain generators in this disease is crucial. Opioid prescriptions
due to acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain visits increased by 50% between 2006 and 2010.
MRI of kOA has historically focused on tissue specific drivers of OA, most notably cartilage evaluation. Our
past work has pioneered a whole-joint approach to kOA, taking into consideration interactions between
cartilage, meniscus and subchondral bone. The current MRI literature on the synovium, synovial fluid,
infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) and bone marrow are limited, presenting a significant gap in MRI evaluation of
kOA. The overwhelming majority of MRI literature addressing synovitis/effusion involves intravenous
contrast-based protocols. In a patient population prone to peripheral vascular disease (affecting contrast
delivery) and requiring longitudinal follow-up, contrast administration is suboptimal. Given the histologic
elements of the inflammatory pathway in synovium, IFP and bone marrow, non-invasive identification and
characterization of cellular infiltrates as well as their distinction from synovial hyperplasia, fibrosis and
vascularity in tissues would represent a revolutionary step in understanding the role of inflammation in OA
progression and response to therapy. Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) is a novel diffusion-weighted
technique that has been used to distinguish restricted diffusion within cells from other water compartments,
has higher resolution than standard diffusion sequences, and has the potential to be standardized across
institutions. Ultrashort Echo Time Dual Echo Steady State (UTE-DESS) combines UTE and DESS to
characterize tissues with a range of intrinsic MR properties and allows quantitative evaluation of those
properties (T1 and T2) as well as diffusion data. We hypothesize that these techniques can be used to
identify cellular infiltrates (RSI) and distinguish them from regions of fibrosis and vascularity (UTE-DESS) in
synovium, IFP and bone marrow in the setting of kOA.
The overall goal of this project is to optimize and validate novel non-invasive (RSI and UTE-DESS) MRI
biomarkers of joint inflammation that can identify and characterize inflammatory changes of cellular infiltrates,
fibrosis and vascularity in synovium, IFP and bone marrow. We will deploy these MR biomarkers of
inflammation in a preclinical animal model (mild, moderate and severe kOA) and translate optimized
sequences to assess conservative therapy in kOA subjects. We will develop a multi-variate statistical model
that incorporates outcomes from clinical morphologic MRI, novel optimized MR biomarkers of inflammation,
MR spectroscopy to create a structural/ biochemical framework to correlate with kOA pain/function."
10795639,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important concern of the Veterans Administration,
associated with considerable morbidity, increased mental healthcare costs and loss of economic
productivity. A recent State of the Science conference convened by the Department of Defense on
Discovering Drug Targets for PTSD concluded that a decade of research costing millions of dollars
had yielded few new effective drug treatments for PTSD. In addition to limitations in efficacy,
pharmacological treatments can be limited by side effects or poor compliance, while
psychotherapeutic interventions may not be tolerated due to re-activation of traumatic memories.
Electrical treatments represent a new horizon in the treatment of PTSD and psychiatric disorders in
general. Earlier generations of electrical treatments were limited by the need for complicated
surgical and anesthetic procedures, high cost, and lack of reimbursement by insurance for
procedures or routine psychiatric follow-up. This prevented wide-spread implementation of these
treatments in psychiatry. New non-invasive transcutaneous cervical (neck) Vagal Nerve
Stimulation (tcVNS) devices that are economical and do not require surgical implantation
overcome these limitations of electrical treatments, as well as avoiding side effects or other
limitations to medication treatments for PTSD. VNS results in both enhancement of anterior
cingulate and reduction in insula responses to traumatic stress scripts as well as peripheral
cardiovascular / sympathetic and immune function, all of which indicate that they could act on
neurobiological and physiological systems that maintain symptoms of PTSD. Our preliminary data
shows that tcVNS (but not sham stimulation) when applied in conjunction with exposure to scripts
of specific traumatic memories blocks the effects of stress on increased peripheral vasoconstriction
and sympathetic tone as measured with direct cardiovascular measures (pre-ejection period, or
PEP) and reduces inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6) and insula response while enhancing
anterior cingulate function in PTSD. This project will explore the effects of tcVNS or sham
treatment on brain, cardiovascular / sympathetic and immune response to stress in veterans with
PTSD. Veterans will undergo exposure to traumatic script stress in conjunction with High
Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HRPET) measurement of brain function and peripheral
cardiovascular /sympathetic function and immune biomarkers in blood. Veterans will then undergo
three months of twice daily treatment with tcVNS or sham stimulation followed by a repeat of these
measures. We hypothesize that tcVNS but not sham stimulation will result in a reduction in brain /
cardiovascular / sympathetic and immune response to stress in veterans with PTSD, as well as
symptoms of PTSD with long term treatment. This project will provide information about
mechanisms of tcVNS on the neurobiology and physiology of PTSD and ways in which it may
ameliorate symptoms of PTSD."
10721359,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major medical concern in service personnel and veterans as currently no
therapy is available to alleviate post-trauma neurological deficits. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a
dynamic interface to separate the brain from the circulatory system, maintaining a stable brain
microenvironment. As a major component of the BBB, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), together
with intercellular tight junctions (TJs), play a dominant role in modulating BBB integrity and paracellular
permeability1. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that BBB breakdown after TBI promotes a devastating
cascade of events such as transmigration of peripheral immune cells, cerebral inflammatory responses, edema,
and hemorrhagic transformation, contributing to secondary injury in neurotrauma. Thus, it is necessary to
identify mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies that protect BBB integrity and prevent
permanent brain damage after TBI.
 MicroRNAs (miRs) function as a major class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively modulate protein
expression. In addition to their critical role in various biological processes, miRs have also been implicated in a
variety of human neurological diseases. We and others have shown the involvement of miRs in the
pathogenesis of TBI. However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of miR molecules in
regulating cerebrovascular pathogenesis, in particular BBB disruption/dysfunction, and resultant long-term
neurological outcomes are poorly understood in TBI.
 The miR-15a/16-1 cluster is the first identified miR group associated with human carcinogenesis.
Dysregulated plasma miR-15a/16-1 levels have been found in TBI individuals, showing great potential as
useful biomarkers in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Interestingly, molecular inhibition of miR-15a/16-1 levels
has been shown to protect against myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic brain injury. Therefore, American
and European pharmaceutical companies consider the miR-15a/16-1 cluster as one of the most important miR
targets to develop miR-based drugs for the treatment of MI.
 In our recent preliminary studies, we have shown that expression of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster is
selectively increased in the mouse cerebral vasculature after TBI. Of note, endothelial cell (EC)-selective miR-
15a/16-1 genetic deficiency leads to reduced BBB leakage, and less neuronal loss, white matter (WM) injury,
and neurobehavioral impairments in mice after TBI. We also found that the miR-15a/16-1 cluster can bind to
the 3’-UTRs of major BBB tight junctions, brain-enriched Claudins, and inhibit their translation, and genetic
silencing or deletion of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster significantly increased endothelial or cerebral expression of
claudins. These findings have provided the basis for our Central Hypothesis that genetic deletion of
vascular miR-15a/16-1 attenuates BBB disruption and subsequent pathological cascades after TBI,
thereby contributing to increased BBB stabilization, reduced neuronal/WM loss, and improved long-
term neurological outcomes in TBI. Three aims will be performed in this proposal. Aim 1: Define the role of
vascular miR-15a/16-1 in post-traumatic BBB dysfunction and TBI outcomes; Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanisms
of miR-15a/16-1 regulation of post-traumatic BBB dysfunction; Aim 3: Explore systematic delivery of miR-
15a/16-1 antagomir (inhibitor) as a potential therapy in TBI through BBB stabilization. Elucidating the molecular
mechanisms of miR-15a/16-1-mediated BBB dysfunction may lead us to discover novel and effective treatment
against TBI."

The main objective of this proposal is to develop a new multi-spectral light source with exceptional illumination
uniformity we call “Effective Uniform Color-Light Integration Device (EUCLID)” for biological imaging applications.
Our project's primary goal is to show how EUCLID impacts multispectral imaging applications and validate in
mesoscale brain imaging, a popular neurophotonics application. We anticipate that EUCLID can be integrated
into a wide range of biological microscopic and mesoscopic imaging applications, including super-resolution
microscopy and birefringence microscopy. In biological widefield imaging application, illumination homogeneity
is a crucial factor for excitation performance and resulting data quality. Yet, due to spatial and spectral non-
uniformity of conventional imaging systems caused by imperfect optical components, illumination corrections
require sophisticated solutions. Illumination design for multi-spectral imaging (MSI) is particularly challenging as
field uniformity across a wide range of wavelength is essential. Recent advancements in light emitting and laser
diode technology enables creation of multi-spectral light sources with previously unattainable compactness,
power, and controllability. Traditionally, achieving homogenous illumination at several wavelengths requires
combining collimated beams using dichroic mirrors or beam-splitters and precise alignment. Cost, complexity,
and absolute size of the illumination solution require careful consideration when developing a MSI application.
The significant novelty of EUCLID is the introduction of a conical geometry allowing for light integration, design
optimization and uniformity adjustments. The diffuse-reflective adjustable hollow cavity used in EUCLID alters
the source field distribution to compensate spatial non-uniformity caused by the imaging system's optical
components while allowing for uniform mixing of light from discrete sources with great efficiency. With a maximum
spatial deviation of 1% over a large field of view, preliminary experiments show significantly improved illumination
for multispectral imaging in both Nelsonian (critical) and Koehler configuration (FOV). EUCLID is also shown to
provide speckle-free laser illumination over a wide field-of-view with a plateau uniformity around 2% for a broad
spectrum. This uniformity introduced by the EUCLID is 3 times better than current state-of-the art flat-top
illumination technique. In this proposal, we propose to show EUCLIDs performance in multispectral mesoscale
brain imaging where neuronal activity (calcium signals), hemodynamic activity (hemoglobin oxygenation), and
neuromodulation (acetylcholine levels) are simultaneously monitored across the dorsal cortex of mice with
implanted ‘crystal skull’ windows. For that, we will develop two different EUCLID designs. The first one will accept
two different commercial LED bulb to provide oblique excitation light to monitor neuronal activity. The latter one
will integrate two different laser source and provide speckle-free uniform illumination to detect hemoglobin
oxygenation. We formed a partnership with Boston University's Neurovascular Imaging Laboratory and
Neurophotonics Center allowing us to showcase how EUCLID can be used in biological imaging applications."

 Electrographic seizures (ESz) and high-frequency periodic discharges (HF-PD) are present in
approximately
30%
of
severe
traumatic
brain
injury
(sTBI)
patients
and
are
associated
with
poor
outcomes
across
a
range
of
acute
brain
injuries.
ESz and HF-PD are associated with hypermetabolism that demands
more energy than supplied, particularly in patients vulnerable from acute brain injury. A gap in knowledge
exists regarding whether ESz and HF-PD result in secondary brain injury in sTBI and are treatment-responsive.
To date, no existing treatment guidelines are available regarding which epileptiform abnormalities result in
secondary brain injury or respond to treatment after sTBI. Thus, our central hypothesis is that ESz and HF-
PD represent a treatable biomarker of metabolic crisis and secondary brain injury in at-risk tissue. The long-
range goal of our research program is to improve the outcomes of sTBI patients by developing treatment
strategies that reduce acute secondary brain injury. The proposed project is significant because it will 1)
establish if ESz and HF-PD exposure is linked with metabolic crisis, 2) quantify the impact of ESz and HF-PD
on clinical outcome, and 3) investigate the effect of clinical treatment on ESz and HF-PD exposure in a large,
generalizable population of sTBI patients. BOOST-3 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe TBI Phase 3 trial,
U01 NS099946) is a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a treatment strategy using
invasively monitoring to optimize PbtO2 and ICP compared to ICP alone. It offers a unique infrastructure in a
codified cohort to quantify the complex relationship between EEG abnormalities, PbtO2, ICP, clinical outcomes,
and treatment. We will evaluate our central hypothesis in 250 BOOST-3 patients from selected BOOST-3 sites
performing continuous EEG (cEEG) as standard of care in sTBI patients undergoing invasive multimodality
monitoring. We will address the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate the influence of ESz
and HF-PD on brain tissue oxygenation after sTBI. We will establish the relationship between ESz, HF-PD,
brain hypoxia, and elevated ICP to determine if ESz and HF-PD are a dynamic biomarker of secondary brain
injury related to metabolic crisis after sTBI. Specific Aim 2: Quantify the effect of ESz and HF-PD exposure
on functional outcome after sTBI. We will determine the effect of elevations in the peak exposure to ESz and
HF-PD on functional outcome measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale – Extended (GOSE) 6 months after sTBI.
Specific Aim 3: Quantify the effect of ESz and HF-PD exposure on functional outcome after sTBI. We
will evaluate the change in ESz and HF-PD exposure after anti-seizure drug intervention. Further, we will
measure the change in quantitative measures of EEG frequency and networks as well as Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS) score trends before and after the administration of anti-seizure drugs. The findings from this
study will lead to future clinical trials of interventions targeting disrupted metabolism associated with
ESz and HF-PD, in order to improve patient outcomes after sTBI."

Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations in the US face a disproportionate burden of poor
health outcomes. Progress toward eliminating gaps in health outcomes is minimal, despite
increasing investments in and awareness of health inequities. Recognizing that those inequities
are rooted in the conditions in which we live, grow, work, and learn, there has been increased
attention toward social determinants of health. In the past several years, health systems and the
federal government, through Medicare and Medicaid, have committed billions of dollars to
address health-related social needs such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Though
increasingly recognized as the root cause of unequal mortality and disease burden, structural
racism is infrequently considered, poorly understood, and inadequately measured.
Using a structural racism framework, this study will create a neighborhood-level structural
racism effect index by compositing publicly available data. Including data about housing,
transportation, education, wealth and poverty, social cohesion, the built environment,
employment, and criminal justice, the structural racism effect index will capture broad and
interwoven effects of past and current racist policies. The index will assign a score of 0-100 to
each census tract in the US and will be tested against publicly available outcome data such as
average area life expectancy and prevalence of select health outcomes. The novel structural
racism effect index may be used to predict costs and outcomes, direct resources, and inform
decision-making about under-resourced populations. To illustrate the policy implications of a
measure for the effects of structural racism, the index will be used to characterize the Medicaid
population as a means of providing insight into where investments should be made. Using
Massachusetts as a test case, this project will quantify the extent to which structural racism's
effects modify the impact of a $149 million program to address the health-related social needs
of the Massachusetts Medicaid population.

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease marked by painful, recurrent skin abscesses, cysts,
draining sinus tracts, and disfiguring scarring. Hidradenitis suppurativa disproportionately affects racial and
ethnic minority groups. Despite an awareness of these disparities, the underlying causes have not been
adequately studied. Dr. Chang is seeking an NIH K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award to acquire the necessary mentored training, practical experience, and knowledge to
become an independently funded clinical investigator of health disparities in chronic inflammatory skin
diseases with a focus on hidradenitis suppurativa. Towards this goal, the overall objective of this application is
to identify individual-level, interpersonal-level, and community-level factors that influence hidradenitis
suppurativa epidemiology and outcomes. Understanding these multilevel factors and their interactions is
pivotal for advancing our understanding of hidradenitis suppurativa and designing effective interventions to
improve hidradenitis suppurativa management. Dr. Chang proposes to: 1) Use a large racially and
socioeconomically diverse dataset to identify differences in hidradenitis suppurativa prevalence based on
individual-level and community-level factors and to evaluate the association between individual-level and
community-level factors and receiving biologic therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa; 2) Assess individual-,
interpersonal-, and community-level factors associated with time to diagnosis by conducting a survey study of
racially and socioeconomically diverse adults living with hidradenitis suppurativa; 3) Identify patient-reported
facilitators of obtaining care for hidradenitis suppurativa using a mixed methods approach with racially and
socioeconomically diverse study participants. A mentoring team with multidisciplinary expertise will guide Dr.
Chang's career development and research progress: immune-mediated diseases (Dr. Yazdany), hidradenitis
suppurativa (Drs. Naik and Linos), epidemiologic methods for observational studies (Drs. Yazdany and Linos),
health disparities research (Drs. Yazdany and Ackerman), qualitative/mixed methods research (Drs. Ackerman

Chang's expertise in health disparities research in chronic inflammatory diseases."
10480808,"For many years brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) have been explored as a means of restoring communication
to patients with Locked-In Syndrome (LIS), a devastating and often irreversible neurological condition in which
cognition is intact but nearly all motor output from the brain is interrupted, effectively cutting off communication
with the outside world. To date non-invasive BCI's (e.g. EEG) have had inadequate signal fidelity and spatial
resolution, while invasive BCI's using microelectrode arrays in hand motor cortex have delivered cursor and
multi-joint robotic control in controlled settings, but have been difficult to learn and have required frequent
retraining of decoding models, due to instabilities in the microelectrode-tissue interface.
 High-density electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings have been recently used by our team (JHU and
University of Utrecht) and by others for real-time detection and classification of a variety of different upper limb
movements and speech components. ECoG has sufficient spatial-temporal resolution and signal quality to
decode the broadband high-gamma (~60-200 Hz) responses of native cortical representations for upper limb
movements and speech. Speech representations are spatially distributed over several square centimeters,
ideally suited for electrocorticography (ECoG), but impractical for MEA's.
 In a recent landmark paper in NEJM (Vansteensel et al. 2016) Dr. Ramsey's team in Utrecht demonstrated
home use of a fully implantable wireless ECoG BCI by a patient with LIS, without supervision by researchers.
To expand on the capabilities of this 4-channel system, our team proposes a first-in-human clinical trial to
establish the safety and efficacy of an ECoG BCI with far more channels, implanted for 6 months. Based on
the long-term safety and signal quality of ECoG demonstrated in neuromodulation for epilepsy (Neuropace
RNS), we have an IDE for the proposed “CortiCom System”, which uniquely combines a 128-channel HD-
ECoG array (PMT Corp) with a transcutaneous pedestal connector and neural signal processor (Blackrock
Microsystems). In this early feasibility trial, our team will pursue the following Aims/Milestones:
1. Demonstrate efficient and stable control of essential BCI functions (initiate BCI, call caregiver, and BCI
menu navigation). CortiCom will use real-time decoding of attempted movements of different fingers, arm
joints, and mouth and face muscles to control the critical BCI functions, e.g. caregiver calling (by 3 months),
and menu navigation--Up/Down/Left/Right, Enter, and Back/Escape (6 commands).
 2. Demonstrate efficient and stable operation of a keyword-based speech BCI. CortiCom will use low-
latency detection and classification of attempted speech (keywords) to expand communication. Keyword
decoding will use a hierarchical hybrid model to detect and classify keywords based on their unique spatial-
temporal signatures of population activity. Keyword command vocabulary, based on communication value and
ease of classification, will expand from 6 (by 3 months) to 20 or more keywords during the trial."
10673134,"Intellectual disability (ID) results from developmental conditions that are characterized by significant deficits
in intellectual functioning with a prevalence of 1-3% in general population. In most cases, patients with ID
also present with skeletal abnormalities. Recent studies identified several different nonsense mutations in
the trafficking protein particle complex (TRAPPC9) gene in both consanguineous and non-consanguineous
families. Patients with TRAPPC9 mutations share phenotypic features including unique facial appearance,
skeletal abnormalities, moderate-to-severe ID, highlighting the importance of TRAPPC9 in both brain and
skeletal development. However, its precise role in normal skeletogenesis remains obscure. TRAPPC9 is
known as NIBP [NFkB inducing kinase (NIK) and IkB kinase 2 (IKK2) binding protein]. It enhances cytokine-
induced NFkB activation by increasing the kinase activities of IKK2 and NIK, modulating both the canonical
and non-canonical NFkB signaling. In addition, TRAPPC9 is also critical to intracellular vesicular trafficking.
The relative importance of NFkB signaling and vesicular trafficking to the skeletal phenotype in TRAPPC9
patients is unknown. In this application, we propose to study the role of TRAPPC9 in normal bone
physiology and its role in osteoclast (OC) differentiation and function. Our preliminary studies show that
TRAPPC9 is expressed in bone cells and binds NIK and IKK2 in OC in vitro. Functional knockdown of
TRAPPC9 in OC leads to defective OC differentiation and function. In addition, floxed-TRAPPC9 transgenic
mice crossed with myeloid-specific Cre (LysM) mice, develop osteopetrosis. Together these results strongly
suggest TRAPPC9 is a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis. TRAPPC9 also mediates vesicular
trafficking. Here we present data that TRAPPC9 binds to L-plastin and regulates actin-ring formation and
OC function. These findings and others presented in this application, prompted us to hypothesize that
TRAPPC9 regulates osteoclast differentiation and function via modulation of NFkB-dependent and
unrelated signaling pathways. To test our hypothesis, we propose to examine the functional role of
TRAPPC9 using conditional null mice in OC lineage. In addition, we will determine the mechanisms by which
TRAPPC9 modulates NFkB-dependent signaling in OC. Aim 1 will focus on characterization of the skeletal
phenotype of TRAPPC9 conditional knockout mice and will examine the impact of TRAPPC9 deficiency on OC
differentiation and function. Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TRAPPC9 regulates of NFkB
signaling and determine the physiological role of TRAPPC9 in osteoporosis. Aim 3 will examine the role of
TRAPPC9 in OC polarization and function. In sum, these experiments will decipher the role of TRAPPC9 in
regulating bone mass and the mechanisms by which TRAPPC9 regulates NFkB signaling. The successful
accomplishment of this project will generate new clues to enhance our knowledge of NFkB signaling in bone
cells and the development of therapeutic modalities for bone loss diseases."

While a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection has been reported in two individuals after a stem cell transplant with
CCR5∆32 homozygous cells, a spontaneous functional cure of HIV-1 occurs in 0.3-0.5% of all infected
individuals. These individuals, termed elite controllers (EC), maintain undetectable levels of HIV-1 replication in
the absence of treatment, despite the repeated isolation of replication-competent virus from viral reservoir cells.
These individuals provide living evidence that spontaneous control of HIV-1 infection is possible, and the
identification of virological and immunological mechanisms underlying such a remarkable disease outcome holds
promise for inducing a functional cure of HIV-1 infection in broader HIV-1 patient populations. Here, we propose
the novel hypothesis that undetectable viral loads in EC are related to specific genetic and epigenetic features
of proviral HIV-1 DNA in reservoir cells. Based on strong preliminary data, we posit that intact HIV-1 proviruses
from EC are preferentially located in non-genic chromosomal regions that do not permit effective viral gene
transcription, resulting in a proviral landscape in deep latency and with very limited responsiveness to
reactivation stimuli in vivo. In addition, we propose that intact proviruses from EC are also frequently integrated
into chromosomal regions that show epigenetic characteristics of repressive chromatin, evidenced by enhanced
distance to accessible chromatin and enrichment with inhibitory histone marks and hypermethylated DNA. To
investigate this, we plan to longitudinally analyze the frequency and chromosomal location of intact proviruses
in blood and lymphoid tissues of EC, using novel experimental and biocomputational analysis approaches
(Specific Aim 1). In addition, we will conduct a detailed analysis of epigenetic chromatin features at the
integration sites of intact proviruses, using next-generation sequencing assays for genome-wide characterization
of chromatin accessibility, RNA transcription, activating and inhibitory histone marks, and DNA methylation
(Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional experiments to evaluate responsiveness to viral reactivation
stimuli, using novel single-cell assays to simultaneously characterize proviral sequence, chromosomal
integration sites and HIV-1 transcriptional activity of single viral reservoir cells (Specific Aim 3); these highly
innovate single-reservoir-cell assays will allow to functionally test the hypothesis that chromosomal locations of
intact proviruses in EC maintain a state of deep latency and confer resistance to viral reactivation stimuli. If
successful, this project will significantly expand our current understanding of how natural, drug-free control is
possible, and be highly informative for inducing natural control in broader patient populations."
10817661,"Project Abstract
 Essential Tremor (ET) is a progressive disease that leads to significant disability and
markedly diminished quality of life. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the ventralis intermedius
(VIM) thalamus has been an effective treatment for ET control, but is associated with
problematic side effects (e.g. dysarthia, imbalance) and may lose efficacy over time in people
with severe ET. The ability to improve tremor control and reduce side effects with multifocal,
current steering DBS techniques will be an important advance to the field. Furthermore, the
ability to concurrently perform Deep Brain Recording (DBR) during DBS is of critical importance
for characterizing both the pathologic neural circuitry of tremor and network mechanisms of DBS.
 We seek to restore optimal tremor control to subjects with refractory ET by replacing a failing
single lead VIM thalamic DBS system with a dual lead (VIM + Ventralis Oralis (VOP)) thalamic
DBS system in patients seeking revision surgery. The dual lead system will not only offer an
effective rescue strategy for patients with severe tremor (open loop) and failure of standard VIM
DBS, but the optional use of a DBR-capable system will also afford us an unprecedented
opportunity to explore closed loop, on-demand, patient-specific tremor control. We propose to
conduct this clinical feasibility study in 10 human subjects. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of dual lead thalamic DBS for treatment of severe
essential tremor that has failed standard VIM DBS;
Aim 2: Identify neurophysiologic markers of action tremor using a dual lead DBS/DBR
system
Aim 3: Develop neural decoding and control strategies for closed loop dual lead
stimulation
 The proposal addresses what are arguably some of the most important limitations of
currently available treatment for severe ET patients. We have assembled a highly experienced
team of investigators and established an exclusive industrial partnership with Medtronic to fulfill
the goals of this project. The proposed plan is driven by solid neuroscience and engineering
principles that may have overarching impact on clinical applications of DBS technology for years
to come."

Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9
Exemplified by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, gene-editing technology is a powerful collection of
tools for probing the hidden mechanisms of human diseases by understanding and controlling
the functions of human genome variants. However, existing CRISPR genome technologies have
three major limitations: (1) low efficiency and lack of accuracy when making large genome
modifications such as structural variants in complex diseases; (2) uncontrollable off-target
effects that lead to unwanted editing and cellular toxicity; (3) variable activity and precision when
performing CRISPR editing in mammalian genome across different contexts, e.g. genomic loci,
cell types, and model systems. To overcome these limitations, many groups including our own
have sought to develop improved CRISPR tools using experimental methods and computational
techniques. Building on my previous expertise, I will work towards multiplex, robust and error-
free genome engineering. My group will seek to design new microbial proteins with sequence-
independent recombination and RNA-to-DNA editing capabilities (Focus 1). Then, to provide
robust gene-editing tools for studying single-cell genomics, I propose to leverage versatile
CRISPR designs to enable high-capacity cell barcoding to define genome dynamics at single-
cell resolution (Focus 2). To validate our new tools and as initial demonstration, we will use in
human cancer models, with a focus on studying the cellular dynamics that lead to tumor drug
resistance through genetic perturbation (Focus 3). The ultimate goal of my lab is to enable error-
free engineering of genomic variants at any sizes, with robust activities across in vitro and in

alterations in human diseases, a major “black box” in our genome. The success of the proposal
has the promise to generate safe, reliable genome correction tools for therapeutics."

Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Man
Almost ~ 100 million people in the US have type 2 diabetes (T2D) or pre-diabetes that accounts for 1 in 5
health care dollars. The prevalence of these metabolic disorders is increasing exponentially. Understanding the
pathogenesis of and developing better and rational therapies based on the causal factors for these conditions
is a very high priority. We have previously evaluated nighttime regulation of glucose and effects of counter-
regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol) on nocturnal endogenous glucose production (EGP) in T2D. We
observed that rates of EGP remained high all night (at 1AM vs. 4 AM vs. 7 AM) in T2D. However, we did not
determine whether the higher nighttime EGP was due to higher EGP rates all day i.e. post breakfast, post
lunch and post dinner. We also did not determine the daytime temporal profiles of EGP, insulin action and
secretion. Therefore, the mechanism of daytime regulation and diurnal pattern of EGP in T2D remains poorly
understood i.e. when do rates of EGP increase - are they higher throughout the day as they are during the
night; why is EGP higher – is it due to abnormalities in hepatic glycogen content? How can we control the
higher rates of EGP? We have designed a set of experiments to test hypotheses related to various specific
aims that address these fundamental questions. In Specific Aim 1A we will determine the diurnal pattern of
EGP using a stable label triple tracer approach and in Specific aim 1B concurrently estimate insulin action
and beta cell responsivity during the day in T2D. We will study the role of hepatic glycogen on nocturnal EGP
in T2D with glycogen loading vs. non-glycogen loading using NMR to measure hepatic glycogen content and
deuterium labeled water to measure gluconeogenesis as part of Specific Aim 2. We have designed a
mechanistic clinical trial in Specific Aim 3 to test the effects of modulators of gluconeogenesis (metformin),
glycogenolysis (insulin-glargine) and glucokinase activity (novel glucokinase activator drug: dorzagliatin) on
EGP in T2D. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators (endocrinologists, mathematical
modelers, radiologist, biostatistician) to design the various specific aims in adult subjects with T2D using state
of the art imaging (NMRS of liver to estimate glycogen content), isotopic, glucose clamp techniques and
glucose/hormonal modeling coupled with CGM data for innovative and comprehensive assessments which will
be easily translatable to clinical practice. Taken together, we believe our approach will answer vital questions
regarding the regulation of daytime and nighttime glucose production on fasting and post-prandial
hyperglycemia in subjects with T2D. The planned research will fill knowledge gaps in regulation of
endogenous glucose production, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis in people with T2D and provide insights
into future innovative therapies for this condition."

identification of modifiable early-life risk factors for IBD, risk prediction and eventually, prevention of IBD. Dr.
Agrawal’s proposed training activities are in five areas: 1) advanced and life-course epidemiology, 2) advanced
biostatistical methodology 3) predictive biomarker analysis, 4) principles of immunological data analysis and 5)
scientific and grant writing. To achieve this, she has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Inga

translational -omics and data science, and Dr. Jean-Frederic Colombel, Director of the Feinstein IBD Center,
Mount Sinai, a global expert in clinical and translational investigation of IBD pathogenesis, prediction and

research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. The Mount Sinai Division of Gastroenterology
is consistently considered one of the top 10 divisions in the country by US News and World Report and is an
international leader in IBD research and clinical care. Research: IBD, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disease of the intestinal tract with significant
morbidity, healthcare costs and has no cure. IBD pathogenesis involves early-life risk factors, but these are not
well-understood, which impedes early intervention and prevention. Newer data suggest IBD is preceded by
intestinal inflammation, loss of microbiome diversity and distinct proteomic signatures. Developing IBD risk
prediction models will shed light on IBD pathogenesis, help identify at-risk individuals, and guide therapeutic and
preventive strategies. In addition, determining the impact of IBD risk factors on intestinal inflammation and
microbiome changes will provide further insights in IBD pathogenesis and the relevance of these changes.
Therefore, our specific aims are to (1) derive and validate models to predict CD and UC risk using early-life non-
genetic risk factors (2) determine if early-life IBD risk factors are associated with intestinal inflammation, and loss
of gut microbiome diversity as well as correlate IBD risk signature based on its prediction model with intestinal
inflammation (3) determine if inflammatory protein biomarkers in the cord serum are associated with maternal
IBD status and with intestinal inflammation in the mothers and their offspring. We will study the Danish
population-based cohort for Aim 1, and MECONIUM, a novel longitudinal cohort of pregnant women with and
without IBD and their offspring for Aims 2 and 3. The general approaches and skills developed during this award
can be applied to future studies to understand better IBD pathogenesis and toward preventive efforts."

through its members who chair or co-chair research base protocols. The goal of the Florida
Pediatric NCORP will be a continuing effort to make available the latest advances in cancer
care to patients in Florida through participation in clinical trials and to register the majority of
their eligible patients on COG protocols, thereby providing quality care in patients’ home
communities. The Florida Pediatric NCORP will provide a unique opportunity to study a
geographically-defined population to investigate risk factors, patterns of care, and population-
based interventions. The Florida Pediatric NCORP will also maintain a Patient Log which affords
the opportunity to ensure the majority of eligible patients are registered on appropriate COG
protocols. Over the last grant cycle, the five Florida Pediatric NCORP participating sites have
averaged 270 patient registration on COG treament, cancer control, and cancer care delivery
protocols, as well as 321 biospeciem. The Florida Pediatric NCORP anticipates increased
patient registrations as more COG treatment, cancer control, and cancer care delivery protocols
become available. COG quality-control procedures will apply uniformly to the Florida Pediatric
NCORP, ensuring compliance with protocols and external review of pathology, radiotherapy,
surgery, and chemotherapy."
10619008,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disease that is incurable and progressive due to
fibroblast activation, and the formation of scar tissue. Approximately 130,000 Americans suffer from IPF, with
an estimated 50,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Although it is well accepted that myofibroblast
accumulation is a central component of pathogenesis in IPF, the transcriptional program(s) that orchestrate
fibroblast activation including fibroproliferation, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT), survival, and
collagen production are poorly defined and represent a significant knowledge gap in the field. WT1 is a zinc-
finger transcriptional regulator, the function of which has been poorly studied in adult fibrotic lung diseases. We
have recently reported direct clinical evidence of WT1 upregulation in fibroblasts of IPF and mouse models of
severe fibrotic lung disease. Recently published studies from our lab highlight that WT1-positive fibroblasts
play a pathogenic role in pulmonary fibrosis. In this regard, we generated fibroblast-specific WT1 knockout and
overexpression mice to investigate mechanisms and develop new therapeutic interventions against WT1-
driven pulmonary fibrosis. The focus of this application is to identify WT1-driven gene targets that are
druggable to prevent fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrosis. Our efforts to identify key targets of WT1
involved in fibroblast activation have led us to identify several anti-apoptotic genes, MYCN, and PLK1 as
important mediators of WT1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In support, we observed significant increases in
MYCN and PLK1 by WT1 in lung fibroblasts of IPF and mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis. Importantly, we
have identified a potent inhibitor of PLK1 called Volasertib (BI 6727; Phase I/II compound), as a lead small
molecule inhibitor that can block a feed-forward loop of the MYCN-PLK1 axis to attenuate WT1-driven
fibroblast activation. Together, these findings lead us to postulate that WT1 functions as a positive
regulator of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL3 and BCL2L1), and the MYCN-PLK1 axis and that these factors
are involved in fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrosis. For this study, we propose three specific
aims: 1) determine mechanisms by which WT1 inhibits apoptotic clearance in fibroblasts during the
progressive expansion of fibrotic lesions; 2) determine mechanisms underlying WT1-driven the MYCN-PLK1
axis in fibroproliferation, FMT, and ECM production, and 3) test the therapeutic potential of volasertib therapy
compared to FDA-approved anti-fibrotic therapies using two alternative mouse models of severe fibrotic lung
disease. We will use advanced molecular methods and mouse transgenic approaches, coupled with detailed
biochemical analysis of these WT1-driven processes in vivo and in vitro. Completion of the proposed
experiments is likely to impart a significant understanding of WT1-driven fibroblast activation. The
multidisciplinary team will facilitate a timely approach with expertise in all aspects of lung pathology and offers
insight into new and highly needed treatments in IPF."
10836002,"Project Summary: Overall BRIDGE Center
The promise of using Big Data for precision medicine, drug discovery, and a host of other challenges has
remained elusive. Social and technical barriers have limited our ability to leverage our collective data assets to
address biomedical and behavioral health challenges; Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions present an
opportunity to overcome these barriers. The NIH has established the Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI,
or B2AI) program to catalyze AI solutions to a set of community-defined “Grand Challenges.” This concerted
effort will lay the groundwork to promote the widespread adoption of AI and to ensure that it leads to
trustworthy, inclusive research innovations that have a significant, positive impact on human health.
The BRIDGE Center proposal includes Administrative, Teaming, Skills and Workforce Development, and
Standards Cores, chosen to coincide with the Core teams’ unique and complementary expertise in large-scale
team science, standards development and dissemination, innovative training approaches, and community
building. The vision for the BRIDGE Center is to engage all participants within and beyond the B2AI community
through carefully considered social and technical mechanisms and operational excellence, with the goal of
creating a dynamic, productive, and inclusive community that builds upon each other’s work in a deeply
collaborative manner. The mission of the BRIDGE Center is to complement the Bridge2AI Data Generation
Projects (DGPs) by supporting the integration, dissemination, and evaluation of Bridge2AI work products and
teams. We propose to achieve that mission through three aims. Aim 1 focuses on integrating across the
Bridge2AI Program. Specifically, we will foster group identity to create opportunities and incentives for
transdisciplinary learning; establish human & machine-understandable standards, practices, and vocabularies
across B2AI; and deploy technology to promote transparency and scalability across the B2AI program. Aim 2
creates and promotes opportunities to evaluate and improve B2AI products and activities including (1)
employing community-based evaluation within and across DGPs, (2) deploying data-driven evaluation and
improvement of B2AI products and processes, and (3) establishing and maintaining diversity in B2AI data,
people, and team structures through a continuous process of evaluation and refinement. Aim 3 focuses on
sustainable dissemination of products, knowledge, best practices and “lessons learned” from B2AI thereby
ensuring broad, long-lasting distribution and impact. Taken together, these Aims will create a BRIDGE Center
that fosters broad community engagement, inclusivity, and trust to successfully integrate activities and
knowledge across the B2AI Program; disseminate products, best practices, and skill development
materials/activities; and continually assess and improve all aspects of the Bridge2AI program with input from
external stakeholder communities."
10685512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Psychotic illnesses usually first emerge in young people and result in widespread suffering, protracted disability, premature death, and a huge economic burden. Early intervention represents a vital strategy to reduce this burden. Psychotic disorders are preceded by a prodromal period of distress, impaired functioning and subthreshold symptomatology. Our original research operationally defined the Clinical High Risk (CHR) state, which predicts a substantially increased risk of incipient psychosis. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical trajectories in the CHR population. The field is currently unable to reliably identify these trajectories early on, particularly on an individual patient level. The models to date (using clinical, neurocognitive, neuroimaging, neurobiological and genetic data) have yielded only modest predictive value for conversion to psychotic disorder and other outcomes. This presents a challenge for targeted intervention development and developing robust aetiological models. The current project seeks to develop more robust prediction models for a range of outcomes in the CHR population (conversion to psychotic disorder, persistent and incident non-psychotic disorder, non-remission of CHR status, persistent negative symptoms, full recovery, functional outcome) and introduce validated tools for use in clinical practice. These prediction models and associated clinical tools will be developed using multimodal data consisting of biomarkers (neuroimaging, neurocognition, neurophysiology, biospecimens), clinical data, and digital momentary assessments. The prediction models will facilitate selection of CHR patients for enrolment in clinical trials, serve as measures of early treatment effects, and monitor disease progression and clinical and functional outcomes. The project is based on four pillars:
1. An existing nationwide clinical infrastructure (network) to support recruitment and follow up of a large cohort of CHR young people (n=1000) over a short timeframe (2 year recruitment period, 2 year follow up), as well as a clinical comparison group (n=300).
2. Use of this dataset to: validate existing and forthcoming prediction models and develop new, more refined prediction models using recent methodological advances and exploratory biomarkers. 
3. Recruitment of an independent CHR sample across international centres for external validation of models generated in the Australian network to ensure generalizability of findings. Alternatively, these sites could be used as additional spokes in the network, with alternative data sets used for external validation purposes (see 2.5.4). This network of sites and research specialization will provide the clinical research infrastructure for future treatment trials in this clinical population informed by findings of the current program of work.
4. Unique track record as pioneers of the CHR field and expertise in state-of-the-art predictive modelling, including pioneering new approaches to prediction (dynamic prediction, multimodal probabilistic prediction, network theory), and use of digital technologies to support collection of requisite data. We also have unrivalled track record in management of multisite research networks in this clinical population and rapid recruitment locally, nationally, and internationally."

The goal of the CLEAR Consortium is to elucidate the developmental and genetic mechanisms of trachea-
esophageal birth defects (TEDs) to better understand their etiology, enhance diagnosis, improve treatment, and
inform strategies to generate tissue in vitro that might ultimately be used for repair. The trachea and esophagus
arise from the separation of a common foregut tube during early fetal development. Defects in trachea-
esophageal development cause a spectrum of life-threatening TEDs, which occur in ~1:3500 births and prevent
proper breathing and feeding in newborn infants. Gene mutations are known to cause TEDs but have only been
identified in ~15% of cases and how these cause congenital malformations is poorly defined. To address this
unmet need we have assembled an experienced and highly collaborative multi-disciplinary team of clinicians,
surgeons, geneticists, computational scientists, and developmental and stem cell biologists that use an
innovative combination of patient genome sequencing, neonatal MRI, animal models, quantitative cell biology,
single cell genomics, CRISPR gene editing and human PSCs-derived organoids to study TEDs. This Multi-PI
project centered at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital (CCHMC) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) is
led by Wendy Chung MD PhD (CUMC), Paul Kingma MD PhD (CCHMC), Yufeng Shen PhD (CUMC), James
Wells PhD (CCHMC) and Aaron Zorn PhD (contact PI; CCHMC). Our program has 3 projects linked together by
an Integrated Genomics Core.
Project-1: Comprehensive phenotypic and genetic assessment of TED patients.
Project-2: Defining the developmental mechanisms of TEDs in animal models.
Project-3: Modeling EA in human PSC-derived embryonic tissues."
10834289,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Overall)
The persistence of HIV infection despite long term suppression of viremia by cART constitutes the major obstacle
to HIV cure. This is unfortunately true even for patients initiated on cART during acute infection. Thus, long-term
persistent HIV reservoirs are seeded rapidly post infection, and this was confirmed in the nonhuman primate
(NHP) model of HIV. In addition, data from several groups and ours strongly suggest that residual viral replication
is ongoing despite in tissues despite full suppression of viremia by cART. Our on-going studies investigate the
“eclipse phase” of viral rebound in the NHP model after cART interruption. This “eclipse phase” is key to
understand the rebound process since the virus is spreading in tissues before viremia and it is influenced by
adaptive and innate responses as well as the host microenvironment. In our studies of early (4 days post-
infection) cART initiation, our innovative SIV-env ImmunoPET-CT guided analysis and sampling led to several
important, sometimes unexpected findings: 1) we detected SIV expansion throughout the entire host for >1 week
post cART initiation, with signal decreasing thereafter; 2) Even after 6-8 months of cART, immunoPET/CT was
sensitive enough to detect residual viral (protein) signal in tissues in spite of undetectable viremia in the blood;
3) upon ART interruption, viral signals rebounded as early as 4 days post cART interruption (ATI) but also 2
weeks before detection of virus in plasma; 4) analysis of the tissues collected at rebound through our PET-CT
guided necropsy workflow surprisingly showed that the majority of infected cells were of myeloid cells. After
extensive analysis, these cells revealed to be mast cells (MC), a predominantly tissue resident granulocytes that
we demonstrate expresses CD4 and CCR5. By teaming up with a local MC expert, we were able to demonstrate
that primary tissue MC are susceptible to HIV infection in vitro and their susceptibility and ability to support viral
replication is heavily influenced by environmental stimuli. In this PPG, we will leverage several important insights
and innovative techniques developed during our current PPG to investigate the hypothesis that MC contribute to
HIV persistence in tissues during cART and/or contribute to viral rebound upon cART interruption. Moreover, we
will clarify virus-host dynamics through phyloanatomical analysis of viral populations in tissues using tissues and
cells isolated through our innovative PET-CT guided sampling workflow. These tissues will be identified also
through the analysis of additional features of “rebound tissues” that we have recognized through our current
studies. This PPG comprises of 3 independent, although highly interconnected projects, 1 scientific NHP core
and 1 administrative core. The 3 projects will all use in different ways tissues from the NHP studies as well as
resources unique to each project and will address different although complementary questions with the ultimate
goal to dissect the mechanisms of HIV persistence and rebound."
10888420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this treatment development project is to develop and pilot an adaptive mobile health (mHealth)
intervention that targets the co-use of alcohol and opioids in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD).
Alcohol is an under-recognized contributor to the opioid crisis that, when used with opioids, substantially
increases the risk of opioid overdose and other use-related problems. Despite clear public health significance,
however, no existing intervention targets alcohol-opioid co-use. This gap is especially detrimental to young
adults aged 18-25, who have the highest rates of alcohol and opioid (i.e., nonmedical prescription opioid or
heroin) use and use disorders of any age group. Over half of young adults who use nonprescription opioids
report past-year alcohol-opioid co-use, yet few young adults receive treatment for either substance. MHealth
interventions, which use technology (e.g., smartphone applications) to intervene in daily life are highly
accessible and acceptable to young adults. MHealth thus offers a means of targeting alcohol-opioid co-use that
can reach young adults not currently in treatment. However, developing an effective mHealth intervention
requires an ecologically valid understanding of the target behavior, which does not exist for alcohol-opioid co-
use. Thus, the first step of the proposed project is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA), wherein 60
young adults (ages 18-25) with mild to moderate OUD who report regular alcohol-opioid co-use will complete
EMA multiple times daily via smartphone for 3 weeks to examine how, why, and when young adults co-use
alcohol and opioids in real time in their daily lives. Using established guidelines for developing mHealth
interventions, we will then use this EMA knowledge base to develop a smartphone-based mHealth platform
targeting alcohol-opioid co-use. The intervention will be founded on principles of motivational enhancement
therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy and deliver tailored micro-interventions based on participants’
responses to EMA assessments. We will refine the intervention based on feedback from two iterative usability
studies with 10 participants. Finally, in a new sample of 60 young adults, we will conduct a Stage 1 randomized
clinical trial, comparing the mHealth intervention to EMA-only and remote assessment-only control conditions.
We will evaluate the intervention’s feasibility and acceptability and putative mechanisms of action. Sustained
benefit will be evaluated at 3-month follow-up. This study will address national priorities to respond to the
accelerating opioid crisis. It will provide vital new information on the nature of alcohol-opioid co-use in daily life
and develop and pilot an innovative adaptive mHealth intervention to address this behavior in young adults."
10766235,"Project Summary:
There are over 1 million cases of failed bone repair in the U.S. annually, resulting in substantial patient
morbidity and societal costs. The genetic factors affecting bone repair are poorly understood because the field
has been limited by having to rely on interrogating genes with known relevance for osteoporosis or other
biological processes such as inflammation. These studies have identified only a handful of genes. In contrast,
systems genetics studies of many phenotypes including skeletal traits such as bone mineral density have
already identified multiple novel genetic variants that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.
Unfortunately, the study of bone repair in patients is not readily amenable to this approach because of the
difficulty in enrolling patients in studies after the occurrence of the index event, great variability in injury types
and lack of simple readouts to assess repair. These barriers can be overcome by using a model organism with
a well-defined injury mechanism and simple readout to characterize the repair phenotype. Thus, we will use
systems genetics to discover novel genes influencing intramembranous bone regeneration induced by marrow
ablation in a mouse model. Intramembranous bone repair is integral to fracture healing, distraction
osteogenesis, fixation of orthopedic and dental implants to the skeleton and repair of large defects caused by
trauma or necessitated by resection of bone tumors. In Aim 1, we will perform the first genome-wide
association study (GWAS) for bone repair by measuring the intramembranous bone regenerative response
after marrow ablation in Diversity Outbred (N=1000) mice. We will identify genes responsible for bone
regeneration quantitative trait loci (QTL) and expression QTL using multiple fine-mapping approaches and
transcriptomic data generated from single cell RNA-seq. In Aim 2, we will use Bayesian networks and identify
genes highly connected to known regulators of bone traits using Key Driver Analysis to identify candidate
causal genes for the bone regenerative response. In Aim 3, we will validate the role of Periostin, a recently
identified candidate gene, and at least one additional candidate identified in the first two aims. We will begin by
testing the role of Periostin, a gene implicated in intramembranous bone regeneration in preliminary
transcriptomic, lineage tracing and key driver analyses. The project will significantly increase our
understanding of the genetics of bone repair. Genes that we identify will serve as potential therapeutic targets
capable of improving multiple orthopedic and dental procedures which rely on bone repair."
10681416,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a major global health burden
through much of the world, despite the widespread distribution of insecticide-based tools and antimalarial
drugs. Consequently, there is interest in novel strategies to control these diseases, including the release of
genetically sterile male mosquitoes, mosquitoes transfected with Wolbachia, and mosquitoes engineered with
gene drive systems. The safety and effectiveness of these strategies and considerations regarding trial design
and implementation are critically dependent upon a detailed understanding of mosquito movement at both fine
and broad spatial scales, yet there are major gaps in our understanding of these movement patterns. The
declining cost of genome sequencing and novel methods for analyzing geocoded genomic data provide
opportunities to address these knowledge gaps. In this project, we propose to devise a robust approach for
inferring fine-scale mosquito dispersal patterns and their impact on innovative vector control strategies. We
propose to use in silico simulations of mosquito ecology and preliminary geocoded mosquito genomic data
collected from Fresno, California to determine sampling routines capable of quantifying dispersal patterns,
population sizes and mating patterns using genetic kinship analyses (Aim 1). Results from these analyses will
iteratively inform sampling schemes for two rounds of subsequent collections of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito
vector of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, in Yishun, Singapore (Aim 2). Genome sequencing and
kinship analyses will be used to quantify Ae. aegypti movement patterns, population sizes and mating
behaviors at this location, and to parameterize spatially-structured 3D models of Ae. aegypti population
dynamics. The resulting models will be used to explore biosafety, trial design and implementation
considerations for novel vector control strategies including: i) population suppression systems such as
Wolbachia-infected males and genetically sterile males, and ii) population replacement systems such as
population transfection with Wolbachia, localized systems such as chromosomal translocations, and non-
localized systems such as homing-based gene drive (Aim 3). We expect the proposed research to lead to the
development of greatly enhanced surveillance strategies to infer fine-scale mosquito movement patterns and
other demographic parameters, and to help inform the safe application of several novel and highly promising
strategies for the control of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses and other devastating mosquito-borne
diseases."
10836031,"SUMMARY
Strategies for achieving sustained HIV remission must target the long-lived reservoir of HIV-infected cells.
These reservoirs remain a challenge to study because they make up a very small fraction of immune cells, can
be located in difficult to sample anatomic sites (e.g., the central nervous system [CNS]), and are generally less
well studied in individuals who undergo treatment interruption. Here we aim at answering three critical
questions: (A) what are the drivers of clonal expansion, activation of HIV-1-infected cells, and viral rebound
timing – is it viral factors (such as HIV-1 integration site) that provide survival benefit of the infected cells, or is
it host factors (such as immune responses to antigen or HIV stimulation) that drive the proliferation of HIV-1-
infected cells and viral rebound after treatment interruption (Project 1)? (B) How do HIV-1-infected cells persist
and distribute between peripheral blood and the anatomical sanctuary of the CNS (Project 2)? (C) Do HIV-1
eradication strategies, such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), reprogram host immune effector
responses, transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally (Project 3)? Overall, we aim at understanding the
expansion dynamics, tissue distribution, and rebound predictors of HIV-1 persistence using several unique
clinical cohorts and innovative methods to provide critical insight to mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and
strategies for HIV-1 eradication. We will use these samples to define the mechanisms that govern spontaneous
HIV-1 reactivation during treatment interruption and the persistence of viremia despite effective antiretroviral
therapy (ART), specifically exploring virus and immune mechanisms that may impact viral maintenance and
rebound (Project 1). We focus on the establishment, persistence, clonal proliferation, and rebound competence
in different stages of infection of HIV-1 brain reservoirs, a critically important virus sanctuary that has been a
challenge to study in detail (Project 2). Lastly, we explore the immune mechanisms that impact virus reservoir
dynamics and the role of host epigenetics and immune cell function in the control and pruning of the HIV-1
proviral landscape in the context of a first-in-human broadly neutralizing antibody (Project 3). These Projects
will be supported by an Administrative Core and a Data Analytics & Modeling Core.

10819571,"Project Summary
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
deaths in men in the United States. This growing public health challenge is aggravated by disparities in the
incidence and mortality of PCa between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) men. For
example, the incidence of PCa is almost 60% higher in AA men and the mortality rate 2-3 times greater. While
access to medical care may contribute to these differences, other studies suggest that cell-based differences
may play a critical role. Unfortunately, no primary human prostate cell cultures are available for interrogating
potential cellular alterations during early carcinogenesis. Organoid culture models work well for growing normal
prostate cells and advanced PCa, but fail to succeed with primary PCa. CR (Conditional Reprogramming)
culture, which was developed by Dr. Liu (PI) and his colleagues, is changing the landscape for generating in
vitro human cancer models. CR technology allows to establish cell cultures from normal prostate, primary PCa
and advanced PCa. CR cells from normal epithelium can fully differentiate when placed in conditions that
mimic their natural environment, while CR cells from a primary prostate tumor exhibit an abnormal karyotype
and form tumors in SCID mice. In the current application, in an effort to define the biological basis for their
clinical disparities, we first propose to probe primary AA and EA normal prostate cells for differences in their
susceptibility to immortalization and transformation. Then, we will determine response of biobanked normal
and tumor CR cells to testosterone from AA and EA patients in presence or absence of their corresponding
fibroblasts. Then, we will compare the genetic and biological properties of tumor CR cultures from AA and EA
patients, including migration/invasion, anchorage-independent growth, tumor formation in presence or absence
of their corresponding fibroblasts. Finally, we will compare genetically, epigenetically and phenotypically CR
cells from AA and EA patients with metastatic and castration resistant PCa. Upon completion of this
application, we will have established a living biobank with novel functional cell models, including matched
normal and tumor prostate CR cells and their corresponding fibroblasts from AA and EA patients, immortalized
AA and EA prostate cell lines and transformed AA and EA cell lines with annotated genomic and patient’s
clinical information. These novel models include prostate cells at normal, primary PCa and advanced PCa and
will provide an invaluable and novel resource for studies of initiation and progression and health disparity
studies of PCa."

This is a new application proposing to conduct the SUBstituting with Preferred OPtions (SUB-POP) trial, a
parallel-arm RCT to test the effects of substituting SSBs with non-caloric options on body weight and markers
of T2D and cardiometabolic health. Eligible adult participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 beverage groups
(N=135 per group) at the baseline in-person visit and all will receive at-home monthly deliveries of beverages
via Amazon for 6 months. In-person clinic visits will be conducted at baseline, 6, and 12 months. After the 6
months of assigned beverage substitution and delivery, all participants will be instructed to substitute SSBs
with water only for a final 6 month observational period. In-person clinic visits will collect technician-measured
anthropometrics, blood pressure, biospecimen samples (blood, urine, stool [subset n=50 per group]), and
questionnaires (physical activity, beverage frequency), and taste preference test. The SUB-POP app-based
assessments and online diet recall will ascertain repeated measures of beverage adherence, diet, physical
activity, and appetite in the interim, every 3 months. A subset (n=60 per group) will receive at home Wi-Fi
digital scales to measure body weight approximately daily for novel energy balance and caloric compensation
modeling. Our proposal will leverage the many strengths and state-of-the-art clinical trial infrastructure of the
Division of Preventive Medicine at BWH. The highly collaborative investigator team is comprised of experts in
nutritional and obesity epidemiology, clinical trial design, implementation and analysis, energy balance and
weight loss, and interpretation for public health dietary guidelines. SUB-POP is a novel RCT that will enroll
adult regular SSB consumers with overweight or obesity to evaluate the effectiveness of substituting SSBs with
non-caloric options in a real-world, un-blinded setting. Our trial will leverage modern recruitment methods,
achieve ≥30% non-White participants, implement innovative intervention delivery, adherence, and data
collection tools, and partition the two most common artificial sweetener types to explore potential
heterogeneity. It is unknown whether ASBs, which are largely free of calories and sugar, provide a healthful
interim strategy to transition to water among habitual SSB consumers. Thus, by addressing this large gap in
our understanding of how to address a highly prevalent and concerning dietary exposure, we will inform dietary
guidelines and clinical recommendations for the prevention of obesity, T2D, and cardiometabolic disease risks."
10630212,"Genomic data hold the promise of revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of human disease. Multiple
barriers stand between the acquisition of the data and realizing these and other benefits. Rapid accumulation
of genomic data far exceeds our capacity to reliably interpret genomic variation. New developments in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, combined with increased computing power and domain knowledge, provide
hope for the deployment of enhanced computational tools in both basic research and clinical practice. Use of
these methods critically depends upon reliable characterization of their performance.
 The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (C-CAGI) will address these needs, through
objective evaluation of the state of the art in relating human genetic variation and health. CAGI has had five
editions since 2010 with 50 challenges posed to the community taken on by hundreds of predictors, leading to
scores of publications about prediction methods and their assessment. We propose for C-CAGI to continue to
advance the field of variant interpretation through the following Specific Aims:
1. Develop community experiments to evaluate the quality of computational methods for interpreting
genomic variation data. C-CAGI will conduct community experiments in which participants make bona fide
blinded predictions of disease related phenotypes on the basis of genomic data. We will engage a diverse
predictor community to spur innovation. The CAGI Ethics Forum will vet studies to ensure that privacy and
sharing maintain the highest standards and will educate the community.
2. Assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data;
highlight innovations and progress at interactive conferences. Predictions will be evaluated by
independent assessors, who will be supported by new assessment approaches from C-CAGI. Results will be
presented at CAGI experiment conferences with deep technical engagement, which will be interleaved with
reflective CAGIâ meetings that create an environment for a comprehensive evaluation of the field, facilitating
identification of major bottlenecks and problems faced by the current genome interpretation approaches.
3. Broadly disseminate the results and conclusions from the CAGI experiments and analysis. C-CAGI
will outreach to the broader scientific and clinical community through its publications, and the creation of a
calibrated reference integrated into the most common workflows for ready adoption. CAGI will also be
represented at international meetings with presentations and workshops.
4. Operate effectively and responsively. C-CAGI will operate efficiently as it closely interacts with hundreds
of participants. CAGI will build upon a robust information infrastructure that securely facilitates data
dissemination, prediction submission, and assessment."
11162642,"This application from Florida International University (FIU) and Emory University requests support for a four-year
research conference series to address critical scientific issues associated with reducing Alzheimer's Disease
and Related Dementia (ADRD) inequities among ethnic minorities in the United States. The conference series
we propose rests on interdisciplinary research using a population disease framework, with specific attention to
ethnic groups and sex differences in pathways to neurodegenerative diseases. Genetics and family/personal
health histories are non-modifiable factors, and modifiable factors include a wide range of lifespan environmental
exposures and lifestyle factors. The conference series focuses on increasing understanding about how genetic
factors are operating in concert with environmental exposures, family and personal health histories, and lifestyle
factors to produce interactions that enhance or mitigate risk of ADRD within and between ethnic groups,
specifically among African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites. These critical issues remain largely
overlooked and are fundamental for increasing knowledge for disease modification using precision medicine and
for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic intervention development in under-represented populations in AD
clinical trials. The 4 related specific aims of the series are: 1. To understand how the current evidence examines
specific genes, individually or in combination, are differentially distributed by ethnicity and sex, and are
associated with higher risk or protection against LOAD between and among higher risk ethnic groups. 2. To
describe how genetic risk may be modulated by factors such as epigenetics, age, sex, environmental exposures,
lifestyle/diet, family and personal health histories, social, and demographic factors between and within ethnic
groups and women at disproportionate risk for LOAD. 3. To examine current knowledge about how comorbidities
such as vascular diseases, diabetes, and mental health moderate or mediate the increase risk of ADRD in these
under-represented populations. 4. To explore underlying theory, new findings, and innovative observation,
instrument development and calibration for respondent or patient assessment, and measurement/analytic
strategies to improve our understanding of the gene x environment interactions influencing ADRD risk and how
methods may be modified or adapted for use in specific research applications with higher risk minority
populations and women."
10754225,"Among Veterans, post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can result in end-organ damage such as liver
cirrhosis. Both cirrhosis and PTSD independently lead to gut dysbiosis and brain dysfunction. We have shown
that cognitive dysfunction in Veterans with cirrhosis is linked with high stool pathobionts, alteration of bile acids
and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and a pro-inflammatory milieu that were linked to cognition and patient-
reported outcomes. However, alterations in gut-liver-brain axis in Veterans with PTSD+Cirrhosis require further
investigation. This is part of a Collaborative Merit Application (CMA) entitled “Targeting Gut-Microbiome in
Veterans Deployment related Gastrointestinal and Liver diseases”. These proposals focus on the impact of
PTSD and Gulf War Illness on cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diarrheal diseases in Veterans.
Our published data shows that Veterans with PTSD+cirrhosis have greater cognitive impairment, microbial
dysbiosis and serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) compared to cirrhosis without PTSD. Our
preliminary data show a) Veterans with PTSD+cirrhosis have worse cirrhosis-related outcomes versus
cirrhosis alone; 2) metagenomics with lower abundance of genes synthesizing SCFA in PTSD+cirrhosis versus
cirrhosis; and, 3) microbiota from PTSD+cirrhosis patients transferred to germ-free (GF) mice show lower
microbial diversity and higher intestinal and cortical inflammation versus cirrhosis, PTSD, and controls.
The current medications for PTSD have relatively modest success. Given the central role of the liver in
metabolizing medications and potential for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) development, the use of neuroactive
medications in cirrhosis is challenging. Microbial modulation may be a major step to safely treat the gut-derived
inflammation that can result in brain dysfunction in Veterans with PTSD+cirrhosis. We have performed three
phase 1 randomized trials of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in Veterans with cirrhosis. These trials
demonstrate safety, better cognition, lower serum LBP and systemic inflammatory milieu, and higher
stool/plasma SCFA. However, before we apply these to Veterans living with PTSD+cirrhosis, we need to
determine the role of microbial changes. This proposal is a first step towards this overarching goal.
Our overall hypothesis is: “Gut microbial alterations lead to increased impairment of intestinal barrier
and greater cognitive dysfunction in Veterans with concomitant PTSD and cirrhosis, compared to
those with PTSD or cirrhosis alone, due to synergistic inflammatory processes”. This is due to increased
inflammation and intestinal barrier changes associated with microbially transformed bile acid and SCFAs. This
hypothesis will be tested with the following two aims:
Aim 1: Determine the linkage between gut microbial community composition and function with health-
related quality of life in Veterans with PTSD+cirrhosis compared to cirrhosis alone and PTSD alone.
We will enroll 320 Veterans (80 each with PTSD+cirrhosis, PTSD alone, cirrhosis alone, and controls) from
Richmond and Los Angeles VAMCs. Stool metagenomics and microbial function (stool SCFA/bile acids), and
systemic inflammatory cytokines will be linked with quality of life. PTSD and cirrhosis severity will be matched.
Aim 2: Determine which microbial taxa mediate development of intestinal barrier change, altered bile
acids, and brain inflammation using human to germ-free mouse transplants, and evaluate their impact
on resilience from stress. Aim 2.1: Define the impact of colonization of GF mice with stools from Veterans
with PTSD+cirrhosis compared to PTSD alone, cirrhosis alone, and controls on gut and neuroinflammation,
and changes in intestinal barrier with resultant changes in behavior using a validated mouse model of PTSD.
Aim 2.2: Define the role of this differential colonization in mediating resilience towards PTSD-related stress.
The study team is experienced in cirrhosis, microbiome analysis, PTSD and gnotobiotic studies. This proposal
will form a platform to investigate microbially-based treatments in Veterans with cirrhosis and PTSD."

 R01 DA047336-01: Opioids and Maternal Brain-Behavior Adaptation During the Early Postpartum
 Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a fast-growing and devastating epidemic in the US, affecting a high
proportion of child-bearing women, with many suffering comorbid mood disorders. Untreated opioid use and
dependence may cause withdrawal symptoms, impair interpersonal interactions and may be associated with
polysubstance use and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). These problems are linked to higher risks of
child maltreatment and costly utilization of foster care. Buprenorphine Treatment (BT) reduces withdrawal
and other deleterious effects of illicit opioids for peripartum women. However, the effects of BT on
maternal neurobiology and infant-oriented behaviors in the context of OUD are unknown. Preclinical
maternal brain-behavior research and human brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have provided
a model of corticolimbic maternal caregiving neurocircuit (MCN) for parenting behaviors. The MCN includes
two reciprocally inhibiting subsystems for (1) maternal care, mediated by the medial preoptic area in
hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum; and (2) maternal defense,
mediated by periaqueductal grey. For humans, the MCN regulates flexible responses to the demands of their
own infant – such as to the unique, ethologically salient own-baby cry – during the early postpartum period. We
aim to examine the human MCN and maternal behaviors in a group of mothers undergoing BT for OUD (n=80)
as compared to non-OUD depression Matched Controls (MC, n=80). All participant will have 2 MRI scans: T1
at 1-month postpartum and T2 at 4-month postpartum. We will measure maternal thoughts and behaviors –
including measures of infant-oriented care and defense – and polysubstance use and moods in all participants.
We will use multimodal neuroimaging methods to measure resting-state functional connectivity, neural
responses to own-baby cry, and gray matter volumes of MCN. Based on our preliminary research and
preclinical models we hypothesize that BT in OUD increases activity in both care and defense
subsystems of MCN and diminishes normal reciprocal inhibition between these subsystems, resulting
in potential disinhibition of maternal infant-oriented defensive thoughts and behaviors. Finally, we will
explore the effects of cumulative buprenorphine exposure (daily dosage x days on BT) on MCN physiology and
maternal behaviors within the group of BT mothers, controlling for polysubstance use and NAS. The proposed
research will elucidate the effects of BT in the context of OUD on the neurobiology of parenting - with
translational potential to optimize current approaches to treat mothers with OUD and suggest directions to best
manage postpartum mental health issues."

Diabetes mellitus affects close to 30 million people in the United States, causing significant morbidity and
mortality and economic burden to the healthcare system. A critical aspect of addressing this burden is
optimizing glycemic outcomes through accurate diabetes classification and management. This concept is most
precisely applied to monogenic diabetes, where genetic diagnosis directs gene-targeted therapy resulting in
improved clinical outcomes and will inform the implementation of similar future approaches to type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Monogenic diabetes remains the best example of personalized medicine in diabetes, yet it is usually
misdiagnosed and therefore inappropriately treated. Over the last four years, enrollment in the University of
Chicago Monogenic Diabetes Registry has surged to over 1000 with causal genetic variants, including 344
individuals whose diagnosis was made possible only through our research funding in the last four years. We
are the largest registry of monogenic diabetes in the Western Hemisphere and we have detailed the clinical
and cost-effectiveness of diabetes precision medicine in over 30 publications.
 Our overarching goals continue to be: to accelerate efficient diagnosis, to advance progress in
understanding, and to inform clinical guidelines in the management of monogenic forms of diabetes, through
cumulative longitudinal follow-up and pragmatic cohort studies from our Registry. We propose to bolster our
innovative efforts by establishing a genetic testing algorithm that accurately identifies appropriate individuals
for single gene Sanger sequencing and prioritizes massively parallel sequencing for those who would
otherwise require iterative gene screening. Additionally, we will adapt the Registry platform to improve
engagement via a participant-facing portal and ensure sustainability through adaptive change garnered from
Registry insights. Finally, we will engage current Registry participants to identify barriers to sharing positive
monogenic diabetes results with relatives, which will guide the development of a structured approach to
cascade genetic testing, as well as cost-effectiveness analyses, to improve enrollment of family members for
genetic testing.
 These projects will have a broad direct impact by improving healthcare provider and commercial
genetic testing laboratory practices in the cost-effective diagnosis of monogenic diabetes. We aim to decrease
participant burden and improve data quality and completeness while advancing the evaluation and surveillance
infrastructure of the Registry to allow accurate conclusions about the benefits of targeted gene therapy in
monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, we aim to develop improved strategies to extend the benefits of precision
medicine through cascade testing. The Monogenic Diabetes Registry will continue to play a prominent role in
bridging evidence gaps in monogenic diabetes to ultimately improve patient outcomes and be a model for
precision diagnosis and treatment for all forms of diabetes."
10767790,"Schistosomiasis ranks second (behind malaria) as the world’s most devastating parasitic disease.
Despite this, treatment relies on a single drug, Praziquantel (PZQ), that has marginal efficacy.
This disease is caused by Schistosoma flatworms (schistosomes) that live in the vasculature,
producing eggs that spur a variety of chronic pathologies that are exacerbated by the fact that
schistosomes can survive in the blood for decades. How these parasites thrive in this hostile
environment remains an open question. Our group discovered that adult schistosomes possess
a population of somatic stem cells, neoblasts, that are critical for tissue renewal. During our
studies of these cells we made a surprising discovery: mechanical injury induces a massive
increase in neoblast proliferation at the site of wounding. Because this mirrors what happens in
highly regenerative free-living planarian flatworms, we reasoned that schistosomes may possess
an uncharacterized regenerative capacity. Whole-body regeneration (i.e., regenerating
amputated heads) is not known to occur in schistosomes; yet, classic studies suggest that
treatment of adult worms with sub-lethal doses of PZQ results in extensive tissue damage that
the worms can repair. Likewise, we find that sublethal concentrations of PZQ induce neoblast
proliferation in adult parasites. Furthermore, rapidly growing juvenile schistosomes, which have a
massive number of neoblasts, are refractory to PZQ. Thus, PZQ sensitivity and neoblast number
are inversely correlated. Given these data, we hypothesize that neoblasts fuel regenerative
responses in the worm and we predict these regenerative responses are critical to the parasite’s
ability to respond to insults in vivo, including PZQ treatment. To test this hypothesis, we propose
two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use single cell RNA sequencing to describe the
cellular lineages that operate during parasite development and determine whether these linages
programs are “reactivated” in adult worms following injury. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate
how well schistosomes are able to restore form and function to their tissues following injury and
the extent to which tissue repair relies on neoblasts. We will additionally determine whether
neoblast-driven regenerative responses are essential for juvenile and adult parasite survival
following PZQ administration in vivo. Together, these studies will be the first to explore
schistosome regenerative responses on a molecular level. Because we predict that neoblasts
mediate tissue repair following PZQ-induced damage, these studies could also suggest that
targeting neoblasts may enhance the efficacy of PZQ, thereby transforming how we treat this
disease."
10839912,"OVERALL: ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
Bridge2AI is a signature NIH initiative. It recognizes the challenges and opportunities in the growth of data sci-
ence and data-driven methods for biomedical and behavioral research and healthcare delivery. We have reached
a key moment: with the exponential growth of our ability to collect and analyze data, we must consider how we
use this information to benefit everyone in an equitable way, providing a collective path forward. Data Generation
Projects (DGPs) within Bridge2AI will tackle “grand challenges”: questions that will shape future scientific dis-
covery and can ultimately impact the health and care of many. Marshalling these forces collectively requires
experience and insight to create a collaborative, interdisciplinary endeavor that brings together disparate stake-
holders to realize Bridge2AI’s mission: discovery, collaboration, and learning.
Building from our collective experience in successfully guiding large NIH initiatives and (inter)national scientific
consortia, our BRIDGE Coordination Center (CC) is designed to ensure a responsive set of Cores that will sup-
port and enable the DGPs in their grand challenges. Representing multiple institutions (UCLA, Penn State Uni-
versity, University of Florida, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, Oregon Health & Sciences
University, Sage Bionetworks, EMBL-EBI), we propose multiple interacting Cores. These Cores have interdisci-
plinary expertise across several key areas, including biomedical informatics/data science and AI (methods, ap-
plications, evaluation), as well as across different domains and data types. Our Cores (Ethics, Standards, Tool
Optimization, Skills & Workforce Development) are ready to interact to facilitate cross-cutting activities related to
ethics and trustworthy artificial intelligence (ETAI); FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)
across emergent datasets and domains; comparison and benchmarking of developed AI-ready datasets and
tools. Across our CC we will create a basis for diverse trainees to not only appreciate the implications of AI in
biomedical/behavioral research, but to meaningfully engage with them – embracing the heterogeneity of experi-
ences, backgrounds, and objectives to maximize the richness and strength this diversity brings in our actions.
We plan to work with a Teaming Core to enable activities that bring together disparate groups within Bridge2AI.
Our efforts are organized by a skilled Administrative Core who will provide oversight and cohesion to this en-
deavor, both across the Cores as well as with the DGPs and NIH. Our Cores are shaped to maximize the inte-
gration and sharing of ideas across the DGPs and Bridge2AI as a whole through dynamic, contemporary com-
munication methods; the refinement and dissemination of best practices between these groups and wider sci-
entific community through multiple venues; and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the methods and overall
Bridge2AI initiative. This CC will provide a unified framework for Bridge2AI to engage and education different
stakeholders, and together blaze a collective trail forward for biomedical and behavioral AI – for everyone."

The aim of this grant application is to test the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted, school-
based suicide prevention intervention, delivered by indigenous Rush University social workers
(i.e., “intervention social workers”), for low-resourced, urban, African American 9th grade
students. Rates of suicide among African American youth have increased substantially in the
past 20 years, and suicide is currently one of the leading causes of death among African
American adolescents. As such, there is a need for effective, sustainable prevention
interventions for these populations. Our study will train intervention social workers to deliver a
culturally-adapted, evidence-based coping with stress prevention intervention (i.e., the
Adolescent Coping with Stress Course [A-CWS]). Urban African American adolescents who
have participated in the A-CWS have demonstrated decreases in suicide risk, as well as
decreases in anxiety and increases in several dimensions of adaptive coping (i.e., use of
positive coping strategies for problem experiences, positive thinking, depression coping self-
efficacy). We aim to demonstrate that indigenous intervention social workers can implement the
A-CWS with fidelity and that participants in intervention groups facilitated by indigenous
intervention social workers experience increases in levels of adaptive coping. We will examine
the extent that interpersonal factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness)
and socio-ecological factors (i.e., community violence exposure, limited neighborhood
resources, family dynamics) influence active suicidal ideation. We will test whether these factors
influence active suicidal ideation in African American adolescents. Lastly, our study will examine
the mechanism by which the A-CWS intervention reduces suicide risk for low-resourced, urban
African American adolescents. We will examine the ability of adaptive coping skills, gained
through participation in the A-CWS intervention, increase hope and reduce hopelessness. We
will then examine the moderating effects of hope and hopelessness on the influence of
interpersonal and socio-ecological factors on active suicidal ideation. This translational study
has public health implications. It will expand the understanding of mechanisms of change
related to suicide risk reduction in urban African American adolescents. It will test a modified
version of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide for urban African American adolescents. Lastly,
our study will inform the training and monitoring of indigenous mental health professionals to
deliver evidence-based prevention interventions for urban African American adolescents; as
such, our study will inform the practice of prevention intervention sustainability and
dissemination."
10655358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Addiction is an enormous economic, personal, and social burden, costing over $600 billion per year in the U.S.
Understanding vulnerability to addiction, and developing effective therapies, requires identifying the genes and
pathways that mediate the addiction process. Our long-term goal is to develop novel genetic models for
addiction-relevant phenotypes, and use these models to characterize the genetic mechanisms of addiction. Here,
we propose to extend our previous work that led to the cloning of a QTL that regulates addiction and the
subsequent identification of Cyfip2 in mouse substrains as a regulator of cocaine acute and sensitized
responses. We and others have since shown that this mutation regulates food reward, nicotine preference, and
alcohol preference (preliminary data). In addition, we have shown that Cyfip2 regulates voluntary self-
administration of cocaine in the IVSA assay, the gold standard in the addiction field. Cyfip2 is a hub for signal
integration from multiple pathways, including the small GTPase RAC1, WIRS domain receptors, and Fragile X
family signaling. We hypothesize that this signal integration by Cyfip2 is critical for reward behaviors. In response
to PAR-19-278, we now propose to use precise genome engineering in mice to generate and functionally validate
5 variants in Cyfip2 (1-2 amino acid substitutions each) that specifically perturb each of these signal integration
events. These mutations are designed using published biochemical data and in consultation with our Co-
Investigator Dr. Chen, who is a leader in Cyfip biophysics and structure. In the R21 phase (Aim 1), we will
leverage the mouse genetics expertise of the Jackson Laboratory to generate by CRISPR/Cas9 a set of 5 Cyfip2
signaling mutants. Specific milestones for progression to the R33 phase are (i) viability of the mutants, since the
knockout of Cyfip2 is postnatal lethal, and (ii) the lack of functional off-target edits. We will then characterize
these mutants comprehensively for cocaine and natural reward behavior (R33, Aim 2). To gain insight into
mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we will determine the biochemical interactome of each mutant in mouse
brain regions using a comprehensive mass spectrometry-based study (R33, Aim 3). The successful completion
of this project will yield 5 preclinical mouse models of addiction transition for the scientific community, as well as
information about specific signaling pathways that are critical for transition to addiction and that can be targeted
for therapy."

The convergence of radiation oncology, cancer genomics, data science, computational modeling, and artificial
intelligence presents spectacular opportunities and challenges. In the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN, we propose to
capitalize on these opportunities to improve our understanding of radiation response and resistance. The
clinical vehicles for our ROBIN Center are diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) and neuroblastoma, the two most
clinically significant pediatric tumors of neural ectodermal origin. We hypothesize that intratumoral
heterogeneity drives radiation response and resistance, and that the mechanisms thereof can be identified by
deciphering tumor cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic components of the tumor microenvironment before, during, and
after radiotherapy. The Molecular Data Science and Advanced Dosimetry Core (Data Science Core) is an
essential component of the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center. It will serve as the hub for data storage and
management, analysis, and integration of all molecular datatypes generated by the Center, advanced
dosimetry modeling, and predictive computational modeling platforms. Specifically, the Core will work to (i)
retrieve, curate, and manage molecular data related to the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center and provide the
infrastructure necessary to efficiently provide access to all data required for achieving the ROBIN goals; (ii)
analyze and integrate all molecular data types generated in Projects 1 and 2; (iii) generate advanced
dosimetry data, including accurate distributions of dose for radionuclide therapy and dose received by tumor
cells, that are required to investigate the biological hypotheses proposed in Projects 1 and 2; (iv) conduct
mechanistic modeling of radiation effects and evolution of resistance to radiotherapy that directly supports the
aims of Projects 1 and 2 and can inform data collection and address the hypotheses of the ROBIN Center;
and (v) share findings and novel methods with the ROBIN Network and the scientific community at large.
Toward these ends, the Core will coordinate its activities closely with Projects 1 and 2 and the other cores, in
particular with the AI Core, focusing on imaging, radiomics, and natural language processing, and the
Molecular Characterization Trial. The Core will also work closely with the Cross-Training Core and the
Administrative Core to reach other members of the ROBIN Network and the larger scientific community. The
Core will be directed by two investigators, Drs. Michor and Seo, who have expansive and complementary
expertise and have assembled a team of experienced investigators to contribute to the goals of the Core. We
anticipate that the results of the Data Science Core will be broadly utilized by all components of the ROBIN
Center and the larger ROBIN Network as well as the broader scientific community, and will significantly
contribute to understanding data science and dosimetry/cancer evolution aspects across a broad suite of
cancers and treatments."

10906731,"Gonorrhea remains a significant worldwide public health problem with over 87 million cases/year. Compounding the problem of disease incidence is the emergence of strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the community that are resistant to currently used antibiotics in dual therapy (azithromycin and ceftriaxone). We have shown that the MtrCDE efflux pump is a critical system used by gonococci to resist both beta-lactams and macrolides. Moreover, this multidrug efflux pump can recognize and export host defense compounds (e.g., bile salts, cationic antimicrobial peptides and progesterone), and loss of the pump by genetic inactivation or repression of gene expression renders gonococci less fit in a female mouse model of lower genital tract infection. Based on these observations we propose that MtrCDE is a virulence factor used by gonococci to survive the onslaught of host defense compounds and antibiotics so as to proliferate during infection. We have shown that both cis- and trans- acting transcriptional control systems can modulate the degree of mtrCDE expression. In this respect, we have identified novel single nucleotide mutations in promoter sequences that elevate mtrCDE expression. More recently, we found that single amino acid changes in the MtrD transporter can result in enhanced resistance of gonococci to antimicrobials. In the two Specific Aims of this competitive renewal application we will perform experiments that address the emergence of mutations that influence antimicrobial resistance expressed by gonococci. We will use a female mouse of infection to ascertain whether such mutations impact antibiotic efficacy during infection. Mutations that cause amino acid changes in the MtrD transporter will serve as tools to understand its structure-function through the use of cryo-electron microscopy and in vitro drug binding assays. The successful completion of the work will provide important basic knowledge on the role of the MtrCDE efflux pump in providing gonococci with resistance to antibiotics and mediators of innate host defense. With such knowledge, future translational work focused on therapeutics that target MtrCDE (and other similar pumps possessed by Gram-negative pathogens) can be rationally pursued."
10848428,"Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is a highly lethal condition with nearly 60% mortality rate, and
survivors are often left with neurologically devastating injuries which persist for a lifetime.
Furthermore, prevention of cardiac arrest is inherent to the NHLBI's mission to “promote the
prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases”.
Since pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is most commonly preceded by hypotension, its timely
reversal and/or prevention may avert impending cardiac arrest. As a rapid bedside intervention,
the clinical practice of administering bolus dilute epinephrine (BDE) for acute hypotension in the
pediatric intensive care unit has emerged despite scant published evidence to support its use.
As this practice is largely unstudied, optimal dosing of BDE in this population remains unclear.
This project aims to determine if an initial dose of 0.5 mcg/kg versus 1 mcg/kg yields differences
hemodynamic changes with the hypothesis that 1 mcg/kg will offer superior augmentation of
blood pressure. To test this hypothesis, a Phase II, single-center, prospective, randomized,
double-blind, dose-effect trial measuring systolic blood pressure before and after BDE is
proposed. Pediatric patients in the intensive care unit with acute hypotension will be randomized
to receive an initial dose of 0.5 mcg/kg versus 1 mcg/kg of BDE. Changes in systolic blood
pressure following administration of BDE in the two groups will be compared. As a secondary
outcome, the frequency of severe hypertension by age will be assessed. To inform the design of
a future phase III trial, clinical outcomes such as need for subsequent doses, rates of
subsequent cardiac arrest, adverse events and survival to discharge will also be explored. In
addition to the primary clinical trial, a sub-study to develop and evaluate novel methods for
public disclosure under the FDA-regulated Exception From Informed Consent will be performed.
The candidate will pursue formal educational courses in qualitative research, bioethics,
biostatistics and clinical trial design at the Harvard Schools of Medicine and Public Health. At
the end of this training period, the candidate will be poised to meet her career goal of becoming
an independent investigator in the field of pediatric resuscitation. She will have the data to
support a larger trial funded through the R01 mechanism to address the overarching hypothesis
that preemptive treatment of hypotension with a properly titrated dosage of epinephrine will
prevent impending cardiac arrest. Furthermore, the candidate will have the key requisite
experience in conducting future trials through Exception From Informed Consent to address
challenging questions in pediatric resuscitation science that could not otherwise be answered."
10895984,"Abstract
 A hallmark of English-learning children with developmental language disorder (DLD, AKA specific
language impairment) is the inconsistent production of grammatical morphology. However, recent work also
implicates the phonological domain, as indicated by deficits in producing word and nonword forms. The
hypothesis driving the current proposal is that morphological and phonological deficits are causally linked by a
broader deficit in sequential pattern learning. The unique approach taken here combines what we already
know about morpho-syntactic deficits in DLD with recent developments in the fields of linguistics and language
acquisition. First, it is possible to divide phonological and morphological patterns into three pattern types
(Single Feature, OR/Disjunction, Family Resemblance/Prototype), with these types having a long history of
study in visual pattern learning. Importantly, children with DLD appear to have maximum difficulty with morpho-
syntactic patterns of the OR type (e.g., regular past tense). In contrast, studies using artificial grammars show
that infants who are typically developing are highly adept at learning Single Feature and OR pattern types;
Family Resemblance patterns may be weaker. Typical adults are adept at Single Feature and Family
Resemblance patterns, but appear to be, at least superficially, more like children with DLD in their performance
on the OR pattern.
 With these intriguing findings as a starting point, the proposed research links phonological and
morphological sequence learning in children with DLD. In Aim 1, we ask if 4- to 6-year-olds (typically
developing (TD), DLD alone, DLD + speech sound disorder (SSD), and SSD with no morpho-syntactic deficit)
and adults are sensitive to input examples that fit one of these three patterns. We predict that, consistent with
their long-documented morpho-syntactic deficit, children with DLD will have particular difficulty with the
phonological OR pattern. Consistent with their intact morpho-syntactic skills, children with SSD should show no
deficits in the OR pattern, revealing a link between OR pattern learning, phonology, and morpho-syntax. Aim 2
explores whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue facilitates learning the OR pattern. Aim 3 asks if
dependence on the associatively organized lexicon can account for the infant-to-adult developmental changes
observed for the OR pattern (which is not associatively organized) and thereby explores the possibility that
children with DLD rely on their lexicons to compensate for their sequential pattern learning deficit. The results
of the proposed studies promise to help identify the underlying mechanism(s) of DLD and to suggest possible
intervention strategies, such as employing semantic cues to the OR pattern and strengthening lexical
organization."

The VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) provides access to genotyping and longitudinal clinical data for
more than 616,000 Veterans, thereby offering an unparalleled opportunity to define the genetic basis of
complex diseases. In this project, we will examine age-related eye conditions that are of high relevance
to the Veterans Health Administration (primary open angle glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, Fuchs
endothelial corneal dystrophy, cataract, myopia, aqueous tear deficiency) that are prevalent in the
Veteran population with distinct adverse effects on vision and demands on system resources. In Aim 1,
we will perform single variant analysis for each ocular phenotype, towards identification of common and
rare variants. This genetic analysis will be conducted following development of a robust algorithm to
identify Cases with a condition and Controls without that condition. This algorithm will be based on
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Separate genome wide association studies (GWAS)
will be conducted on MVP enrollees of European-American (EA), African-American (AA) or Hispanic-
American (HA) descent, with descent confirmed by Principal Component Analysis. For many of these
conditions, this will be the first GWAS ever conducted or will be the first trans-ethnic GWAS. This work
will follow-on our successful analysis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where we noted
marked differences in the genetic basis of EA as compared to AA and HA Veterans. In Aim 2, we will use
PheWAS analysis to understand the interrelationships between different ocular diseases, between
ocular diseases and other conditions and between ocular diseases and quantitative physiological traits.
The MVP biobank provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the genetic basis for eye diseases
that impact Veteran populations and to determine how eye diseases and other medical conditions are
related via shared gene variants or genetic profiles. Through the identification of new relationships
between ocular traits and other diseases or physiologic measures, this project will address an important
gap in the ocular genetics field."
10795634,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare and devastating disease with no cure affecting 1 in 4700 male
births. DMD results in loss of ambulation, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy (CM), and premature death. CM
is the leading cause of death in DMD, but CM progression is variable. Currently, there are no genetic, blood, or
imaging biomarkers that can predict high- or low-risk cardiovascular phenotype. More importantly, there are no
established cardiac outcome measures. Novel, targeted therapeutics are necessary to treat DMD CM, but this
knowledge gap makes clinical trials challenging. A better understanding of CM disease progression is critical to
improve clinical trial efficiency. To address these obstacles, we propose a rigorous, prospective, serial
evaluation in the largest cohort of DMD patients with complete cardiovascular phenotyping. This study will
assess serum and imaging markers of fibrosis as surrogate biomarkers of disease progression and ultimately
mortality. It will leverage the DMD Cardiac Consortium (created as part of the PIs R56), which has
standardized cardiac MRI and skeletal muscle protocols for the assessment of DMD progression. We will
combine this prospective evaluation with a comprehensive assessment of genetic polymorphisms performed
using DNA collected from the largest DMD registry. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that imaging and
blood biomarkers detect subclinical myocardial fibrosis with potential for use as surrogate biomarkers of CM in
DMD. We further hypothesize genotyping in a large sample size of DMD patients can determine the impact of
genetic polymorphisms on DMD CM progression. Aim 1 will collect DNA using the largest DMD registry to
discover genetic variants that determine DMD CM severity. Aim 2 will identify serum biomarkers that
characterize DMD CM disease severity. Aim 3 will define the longitudinal progression of DMD CM in the
current era and determine serum and imaging measures of myocardial fibrosis that herald a subsequent
change in cardiac function. The proposed studies will include four of the larger cardiac muscular dystrophy
centers in the country and will create the largest cohort of DMD patients with rigorous cardiovascular
phenotyping. The consortium has been constructed to allow additional sites to join in order to foster the larger
collaborative efforts necessary to achieve meaningful results in this rare disease. This project directly
addresses the goals of the funding mechanism to characterize the natural history of rare diseases, identify
genotype and phenotype subpopulations, and develop clinical outcome measures. These results will have
clinical relevance for other similar diseases, including Becker muscular dystrophy and female mutation carriers.
The innovation of this grant is the integration of genetic polymorphisms with imaging and blood biomarkers to
identify surrogate biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. The ability to readily test novel and targeted therapies
is crucial for lengthening and improving the quality of life in boys and men with DMD."

We propose a large multi-center non-inferiority follow-up cohort study designed to evaluate long-term
obesity/growth and neurodevelopment after perinatal exposure to adjunctive azithromycin as compared with
placebo (plus standard cephalosporin) to prevent surgical site infections at cesarean delivery. The parent
C/SOAP randomized trial of adjunctive azithromycin (4/2011–11/2014) demonstrated a significant reduction in
maternal infections (endometritis and wound infection) without any significant effect on short-term neonatal
outcomes in the azithromycin group. This reduction in maternal infection (a major cause of death) was so
significant that azithromycin use was found to be cost-saving – saving ~$360/unscheduled cesarean and $270
million/year in US healthcare costs. However, enthusiasm for adjunctive azithromycin has been tempered
given reports of changes induced by azithromycin on the newborn gut microbiome that may be associated with
childhood weight gain/obesity and neurodevelopmental impairment. In September 2018, ACOG suggested
“consideration” of adjunctive azithromycin, but emphasized the need for studies of its effect on long-term
childhood outcomes. In response to these concerns, we proposed an R01 study evaluating pulmonary and
gastrointestinal (GI) health after perinatal azithromycin exposure (6th percentile score). Reviewers emphasized
the need to evaluate obesity/growth and neurodevelopment (NIH officers advised a separate application due to
cap limitations). Thus, in this proposal, we hypothesize that perinatal exposure to adjunctive azithromycin
compared to standard cesarean prophylaxis alone is not associated with increased risk of obesity/weight gain
or neurodevelopmental impairment (i.e. is non-inferior). We propose a follow-up study of the offspring of the
C/SOAP trial cohort at target age of 7 years (range 6-9) at the 14 sites in the parent trial. We expect at least
1410 of 2013 children (70% follow-up) whose mothers were enrolled in C/SOAP will undergo a single study
visit incorporating growth/biometry and neurodevelopment assessments to address the following specific aims:
 1) To compare the incidence of obese/overweight children (primary outcome), and other biophysical
 measurements, between cohort offspring aged 7 (range 6-9 years) after perinatal exposure to
 adjunctive azithromycin versus placebo (standard prophylaxis alone)
 2) To compare neurodevelopmental outcomes including cognitive ability (primary outcome), functional and
 behavioral impairment, and motor proficiency, between cohorts at age 7 (range 6-9 years) after
 perinatal exposure to adjunctive azithromycin versus placebo
This study, along with the companion study evaluating pulmonary and GI outcomes (award notice pending), is
the only opportunity to efficiently provide comprehensive long-term safety data from a large US trial to inform
and strengthen the newly recommended use of adjunctive azithromycin for cesarean delivery."

 HCC is the 3rd most deadly malignancy in the world due to limited success in early and effective
therapeutic interventions. Behavior of HCC cells is predicated by tumor microenvironment (TME) which
comprises non-cellular and cellular components. One of tumor-associated cell types implicated in
promoting HCC is the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) which produces ECM components, matricellular
proteins and soluble factors to support HCC growth. Our research into the molecular mechanisms of
HSC activation, revealed a novel positive loop of canonical Wnt pathway mediated by stearoyl Co-A
desaturase (SCD). This loop involves sequential steps of β-catenin (CTNNB1) amplifying SREBP1c-
mediated transcription of Scd2; SCD2 raising cytosolic monounsaturated fatty acids which impair nuclear
transport of the mRNA binding protein HuR; and increased cytosolic HuR stabilizing Lrp5/6 mRNA and
upregulating their proteins, the functional Wnt co-receptors. Disruption of this loop by conditional Scd2
knockout in activated HSCs (aHSCs) in Scd2f/f;Col1a1Cre mice, attenuates cholestatic and hepatotoxic
liver fibrosis, and remarkably live tumor development. This tumor suppression is accompanied by global
repression of CTNNB1 and YAP1 in TME, suggesting SCD-dependent release of factor(s) by aHSCs to
achieve tumor promotion via global CTNNB and YAP1 upregulation. In search of such factors by
combinatorial transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, we identified 12-HHTrE (12-
hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid), the highest affinity lipid ligand for leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (LTB4R2)
as a putative driver for the novel 12-HHTrE-LTB4R2 tumor promotion pathway. 12-HHTrE is a major
eicosanoid metabolite released by murine primary aHSCs and human aHSC line LX2 cells. It is enriched
in wild type but not in Scd2ff/Col1a1Cre mouse liver TME. It induces via LTB4R2: 1) p-ERK1/2,
p(S9)GSK3β, and nuclear CTNNB1; 2) CTNNB1-induced YAP1 transcription via a TCF site in its first
intronic enhancer; and 3) nuclear YAP1 and YAP1-target genes in liver cancer cells. Single cell RNA
sequencing of mouse TME identifies a unique aHSC subpopulation which co-expresses both HSC
marker Lrat and fibroblast marker Fbln2, and selectively expresses Cyp1b1 but not other 12-HHTrE
biosynthetic genes. SCD or CTNNB1 knockdown (KD) reduces CYP1B1 expression and 12-HHTrE
release by aHSCs in culture. Finally, AAV8-mediated LTB4R2 KD in wild type mice, reproduces tumor
suppression observed in Scd2f/f;Col1a1Cre mice.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the most critical upstream event in the newly disclosed
LTB4R2 tumor promotion pathway, is increased12-HHTrE generation by CYP1B1 upregulated in tumor-
associated Lrat+Fbln2+ aHSCs and that this subpopulation is a plausible target for anti-HCC therapy.
To test this central hypothesis, we aim to determine: 1) if an emergence of Lrat+Fbln2+Cyp1b1+ aHSC
subpopulation is prevented by conditional Scd2 ablation in mice; 2) if SCD-CTNNB1 orchestrates in
aHSCs, CYP1B1 transcriptional activation and 12-HHTrE production via CTNNB1-AhR (aryl
hydrocarbon receptor) interaction and PGST2 (COX2) generation of PGH2 which serve as a lipid AhR
ligand to support CYP1B1 transcription and the substrate for CYP1B1 synthesis of 12-HHTrE; 3) if 12-
HHTrE generation is selectively inhibited in Lrat+Fbln2+ aHSC subpopulation to have therapeutic effects
on the development of hepatoma and progression to HCC in mice; and 4) if Lrat+Fbln2+ aHSC-targeted
CYP1B1 KD in HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model achieves therapeutic efficacy.
 A long-range goal of our research is to extend results from these specific aims to innovative designing
and development of novel aHSC-directed therapeutic modalities for HCC which inflicts many veterans."
10889024,"Abstract
Current influenza (flu) vaccines are effective only for closely matched flu viral strains and must be updated
annually to address constant antigenic shift/drifts of surface hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) of
the virus. Even with annual update, there have been years in which flu vaccines were ineffective due to
significant differences in antigenicity of HA and/or NA between the strains used for preparing the vaccines and
the circulating ones, leaving us at high risk of pandemics in case a new and highly pathological virus emerges.
It is without any doubt that a “Universal” flu vaccine that can protect against both seasonal (matched or
mismatched) and pandemic flu viruses is urgently needed, but it remains “an alchemist’s dream” so far. We
developed a novel adjuvant by encapsulation of cGAMP, an agonist of the stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene
(STING), into pulmonary surfactant (PS)-biomimetic liposomes (PS-GMNP). The adjuvant, alongside an
inactivated flu vaccine, robustly stimulated humoral and CD8+ T cell immune responses that resemble those
ocurring during the early phase of viral infection both in magnitude and in dynamics. Strikingly, a single dose of
PS-GMNP-adjuvant flu vaccine elicited strong cross-protection against a lethal challenge of diverse
heterosubtypic flu A viruses as early as 2 days after immunization. While stimulating robust heterosubtypic
immunity, the adjuvant did not cause any adverse events in lung histology, body weight or temperature, in
sharp contrast to the severe lung inflammation and death caused by flu viral infection. In this proposal, we will
investigate the cellular and humoral immune responses essential to the cross-protection induced by PS-
GMNP-adjuvanted flu vaccines. Specifically, we will determine whether PS-GMNP can expand cross-reactive
CD8+ T cells and induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), pivotal to PS-GMNP-induced cross-
protection. In Aim 2, we will preclude any adverse effects of pre-existing immunity on the adjuvanticity of PS-
GMNP and extend the cross-protection to pre-pandemic wild type H5N1 and H7N9 viruses to establish its
clinical potentials. Distinguished from conventional adjuvants that activate primarily antigen-presenting cells
(APCs), cGAMP delivered by PS-GMNP activated both alveolar macrophages (aMɸ) and alveolar epithelial
cells (AEC), which can be crucial since similar activation of these two types of cells is also observed during flu
viral infection. Two alternative approaches will be employed in Aim 3 to corroborate indispensable function of
AEC and/or aMɸ in PS-GMNP-mediated heterosubtypic immunity, including a blockade of cell-gap junctions
and generation of chimeric mice of wild type and STING-deficient bone marrow (BM) cells. The study, if
successful, could provide invaluable information about clinical potentials for PS-GMNP to widen the breadth of
existing flu vaccines toward a “Universe” one, which will have a huge and immediate impact on global health."

Astrocyte morphological maturation is a critical step for healthy central nervous system development. Immature
astrocytes elaborate their processes and infiltrate the neuropil with fine, terminal, leaflet processes. These
processes allow for cell-cell communication with neighboring astrocytes, ensheathment of the vasculature and
enwrapping synapses, and where astrocytes participate in neurotransmitter uptake, synapse development and
stabilization. Astrocyte morphogenesis coincides with neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis, implicating a
common mechanism between these two events. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one developmental
molecule crucial for development and activity-dependent plasticity in neurons. Our lab has shown that BDNF
interacts with astrocytes through a TrkB receptor isoform (TrkB.T1) to promote astrocyte morphological
maturation. Our published work demonstrates astrocyte deletion of TrkB.T1 results in a 25% reduction in
astrocyte volume and branching complexity, a change that persists through adulthood. Our discovery is
relevant to health, as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with BDNF dysregulation,
including the X-linked NDD, Rett Syndrome (RTT). Preliminary evidence demonstrates that astrocytes in RTT
mouse models have volume deficits similar to TrKB.T1 knockout accompanied by dysregulated gene expression.
Reports demonstrate that the TrkB.T1 isoform uniquely interacts with a small RhoGTPase inhibitor, though its
functional significance is relatively unknown. We propose to evaluate astrocyte RhoGTPase signaling and
cytoskeletal dynamics in response to BDNF and potentially therapeutic TrkB activators utilizing in vitro
and in situ genetic, molecular, and imaging techniques. Furthermore, we will assess if TrkB therapeutics
rescue RTT astrocyte morphology deficits and gene dysregulation. My specific aims seek to (1) determine
signaling consequences of TrkB.T1 activation and (2) the role of TrkB.T1 activation on morphological change in
astrocytes as well as to expand upon our discovery by (3) evaluating astrocyte TrkB.T1 in a relevant NDD model.
This proposal meets the priorities of the BRAIN Initiate 2.0 of (1) demonstrating causality of relationships and (2)
identifying fundamental principles of observable brain properties."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after
Alzheimer’s disease with prevalence estimated at 0.3% in the general population and at 1% in
individuals over age 60 (Getz & Levin, 2017). In addition to the cardinal motor features
associated with this illness, individuals with PD also experience cognitive decline. While
estimates vary (Goldman et al, 2013), it is estimated that up to 40% of PD patients would meet
criteria for a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and that up to 80% will develop dementia
over the course of the disease (Kenney et al, 2022). Given limitations in current treatments for
PD and the lack of a complete cure, there is an outcry for additional research into effective
interventions, particularly those that might slow cognitive decline as well as conversion to
dementia (Cammisuli et al, 2019). At present, while dopaminergic medications and surgical
interventions (DBS) often ameliorate some motoric symptoms (at least temporarily), there is
minimal documented neuropsychological benefit. As result, there has been a call for lifestyle
interventions for older adults to prevent, delay or ameliorate cognitive decline via
non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise (Camisul et al, 2019). Our initial
randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated exergaming for older adults (Anderson-Hanley et
al., 2012a), and revealed significant cognitive benefit after three months of pedaling a virtual
reality enhanced bike or “cybercycle,” compared with traditional pedaling only. Results suggest
that for the same effort, interactive physical and mental exercise on a cybercycle can yield
greater cognitive benefit than physical exercise alone on a stationary bike. Furthermore, there
was a 23% reduction in risk of conversion to MCI among the cybercyclists. The PI and
collaborators have worked to replicate and extend this line of research with patients with varied
neurological conditions which sparked development of a portable, affordable tablet-based
prototype: the interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System (iPACES) which can be
paired with an under-table elliptical pedaler for in-home use. Data from in-home pilot trials (v1 &
v2), found executive function significantly improved after 3-months of pedaling-to-play in the
iPACES neuro-exergame, and more so than game-only (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2018b; Wall et
al., 2018). The proposed research aims to replicate and extend these findings in Parkinson’s. If
warranted by the data, we will pursue the goal of offering to patients, families, and healthcare
providers an additional tool for PD patients and caregivers to preserve brain health and curb
cognitive decline, all in the fight against dementia."
10889987,"The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the
past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied
heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in
humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present
application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi-
naturalistic, and dynamic.
 The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing
during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach-
avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific
hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive
processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed
circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.
 The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits
supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an
important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance
conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also
revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior
hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape
mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions
during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where
the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.
 Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at
understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic
processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has
been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms."

Influenza virus is a persistent global menace that every year infects an estimated 5-10% of adults and 20-30%
of children worldwide causing over 500,000 influenza-related deaths. Most annual influenza infections are in
the very young, the elderly, and in individuals with chronic health conditions such as asthma. However,
recurrent influenza pandemics caused by the emergence and spread of highly pathogenic novel influenza A
strains, such as occurred in 2009, disproportionately causes severe illness in healthy children and younger
adults. This study of life-threatening influenza virus lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in young hosts is
designed by an established multidisciplinary group of investigators to better understand how host innate and
adaptive immunity to influenza virus is associated with disease susceptibility, severity and clinical outcomes.
In the Pediatric Intensive Care Influenza (PICFLU1) study, we hypothesized that infection with the influenza
virus triggers hypercytokinemia and immune dysregulation in a genetically susceptible host resulting in severe
life-threatening infection. Confirming our hypothesis, in PICFLU1 (AI084011, enrolling 2008-2016), we
identified a hyperinflammatory phenotype coexisting with innate immunosuppression; both were associated
with mortality. We also identified associations between functional variants in IFITM3 and MBL2 with pediatric
influenza-related death. In the Immunobiology of Influenza Virus-Related Critical Illness in Young Hosts study
(PICFLU2, enrolling 2020-2025), we test the hypothesis that distinct severe influenza LRTI phenotypes –
defined by host immunobiology – can be identified for targeted preventive and therapeutic
interventions. In this study we aim to: 1. Identify biomarkers in children with severe influenza LRTI that can be
used for prognostic stratification and predictive enrichment in future immunomodulatory clinical trials; 2.
Determine if pre-existing strain specific immunity to influenza virus protects against life-threatening disease
and influences viral shedding and disease severity; and 3. Identify genes essential for anti-viral immunity
and/or containment that explain host susceptibility to severe influenza infection or its outcome. To achieve
these aims, we will enroll 600 additional children and young adults with confirmed influenza infection (300
intensive care unit and 300 ward or outpatient) across 35 PICFLU sites. Across PICFLU studies (2008-2025)
we will have DNA on ~1,000 young hosts infected with influenza virus to identify important endophenotypes for
risk stratification and predictive enrichment in future clinical trials targeting prevention of and more rapid
recovery from severe influenza-related disease. Identified influenza virus susceptibility and severity genes are
potential “druggable targets” for immune modulation. Our findings could personalize the care of young
individuals with severe influenza infection based on distinct immunobiologic host phenotypes based on patient
age, influenza strain, clinical presentation, innate and adaptive immune biomarkers and host genetics."

ABSTRACT
Viral, host and environmental mechanisms governing HIV reservoir dynamics on and off antiretroviral therapy
(ART) must be grasped more deeply if cure efforts are to be successful. Further, variability in the size, distribution
and activity of the reservoir is substantial, and although a ‘one size fit all’ HIV cure strategy is seducing, a
reductionist ‘bulk’ approach cannot fully capture the complex underlying processes of HIV reservoir dynamics.
To better define the viral, host and environmental factors that govern these dynamics at the cellular and single-
genome level, our novel Leaving, Coming and Staying HIV Obligate MicroEnvironments (HOME) program
builds on our previous infrastructure, and success, including our ‘Last Gift’ cohort, which enrolls altruistic people
with HIV (PWH) who did or did not stop ART before death, collects pre-mortem clinical data and limited samples,
then performs a full body rapid autopsy with sample collection across the body within 6 hours of death. The
rationale for our program is that the use of new single-cell and single-genome technologies will bring new
perspectives on assumptions built on bulk technologies and help identify vulnerabilities in HIV reservoir states:
• Leaves HOME when HIV (re)activates from tissues during ART (i.e., ‘ready to move once ART is interrupted’,
 like packing its bag and getting ready to leave) and causes rebound viremia during ART interruption.
• Comes HOME when HIV (re)populates tissues during viremia off ART and through the spread of clonally
 expanded HIV-infected cells while on ART. (Clonal expansion is like adding family to the home.)
• Stays HOME when HIV persists in tissue reservoirs during ART and viral suppression in plasma.
The HOME program is organized into three Research Projects (RP) to investigate these reservoir dynamics:
• The Viral, EpigeNetics and Integration (VENI) RP will investigate viral and proviral epigenetic factors.
• The Viral, Immunology, Drugs, and Imaging (VIDI) RP will investigate host and environmental factors.
• The Viral, Immune, and Cellular data Integration (VICI) RP will develop new methods needed for the
 integration and analysis of complex multi-dimensional data.
These three RPs will be supported by two cores: the Administrative and Data (AD) Core will provide leadership,

Our proposed HOME program is a good use of resources because it innovatively responds directly to the
Understanding HIV Reservoir Dynamics RFA (AI-21-013) and will create the next level of understanding of deep
HIV reservoirs. We expect to clearly define the viral, immunological, cellular expression, epigenetic, tissue
architectural factors associated with specified HIV reservoir states across the human body on and off ART. Such
results would be foundational for HIV cure strategies aimed at locking down or clearing HIV reservoirs."
10720882,"70 million Americans suffer from some sort of sleep disorder. Behavior, mood and
memory deteriorate with sleep loss and it gets worse with continuing sleep deprivation. Lack of
sleep has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. There is considerable amount of data on the
neurons that wake us up (wake-active neurons) and neurons that initiate NREM (NREM-max)
and REM sleep (REM-max). However, there are also glia in the brain and they outnumber
neurons. A single astrocyte contacts hundreds of dendrites, and tens of thousands of synapses
(Bushong et al., 2002, Halassa et al., 2007). As such, astrocytes can actively control neuronal
activity and synaptic transmission. Converging evidence shows that astrocyte activity may
regulate the waxing and waning of sleep. Sleep is increased by activating astrocytes (our data,
Pelluru et al., 2016), and recent evidence shows that cortical astrocytes are active in waking
relative to NREM and REM sleep. Are glia also active during waking in other brain regions? Or,
do glia have a varied pattern of activity similar to neurons? Are there REM-max glia? It is
important to answer these questions considering that glia are now believed to clear the brain of
waste. We will use microendoscopy to image the activity of glia and local neurons in the zona
incerta, a region where 70% of the GABA neurons are most active in NREM and REM sleep.
Four specific aims will test the overall hypothesis that there is a dynamic activation of glia
during waking, NREM and REM sleep. Glia in the zona incerta will be imaged during sleep, and
in response to 6h sleep loss to test the hypothesis that fluorescence in glia increases after sleep
loss. In aim 3, the activity of local glia will be manipulated with pharmacogenetics to test the
hypothesis that activating glia also activates local excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter
type 2; vGLUT2) and inhibitory (Lhx6-cre, a transcription factor that colocalizes in GABA
neurons) neurons. In aim 4, the activity of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the zona
incerta will be manipulated (optogenetics and DREDD) and fluorescence in glia will be imaged
to test the hypothesis that activity of neurons changes activity of the local glia.
 The proposed aims utilize cutting-edge methodologies to test specific hypotheses in male
and female mice. It is feasible to achieve the aims during the funding period because we have
established expertise in collecting and analyzing microendoscopy data. The overall impact of
this project is that it mechanistically identifies activity in local circuits that precedes the
emergence of sleep. Inclusion of astrocytes in circuit models will lead to a better understanding
of sleep homeostasis and unihemispheric sleep, which is something that current “neuron-
centric” models have failed to do."

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are increasingly more prevalent on brain MRIs, are significantly
associated with vascular risk factors and linked to age-related mobility and cognitive impairment. However, not
everyone with WMH is equally afflicted and some older individuals are able to maintain their mobility and
cognition despite a significant burden of WMH on their brain MRI. We do not know what specific attributes of
these individuals contribute to their resilience. Identifying which specific factors are associated with cognitive
vulnerability and/or resilience in the presence of WMH is critical for favorably impacting the trajectory of brain
health in our aging population, especially among health disparity populations. Over the past 5 years we have
been able to identify neuroimaging features associated with vascular risk factors, gait and cognition in midlife.
Building on these findings, we now propose to continue our line of inquiry and identify the neuroimaging
features associated with gait and cognitive performance in mid- to late-life individuals with WMH, with a
specific focus on African Americans and women, both of whom are at a high risk for developing WMH, gait and
cognitive impairment, but have often been under-represented in such studies. In Aim1, we will characterize the
diffusion properties of the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and resting brain functional network
connections in mid- to late-life individuals who have WMH. These are the neuroimaging features that we have
already identified in our midlife cohort study. In Aim 2 we will determine how changes in diffusion properties of
NAWM and resting brain function network connections change in relation to gait and cognition in mid- to late
life individuals with WMH. Aim3 is an exploratory aim to identify other attributes associated with maintaining
gait and cognitive performance in mid- to late-life individuals who display WMH on brain MRI. Findings from
the proposed work, will serve two overarching objectives. First, identified neuroimaging features that associate
with gait and cognitive performance in individuals with WMH will help guide treatment decisions and allocation
of appropriate individuals with WMH for future clinical trials. Second, identified neuroimaging features that
associated with gait and cognitive vulnerability &/ or resilience in the presence of WMH will reveal underlying
mechanisms and facilitate the future possibility of therapeutic development targeted at mitigating progression
to impaired mobility and dementia and expression of Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) in at-
risk individuals."
10687048,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) can provide substantial motor benefit yet
occasional mood and cognitive side effects in Parkinson disease (PD). Current literature hypothesizes that
downstream network level effects are a critical mechanism of STN DBS’s influence on motor and non-motor
behavior, however our ability to test this hypothesis has been limited. Common imaging modalities either do
not have the temporal resolution necessary to discern resting state functional connectivity of cortical networks
or are not suitable or safe for patients with implanted DBS. We have developed a novel high-density diffuse
optical tomography (HD-DOT) system for measuring brain hemodynamics which can accurately map the
functional connectivity of cortical resting state networks (RSN) or task-evoked responses within the first ~1cm
of cortex. HD-DOT has comparable temporal and spatial resolution to fMRI, greater comfort than MRI or PET,
no radiation exposure, no electrical artifacts, no metal artifacts and no contraindications or safety concerns for
DBS patients. We have strong preliminary data showing the validity and feasibility of assessing cortical RSNs
and task-induced responses in STN DBS patients. With our novel HD-DOT system, careful experimental
design and rigorous analyses, this study will determine the nature of cortical RSN-level modulation induced by
STN DBS and its relationship to DBS-induced motor and cognitive change. Controls and individuals with PD
will be enrolled pre-surgically and scanned with HD-DOT and MRI (resting state BOLD, structural]). After
implantation and optimization of DBS, PD individuals will be scanned with HD-DOT in several conditions. With
these data, we will test hypotheses about networks that are responsive to important characteristics of STN
DBS (e.g.location) and their relationship to motor and non-motor function. This information ultimately could
provide methods for faster optimization of DBS parameters and help identify cortical nodes or networks
involved in STN DBS-induced benefits or side effects that would provide future targets for less invasive
neuromodulation. Finally, this work could reveal fundamental properties of cortical network physiology such as
the capacity for plasticity in response to up-stream perturbations."
10682442,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Through our NIA MSTEM Project (Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate
Education at the University of the District of Columbia) we seek to create and foster aging-related research
and curricular experiences for underrepresented minority (URM) students at the University of the District of
Columbia (UDC), a historically black college and university (HBCU). Of significant societal relevance, is our
long-term goal to increase the number of URM professionals aimed at solving problems tied to aging via
research investigations (studies) and interventions (designs and devices). It is projected that the number of
individuals older than 50 years of age will increase to 1.2 billion by 2025 worldwide, however, aging-related
research training is nascent at the undergraduate levels & diversity is limited.
 The objectives of this project are to create and foster aging-related: 1) research experiences (tied to falls,
imaging, and data analytics); 2) new and unique curricular experiences tied to freshman and senior design
projects, practicum & seminars, and professional student club activities; and 3) professional development via
mentorship, dissemination and outreach for the URM undergraduate student demographic at UDC. Our
central hypothesis is that through the above objectives we will produce a diverse cadre of professionals that
are well-equipped to solve issues tied to aging. This project is distinct, yet dovetails nicely with, previous and
current sponsored research activities at UDC focused on undergraduate aging-related (balance) research
and Biomedical Engineering (BME) education.
 The project’s contribution is significant in that it will lead to new scientific findings on aging-related
research tied to balance & falls, imaging, and analytics, as well as increase the number of trained URM
undergraduate students captivated by aging-related research. Research experiences, typically only available
to students at the graduate level, will be provided to URM undergraduates at UDC. The proposed project is
innovative in that it will capitalize on the fact that UDC is only 1 of 3 HBCUs nationwide with a BS in BME
degree program and, more importantly, UDC is the only HBCU which currently fosters BME-focused aging
research. Further, the project will provide URM undergraduates an unparalleled ecosystem in aging-related
research, curricula, and professional development which interweaves a unique, meaningful network of the:
UDC BME-focused personnel, the Department on Aging and Community Living (DACL) which has
community sites across all 8 wards of Washington, DC, and the UDC Institute of Gerontology (IOG). Further,
this project may have an impact on and serve as a model for minority-serving institutes (MSIs) and non-MSIs
nationwide seeking to create their undergraduate aging-related research and education infrastructure."

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a twisting condition of the spine and is the most common pediatric
musculoskeletal disorder, affecting 3% of children worldwide. Children with AIS risk severe disfigurement, back
pain, and physiologic dysfunction later in life. Girls requiring treatment for AIS outnumber boys by more than
five-fold, for reasons that are unknown. Hospital charges for AIS surpass one billion dollars annually in the U.S.
and are rising significantly faster than for other pediatric procedures. AIS is treated symptomatically rather than
preventively because the underlying etiology has been poorly understood. Genetic contributions to AIS are
significant, but few human susceptibility loci were identified prior to the beginning of this Program. The
mechanisms driven by these loci were likewise largely unknown, as they mapped within non-coding genomic
regions that were not easily interpreted. The AIS field also lacked appropriate animal models that enable
mechanistic and therapeutic studies. To address these issues, we established an innovative collaborative
approach combining three Projects to lead unbiased gene discovery in humans, modeling and gene discovery
in zebrafish, and genomic analysis of postnatal spine development. Our program addressed six gaps in
knowledge: (i) identity of the tissue and cellular origins of AIS; (ii) defining the true beginning of AIS disease
pathogenesis; (iii) defining the genetic factors and genetic interactions underlying AIS; (iv) developing robust
vertebrate systems to functionally validate, interpret, and model human genetic findings; (v) defining the
molecular mechanisms controlling spinal development post-somitogenesis, and the correlation with AIS; (vi)
defining the basis of sexual dimorphism in AIS. In the prior award cycle our Program significantly advanced
each of these initiatives. Integrating data in humans and animal models, our data underscored cartilage as a
functional tissue in AIS and specifically highlighted the extracellular matrix compartment, new paradigms in the
field. Our Program discovered several new AIS genetic susceptibility loci in human and developed 73 new zebrafish
models of spine deformity. Data from each Project also converged on the hypomorphic nature of AIS disease alleles,
supporting multigenic inheritance. We defined the non-coding regulatory landscape of human and mouse AIS-related
tissues, and discovered that knockout of one such regulator linked to female AIS in humans produces a female-biased
phenotype in mouse. Here we propose a comprehensive plan to drive these discoveries forward to define AIS disease
mechanisms using genetically targeted mouse and zebrafish models, to define cell-specific transcriptional, epigenetic, and
signaling mechanisms underlying AIS, to continue identifying vertebrate models of spine deformity by forward genetic
screens in mouse and zebrafish, and to discover new high-risk alleles contributing to AIS in patients refractory to treatment.
We will also expand our investigations to address why AIS has a female bias, and to testing rationally selected drug
therapies in vertebrate models. These studies will advance fundamental understanding of AIS, inform diagnosis and
highlight potential therapeutic targets."

ADRD living alone often have limited access to LTSS, which increases their distress. This also increases costs
for unnecessary hospitalizations and institutionalizations. Therefore, the large population of older adults with
ADRD living alone likely has large-scale underserved needs that constitute an urgent public health problem,

especially with respect to racial/ethnic minorities who have increased risk of ADRD vs. Whites, often live alone
and often have worse access to services. This project's objective is thus to elucidate specific barriers and
facilitators to access to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD living alone vs those with ADRD living
with others, and to compare how these barriers and facilitators may differ among racial/ethnic groups. We will
then apply this knowledge to develop policy recommendations to increase access to and use of LTSS,

among older adults with ADRDs and the extent to which these predictors of LTSS use vary by living
arrangement (living alone vs. living with others) and race/ethnicity. 2) To elucidate in depth the barriers and
facilitators to accessing and using LTSS via semi-structured interviews with older adults with ADRD,
informants, and LTSS providers and administrators. 3) To develop policy recommendations to increase access
to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD, emphasizing racial/ethnic minorities and older adults living

10846779,"Summary - Overall
 To understand HIV-1 reservoir dynamics, we must understand how the reservoir is formed. The overall
goal of this research program is to study dynamics of the latent reservoir through single cell analysis of the viral
decay processes that determine the composition of the reservoir. Seminal studies by co-investigator Alan
Perelson showed that following initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), plasma virus levels decay
rapidly in a striking biphasic fashion. These studies established that in untreated people living with HIV-1
(PLWH), most of the virus in the blood is produced by infected cells that die or transition to a non-productive
state of infection very rapidly. The half-lives of the two phases of decay are 0.7 days and 14 days. It is important
to note that these decay processes occur continuously throughout untreated infection and are simply revealed
when new infection events are blocked by ART. Thus, they are an essential feature of HIV-1 biology.
Surprisingly, the identity and fate of the cells that decay with these kinetics have never been clearly defined.
Coincident with the initial studies of HIV-1 dynamics by Perelson and colleagues, studies from the Siliciano lab
established that HIV-1 could persist in a latent form in resting CD4+ T cells, and it rapidly became clear that the
half-live of this latent reservoir was extremely long (3.7 yrs), long enough to preclude cure even with optimal
ART. Using an SIV/macaque model, Dr. Dan Barouch showed that this reservoir is established very early in
infection. A fundamental hypothesis of this research program is that the latent reservoir is composed of cells
that survive the rapid decay processes that eliminate the vast majority of infected cells. We believe that insights
into reservoir dynamics can be obtained through analysis of these decay processes. We will analyze these
decay processes in coordinated studies in PLWH (Dr. Robert and Janet Siliciano, Project 1) and in SIV-infected
macaques (Dr. Barouch, Project 2) with the help of Dr. Perelson and the Modeling Core."
10678903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 100,000 newborns receive mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube
(ETT) each year in the United States. Intubating newborns is challenging due to their
size and delicate nature, and unfortunately, nearly 40% of the initial intubation attempts
are incorrect, and the tube is inadvertently placed in the esophagus instead of the
trachea, or too deep in the main stem bronchus, leading to ventilation of only one lung,
or with the tip of the tube too high in the trachea. It is critical to detect malpositioning of
the tube promptly. The goal of this research is to develop Simultaneous Multi-Source
Electrical Impedance Tomography (SMS-EIT) technology for the bedside to correctly
and instantly identify ETT position or malposition. In this application we will combine (1)
deep learning EIT-based confirmation of ETT placement with (2) EIT images of lungs
being ventilated. Together, this would provide clinicians and bedside staff with a real-
time, closed-loop system for determining if (1) the ETT was inserted in the correct
lumen (trachea, not esophagus) and (2) if the lungs are being ventilated appropriately to
detect left or right mainstem bronchial malplacement. The same system with no change
in electrode placement could be used to monitor for inadvertent extubation and for the
onset of emergency conditions such as pneumothorax.
EIT is a noninvasive, non-ionizing functional imaging technique in which images are
formed from voltages measured on electrodes on the body arising from imperceptible
applied currents. Since EIT is a safe and portable technology with no damaging side
effects, it can be used both for continuous monitoring and as needed. Our
interdisciplinary team from GE Research, Colorado State University, and Stanford
University will develop and validate the specialized SMS-EIT system through three
specific aims. The first aim is to develop and implement an electrode configuration,
reconstruction algorithms, and hardware modifications of the GE SMS-EIT system for
the special needs of neonates and this project. In the second aim, training data and a
deep learning classification algorithm to classify intubation as correct, esophageal, too
high, or mainstem bronchial misplacement will be developed. The efficacy and clinical
feasibility of the SMS-EIT system and algorithms for the real-time detection and
classification of ETT malplacement will be evaluated in a study of 30 infants in the Level
IV NICU at Stanford University Medical Center."
10696142,"PA-19-077 DOOLAN: PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria remains a global public health problem with nearly half of the world's population at risk. An effective
malaria vaccine would prevent almost half a million deaths and over 200 million clinical cases each year and
help eradicate the disease. The most effective experimental malaria vaccination regimens to date are radiation-
attenuated sporozoites (RAS; PfSPZ) and infectious sporozoites administered under chemoprophylaxis (CPS).
Protective immunity is believed to be mediated by CD8+ T cells which attack the parasite during the pre-
erythrocytic (PE) liver-stage of infection. However, the key antigens underlying this protection are largely
unknown. We have developed and applied a proteome-wide T cell screening approach to identify the subset of
key antigens targeted by T cell responses from the complete Plasmodium falciparum parasite proteome. We
have shown that the antigens preferentially recognized by T cells are distinct from antibody targets. Here, we
will characterize and credential highly ranked pre-erythrocytic P. falciparum T cell antigens from our unique
dataset, focusing on those that are categorized as exclusively T cell targets, since T cells directed against liver-
stage antigens are considered the primary immune effectors required for sterile immunity against malaria which
prevents disease and stops transmission. Our selection criteria will consider extent of sequence conservation
across Plasmodium strains and species, to target a vaccine that confers strain transcending and cross-species
protection. We will use clinically relevant selection criteria governed by the capacity of the antigen to protect
against virulent P. yoelii parasite challenge in established preclinical models and to be recognized by recall
Plasmodium-specific immune responses in protective human models. We will use two innovative vaccine
delivery platforms selected for capacity to induce robust and sustained T cell responses, with a specific focus on
the induction of liver-specific resident memory T cells (Trm) targeting the putative site of immune action. Our
selected regimens include “Prime-Target” comprising a DNA prime followed by adenovirus boost delivered
intravenously to target the liver, and a liposomal mRNA vaccine platform with an incorporated agonist (cA) to
activate NKT cells and link innate and adaptive immunity; both platforms can induce sustained T cell responses
and are capable of protecting mice against sporozoite challenge. We will assign priorities for vaccine
development according to their credentials, evaluate combinations for synergy, and down-select for clinical
development the set of antigens that have a maximum likelihood of inducing robust and sustained protective
immunity against malaria in humans. The optimal vaccine candidate defined with this preclinical development
strategy could be transitioned directly to clinical development with the ultimate goal of deploying in the field an
effective rationally-designed genome-based vaccine that would induce durable T-cell mediated protection and
ameliorate disease in all at-risk individuals."
10758517,"Abstract:
The usage of metabolic pathways is tailored to meet the specific functions and demands of a given cell type.
Of particular interest is how metabolism supports the survival and antibody secretion of plasma cells, the
primary cell type that is responsible for humoral immunity. The lifespan of these cells dictates the duration of
antibody-mediated immunity after infections or vaccines—a particularly relevant topic in the midst of this
pandemic. During the previous funding period, our work suggested a surprisingly minimal role for
transcriptional pathways in controlling plasma cell lifespan. Instead, metabolic pathways functionally distinguish
plasma cells of differing lifespans. Using newly created genetic tools, we will rapidly define and dissect
essential plasma cell metabolic pathways in vivo. We will use newly generated plasma cell Cre-drivers,
lentiviral bone marrow chimeras, and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to functionally define mitochondrial dynamics,
essential metabolic pathways, and vesicular maturation pathways that promote plasma cell lifespan and
antibody secretion. These approaches will be coupled with sensitive imaging mass spectrometry and stable
isotope-tracing experiments to provide mechanistic insight. Specifically, our experiments will define the
importance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in plasma cell energy metabolism, antibody production, and

plasma cell metabolic re-programming as these cells become progressively longer lived. Second, based upon
results of a completed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we will pursue the importance of V-type ATPases
in amino acid uptake, plasma cell lifespan, and antibody secretion in vivo."

Sedentary behavior (SB) contributes to increased risk for obesity and metabolic disease, cognitive deficits, and
affect disorders over the lifespan. These are critical outcomes because children with these risk factors are more
likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SB increases T2DM risk by promoting hyperglycemia and
greater postprandial glycemic variability as well as via cognitive detriments and depressive symptoms that lead
to poor energy balance behaviors, obesity, and worsening insulin resistance. Physical activity can reduce these
risk factors, however less than half of US youth meet guideline recommendations, and physical activity continues
to decline throughout adolescence. Thus, there is a critical need to test alternative intervention approaches to
sustained bouts of exercise for the prevention of T2DM in children. We were the first to show that interrupting
SB with short, 3-minute, bouts of moderate exercise improved glucose tolerance and negative mood in a single
3-hour session. However, it is unknown whether these short-term improvements translate to sustained multi-day
benefits to metabolic, cognitive, and mood outcomes. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to test the efficacy of
multi-day effects of interrupting SB as a T2DM prevention strategy in youth with overweight/obesity. We propose
a Phase II RCT to compare the effects of SB interruptions vs. sustained bouts of exercise to prolonged sitting in
7-11-year-old children with overweight/obesity. This proposal will address the following aims: (1) determine the
multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on glucose homeostasis measured by continuous glucose monitor and
oral glucose tolerance tests; (2) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on cognitive function
improvements; and (3) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on affect and anxiety improvements.
This study is innovative because: (a) interrupting SB is a novel intervention strategy that has shown potential to
acutely improve metabolic parameters, yet the longer-term effects are unknown and no prior studies have
compared efficacy in reducing multiple T2DM risk factors using this approach vs. a single bout of exercise over
multiple days in children; (b) the use of continuous glucose monitoring is a novel strategy to investigate multi-
day glucose responses to SB interruptions and their association with cognitive and affective outcomes; and (c)
investigating psychological responses to multiple days of interrupting SB vs. a single bout of exercise are novel
outcomes that co-vary throughout the day, and are essential to elucidate if we are to develop novel intervention
approaches that address factors associated withT2DM risk. Given the improvements in glucose homeostasis in
our acute 3-hour trials, along with the dearth of pediatric studies investigating sustained interventions interrupting
SB, this study is a significant and logical next step towards testing the efficacy of this approach for the reduction
of multiple T2DM risk factors in children with overweight/obesity. Our approach is impactful because the rigorous,
controlled lab setting will allow us to design stronger intervention strategies for children that can be translated to
other settings, and age and weight groups, thereby contributing to efforts at reducing T2DM risk in U.S. youth."
10843839,"Abstract: While the latent and intact HIV reservoirs pose theoretical barriers to cure, it is also critical to
understand those cells that are reactivated and/or express HIV in vivo, which contribute to immune activation
and may have more potential to initiate rebound after ART interruption. However, prior studies of the
“transcriptionally active reservoir” have not been able to fully characterize the heterogeneity of these cells, which
vary in terms of whether they transcribe incomplete or completed and spliced HIV RNA, whether the HIV RNA
is transcribed from defective or intact proviruses, and whether it is translated into HIV protein. This P01 focuses
on the novel hypothesis that subsets of cells expressing different types of HIV RNA and/or protein will differ in
terms of their frequency, survival or clearance rate, contribution to immune activation, cellular gene expression,
differences across tissues, rebound potential, and susceptibility to new therapies aimed at HIV cure. To test
these hypotheses, the three synergistic projects in this P01 will employ an array of new and cutting-edge
technologies that can distinguish HIV-expressing cells based on the processivity of the HIV RNA, presence or
absence of deletions or hypermutations, translation into HIV protein, and human transcriptome/proteome.
Project #1 will measure the changes in blocks to HIV transcription and levels of defective or intact HIV RNA and
protein over time in the blood of elite controllers and individuals who initiate ART during acute or chronic infection
(aim 1), determine how they relate to immune responses and immune activation/inflammation (aim 2), and
determine how differential expression of host cell genes relates to the ability of these cells to express HIV and
survive in blood and lymph nodes (aim 3). In Project #2, we will measure the total burden of intact/defective
proviruses and intact/defective HIV RNA across the full spectrum of different organs and tissues in vivo (aim 1),
define the frequencies and phenotypes of cells expressing different types of HIV RNA transcripts across tissues
(aim 2), and determine the in situ impact of HIV burden and residual transcriptional activity on host cell factors
in tissue-resident lymphoid and myeloid cells (aim 3). Project #3 will determine which reservoirs of HIV-
expressing cells (as well as the intact and inducible reservoir) and host factors best predict the timing of rebound
in individuals who initiated ART during acute vs. chronic infection (aim 1), define the features of the rebounding
virus and earliest detectable infected cells during treatment interruption (aim 2), and assess the effects of
immune-based cure interventions on these HIV reservoirs (aim 3). To achieve these goals, the Bioinformatics
Core will help analyze transcriptomic, proteomic, and high dimensional data, while the Administrative Core will
facilitate scientific crosstalk and collaboration, coordinate allocation of resources, and track and evaluate
progress. Findings from these studies will generate a wealth of new knowledge about the HIV-infected cells that
contribute to immune activation on ART and virologic rebound after ART interruption, which may lead to new
approaches aimed at HIV cure or reducing HIV-associated immune activation and organ damage."

 The production of antibodies using hybridoma or primary B-cells with in vitro screening technologies
represents one of the most industrialized processes in contemporary life science. Products including research
reagents, diagnostic tests and biopharmaceuticals rely on the throughput, efficiency and quality of different
antibody screening and manufacturing methods. Despite the large-scale and high-quality requirements of these
industries, automation of the process for selecting specific antibodies for manufacturing remains an unmet need.
The CellRaft Technology represents a novel means of imaging, identifying, and isolating single cells and clonal
colonies. By imaging cells on the proprietary CellRaft Array using the CellRaft AIR® System, phenotypes can
be characterized in detail and over time, prior to isolating cells and colonies for downstream propagation. During
the Phase I program, we tested and developed novel reporter cell lines, software, and cell-based co-culture
assays that leveraged our CellRaft AIR System as an automated antibody screening platform. Briefly, the
CellRaft Technology relies on the CellRaft Array, which contains thousands of microwells, each featuring a
releasable polystyrene floor where cells are seeded and cultured. Cells are phenotypically monitored on the
array with the imaging capabilities of the CellRaft AIR System. Using the CellRaft Cytometry analytical software,
cells can be tracked over time and analyzed for various phenotypes, including fluorescence intensity, as well as
expansion into clonal colonies. The AIR System provides an automated, cost-effective, efficient, and robust
platform for screening the production, affinity and functionality of monoclonal antibody producing cells prior to
isolation so only the most promising candidates need to be harvested. During Phase II, we will adapt the
hybridoma and Jurkat reporter cell line co-culture that was developed in Phase I to be able to screen hundreds
of thousands of primary B cells on the CellRaft-HTS Array. We will evaluate a high throughput workflow for
assessing production and functionality of novel antibodies against therapeutically relevant antigen targets.
Current technologies offering automated solutions to this challenging workflow are incapable of rivaling the cost
savings, throughput, and the detailed phenotypic and functional characterization proposed here."
10800643,"Project Summary
Memories are essential for survival and contribute to numerous brain functions. The storage of long-term
memories takes time: newly formed memories are initially labile, but over time stabilize and strengthen through
a process known as memory consolidation. Defects in this process underlie many devastating conditions
associated with cognitive impairment, including neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative
diseases. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying memory consolidation and
strengthening is key to understanding how memories function and ultimately developing novel, effective
therapies to treat cognitive impairments. Over 25 years of work in this field, our group has identified
fundamental molecular mechanisms of memory consolidation in the rat and mouse hippocampus, a brain
region critical for episodic and spatial memories. Among those mechanisms, the gene encoding insulin-like
growth factor 2 (IGF-2 or IGF-II) emerged as a key target of the evolutionarily conserved CREB-C/EBP
pathway. IGF-2 is necessary for memory consolidation and also strengthens memory. In fact, administering
recombinant IGF-2 at the time of learning or memory retrieval significantly enhances and prolongs memory
retention by preventing memory decay. These memory-enhancing effects are mediated selectively via a high-
affinity receptor for IGF-2, known as IGF-2 receptor (IGF-2R). Another ligand of this receptor, mannose-6-
phosphate (M6P), exerts similar effects, indicating that memory enhancement derives from IGF-2R activation,
which itself is necessary for memory consolidation. In mouse models, both IGF-2 and M6P can reverse most
core deficits of autism spectrum disorder and Angelman syndrome, as well as major problems associated with
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease; these effects are mediated via
IGF-2R. Despite these remarkable effects in both healthy and pathophysiological states, relatively little is
known about the biology of the IGF-2/IGF-2R system in the brain. Based on strong preliminary data, in the
proposed research we aim to significantly advance the cellular and molecular characterization of the IGF-
2/IGF-2R system. By employing state-of-the-art molecular techniques, including RNAscope, regulated mouse
genetics, biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, proteomics, transmission electron microscopy, ribosomal
profiling, RNA-seq, and hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks in mice, we will accomplish the following
Aims: 1) Determine which hippocampal cell types express and regulate IGF-2 and IGF-2R under basal
conditions and during memory consolidation; 2) Identify the hippocampal cell types that require IGF-2 and/or
IGF-2R to form long-term memory; and 3) Elucidate the mechanisms of action of IGF-2R in memory
consolidation. The outcomes of the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the roles
of IGF-2 and IGF-2R in memory consolidation and enhancement."
10689669,"The objective of this HSR&D Career Development Award-2 Proposal is to facilitate Dr. Jason Chen's transition
into an independent, VA mental health services research career focused on intervention development for
Veterans at high-risk of suicide. The goal of the project is to develop a multicomponent intervention focused on
increasing social connectedness among Veterans with recent psychiatric hospitalizations through supported
participation in community activities. This intervention will be informed by input from Veteran, VHA clinical (e.g.
psychiatrists, administrators), and community (e.g. non-profit organizations, family) stakeholders. Research
Plan: Although multiple national efforts have been introduced to address Veteran suicide, suicide rates remain
high. Systematic reviews have identified few interventions that effectively decrease suicide risk. One promising
area for intervention is social connectedness which has been identified as a strong protective factor. However,
few interventions directly target social connectedness among at-risk individuals. Increasing Veteran
participation in community activities may be one way to improve social connectedness difficulties. The current
project proposes the following research aims: 1) Identify Veterans' current behaviors, needs, and preferences
for community engagement following psychiatric hospitalization, 2) Identify VHA staff and community
stakeholder perceptions and perceived needs related to Veteran community engagement following psychiatric
hospitalization, and 3) Develop and pilot a multicomponent, peer-support facilitated intervention for increasing
social connectedness among Veterans at elevated risk of death by suicide. Expected outcomes from these
aims include clinical toolkits for VA and community stakeholders, academic manuscripts and presentations,
and two HSR&D IIR submissions over the course of the CDA award period. Career Plan: Dr. Chen has
assembled a mentorship team who will support his development as a VA mental health services researcher.
Team members include: Steven Dobscha, MD (Primary Mentor), Julie Lowery, PhD (Co-Mentor;
Implementation Science/Qualitative Methods), Paul Pfeiffer, MD, MS (Co-Mentor; Peer Support Intervention
Development), Sarah Ono, PhD (Consultant; Veteran Engagement/Qualitative Methods), and Alan Teo, MD,
MS (Consultant; Social Support). Dr. Chen will also have three Operations Partners/Consultants: Aimee
Johnson, LCSW (Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention), Tracy Weistreich, PhD (Office of Community
Engagement/Center for Compassionate Intervention), and Jason Zimmerman, CPSC (Peer Support Lead). Dr.
Chen and his mentorship team have developed the following training goals which align with his research aims:
1) Develop advanced qualitative health services research skills, 2) Acquire intervention development and
evaluation skills for conducting clinical trials, 3) Gain didactic and applied training in implementation science,
and 4) Achieve further competence in program development to support effective VA-community collaborations
including peer support. Dr. Chen will achieve these training goals through coursework, mentorship/consultant
meetings, and applied training during CDA research activities. Following the completion of these training goals,
Dr. Chen will be well-prepared to become an independent VA HSR&D mental health services researcher with
expertise in utilizing qualitative methodology, clinical trials, implementation science, and program development
to enhance current Veteran suicide prevention efforts."
10830234,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the leading causes of liver failure in the U.S., and accounts for 4% of
mortality worldwide. Sphingolipids, a lipid class bearing signaling properties, have been implicated in numerous
liver pathologies. Sphingolipids are formed by serine palmitoyltransferase, a heterodimeric enzyme composed
of the subunits Sptlc1 and Spltc2. This heterodimer combines serine and palmitoyl-CoA to generate
dihydrosphingosine, which serves as a scaffold for generation of all downstream sphingolipids (e.g., ceramides,
sphingomyelins, glycosphingolipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, etc.). Despite their implication in pathology,
sphingolipids are required by all eukaryotic cells. However, a previously identified novel pool of sphingolipids
were identified. These lipids arise from a dimerization of Sptlc1 with a novel SPT subunit, Sptlc3. Here we show
that Sptlc3 is induced in a mouse model of ALD leading to an increase in atypical sphingolipids, which we show
to regulate several pathways in a potentially protective manner. Therefore, we propose that the canonical
sphingolipids derived from Sptlc1/2 heterodimer are homeostatic and/or play a role in liver pathology, but in some
hepatic insults Sptlc3 is induced, changing the intracellular sphingolipidome in a protective manner. This would
present the opportunity for therapeutic intervention directed toward atypical, Sptlc3-derived sphingolipids,
leaving the homeostatic sphingolipid pool intact.
 The scientific premise behind our hypothesis is that sphingolipid metabolism could be targeted to prevent
or reverse alcoholic liver injury. Our hypothesis is that injury induces these atypical sphingolipids, or a subset
thereof, which activate pathways regulating autophagy/mitophagy, in a manner that expedites recovery from
mitochondrial damage caused by metabolism of ethanol, and that inducing their production will attenuate injury.
This will be tested in 3 aims: 1- determine the mechanism of SPTLC3 upregulation in hepatocytes, and how
this alters sphingolipid profiles, 2-establish the role(s) of SPTLC3 and d16-sphingolipids in mitophagy,
mitochondrial function, and regulation of nuclear receptor transcription factors 3- assess the impact of
alcohol feeding on the hepatocyte-specific Sptlc3 knockout mouse. The far-reaching goal of this project is
to pursue future treatments for ALD based on manipulating metabolism of atypical sphingolipids in hepatocytes."

 3 During the last few months of life, many older adults receive care that is discordant with their preferences,
 4 increases suffering, and disrupts closure and grieving. The process of advance care planning (ACP) helps
 5 patients have control over their end-of-life care by empowering patients to define and document what care they
 6 would like to receive while they still have the cognitive and physical abilities to consider and express these
 7 preferences. ACP improves patient and family satisfaction with the dying process, increases the likelihood that
 8 patients receive the care they want, and reduces healthcare expenditures. Unfortunately, few older adults have
 9 completed ACP and even fewer have documented their end-of-life care preferences in a way that is accessible
10 in a timely manner to medical providers. In a recent Institute of Medicine report on Death and Dying in America,
11 increasing ACP among older adults was identified as a major public priority. Primary care providers, who typically
12 have long-term relationships with patients and understand the details of their medical condition, are well
13 positioned to have end-of-life care conversations. Unfortunately, for several reasons these conversations often
14 do not occur: primary providers don’t want patients to think they’ve given up hope; patients think they are too
15 healthy to benefit from these conversations; and educating patients about end-of-life options takes time. U.S.
16 emergency department (ED) visits provide access to a large number of older adults with advanced illness who
17 are likely to benefit from ACP and provide a unique and important opportunity to overcome these barriers to
18 ACP. Specifically, emergency providers are unlikely to fear undermining a long-term relationship with the patient,
19 older adults who are receiving ED care are unlikely to think they are too healthy to benefit from ACP, and there
20 is ample opportunity during the ED visit to educate patients and initiate a conversation about end-of-life care
21 preferences. The overarching goal of this project is to develop evidence to support the use of an ED-based
22 intervention to promote ACP. We propose a randomized controlled trial of 900 older adults receiving care at
23 three U.S. EDs. Patients receiving the intervention will watch a 5-minute certified video decision aid about ACP
24 and have a structured conversation with a social worker about their values and preferences. The social worker
25 will then send a secure electronic message to the patient’s primary provider sharing with them the patient’s initial
26 preferences and providing instructions as to how to document the patient’s preferences in a manner that is widely
27 accessible to the patient’s medical providers. Following the clinical model of shared decision making, patients
28 will be encouraged by the social worker to deliberate further on their preferences and then have an informed
29 conversation with their primary provider or admitting physician regarding care preferences. Outcomes will include
30 documentation of ACP conversations and preferences, agreement between expressed and documented
31 preferences, and hospital days assessed 3 and 6 months after the ED visit. The results of this study will establish
32 the efficacy of this intervention and provide information to support and inform implementation."

10915393,"For decades, type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been considered a disorder resulting from chronic autoimmune
destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. While a broad number of intellectual advances have improved
our understanding of the natural history of T1D, significant gaps remain in the complex series of physiological
events, both immunologic and metabolic, that initiate β-cell autoimmunity, spur the loss of functional β-cell mass,
and culminate in clinical diabetes. People with a first-degree relative (FDR) with T1D have ~15-fold increased
lifetime risk of T1D. Importantly, natural history studies have informed the use of islet-associated autoantibodies
(AAb) as biomarkers to track progression to overt disease, and these biomarkers were transformative for the
field. Nevertheless, there remains significant heterogeneity in T1D progression, and additional biomarkers of
T1D risk are urgently needed. Studies by this group demonstrated that pancreas weights from organ donors with
T1D were significantly reduced, including at diabetes onset, and provided essential data using the ratio of
pancreas weight to body weight or BMI (relative pancreas volume, RPV) to normalize for subjects’ sex and age.
Yet more profound in terms of T1D pathogenesis, reductions in pancreas size were also observed in single AAb+
donors compared to autoantibody-negative (AAb-) control donors. Subsequently, a pilot cross-sectional DP3 trial
in NIH-NIDDK TrialNet (TN) subjects was completed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify RPV
in FDR in comparison to controls and patients with recent-onset T1D (< 1-year duration). Strikingly, a reduction
in RPV was observed in FDR without AAb (AAb-) with further reductions in RPV for FDR with single and multiple
AAb+. We hypothesize that a smaller pancreas size is predictive of T1D risk and a decline in pancreas
size over time is predictive for diabetes progression. This hypothesis will be tested at four TrialNet centers
in FDR subjects. To test our hypothesis, we will: Aim 1: Quantify pancreas volume (PV) and morphology in
FDR subjects by AAb status and test for longitudinal changes in PV. Aim 2: Correlate PV and morphology
with surrogate markers of β-cell function and mass. Aim 3: Correlate PV and morphology with surrogate
markers of acinar function. Aim 4: Perform SNP analyses for genetic determinants of pancreas size. The
successful completion of these studies will serve to expand the prognostic utility of pancreas MRI in
understanding T1D pathophysiology. Non-contrast pancreas MRI is safe and readily performed in children and
could add to biomarkers informing T1D risk predication, and potentially, progression. Endocrine-exocrine
interactions are novel and are expected to provide a new understanding of diabetes pathogenesis. Earlier
identification of subjects at highest risk for T1D progression is expected to significantly impact prevention
strategies and their successful application before the loss of functional β-cell mass is irreversible."
10877081,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias exhibit symptoms that include
deficits in spatial navigation, and in forming/using cognitive maps of space to guide decision-making, especially
in new environmental situations. These deficits are linked to disease-related perturbation of medial temporal lobe
and frontal lobe brain structures, but surprisingly little is known about the underlying computations that go awry.
 Spatial navigation is believed to be dependent on populations of neurons in the hippocampus with “place-cell”
like representations. Decision-making in novel situations is dependent on representations of latent features that
are shared across examples or experiences, as observed in prefrontal cortex. Finally, the output of these
computations must reach the motor cortex where neural activity is coupled to immediate behavior. However,
studies to determine whether/how neural computations across these brain regions contribute to decisions based
on spatial location, especially in novel situations have not been conducted. Furthermore, whether symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias can be treated by modulating these computations is not known.
 To address this gap, I created an innovative new virtual reality paradigm and trained monkeys to make
decisions about which objects to collect based on learned spatial rules. I will combine this with high-channel-
count electrophysiology in trained monkeys to determine if/how population-level representations in the HPC-
PFC-PMd support decision-making based on spatial rules. Then, I will elucidate if and how population activity in
the HPC-PFC-PMd circuit supports generalization in novel situations. In my independent laboratory, I will use
this model system as a platform for elucidating the neural mechanism of an emerging treatment for Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias. These contributions are significant because they will
provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of some of our most adaptive cognitive capacities, while also
creating a new platform for discovering and testing new treatments where I systematically test the effects of
neural perturbations on neural circuit function and behavior.
 This project will facilitate my training as an independent researcher through new experience in high-channel
count, multi-area recordings, training in the etiology and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias,
and in running a monkey electrophysiology lab at the intersection of basic and translational neuroscience. This
project will result in direct interactions between experimental neurophysiologists, theoretical neuroscientists, and
clinician-scientists. This award will help me achieve my long-term career goal to run an independent research
laboratory at an academic institution with a medical school, where I will operate a monkey electrophysiology lab
at the nexus of 1) elucidating neural mechanisms of learning and decision-making, and 2) developing/testing
novel therapeutics for disorders of memory and decision-making, including Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease related dementias."
10660964,"Abstract:
 Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with
jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number
of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.
 Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments
of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although
the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes.
Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements
and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing,
surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just
hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue”
approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even
bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect,
a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But
this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s
perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both
doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.
 In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes
following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable
amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the
postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following
the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.
 Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are
able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery.
To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together
to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.
 The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable
clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single
software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome-
driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery."
10645148,"Adipose tissue remodeling, involving adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, extracellular matrix (EM) remodeling, and thermogenesis, plays a central role in regulating energy homeostasis. A notable adaptive process within adipose tissues is the “browning” or “beiging” of white adipose tissue (WAT): enhanced brown/beige fat function is accompanied by a substantial improvement in metabolic health, including increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as well as reduced adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Reciprocally, dysregulation in the processes is tightly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. As such, a better understanding of the brown/beige fat biogenesis continues to be a significant area of research in the field of metabolic disorders. The best-known stimuli of brown/beige fat biogenesis are cold and PPARγ: cold exposure via activation of β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) or chronic treatment with synthetic PPARγ ligands (e.g., thiazolidinediones) activate the brown/beige fat-selective genetic program. However, chronic activation of these pathways often causes multiple side effects, such as cardiovascular diseases. Thus, identifying alternative pathways that selectively stimulate brown/beige fat biogenesis, while avoiding the detrimental effects of the conventional pathways, may promise new approaches that improve metabolic health with minimal side effects. In this regard, our recent finding may offer a new opportunity: we identified a previously uncharacterized cell-intrinsic post-translational pathway that activates brown/beige fat biogenesis – e.g., enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, thermogenesis, as well as reduced adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis – without activating the canonical PPARγ transcription pathway. We found the first ubiquitin E3-ligase complex that controls the protein stability of PRDM16, a dominant transcriptional co-activator of the brown/beige fat gene
program. Notably, inhibition of the ubiquitin E3-ligase complex is sufficient to activate the brown/beige fat program through extending the half-life of PRDM16 protein. Accordingly, this proposal aims to determine the post-translational mechanisms through which the newly identified E3-ligase complex for PRDM16 regulateswhole-body energy metabolism."
11171816,"Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer among women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women. However, breast cancer is not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous group of cancers with a variety of molecular drivers regulating tumor development, progression, and response to therapy. Thus, a central goal in breast cancer research has been to identify the key genetic alterations defining specific subsets of this cancer, thereby providing an opportunity to develop targeted therapies against the specific proteins affected by these alterations. This strategy has been realized, in one instance, with the identification of ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification as an oncogenic driver for ~20% of breast cancers, and has led to the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, and T-DXd) for treatment of tumors harboring this amplification. The impact of these antibody-based therapeutics has been transformative, dramatically increasing survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Nevertheless, many patients with HER2-positive breast cancer are initially resistant to this therapy or develop resistance with time, so that now a major challenge to the field is to understand the mechanisms driving this treatment resistance and to develop new approaches to target these resistant cancers. This research project focuses on p95HER2, a truncated form of HER2 that is produced via the use of an alternative translation initiation site within the HER2 mRNA, corresponding to Met611 in the full-length HER2 protein. The p95HER2 protein lacks nearly the entire extracellular domain and therefore cannot be recognized by any of the HER2-directed therapeutic antibodies in clinical use, yet retains oncogenic signaling properties. As such, upregulation of p95HER2 represents one mechanism for the development of therapy resistance. In addition, our work demonstrates that p95HER2 expression in breast cancer cells drives a distinct set of signaling pathways, different from those driven by the full-length HER2 oncoprotein, which exert unique effects on the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we speculate that HER2-positive breast cancers that co-express the p95HER2 variant are fundamentally different with regard to how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and may respond differently to therapeutics that engage anti-tumor immunity. The overarching objectives of this project are to fully understand the impact of p95HER2 on cells of the tumor microenvironment, specifically with regard to the tumor immune response."
10947426,"Abstract
The proposed work aims at the commercialization of a microfluidic chip-based platform for modeling
Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) for preclinical in vitro mechanistic
studies and drug testing. AD/ADRD are a growing health concern, accounting for 50-75% of all dementia
cases, and currently affecting an estimated 5.8 million Americans. In addition to the human suffering, the
annual cost of AD/ADRD is $290 billion. Current FDA approved treatments only help manage the symptoms of
the disease. However, there is no treatment to stop or reverse its progression despite hundreds of clinical
trials. A major obstacle to successful treatment development is the dearth of suitable preclinical models. In
addition, there is substantial epidemiological evidence of an intricate relationship between traumatic brain
injury (TBI), longer-term AD/ADRD pathology, and cognitive decline. However, the exact link between AD and
TBI is not known. This application aims to solve both of these problems by developing a novel microfluidics-
based 3D in vitro AD model, and merging this chip with BMSEED’s existing in vitro TBI model platform, the
MicroElectrode Array Stretching Stimulating und Recording Equipment (MEASSuRE), to meet the needs for
pre-clinical AD/ADRD research. This new platform presents an efficient and physiologically relevant pre-clinical
drug screening platform for AD treatments. The platform is also well-suited to investigate the effects of a TBI
on a person with or without a pre-existing genetic disposition to develop AD. The key innovations are the use
of a stretchable microelectrode array for functional assessment of neuronal health in a microfluidics drug
screening platform, and the capability to investigate the mechanistic links and similarities between AD and TBI
using this stretchable microelectrode array in a 3D cell culture matrix (3D-sMEA). This 3D-MEASSuRE
platform provides a more realistic in vitro facsimile of the natural in vivo biochemical and biomechanical
microenvironment of the cells compared to existing 2D systems. Phase I is focused on demonstrating Proof-of-
Concept (PoC) using a single-well (SW) 3D-MEASSuRE platform with cells derived from genetically modified
(3xTg, 5xFAD) and wild type mice. Phase II is directed towards (a) improving efficiency by developing a high
throughput multi-well (MW) 3D-MEASSuRE platform, and (b) increasing relevance to clinical translation by
evaluating the platform using human cells derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from AD
patients and age matched controls. The capability of the 3D-MEASSuRE platform for research on the genetic
pre-disposition to develop AD and the role of crosstalk between different cell types in the brain in mediating
neuronal health after TBI-relevant strain injury will be evaluated and validated. The focus of this proposal is the
development of a pre-clinical drug screening platform for AD/ADRD, however, the products developed in this
research will also be applicable in drug screening for other neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Parkinson’s
Disease. At the end of Phase II, the 3D-MEASSuRE platform will be ready for the marketplace."
10757314,"Project Summary: While mechanical thrombectomy has advanced the treatment of large vessel occlusion
(LVO) stroke, over 50% of patients still suffer from significant disability or death. Ischemia/reperfusion injury
(I/RI), the result of restoring blood flow to deeply ischemic tissue, accelerates recruitment of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs). PMNs exert poor outcomes in two ways. First, PMNs physically obstruct
cerebral microvessels in the stroke bed despite macrovascular reperfusion – a condition known as microvascular
‘no-reflow’. Second, PMNs exert toxic effects regionally once recruited at postcapillary venules and extravasated
into the infarcted brain. Accordingly, preclinical studies that block PMN recruitment have had success in reducing
stroke burden and improving neurologic outcome. Unfortunately, these preclinical studies have not been
successful in human trials. These translational roadblocks may be addressed by investigating the spatiotemporal
determinants of PMN recruitment as it relates to the in vivo cerebrovasculature during stroke. Using a mouse
stroke model to simulate the LVO population and novel histopathological and imaging techniques, my preliminary
data have found that PMN recruitment throughout I/RI is non-uniform up to 72 hours after infarction. PMNs were
also found to progress cortically to subcortically throughout I/RI over the course of 72 hours, with partial restriction
to the cortical surface by administration of an antibody that blocks transendothelial migration (TEM). These
results support the concept of stroke microenvironments – highly regionalized areas within an infarct where
inflammation and impaired microcirculation interface with each other. I hypothesize that these stroke
microenvironments within an infarct are due to feedback loops between 1) microvascular flow and oxygenation;
and 2) PMN recruitment. To test this hypothesis, I will investigate two aims: 1) Defining and physiologically
manipulating the stroke microenvironment 2) Determine how PMN infiltration and position regulates I/RI over
time. I will test these aims using techniques of multimodal in vivo animal imaging, advanced microscopy, and
targeted manipulation of both leukocyte biology and stroke physiology. These studies will ultimately be used to
identify molecular similarities of PMNs in particularly toxic stroke microenvironments, facilitating the investigation
and creation of novel leukocyte-based therapies. To complete these long-term goals, I will incorporate a
multidisciplinary mentorship team and short-term goals of developing expertise in live-animal imaging, advanced
microscopy, and leukocyte biology. With this K08 proposal, I will build a unique translational stroke program that
defines the interplay of stroke physiology and pathology to develop more precise and translatable therapies for
stroke patients."

Opioid addiction affects people of all races, ages, gender identities, education, and income levels across the
United States. The epidemic has been intensifying in recent years, with relapse rates reaching close to 91%
(Kadam et al., 2017) and provisional data from 2020 indicating the highest number of overdose deaths ever
recorded in a year, over 88,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Further, only 10-20% of
people struggling with addiction receive care for their OUD (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2020). An increasing body of literature exposes a population extremely vulnerable to opioid
addiction and overdose: United States veterans.
 Veterans face unique challenges that predispose them to greater risk for misusing opioids such as
higher prevalence of and more severe pain than the general population (Nahin, 2017), and the stresses and
risks of deployment that often result in PTSD upon return to civilian life (Seal et al., 2012). Indeed, this group,
though not monolithic, may be generally resistant to support; half of military personnel reported that they
believe seeking help for mental health issues would harm their military career. Suicide rates continue to rise,
faster in the veteran population than in the non-veteran population, even despite the decrease in the population
proportion of veterans. In 2018, almost one in seven suicides in the U.S. was a veteran (“2020 National
Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report”, 2020). Mental health issues have an effect on substance use
disorders as well. Nationwide, the rate of overdose deaths in veterans increased by 65% from 2010 to 2016
(Lewei et al., 2019). The stressors of deployment during wartime that are often difficult to shake off upon return
to civilian life, incidences of injuries resulting in severe and often chronic pain, and the nuances of military
culture, combined with stigmas associated with OUD, perpetuate a detrimental cycle of addiction for veterans.
 To address this, we are proposing the development of a novel solution that addresses the mental health
of veterans nationally via a first-of-its-kind remote monitoring and intervention software-as-a-service offering.
Our system builds upon our technology stack and learnings from clinical studies on individuals with OUD.
Given that substance use in the veteran population often precedes a deleterious cycle commonly resulting in
serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI) and sometimes even suicide, advanced and real-time remote
monitoring of the state of mental health would be an important indicator. This tool provides timely intervention
that addresses OUD and further averts the progression of SPMI as well as suicidal tendencies."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes more deaths worldwide than any other infectious agent and is
increasingly characterized by antimicrobial resistance. An effective vaccination strategy to prevent establishment
of M.tb infection and progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease is a priority to achieve rapid control of the global
TB epidemic, but development and clinical testing of new vaccines is hampered by the lack of immune correlates
of protection. Revaccination of adolescents with the only licenced vaccine against TB, Bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG), partially protected against established M.tb infection, providing the first efficacy signal for a novel TB
vaccination strategy in a high-risk population. There is a one-time opportunity to leverage this existing cohort, as
well as newly enrolled participants in a larger confirmatory phase 2b clinical trial, to identify and test the durability
of immune correlates of protection against established M.tb infection in the lung, which could harbour critically
different immune responses compared to peripheral blood.
Blood and bronchoalveaolar lavage specimens will be collected to identify and determine longevity of vaccine-
induced systemic and pulmonary immune responses that correlate with protection against sustained M.tb
infection. The durability of vaccine-induced protection against infection ~6 years after vaccination will also be
explored.
Novel and robust technologies, such as polychromatic flow cytometry, mass cytometry and systems serology will
be applied to study adaptive and innate immune responses in participants enrolled in two BCG efficacy trials at
6 months and ~6 years after vaccination as well as 1 month and 4-5 years after primary M.tb infection. The
overarching hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induced multiple arms of the immune system and that a
combination of Th1/Th17 and IgA responses is associated with lower risk of established M.tb infection.
This approach will: 1) Identify and assess durability of BCG-mediated systemic and pulmonary immune
responses in M.tb-uninfected individuals; 2) Define systemic and pulmonary immune correlates of post-
M.tb exposure protection against established M.tb infection in participants experiencing transient (protected)
or sustained (unprotected) M.tb infection. Identification of vaccine-induced immune responses important for
protection against established M.tb infection would enhance our understanding of early containment of M.tb and
could inform immune correlates of protection against TB disease.
By extending the follow-up of the first BCG revaccination trial and comparing rates of M.tb infection in participants
from the BCG and placebo arms, we will also 3) Measure the durability of vaccine-mediated prevention of
sustained M.tb infection for at least 6 years post-vaccination, which, if significant, would provide impetus to
conduct larger trials testing for efficacy to prevent TB disease in endemic populations."
10934572,"The overarching goal of the Biostatistics and Informatics Core is to provide statistical, informatic and data science leadership and support for the Program Project. The Core faculty and other researchers are engaged in mission-related research motivated by the Program research and the methodological challenges that arise from the three projects. The Core members have extensive and shared expertise and interests that unite their activities across Projects. By forming a Biostatistics and Informatics Core that functions across projects, we anticipate a more efficient, robust and profound level of support for Program research than that could be achieved if biostatisticians were nested within each project. It allows us to pool and share expertise and resources across the Program in statistical genetics and genomics, statistical and machine learning, and to draw on the broader resources available through multiple participating institutes, such as the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences at Baylor College of Medicine, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics of Imperial College. Members of the Core have extensive experience in developing and applying methods, tools and resources for common variant analysis in multiethnic genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare variant analysis of multi-ethnic whole genome sequencing studies, multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, integrative analysis of different types of data, causal inference using Mendelian Randomization and mediation analysis, risk prediction, and statistical and machine learning methods, and statistical methods for epidemiological studies. They have worked together for years on studies relating to lung cancer in collaboration with the Program investigators. The Core provides an environment for coordinating statistical and data science research, study design, and data analysis across the Program projects, including (1) collaborating with the Administrative Core on data management and data sharing; (2) developing and applying state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methods that meet the needs of the Program, especially studies in diverse and understudied populations; (3) providing statistical and and data science training of Program students, postdocs, and researchers."
10906779,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor among adults, with poor patient prognosis despite aggressive treatment regimens combining chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy 
infiltrating tumor cells in the brain. Engineering T cells to express tumor-targeting chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) offers a tantalizing means to induce targets for CAR-T cell-based immunotherapies. Prior clinical trials have shown the safety of CAR-T cell therapy targeting interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13Rα2), an 
antigen that is overexpressed by 58-78% of gliomas. However, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier hindering the effectiveness of these immunotherapies against GBM, with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) playing a particularly prominent role. We have now developed a 
bispecific CAR that simultaneously targets TGF-β and IL-13Rα2, and observed superior in vivo anti-tumor 
efficacy against both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic gliomas in immunocompetent mice 
compared to single-input IL-13Rα2 CAR-T cells. Our central hypothesis is that IL-13Rα2/TGF-β bispecific 
CAR-T cells can directly attack GBM via IL-13Rα2 recognition and simultaneously disrupt the 
immunosuppressive feedback loop between TGF-β and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. In this new 
SPORE Project, we have planned a series of studies with the following specific aims: 1) to optimize clinicalgrade cell manufacturing of IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells for clinical testing; 2) to conduct a new first-in-human clinical trial of a novel IL-13Rα2/TGF-β bispecific CAR-T cell therapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma; and 3) to determine correlates of response and potential resistance mechanisms to this novel therapeutic approach. At the conclusion of this grant, we hope to address some of the major hurdles of CAR T cell therapy for GBM by targeting both glioblastoma cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. If successful, this project will expand our immunotherapeutic armamentarium and potentially help to enhance tumor eradication, thereby improving outcomes for patients with GBM."
11178923,"The lack of effective treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains a significant health problem and highlights the need for novel and innovative approaches. Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells in the brain. For the past 15 
years, our group and others have been testing active vaccination strategies, such as dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with tumor lysate, to induce antitumor immunity in glioblastoma patients. From the interim results of the clinical trial we initiated in our current SPORE funding period, we found that in addition to inducing T-cell infiltration into brain tumors, DC vaccination + anti-PD1 blockade may also create a pro-inflammatory environment within the tumor that induces the immigration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells (TIM). These cells are phenotypically similar to the myeloid cells that dominantly attenuate the T-cell response to chronic viral infections, and may counteract the effective anti-tumor T-cell responses induced by DC vaccination within the tumor microenvironment. Therapies that target myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment represent a promising new strategy. As such, inhibition of these myeloid cells using a CSF-1R inhibitor, in conjunction with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination (ATL-DC) and PD-1 mAb blockade, resulted in significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing animals with large, well-established intracranial (i.c.) gliomas. Our hypothesis is that myeloid cells mediate adaptive immune resistance in response to T cell activation induced by 
immunotherapy. In this SPORE Project renewal, we have planned a series of novel pre-clinical studies to repolarize myeloid cells, to optimize how the timing and sequence of immunotherapy can influence ant-tumor immunity, and a new clinical trial to test the first-in-human combination of a new brain penetrant CSF-1R inhibitor (CSF-1Ri; PLX3397, Daiichi-Sankyo) with DC vaccination and PD-1 mAb blockade (Pembrolizumab, Merck) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. A better understanding of the biology of these cellular interactions will provide insight into more effective ways to induce therapeutic anti-tumor immune responses for this deadly type of brain tumor. These studies span the continuum of translational research in brain tumor immunotherapy, and will likely provided informative new insights for the development of new, rational immune-based strategies for brain tumor patients."
11140081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a human gamma-herpesvirus, is the causative agent of AIDS 
malignancies like KS and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). In recent years it became clear that pathogenic 
herpesviruses including EBV, KSHV, and MHV68 express numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) many of 
which are in antisense orientation to protein coding transcripts. The function and structure of these RNAs is 
largely unknown. In addition, these viruses express microRNAs (miRNAs). While characterizing the KSHV 
miRNA targetomes using a modified Crosslinking and Sequencing of Hybrids (qCLASH) protocol, we identified 
several hundred host cellular lncRNAs as putative miRNA targets. These data strongly suggest that both KSHV 
encoded proteins and miRNAs contribute to dysregulation of host lncRNAs. Importantly, 34 lncRNAs that are 
perturbed following KSHV infection, including MALAT1, HOTTIP, ANRIL, Meg3, UCA1 and GAS-5 are reported 
to be associated with human cancers. We also linked both mRNA and lncRNA targets to cancer hallmark 
phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism, and started to identify 
signaling pathways that are perturbed by KSHV miRNAs in human endothelial cells as a model for KS. We also 
identified aberrant splicing as an additional cancer hallmark phenotype. Here we propose to extend our studies 
by integrating multi-omics data sets from qCLASH, RNAseq and miRNAseq data to comprehensively analyze 
miRNA-regulated gene regulatory networks in KSHV infected endothelial cells. Moreover, we propose to validate 
our findings in a significant number of human tumor samples and by generating the first KS tumor miRNA 
targetome by qCLASH. These studies will be performed in a comparative fashion with Projects 2 and 3 and 
furthermore will be supported by Cores B, C, and D. In addition, we are functionally studying the role of the 
antisense LANA transcript (ALT) for which we have identified 81 putative binding proteins using a highly 
innovative RNA-pulldown assay. Moreover, we will study the role of a newly identified class of viral circular RNAs 
that has been discovered by this program. In summary, the goal of this project is to delineate the role of viral 
lncRNAs and host cellular lncRNAs that are perturbed by viral infection in AIDS malignancies."
11140082,"Project Summary
The transforming human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV establish stable latent infections in B cells, 
providing a lifelong reservoir of virus that can contribute to the development of malignant disease. Thus, defining 
the mechanisms that govern long-term latency and tumorigenesis is critical for designing rational strategies to 
prevent disease. In vivo studies of gammaherpesviruses in humans have been severely limited by the difficulties 
of working in the natural host. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is related to EBV and KSHV and causes 
lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease in mice, providing a readily manipulatable small animal model for 
mechanistic studies of the virus/host relationship in vivo. Like EBV and KSHV, MHV68 expresses multiple forms 
of ncRNAs whose functions during infection and pathogenesis are largely unknown. In contrast to most 
gammaherpesvirus protein-coding genes, gammaherpesvirus ncRNAs are abundantly expressed in vivo during 
chronic infection and in hyperplastic lesions during lymphoproliferative disease, suggesting that these ncRNAs 
may play key conserved roles in latency and tumorigenesis. In support of this, we have demonstrated that 
MHV68 TMER4 and EBV EBER1 share a conserved function in hematogenous dissemination, and that in vivo
suppression of a conserved miRNA target promotes B cell latency. Further, our new preliminary findings implicate 
both small ncRNAs and miRNAs in the genesis and progression of virus-induced B cell lymphoma. Thus, we 
hypothesize that gammaherpesviruses utilize a broad array of ncRNAs to shape critical B cell signaling pathways 
and thereby promote virus dissemination, latency and tumorigenesis. In Aim 1 (in collaboration with Project 2
and with support from Cores C and D), we will define the mechanisms by which gammaherpesvirus small RNAs 
promote the egress and dissemination of infected B cells, facilitate B cell latency at peripheral sites, and drive 
key stages of lymphomagenesis. In Aim 2 (in collaboration with Projects 2 and 3, and with support from Cores 
B, C and D) we will define the contribution of gammaherpesvirus miRNA repression of host mRNAs and lncRNAs 
to B cell latency and lymphomagenesis. The highly collaborative nature of this program, along with the systematic 
in vivo analyses of ncRNA mutants and recombinant viruses carrying EBV or KSHV genes, provides an 
extremely powerful means to determine the specific molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs contribute to 
gammaherpesvirus latency and tumorigenesis."
11185827,"ABSTRACT – RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
Disparities in health care based on race/ethnicity represent a mutable factor that costs the U.S. 
government billions of dollars annually. According to the National Academy of Science Board on Higher 
Education, Blacks, Latinos and Native American tribal people together represent approximately 25% of 
the nation’s populations, yet they represent only 8% of the total science and engineering PhD recipients. 
The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center, 
is a collaboration among Florida A&M University (FAMU, a Historically Black College and University 
{HBCU}), University of Florida (UF) and University of Southern California (USC) that will advance cancer
research to better meet the needs of Black and Latino communities. In response to the Comprehensive 
Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) U54 PAR, the CaRE2 Health Equity Center 
Research Education Core (REC) is proposed to meet the cancer research education needs of
underrepresented minorities (URM) in Florida and California, especially Blacks and Latinos. The REC
will: (1) support the training of 30 URM post-bac students in a one-year mentored research and training 
program (“Postbac-CaRE2”); and (2) provide academic career development, mentorship, and tailored
research training opportunities to increase the competitive research capacity for a total of 90 URM 
graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and early-stage investigators and 40 ongoing trainees
(CaRE2-Grad+); (3) Evaluation of CaRE2 Research Education activities. Post-baccalaureate trainees at 
each partner site will have a year-long immersion in research, working with multidisciplinary teams to 
build their knowledge of research and to promote their academic career paths in cancer-related health 
disparities. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and ESIs at each site will receive intensive 
mentoring, academic career development and tailored research training opportunities to promote their 
successful attainment of research-related and academic milestones. Program outcomes of the REC will
be monitored with Planning and Evaluation Core support to develop a robust long-term tracking and 
evaluation program of the REC activities across the diverse CaRE2 training pipelines. The Administrative 
Core will use data gathered via assessment activities to implement program changes as needed to 
promote the success of the trainees."

My long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in minority health disparities research, working
to improve outcomes for vulnerable and marginalized populations. My short-term (five-year) career goal is to
gain quantitative skills in secondary data analysis, strengthen my expertise in causal inference, and learn to
implement pragmatic community-based clinical trials that address structural barriers to health. Among US
Latinos, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is alarmingly high, with approximately 1 in 2 at risk for
developing T2D during their lifetime. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study demonstrated that a
structured lifestyle change program to achieve 5-7% weight loss and/or use of metformin in overweight and
obese individuals with prediabetes can prevent and/or delay the onset of T2D. California recently passed a law
(SB 97) mandating that Medicaid (Medi-Cal) plans cover the DPP for interested and eligible Medi-Cal
beneficiaries with prediabetes. However, Latinos and low-income patients face significant barriers to DPP
participation. We need new, sustainable approaches to recruit, engage, and retain Latino and low-
income populations in the DPP, including community-partnered approaches linking participants with
low-cost resources that support lifestyle change and weight loss. My Specific Aims are as follows:
 1. In a difference-in-difference analysis with data from two large California health systems, to determine the
 effect of SB 97 on 12-month weight change, achieving >5% weight loss (primary outcomes), systolic blood
 pressure, and T2D incidence (secondary outcomes) among Latino Medi-Cal patients with prediabetes
 compared with Latino patients of similar SES with prediabetes covered by the health insurance exchange.
 2. Through a community-partnered approach and a community advisory board (CAB), to assess barriers and
 facilitators to recruitment, engagement, and retention at three health clinics that provide DPP programs
 serving LEP Latino patients, and develop an intervention that enhances recruitment and retention and
 improves existing Spanish-language DPP programs by addressing structural-level barriers.
 3. To conduct a one-arm feasibility and acceptability pilot trial of a community-informed intervention (Aim 2)
 to recruit, engage, and retain Spanish-speaking patients who are eligible to participate in DPP classes at 3
 FQHCs in South Los Angeles. Process outcomes include success with recruitment, ability to deliver the
 intervention in a clinical setting, and ability to measure study outcomes. Clinical outcomes include weight
 change, physical activity, and social determinants of health.
This award will enable me to work with an experienced team of mentors to gain career development skills in
community-based pragmatic clinical trials, best practices to engage minority populations in research, and
interventions promoting health equity. The preliminary data collected will support a future R01 grant for a larger
randomized trial of the community-partnered DPP intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinos with prediabetes."
10850596,"Defects in laterality are observed in more than 1 in 8000 live births and have significant clinical implications.
The embryonic heart starts as a straight cardiac tube along the midline of the embryo, which is subsequently
transformed into a c-shaped heart loop reliably toward the right side of the body. This cardiac c-looping is
considered as the earliest evident event of left-right (LR) asymmetry breaking (also called chirality or
handedness) of a human organ. The inversed lateralization of cardiac looping often leads to severe clinical
outcomes, including dextrocardia, septum defects, double outlet right ventricle, and even death of fetuses and
infants. Accumulating evidence suggests that asymmetric cardiac looping derives from an unknown tissue-
intrinsic mechanism. Recently, we have recapitulated chiral morphogenesis on micropatterned surfaces and in
3D hydrogels and demonstrated that cardiac cells have a definite chirality before asymmetric looping. Protein
kinase C (PKC) activators can reverse both cell chirality and cardiac c looping. Our rationale is that novel cell
chirality based high-throughput platforms, together with a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of
cell chirality, can facilitate the LR symmetry research. We propose to use a combination of micro-fabrication,
hydrogel technology, live-cell imaging, molecular assays, traction force microscopy, high-throughput screening,
ex vivo culture, and genetic mouse models as tools to elucidate the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms.
Our objectives are to determine biomolecular and biomechanical mechanisms of PKC regulated cell chirality
and asymmetric looping and to identify cytoskeletal mechanisms of cell chirality during cardiac c-looping.
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Identify components and signaling pathways that regulate cardiac chirality with high-
throughput screening and validate with ex ovo embryo culture. We will screen inhibitors/activators of PKC
isoforms, their downstream effectors, possible substrates, and a small-molecule kinase library, determine
mechanisms of action, and validate the findings with the whole-embryo ex ovo culture.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the biomechanical role of cell chirality in multicellular morphogenesis. We
will examine whether chiral mechanical forces are sufficient to induce cardiac c-looping using traction force
microscopy and whether the cells on ventral myocardium exhibit intrinsic chiral biases.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine cytoskeletal mechanisms in cardiac cell chirality during c-looping. We will
analyze the chirality of actin dynamics of cardiac cells, observe its change under drugs of interest, and confirm
the findings with ex ovo whole-embryo culture and genetic mouse models.
If the project is successful, we will be able to establish a set of novel high-throughput platforms for studying the
biophysics of asymmetric cardiac looping by measuring cell chirality, and further our understanding of
congenital heart disease. Also, this proposed research is transformative, and potentially open a new field of
research: cell chirality, a fundamental cellular property defining symmetry breaking in tissue development."
11041232,The overall goal of this project is to perform preclinical and phase II clinical testing of a Th17-induced pulsed dendritic cell vaccine to assess its efficacy in preventing relapse of high grade ovarian cancer in first remission after debulking surgery and platinum-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
11179622,"Few targeted therapies are approved for recurrent endometrial cancer (EC); and aggressive histologic 
subtypes such as serous EC (SEC, also known as uterine serous carcinoma) and serous-like EC remain clinically 
challenging. Serous-like and SECs share molecular characteristics with high grade serous ovarian cancer (OC), 
raising the possibility that therapeutic approaches in OC might also be effective in these ECs. Our preliminary 
data show that most SEC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors with a high genomic instability score (GIS) still 
have a functional homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway as manifested by formation of RAD51 
foci after DNA damage. In addition, monotherapy with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) 
rucaparib failed to induce tumor regression in 5 of 5 SEC and serous-like EC PDXs, arguing against clinical 
development of PARPi monotherapy for SEC. In contrast, treatment with rucaparib in combination with the TOP1 
inhibitor SN-38 demonstrated strong synergy in SEC cell lines in vitro; and PDX studies demonstrated significantly greater efficacy of rucaparib + PLX038A (a novel pegylated formulation of SN-38) over monotherapy in 3 
of the same 5 EC PDXs in vivo. Although the combination appears promising, several unanswered questions 
remain: i) Do SECs and serous-like ECs have the same responses to the PARPi/PLX038 combination, which 
would impact the design of future trials? ii) Because patients may experience increased toxicity from combination 
therapy despite the excellent tolerability in mice, can the schedule of PLX038A + rucaparib be modified without 
losing efficacy? iii) Because GIS and DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci have not correlated with response in 
preliminary studies, is it possible to identify an alternative predictor of response to PLX038A/rucaparib therapy? 
To address these knowledge gaps, we will test the hypothesis that PLX038A + rucaparib will be more 
efficacious in SEC and serous-like ECs than either monotherapy and that tumors with the greatest response will demonstrate prolonged TOP1-DNA covalent complexes (TOP1ccs), which can serve as a biomarker of response to PLX038-containing combinations."

health disparities research careers. Utilizing evidence-based training that fosters the growth and persistence of 
underrepresented students in the sciences, the REC provides trainees with science enrichment education and 
mentored research experiences which emphasize professional development, inclusive support, and team 
science across multiple disciplines. The framework of the REC focuses on three areas that are critical to the 
development of research scientists: (1) acquisition of scientific knowledge; (2) development of communication 
skills; and (3) individualized career development. The Core will provide four research education programs: 
undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, graduate, and post-doctoral. Over the course of the grant cycle the REC 
seeks to support 60 undergraduates (15-20 per year, minimum one semester or summer, 90% multisemester), 30 graduate students (6-8 per year, most multi-semester), 15 post-baccalaureate students (3 per 
year for 1-2 years), and 2 nursing post-doctoral scientists (1 per two-year fellowship) in innovative research 
education programming. Partnership faculty will mentor trainees and fellows at all levels. Recognizing that the 
needs of individuals vary and that they change at each educational level, the REC will provide individualized 
and developmentally appropriate experiences aimed at preparing students/trainees for the next phase of their 
academic and research careers. The REC will continue to provide research opportunities for students at the 
intersection between the natural/physical sciences and social/behavioral sciences. Over the past 15 years, the 
Research Education Core (REC) has provided 347 trainees/fellows across the scientific preparation levels with 
mentored research experiences and scholarly, scientific, and professional development that prepares them to 
pursue advanced degrees & fellowships, and then to become cancer, health disparities, and/or biomedical 
science researchers. The REC will continue to use innovative methods to assess the extent to which the 
Partnership research education program is preparing trainees and fellows to successfully pursue a productive 
cancer/cancer health disparities research career. The REC will also advance scientific knowledge on effective 
research education programs through the submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed publications regarding 
the impact of Partnership activities on the diversity of the biomedical workforce and effective strategies for 
developing research scientists from underrepresented backgrounds."

The UMass Boston Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Partnership’s Research Education Core (REC) aims
to bridge the divide that exists in the biomedical workforce by increasing the number of UMass Boston 
students, particularly those from underrepresented populations, to pursue graduate degrees and cancer/cancer 
health disparities research careers. Utilizing evidence-based training that fosters the growth and persistence of 
underrepresented students in the sciences, the REC provides trainees with science enrichment education and 
mentored research experiences which emphasize professional development, inclusive support, and team 
science across multiple disciplines. The framework of the REC focuses on three areas that are critical to the 
development of research scientists: (1) acquisition of scientific knowledge; (2) development of communication 
skills; and (3) individualized career development. The Core will provide four research education programs: 
undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, graduate, and post-doctoral. Over the course of the grant cycle the REC

11064394,"Both CART and bispecific antibody (BsAb), as T-cell directed therapies, have yielded impressive clinical responses in patients with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and are now FDA approved in standard of care (SOC) practice. However, durable remissions continue to be low, and most patients relapse in the first 1-3 years. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms of resistance is critical to improve durable remission of T-cell directed therapies. We have identified two novel, T-cell extrinsic, mechanisms of resistance for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development: 1) Myeloma cells intrinsic resistance to killing by entering into a dormant state; 2) Myeloma microenvironment suppression of T cell activities via bone marrow cancerassociated fibroblasts (BM-CAFs). We and others have shown that tumor cells can enter into a dormant, non-growing state after exposure to chemotherapy and radiation. These cells exhibit features of increased signaling in senescence, anti-apoptosis pathways, but are not permanently senescent or growth arrested. They can then re-enter into proliferation and contribute to disease relapse and progression. Thus, this therapy-induced dormancy (TID) state is a novel mechanism of tumor cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. We have found that myeloma cells can adopt this senescent and myeloid-like profile after treatment, and that increased presence of these TID-MM cells in the bone marrow of patients prior to CART infusion is associated with shorter PFS post CART. In addition, our group has recently published a novel mechanism for resistance to CART cells by BM-CAFs. Specifically, our studies indicate that BM-CAFs from patients with MM significantly inhibit CART cell functions in preclinical models through complex mechanisms that involve secretion of suppressive cytokines as well as expression of inhibitory and apoptosis proteins. This provides a rationale to directly target CAFs as a strategy to improve CART therapy. BM-CAFs in MM express high levels of fibroblast activating protein (FAP) and CS1 (also known as SLAMF7), and targeting both MM cells and BM-CAFs with dual BCMA-FAP CART cells or BCMA-CS1 CART cells is more potent compared to single-targeted BCMA-CART cells and is resistant to inhibition by BM-CAFs. Our additional preliminary studies demonstrate that a) dual targeting of MM and BM-CAFs by CART cells is safe in preclinical models, and b) targeting FAP can be enhanced through the utilization of BCMA-CART cells which secrete novel FAP-directed proteins. These preliminary data have informed our central hypothesis that resistance to BCMA-CART cell therapy is mediated by myeloma intrinsic mechanisms through the therapy-induced dormant MM cells and TME through CAF-mediated T-cell inhibition."
10799541,"Project Summary
 The goal of this proposal is to study the structure and dynamics of the interaction of the AAA+ ATPase,
valosin-containing protein (VCP) with disease-relevant tau fibrils to determine VCP-mediated disease
progression and therapeutic potential. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are 2 of
more than 20 “tauopathies” characterized by different forms of fibrillar tau aggregates. The degree of tau
pathology on autopsy correlates with cognitive decline, yet the mechanism of neurotoxicity, disease
development, and disease progression in tauopathies remains to be elucidated. Diseases of aggregation
indicate a dysfunction in proteostasis – the regulation and balance of the proteome. VCP plays an essential
role in proteostasis by removing proteins from complexes, membranes, and aggregates such as those formed
by fibrillar tau, thus pointing to VCP as an important player in proteostatic dysfunction and as a potential drug
target for tauopathies.
 VCP has a variety of cofactors that enable it to perform an array of vital cellular. Ufd1 and Npl4
cofactors (UN) together specifically enable VCP to recognize poly-ubiquitinated substrates. AD tau fibrils have
high rates of ubiquitination, likely because cells have marked these fibrils for removal by proteins such as VCP.
Additionally, mutations within VCP are linked to neurodegenerative disease. A hypoactive VCP mutation first
described by the Edward Lee lab clinically presents as dementia and has been shown to promote tau fibril
pathology. The hypoactive VCP mutation is thought to reduce VCP function causing the accumulation of tau
fibrils, leading to neurodegenerative disease. However, a similar mechanism of VCP inadequately clearing tau
fibrils may be present in cases of sporadic tauopathies. VCP/UN, mutant or wild-type, may also get stuck on
tau fibrils (possibly due to fibrils' high stability) and be unable to break down the fibril or be released, reducing
effective VCP function by trapping it on the fibril. This has been seen with a similar AAA+ ATPase in the 26S
proteasome and neurodegenerative aggregates.
 I propose that for productive disaggregase activity VCP/UN binds unstructured ubiquitin at either end of
tau fibrils then pulls off one tau monomer at a time. I also propose the mechanism of action will not change but
the stoichiometry and rate of reaction will change between tau fibrils due to differences in fibril structure and
ubiquitination. To test this model, in Aim 1 I will structurally characterize how VCP/UN interacts with brain-
derived AD and CBD tau fibrils. Structurally understanding how VCP/UN interacts with tau fibrils will help
elucidate the protein regions that are crucial to VCP/UN function, and knowing how this interaction changes
with fibril type will help understand the generalizability of the VCP/UN fibril interaction. In Aim 2, I will
characterize the dynamics of the VCP/UN-tau interaction. Understanding the dynamics of VCP/UN interaction
with these fibrils will further elucidate the mechanism of VCP/UN in relation to disease-relevant tau fibrils."
11194145,"In May 2020, in response to the rapidly expanding pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) launched a program called Digital Health Solutions for COVID-19. The goal of this initiative was to support the development of digital health tools that could leverage multiple data sources, privacy-preserving technologies, and computational tools to assist in managing population health during the COVID-19 pandemic. NCI and NIBIB awarded eight contracts to companies and academic institutions to develop such tools. These projects acquired large amounts of data from a broad set of sources including but not limited to wearable sensors, smartphones, electronic medical records, insurance claims data, and survey instruments. A key aspect of this initiative was to make the data available and accessible to researchers to enable current and future research. MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) was awarded the current contract to establish a data hub for the collected data. Analysis of the data by the broader research community will provide an opportunity to develop and refine predictive models, generating new learnings from the datasets to address the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics."
10698187,"SWAN-Aging will test the relation of midlife health and the menopause transition (MT) to successful aging in women. The Laboratory Services Core (Core 2) provides critical support for addressing the scientific aims of three integrated Projects: Project 1 will evaluate how the MT and midlife health relate to preservation of cognitive function (avoiding cognitive decline and onset of mild cognitive impairment), sleep, genitourinary and sexual function, and quality of life in early old age; Project 2 will test how the MT relates to cardiac health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in women in early old age and test how cardiac health relates to early markers of physical impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia at a critical period in the lifespan; and Project 3 will examine the role of the MT and midlife health on musculoskeletal and physical function. Core 2 will be based at The Clinical Ligand Assay Satellite Services (CLASS) Laboratory which will directly support SWAN-Aging aims by coordinating biomarker assays run at CLASS and at two other labs. CLASS has been the Central Laboratory for endocrine and cytokine assays since SWAN’s inception and has assumed responsibility for creating biosample collection kits, coordination of shipping to and from clinical sites, receiving frozen samples, biobanking, and coordinating or performing all metabolic and cardiovascular assays. Core 2 will provide oversight for all laboratory components and will support the Projects by providing reliable and valid measures of sex hormones (by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectroscopy), cardio-metabolic health (glucose, insulin, lipids, galectin-3), and biomarkers relevant to multisystem aging (IL-10, NTproBNP). Core 2 will coordinate with the Administrative Core (Core 1) and the Data Collection and Data Management Core (Core 3) to ensure the quality of specimen collections and data transfer, and will: 1) Oversee preparation and transfer of 46,500 new specimens collected at clinic visits and retrieve 16,400 stored samples from the Repository; 2) Conduct high quality assays meeting the standards of CAP and Biorepository guidelines, including more sensitive sex hormone assays; 3) Provide assay results to Core 3 in a timely fashion for data cleaning and analysis; 4) Provide leadership on the interpretation of assay results for scientific aims testing relationships of hormones, cardiovascular markers, and cytokines to CVD events, bone health, sleep, psychosocial well-being, physical function, and multiple domains of cognition to detect cognitive impairment (executive and visual-spatial function, language fluency) and the functional impact of cognitive deficits (cognitively demanding instrumental activities of daily living). Rigorous measurement of the proposed markers over midlife uniquely position SWAN-Aging to test novel predictors of changes in physical and cognitive function and the onset of multi-morbidity, disability, and cognitive impairment in women. Identifying remediable risk factors for dementia risk early in the natural history of cognitive impairment is critical to promoting healthy aging and to preventing dementias, including Alzheimer’s Disease and vascular dementia, in women."
10698194,"The overall goal of this U19 application, SWAN-Aging, is to determine the impact of midlife health and the menopause transition (MT) on health and function in women in early old age (66-75 years), a pivotal period when declines in cardiac health and physical and mild cognitive impairment begin to accumulate. SWAN-Aging capitalizes on the rich resources of the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort study that provided seminal information on the MT. By extending follow up of the SWAN cohort, SWAN-Aging can fill critical knowledge gaps by linking prospectively-assessed features of the MT to health and function as women enter early old age. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and a major risk factor for physical impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia in women. CVD has unique features in women, including a role of the MT that is poorly understood. Project 2 will test how the MT relates to CVD events and cardiac health in women in early old age and test how cardiac health relates to early markers of physical impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia risk at a critical period in the lifespan. Early work indicates that multiple aspects of the MT are critical to CVD risk, yet few studies have the extended follow up from midlife to older ages required to test whether the MT relates to CVD. Further, a major form of CVD, heart failure, is an emerging epidemic. It is the leading cause of hospitalization and may increase risk of physical impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia in women. Its female-predominant phenotype, heart failure with preserved ejection faction, is poorly understood. Whether the MT is linked to later heart failure risk, and the role that cardiac function plays in risk for disability, cognitive decline, and cognitive impairment is not known. Understanding the role of cardiac health as a remediable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia early in the natural history of dementia is critical. Leveraging the strengths of the SWAN-Aging cohort, Cores, and Projects, Project 2 will test the relations of the MT to CVD events in early old age, adding a focus on markers of cardiac dysfunction (echocardiographic indices of cardiac function, serial measures of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, NTproBNP) and its links to indices of physical and cognitive impairment. Project 2 aims are to: 1) Test whether the MT predicts cardiac dysfunction, higher NTproBNP across the MT, CVD events, and mortality; 2) Test whether cardiac dysfunction and NTproBNP relate to early markers of physical disability and mild cognitive impairment in women, placing women at risk for disability and dementia; 3) Test racial/ethnic differences in preclinical cardiac dysfunction and its links to early markers of disability and cognitive impairment; 4) Translate findings to women and providers to improve CVD, disability, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia prevention. Findings can inform midlife risk stratification and interventions to reduce CVD, disability, and dementia in women. CVD is the leading cause of death in women and is linked to functional impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia as women age."
10698196,"The overarching goal of the SWAN-Aging U19 is to determine the impact of midlife factors on successful aging, with a specific focus on the effects of changes during the menopause transition (MT) and midlife changes in health indicators on functioning and health in early old age. This period in the life course, ages 66-75 years, is a pivotal time of changing social roles and transitioning into old age, when adverse changes in health as well as physical and cognitive functioning begin to accumulate. A major goal of SWAN-Aging is to assess whether racial/ethnic differences in midlife health and the MT explain racial/ethnic disparities in health and functioning in early old age. The third goal is to translate SWAN-Aging findings to women and health care providers. Project 3 focuses on the role of MT characteristics and MT-related and usual midlife-aging-related changes in health indicators on preservation of musculoskeletal health and physical functioning. Project 3 will also examine the interface between physical and cognitive function, because successful aging and maintenance of independence require relative preservation of both of these functional domains into old age. The specific aims of Project 3 are to: 1) determine and quantify the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of midlife health indicators on maintaining lean mass and muscle strength, minimizing loss of bone mass and increases in fat mass, and preserving physical functioning in early old age; 2) determine and quantify the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of midlife health indicators on avoidance of falls and fractures in early old age; 3) determine and quantify the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in musculoskeletal health and physical functioning in early old age are attributable to racial/ethnic differences in MT characteristics and midlife health indicators; and 4) translate SWAN-Aging musculoskeletal findings to women and health care providers. To achieve these aims, the proposed SWAN-Aging visit (when cohort median age will be 71 years) will include measurement of bone mineral density, body composition, muscle strength, and physical functioning, and ascertainment (with adjudication) of interim falls and fractures. Integrating across Projects, we will describe cardiovascular antecedents (Project 2) of trajectories of musculoskeletal health and functioning; the relationship between cognitive function trajectories (Project 1) and falls; and the relation between physical functioning trajectories and the development of disability and the onset of mild cognitive impairment (Project 1). Estimation of the size of the effects of MT-related and midlife factors on musculoskeletal health and functioning in early old age will inform key targets for prevention and intervention in future studies. Identifying modifiable midlife factors and quantifying their impact on preservation of musculoskeletal health and functioning in early old age as well as understanding the intersection of physical and cognitive function are critical first steps needed for developing and testing targeted screening strategies and early interventions to optimize independence and quality of life in older adults."

The Biospecimen Repository Core is designed to provide support to the basic translational research efforts of
the SPORE in Bladder Cancer. The Core will play a central role in collecting, annotating, storing, distributing,
and tracking urothelial cancer biospecimens (tissue, urine, and blood) from patients enrolled in biospecimen
banking and therapeutic research protocols. Detailed biospecimen annotation, including documentation of pre-
analytic processing variables, pathology findings, and patient clinical history information will be recorded in
robust relational databases. We will conduct rigorous data quality assurance and quality control measures, and
standardized longitudinal follow-up of all consented patients with materials in the urothelial cancer biospecimen
repository. The Core will also provide SPORE investigators with expert histopathological evaluation of tumor
samples both from patients enrolled on research protocols and from xenograft models. The Core will also
provide assistance in performing and interpreting immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization assays, in
selecting tissue for microdissection and construction of arrays. Given the significant morphologic heterogeneity
of bladder cancers, these services require expertise beyond what MSK Pathology Core can provide,
underscoring the importance of the role and input of the Core Directors. The specific aims of the core are:
Specific Aim 1. To maintain and expand a model urothelial cancer resource designed to collect, annotate,
store, process, and distribute biospecimens for translational urothelial cancer research.
Specific Aim 2. To perform systematic pathologic evaluation of all human and animal biospecimens and
preparation of appropriate biospecimens for use by SPORE investigators.
Each of the research projects relies extensively on the Biospecimen Repository Core to achieve their
translational research objectives. For RP-1, the core will aid with the prospective molecular characterization of
urothelial cancers for mutations in DNA damage response genes and will assist with the preparation of tumor
samples for whole-exome sequencing to identify novel biomarkers of cisplatin-sensitivity and with blood and
urine samples for cell-free DNA analysis. For RP-2, the core will provide blood samples and matched tumor for
next-generation sequencing analyses to identify genes, which when mutated are associated with increased
inherited risk for urothelial cancer. For RP-3, the core will provide blood and tissue samples for multi-platform
analyses (PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, T-cell clonality, tumor mutational load, whole exome sequencing
(WES), RNAseq, TCRseq, immunoSEQ and MDSC quantitation) with the goal of identifying predictive
biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint blockade. For RP-4, the Biospecimen Repository Core will
assist in the characterization of xenograft models used to study novel strains of bacillus Calmette-Guérin
(BCG) and with the analysis of samples from patients with urothelial cancer to identify predictive biomarkers of
response to BCG immunotherapy."

The role of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core is to support the investigators of the SPORE in Bladder
Cancer in their research efforts, including laboratory experiments, molecular studies and analysis of clinical
trial and correlative data. Prior to the initiation of all studies, Core staff will consult with SPORE investigators to
discuss the underlying scientific premise and translational goals of the project, to help the investigators select
the most efficient and robust analytical methods, and to estimate sample sizes to ensure adequate power to
address study objectives. In laboratory experiments, Core members will assist in the formulation of the
experimental design and in the analysis and interpretation of the data at the conclusion of the study. For
molecular studies using human tissues, Core members will closely interface with the members of the
Biospecimen Repository Core, and will have primary responsibility for merging molecular and clinical data, and
for performing appropriate statistical and bioinformatics analyses. The members of the Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core will also work with SPORE investigators to format data for publication and assist with
deposition of genomic data into public repositories to facilitate validation of results by external investigators
using their own analytical methods. For clinical studies, they will work with SPORE investigators to help set up
effective systems to collect and track all required data. As the RP studies proceed, Core staff will review
project databases and monitor the quantity and quality of data collected, and they will suggest modifications to
the design and analysis plans as appropriate. When studies are finished, the Core will conduct correct and
efficient data analyses. They will also assist investigators with the preparation of any necessary graphs and
tables, the interpretation of results, the preparation of presentations and manuscripts, and will consult on the
design of subsequent research. If current statistical methodology does not adequately address a research
question, alternative methodologies will be developed. We believe that this experienced and collaborative Core
is well configured to provide the SPORE in Bladder Cancer with a high level of statistical and bioinformatics
leadership and support that will enhance the efficiency, quality, and quantitative rigor of its science."
11196458,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is a standard of care
for the curative-intent treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). This project is based on the
scientific premise that prospective molecular profiling can identify patients with MIBC (cT2-4aN0M0) for whom
transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) and systemic chemotherapy is curative without the need
for RC. It builds upon prior retrospective data demonstrating that 1) deleterious alterations in DNA damage
response (DDR) genes, most frequently in the nucleotide excision repair gene ERCC2, are predictive of
response to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in MIBC and 2) small cohorts of patients who achieve
clinical complete responses to NAC and refuse or are medically unfit for RC survive long-term with their
bladders intact. The hypothesis that select patients with MIBC can be successfully managed with TURBT and
chemotherapy alone, without the need for RC, will be tested in Aim 1 in the context of a prospective,
multicenter clinical trial performed by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (A031701). In this study, pre-
treatment diagnostic TURBT samples will undergo next-generation sequencing analysis of 468 cancer-
associated genes. All patients will receive dose-dense gemcitabine and cisplatin for 6 cycles followed by
clinical re-staging and will be managed with either bladder preservation or RC based upon 1) post-
chemotherapy response as assessed by repeat cystoscopy, TURBT, and imaging, and 2) somatic mutation
status of DDR-related genes in the patient's pre-treatment tumor. Patients with deleterious somatic alterations
in at least 1 of 9 DDR-associated genes who achieve a clinical complete response or down-staging to
noninvasive disease (<cT1) following NAC will be candidates for bladder preservation. Patients with DDR gene
mutations who have ≥cT1 disease after chemotherapy will undergo RC, as will all DDR gene wild-type
patients, regardless of response. Recognizing that ~60% of NAC responders lack somatic DDR gene
alterations, whole exome sequencing will be performed in Aim 2, using the tumor material collected pre-
treatment from all patients enrolled on A031701, to identify additional biomarkers of chemo-sensitivity,
including mutation signatures of DDR deficiency. In Aim 3, we will assess whether analysis of cell-free DNA
from blood and urine is a sensitive, noninvasive method to identify patients with minimal residual disease and
to explore tumor heterogeneity and its relationship to drug resistance and disease recurrence. The proposed
studies rely extensively on support from the Biospecimen Repository and the Biostatistics & Bioinformatics
Core to achieve the project's translational objectives. If successful, the studies proposed could significantly
expand the use of organ-sparing therapy for the curative-intent treatment of patients with MIBC. The
prospective molecular characterization platform used in this project could also accelerate testing of novel
immunotherapy or targeted approaches in patients unlikely to respond to cisplatin-based NAC."
11196462,"Project Summary/Abstract 
Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (ICB) improves overall survival in a subset of patients with metastatic 
urothelial cancer. Atezolizumab, a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) targeting agent, was FDA-approved in 
2017 for cisplatin-ineligible patients with urothelial cancer based on a response rate of 24% and a median 
survival of 15.9 months. However, only a minority of patients responds, and some develop resistance after an 
initial period of response. Though myriad studies exploring the long-term clinical benefits of immune 
modulation in these cancers are ongoing or under development, a mechanistic rationale for novel therapeutic 
combinations in metastatic urothelial cancer is lacking. Research Project 3 (RP-3) seeks to determine, within 
the context of a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, whether the addition of antiangiogenic therapy to 
anti-PD-L1 therapy improves survival in patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. That trial 
is based on the hypothesis that co-treatment with PD-L1 and VEGF-targeting antibodies will have antitumor 
effects by altering the tumor microenvironment, in part by depleting immunosuppressive cell types such as 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Changes in the tumor microenvironment (T-cell receptor [TCR] 
clonality, MDSC levels) and intrinsic tumor factors (tumor mutation load, neoantigen load and clonality, PD-L1 
staining, etc.) correlate with clinical benefit from ICB, but a unified model for optimal clinical decision making is 
lacking. We propose a systematic approach employing a prospective clinical trial, large-scale analysis of blood 
and tumor samples from ICB-treated patients with diverse clinical outcomes, large-scale dissection of 
molecular determinants, and characterization of microenvironmental changes that occur from treatment. The 
objectives of this proposal are to 1) assess tumor and blood immune markers to predict ICB response; 2) 
characterize adaptive changes in the tumor microenvironment on treatment; and 3) identify mechanisms of 
acquired resistance to ICB. The Specific Aims of RP-3 are to compare the efficacy of atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab as compared to atezolizumab alone, while studying biomarkers of response and resistance in 
this context (Aim 1); examine treatment-induced somatic and microenvironmental adaptations in the tumor to 
discover disease-specific targets for combination therapy (Aim 2); and dissect mechanisms of acquired 
resistance in patients on this trial and patients receiving standard-of-care ICB (Aim 3). The goal of these 
analyses will be to develop more robust biomarkers of immunotherapy response, identify rational targets for 
effective combinatorial therapies, and understand acquired resistance to ICB in patients with urothelial cancer."

 2020 – 2024
The goal of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course in Programming for Biology is to
provide biologists with the advanced knowledge and programming tools they need to
deal with the genomic information explosion. Complementary to training in web tools
such as BLAST, this course teaches researchers how to manage, analyze and display
large data sets by creating dedicated programs that combine existing and custom tools
and platforms. This 16 day course begins with an intensive training in Python
programming, including object-oriented programming and the BioPython library. The
second week introduces essential bioinformatics analysis tools and methods, each
accompanied by appropriate programming exercises. We emphasize the design and
implementation of complex analysis pipelines that directly address a biologist's research
questions using practical software engineering and scientific computing methods. The
course combines formal lectures with extensive hands-on laboratories in which students
solve a series of computational problem sets drawn from common scenarios in biology
research and data management. In a three-day final project that solidifies the course's
teachings, students pose real-life problems using their own data and work in groups with
faculty to solve them."
10721820,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The blockade of lymphocyte surface integrins (i.e. natalizumab (α4), vedolizumab (α4β7)) is an FDA-approved
strategy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our understanding of their mode of action is
incomplete and little emphasis has been placed on their effect on B cells. However, a single dose of vedolizumab
in healthy volunteers lowers secretory immunoglobulin (Ig)A (SIgA) and weakens the immunization response to
oral cholera vaccine. To address the role of β7 integrins for the migration, localization and function of B cells in
IBD, we crossed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-overproducing mice (TNFΔARE, which develop Crohn’s-like ileitis)
and IL10-/- (colitic-prone) with β7-deficient (β7-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, double mutant (TNFΔARE/β7-/-) mice
developed accelerated ileitis (earlier onset and worse severity), whereas IL-10-/-β7-/- develop lethal colitis. This
phenotype could additionally be induced by an anti-MAdCAM-1(α4β7-ligand) antibody. The accelerated
phenotypes were not due to a deficiency of retinoic acid-producing αE(CD103)+ dendritic cells, regulatory T
cells, regulatory B cell-derived cytokines or defensins. There was, however, markedly decreased lamina propria
(CD19+) B cells, poor localization of IgA+ plasma cells, luminal IgA deficiency, and differences in microbiota
composition in co-housed siblings. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplants from β7-/- mice induced colitis in
IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that an Ig deficit may allow transmissible proliferation of colitogenic pathobionts.
Thus, there is a critical need to understand whether sustained blockade of integrins or their ligands may have
implications for mucosal immunity. We hypothesize that the acceleration of ileitis and colitis in β7-deficient mice
is mediated by impaired B cell migration and suboptimal IgA transcytosis leading to an intestinal immunoglobulin
deficit and proliferation of pathobionts. To test these hypotheses, we will examine: 1. the role of B cell recruitment
and survival to maintain luminal IgA. 2. How do changes in microbiota composition alter the course and severity
of IBD? and 3. Further examine the role of β7 integrin (i.e., αEβ7) for docking of IgA-producing plasma cells with
epithelium and optimal IgA transcytosis. This investigation is significant as it begins to address the role of B cells
and their unique critical dependence on β7 integrins to home to the intestine and optimally transcytose IgA to
maintain the required IgA levels that control certain pathogenic elements of the microbiota during homeostasis
and IBD. Understanding the role of lymphocyte integrins at the interface between the microbiota and its host
may lead to a better understanding of how do current anti-integrin therapeutics work and even lead to new
interventions to prevent initiation of the dysregulated immune response to the microbiota that triggers IBD."
10687868,"Probiotics have been used to prevent/treat a variety of digestive diseases including alcoholic liver disease (ALD).
Live probiotics need to colonize the gut to exert their function. Unfortunately, underlying disease states provide
an unfavorable environment for probiotic bacterial gut colonization, which diminishes probiotics’ function. In last
few years, we showed that LGG culture supernatant (LGGs, without live bacteria) was effective in the prevention
of ALD in experimental models of acute and chronic alcohol exposure in mice. However, how LGG supernatant
exerts its therapeutic effects is not fully understood. Exosomes are nanoparticles (NPs) derived from cell
endocytosis which act as transmitters between cells. Recent studies show that bacteria, both Gram-negative
and Gram-positive, produce NPs. The NPs derived from “bad” bacteria have been demonstrated to be
pathogenic. However, “good” bacteria-, probiotics-derived NPs have not been studied. Our preliminary study
showed that administration of LGG-derived exosome-like NPs (LDNPs) effectively reversed ALD in binge-on-
chronic alcohol exposure mouse model, suggesting that probiotic LGGs may exert its function through LDNPs
in ALD. LDNPs administration markedly increased intestinal AhR activity, IL-22, regenerating islet-derived 3
(Reg3) beta and gamma expression, which play a key role in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and
preventing bacterial intestinal transcytosis. In addition, LDNPs administration significantly increased intestinal
epithelial cell (IEC) tight junctions and decreased circulating LPS concentration, associated with upregulation of
intestinal Nrf2 signaling, which is known for protecting intestinal barrier junctions against oxidative stress-induced
damage by alcohol. Metabolomic analysis revealed that LDNPs contain high levels of microbial metabolites of
tryptophan, which are AhR ligands, indicating LDNPs may activate intestinal AhR signaling. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that ginger exosome-like nanoparticles (GDNPs) are preferentially taken up by LGG, suggesting
that GDNP may serve as a prebiotic to enhance the effects of LGG. These preliminary studies provide the
groundwork for our central hypothesis that, by activating intestinal AhR-Nrf2 signaling, LDNPs increase intestinal
expression of Il-22, Reg3 and tight junctions, and modulate gut microbiota homeostasis and enhance intestinal
barrier function, leading to the suppression of ALD. We will test our hypothesis in following three specific aims:
(1) Determine the role of bacteria-derived NPs in ALD; (2) Define the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of
LDNPs in ALD; (3) Determine whether ginger-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (GDNPs) treatment enhances
LDNP production and AhR agonist enrichment that lead to improved effects of LDNPs against ALD. Completion
of this study is expected to significantly impact the development of LGG-based probiotic therapeutics in the
treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases."
10799542,"ABSTRACT
The overarching aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy and safety of a highly efficient and personalized
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) method, termed Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT). In this proposal, we will utilize SAINT as a rapid-acting intervention for the
reduction of explicit and implicit suicidal cognition within the context of an emergency psychiatric admission for
suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Although rTMS is FDA approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the
average required treatment application is 6 weeks before signs of symptomatic improvement, which is not an
optimal strategy for symptomatic treatment of an acute suicidal crisis. This application is motivated by three
recent findings in the neuromodulation field. First is a sham-controlled pilot study evaluating an accelerated
conventional rTMS protocol, where multiple stimulation sessions were safely delivered to the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) across three days in patients with suicidal ideation. This study demonstrated that
conventional rTMS can be ‘accelerated’ as well as demonstrated a signal of reductions in explicit suicidal
cognition. Second, there are two notable randomized trials of intermittent theta-burst stimulation applied to the
L-DLPFC that demonstrated the efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) as a treatment for TRD, a
condition commonly associated with suicidal cognition. iTBS has been demonstrated to have 5X the pulse
potency of conventional rTMS, which allows for a much-reduced stimulation session time in comparison to
traditional rTMS and therefore makes multiple treatments per day a feasible intervention. The final innovation is
that rTMS targeting utilizing resting state functional connectivity improves antidepressant outcomes of rTMS. We
designed an approach, which we termed SAINT, which utilizes numerous applications of iTBS per day, as per
principles of spaced learning theory (optimized intersession-intervals), within a functional connectivity derived
target (L-DLPFC-sgACC). In TRD, we have observed dramatic changes in mood and associated explicit suicidal
cognition using SAINT. We propose utilizing SAINT to modulate the neural circuitry that underlies explicit and
implicit suicidal cognition along with moderators/mediators (hopelessness, anhedonia, and depression). We will
conduct a randomized, controlled trial of SAINT applied to the L-DLPFC-sgACC to assess efficacy of the
approach in reducing suicidal cognition in hospitalized psychiatric inpatients."
10848303,"Abstract
With the generation of more than 100 sequenced vertebrate genomes, the current key question is how to
determine the role(s) of uncharacterized gene products in specific biological and pathological processes. For
example, genes associated with human disease are being discovered at a rapid rate, thanks in part to the
development of next generation sequencing technologies. However, the biological functions underlying this
linkage are often unclear, in part because the majority of published work investigates genes encoded by ~10%
of the genome. The overall purpose of this long-standing and collaborative research program is to
develop innovative ways to address this key gap of functional annotation in genome science. For
example, mitochondria have integral functions in metabolism, organ homeostasis, apoptosis and aging. They
also play important but still largely perplexing roles in human pathophysiology, as demonstrated by the
enormous biological variation and diverse disorders in patients with mitochondrial disease that can
compromise nearly every organ system. Over 1100 known nuclear proteins reside in vertebrate mitochondria,
with the majority of unknown biological function or no known role in pathogenesis.
 Deploying loss of function approaches in model systems has been essential to the annotation of the
genome to date from the discovery of novel processes to the biological mechanisms underlying disease.
Among vertebrates, Danio rerio (zebrafish) has emerged as an outstanding and pioneering vertebrate
amenable to both forward and reverse genetic approaches. This funding period will deploy at scale recently
developed genome engineering technologies designed to address these gaps in the field. We will use
Predominant Microhomology-mediated end-joining Allele (PreMA) generation for rapid functional screening
using reproducible allele generation in F0 animals. For those loci with accessible phenotypes, second phase
analyses will follow via GeneWeld large-insert targeted knock-in technology in conjunction with gene-breaking
protein traps for detailed functional annotation of the genome using targeted protein trapping in F1+ stable
lines. Mitochondria are the products of two genomes – the nucleus and from mtDNA. The conservation
between zebrafish and human in the mitochondrial genomes includes nearly identical size and perfect synteny
of all 37 protein-coding and RNA genes. We will also deploy our recently developed zebrafish mitochondrial
base editor to make the first majority heteroplasmy animal models with targeted mutations in mtDNA-encoded
proteins for in vivo functional annotation. We will use this pioneering model organism for mitochondrial
genomic annotation focusing initially on the mitochondrially encoded proteome and at a targeted panel
of vertebrate-specific, nuclearly encoded conserved mitochondrial proteins of unknown function. We
will annotate the functional role of these genes using a rich array of biological, phenotypic and biochemical
tests in this highly collaborative research program. This work will yield 1) Novel tools for rapid PreMA
deployment and new methods for targeted integration of Gene-breaking Protein Trap alleles will be generated
and disseminated 2) New biological and genomic annotation of vertebrate mitochondrial innovations in
development and regeneration including mechanisms underlying genetic compensation 3) Longitudinal
knowledge of mtDNA SNP heteroplasmy maintenance and 4) Complete a unique functional annotation of the
mtDNA-encoded proteome. This combination of novel technologies, annotation and genome science will
establish important new functional information on the role of mitochondria in biology that, when compromised,
underlies disease."

10841700,"Data Science and Analytical Core – Summary
Achieving elimination of mother to child transmission (EMTCT) will depend on successful collaboration of
scientists and practitioners from diverse fields. Essential among these fields are analytical disciplines,
especially epidemiology, biostatistics, and implementation science. These disciplines are dedicated to applying
appropriate conceptual frameworks and analytical methods to ensure accurate measurement and valid
inference in health research. The goal of the Data Science and Analytical Core is to ensure that synergies
across the research projects are realized by collaborating with the investigators and developing capacity to
produce and manage high quality data for evaluating perinatal HIV transmission, ART uptake and adherence,
and PrEP uptake and adherence through the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Develop data management systems and support data management activities for the three
program research projects. The UNC Project Malawi (UNC-PM) has an established data department
responsible for managing data for large NIH funded clinical trials networks, observational cohorts,
Implementation research, and registries. The data department has consistently achieved outstanding
evaluations of all data metrics, while meeting external monitoring criteria. UNC Project has successfully
extracted routine data from MOH electronic databases and paper-based registers and linking the same to
research data when implementing some of its studies.The Data Science and Analytical Core will utilize these
skills to support the projects by designing data collection tools, creating and managing databases, extracting
routine data from MOH databases, and setting up data quality assurance and control systems. Aim 2.
Support analytical aspects of the research projects from design to dissemination. The research projects
proposed in this application are thematically focused on EMTCT but require a broad range of analytical
aptitudes to assess data from diverse sources. All projects require cross-cutting analytical competencies The
Data Science and Analytical Core and UNC-PM affiliated faculty will directly support these analytical needs to
achieve the overall aims. Aim 3. Estimate the effects of the proposed interventions on pediatric and
maternal outcomes and accelerating EMTCT if expanded nationally. The proposed projects involve
implementing novel strategies to accelerate EMTCT in Malawi. We will develop mathematical models to
quantify and compare the effect of these interventions in averting both maternal and pediatric HIV infections,
improving viral load suppression, and increasing retention in care for mother-infant pairs at the national level.
Aim 4. Create a capacity building environment for embedded junior investigators new to data
management and statistical analysis through didactic training and experiential learning. The Core will
host and support the program mentoring activities by providing one-on-one consultancies and didactic training
in data management, research methods, and analysis for mentored clinical investigators and researchers."
10841705,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
New HIV infections during pregnancy and breastfeeding represents the last mile in achieving elimination of
mother to child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV. However, little focus has been directed towards structured,
antenatal care based strategies or interventions to prevent HIV acquisition among pregnant and breastfeeding
women without HIV who receive HIV testing in ANC. Pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) like Malawi face high rates of HIV incidence. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) represents an important
biomedical intervention in the growing fight for EMTCT. With good adherence, daily oral tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) has been shown to effectively reduce new HIV infections and is considered
safe in pregnancy. Despite oral PrEP promise in reducing HIV acquisition, significant implementation challenges
exist that result in poor adherence and losses to follow up. New PrEP options in the form of the recently U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved long-acting Cabotegravir injectable (CAB-LA) offer more effective
and discrete options that may help address issues of poor adherence. However, the safety data in pregnancy
and breastfeeding remain limited for CAB-LA for PrEP. As women conceive while receiving PrEP for HIV
prevention, obtaining pregnancy safety data for emerging PrEP antiretroviral drugs such as CAB-LA is important
before widespread roll out of the drug in national PrEP programs. The overall goal of this project is therefore to
establish and evaluate surveillance and monitoring systems among pregnant and breastfeeding women exposed
to PrEP (oral PrEP and CAB-LA). Investigators will enroll a cohort of women who are judged to be at high risk of
HIV acquisition categorized according to use of oral PrEP or injectable PrEP. In Aim 1, the investigators will
establish a PrEP pregnancy registry into which all women who begin PrEP during pregnancy or who become
pregnant while receiving PrEP will be entered into a PrEP in pregnancy registry and followed up to their
pregnancy outcome. In Aim 2 the investigators will establish a prospective safety cohort of pregnant women with
PrEP exposure. Women will be followed throughout pregnancy and delivery to obtain their birth outcomes. The
mother-infant pairs will be followed up to about 12 months after delivery. For this aim they also evaluate
acceptability of injectable PrEP and daily use of daily oral PrEP and will also determine whether rates of adverse
pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, stillbirth, miscarriages) and other clinical outcomes differ according to PrEP
use status (CAB-LA vs. oral PrEP). Aim 3 focuses on assessing the growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes
among the infants exposed to PrEP during pregnancy. Infants exposed to either oral PrEP or CAB-LA will have
nutritional assessments based on World Health Organization (WHO) approved classifications."
10841709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Impressive progress has been made towards the ambitious goal of eliminating mother to child transmission
(EMTCT) globally. In efficient EMTCT programs with high rates of ART uptake, an increasing proportion of new
infant infections stem from incident maternal infections; in sub-Saharan Africa nearly one third of infant
transmissions are linked to HIV infections that are acquired during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Driven by
physiological shifts and behavioral changes, including resumption of condomless intercourse, the postpartum
period is a particularly high-risk period for HIV acquisition. In Malawi, one-third of all new pediatric HIV
infections are attributed to women who acquired HIV infection while breastfeeding. Improved postpartum HIV
prevention is needed to prevent pediatric infections. One promising HIV prevention opportunity is HIV pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Taken as prescribed, daily oral PrEP effectively prevents HIV and is safe during
breastfeeding. Unfortunately, uptake of and adequate adherence to PrEP among postpartum women in sub-
Saharan Africa, including in Malawi, has been poor. Newer long-acting PrEP formulations, including injectable
PrEP, is a promising and potentially paradigm shifting advance for HIV prevention, offering more discrete and
convenient dosing. However, to maximize the prevention potential of PrEP (oral, injectable, or other), programs
must address shortfalls across the prevention cascade –increasing rates of postpartum HIV testing, reducing
barriers to PrEP initiation, and improving retention in PrEP care by tracing defaulters. This study will test an
intervention that mobilizes an integrated, task-shifting strategy to improve effective PrEP use among
postpartum women in Malawi. Leveraging maternal attendance at early infant vaccination visits, the integrated
intervention deploys effective strategies to increase HIV testing, promote partner engagement, enhance
access to oral or injectable PrEP, and retain women in PrEP care. The intervention uses task-shifting to
integrate HIV testing and PrEP services into infant vaccination visits, and builds on the highly-effective
community-facility linkage model “peers”, expanding tracing to include PrEP defaulters. In Aim 1, investigators
evaluate the effectiveness the integrated “postpartum prevention package” intervention, examining primary
outcome of PrEP persistence at 12 months among breastfeeding women. Secondary outcomes include PrEP
uptake, PrEP adherence, and seroconversions. Aim 2 focuses on implementation outcomes, examining fidelity
to and acceptability of the integrated intervention among postpartum women, a subset of their male partners,
clinic providers, and policymakers. In Aim 3 investigators conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis using
effectiveness outcomes and prospectively collected costs, modelling cost per new PrEP initiation and per
person retained on PrEP. A budget impact analysis identifies drivers of cost, informing Ministry of Health
staffing and implementation. If successful at increasing effective PrEP use and cost-effective, this intervention
can be scaled to other clinics in Malawi and across sub-Saharan Africa."

HIV cure efforts will likely continue to be futile if we ignore the inflammatory mechanisms sustaining the persistence of HIV.
Scientific Premise: A common driver of inflammation for persons with HIV (PWH) is Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which almost universally co-infects PWH. During this coinfection, subclinical CMV replication is frequent and profoundly impacts the immune system, including several CMV-driven mechanisms that promote HIV persistence, even during antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some of these mechanisms could skew the HIV provirus towards preferentially integrating into CMV specific CD4+ T cells.  Also, as CMV specific CD4+ T cells comprise a large proportion of all CD4+ T cells, so understanding how they contribute to HIV persistence would be essential for HIV cure efforts.
Strengths of the proposed research are that it will use state-of-the-art methods and will leverage prior NIH-investments to collect appropriate biospecimens and data as part of an ACTG-funded, randomized trial of the anti-CMV drug letermovir (A5383, Co-chairs: Gianella, Hunt) as well as anti-CMV vaccine Triplex (A5355, Chair: Sara Gianella). 
Study Design: Our project is designed to carefully and rigorously elucidate the CMV-driven mechanisms that impact HIV persistence. Aim 1 will determine how various viral antigens (CMV, Influenza, EBV and HIV) directly induce clonal expansion of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Aim 2 will assess the indirect effect of suppressing CMV with letermovir or vaccine on HIV reservoirs and T cell repertoire in vivo. To clarify mechanistic pathways of ex vivo and in vivo observations in Aims 1 and 2, we will characterize specific immunologic mechanisms associated with clonal expansion and inflammation in association with CMV and HIV persistence.
Overall Objective: HIV cure efforts will likely be futile if we ignore the inflammatory mechanisms that sustain the HIV reservoir. This project is in line with NIH OAR priorities because it will assess the mechanisms by which viral antigens (CMV, EBV, Influenza and HIV) influence HIV persistence through expansion of CD4+ T cells that carry HIV DNA (Aim 1). Further, we will determine the benefits of suppressing CMV to decrease immune dysfunction and HIV cell reservoirs (Aims 2 and 3).
Impact: The proposed project will have meaningful impact by determining how suppressing CMV with letermovir may influence inflammation, immune dysfunction, and HIV reservoirs. Generated results will advance both the HIV cure and PWH health agendas."
10873677,"SUMMARY
Current treatment of HIV-1 infection has changed the face of the disease by converting a once acute deadly
disease to a chronic illness. As such, many other issues have surfaced that require close attention including
comorbidities associated with the presence of the viral genome, as well as the potential side effects of ART on
several tissues and cells including brain that impact on the homeostasis of neuronal cells thus contributing to
neurocognitive and behavioral disorders seen among people living with HIV (PWH). Other areas of concern
relate to social and structural determinants of NeuroHIV disparities in the PWH community. Now, it has become
increasingly clear that the landscape must move toward a cure by employing sophisticated, innovative, next
generation approaches and technologies that are aimed at the permanent elimination of HIV-1 in PWH and
protect uninfected individuals from HIV-1 infection at the cellular and molecular levels. Importantly, a parallel
approach to improve neurocognitive/psychological disorders in the HIV community as well as the use of
molecular strategies for elimination/protection must be implemented to end more than four decades of clinical
challenges caused by HIV-1 infection. By combining resources and expertise of our teams at Temple and Drexel,
we have developed a Comprehensive NeuroHIV Center (CNHC) facility to provide services to scientists from the
greater Philadelphia area and beyond to initiate and investigate the current issues associated with neuroscience
of HIV-1 from community to laboratory and clinic with an emphasis on neuropsychiatric/behavioral (a new area
of emphasis), continued studies on the neuroscience of HIV-1 infection, and the development of cure strategies
at the molecular and cellular levels by the elimination of HIV-1 proviral DNA from the host using a genetic
approach such as CRISPR gene editing-based technologies. We propose that this unique and unprecedented
strategy will have dual benefit in improving current challenges associated with HIV-1 infection in PWH community
and offer new opportunities for the development of a novel approach for mitigation/elimination of viral infection
by a highly collaborative and complementary group of scientists. Our goals remain to provide neuroHIV research
infrastructure and support utilizing and expanding the CNHC's rich clinical neuropsychological data from a
longitudinal cohort of PWH, including primarily Black/African-American and White participants that identify as
non-Hispanic or Hispanic origin well-characterized by deep sequencing and detailed immunophenotyping as
described in the Clinical and Translational Research Support Core (CTRSC), working closely with NeuroHIV
Community Partnership and Disparities Core (NHCPDC) and taking advantage of the expert services offered by
Viral Gene Editing and Bioinformatics Core (VGEBC), together with resources offered by the Cell Biology and
Functional Analysis Core (CBFAC), and the financial and intellectual opportunities offered by the Developmental
Research and Mentorship Core (DRMC). All of which are operationally optimized and orchestrated by the Central
Administrative and Management Core (CAMC) to maximize our achievements."

Globally, cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden is increasing and a major cause of mortality among people with
HIV (PWH). However, data are not yet available from large trials on an effective primary CVD prevention
strategy for PWH. The ongoing REPRIEVE trial will address this critical knowledge gap, hypothesizing that
statin therapy, with pleiotropic effects on LDL, immune activation and inflammatory pathways, will modify
traditional and nontraditional risks and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in PWH.
REPRIEVE is well-positioned to provide high quality, clinically actionable and generalizable information to shift
the current paradigm of HIV care, in alignment with the goals of NHLBI and OAR to reduce CVD and improve
the overall health of PWH. REPRIEVE has met major challenges, anticipated for a large trial. 7,770
participants (31% female, 43% Black, 25% Latino) were enrolled from over 100 sites in 12 countries, a diverse,
generalizable population. Retention is high, >90%. Endpoint (MACE) are accumulating steadily despite a low
median ASCVD risk score of 4.5%, consistent with the hypothesis that nontraditional risks contribute to CVD in
HIV. The Mechanistic Substudy has met its goal, enrolling over 800 participants for serial coronary CT
angiography (CTA) and immune function. Preliminary baseline data from the substudy support our hypothesis,
linking plaque to CVD risk but also independently to IL-6 and Lp-PLA2, key indices of immune function and
arterial inflammation that are being targeted in REPRIEVE. Moreover, REPRIEVE is being leveraged to assess
statin effects on COVID severity, and long-term effects in PWH, critical unanswered questions for the field.
REPRIEVE has executed well over 6 years and is fundamentally strong. However, with a long duration of
recruitment and protocol revisions to identify the optimal at-risk group given new guidelines, median duration of
follow up is still short at 3.5 years. REPRIEVE needs additional time, projected at 2 years, plus a close out
year, to collect necessary MACE to ensure adequate power, analyze, and disseminate this data. The pressing
need for data from a large global primary prevention trial has only grown since REPRIEVE was initiated.
Completion of the trial will protect the value of the initial NIH investment and honor the commitment to our
participants and scientific community to meet the Aims of the trial. This application for the Clinical Coordinating
Center (CCC) of the REPRIEVE Extension for Trial Completion focuses on the clinical rationale and
coordination of the trial. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application focuses on data management,
including the coronary CTA data of the Mechanistic Substudy, and the statistical rationale for the trial design."
10770352,"Veterans with cognitive deficits represent a substantial service and financial burden at the Veterans
Administration (VA). Importantly, even with treatment, these Veterans have severe problems with community
integration, defined as the ability to return to full participation in major life roles (e.g., competitive employment,
school) and supportive social/family networks. Two of the most prominent patient groups within the VA who
have cognitive deficits and poor community integration are those with schizophrenia (SCZ) and traumatic brain
injury (TBI). There is strong evidence that both disorders are associated with impaired neuroplasticity, which is
a key cellular mechanism of cognition. Importantly, several specialized psychosocial and neurostimulation
(e.g., tDCS) treatments that target neuroplasticity and cognition have recently emerged. New neuroplasticity-
focused interventions that improve the cognitive deficits that lead to poor community integration in SCZ and
TBI would highly valuable for the VA healthcare system. However, to evaluate the efficacy of this novel
intervention approach, we need objective biomarker measures that validly assess neuroplasticity and are
appropriate for use in clinical trials in these populations. These tools currently do not exist. This proposal is
designed to address this key treatment development prerequisite. This proposal will adopt a translational
approach and use neuroscience-based methods to objectively assess non-invasive neuroplasticity measures
in Veterans with cognitive disorders (schizophrenia and TBI) and examine relationships to behavioral
measures of cognition and community integration.
Given the highly novel application of these electroencephalography (EEG) measures of neuroplasticity to the
study of SCZ and TBI, we selected the SPiRE small pilot project mechanism. The research aims for this project
are to measure short-term (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) using non-invasive EEG to: 1) evaluate the
feasibility of recruiting Veterans with cognitive deficits (TBI and SCZ), examine tolerability of the EEG-based
neuroplasticity measures, and optimize the paradigms, and 2) evaluate the statistical properties of the
neuroplasticity measures, a necessary step to determine whether they will be acceptable to serve as
biomarkers. In an exploratory aim, we will evaluate the relationships between the neuroplasticity measures and
cognition and community integration. We will utilize paradigms translated from neuroscience studies to
objectively assess neurophysiological measures of neuroplasticity. In the proposed 2-year study we will recruit
a total of 75 Veterans, (25 with schizophrenia, 25 with TBI, and 25 healthy Veterans without cognitive deficits)
from the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare system.
By identifying the role of neuroplasticity as a key determinant of cognition and community integration in
Veterans with cognitive disorders (i.e., schizophrenia or TBI), we will address substantial knowledge gaps in
the root causes of poor community integration in Veterans that make very heavy treatment and financial
demands on the national VA system. This project will help assess objective biomarkers of neuroplasticity that
can be used to gauge the efficacy of interventions targeting cognition in future studies. The results from this
study will help guide interventions that ultimately are aimed at improving community integration in Veterans
with cognitive disorders."
11142746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a novel form of cellular immunotherapy in which the
antigen specificity of T cells is redirected using synthetic receptors. CD19-CAR T cells have achieved complete
responses in up to 90% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, many malignancies do not
possess a single, highly expressed tumor-associated antigen (TAA) such as CD19. Furthermore, CD19-negative
relapses have been frequently encountered following CD19-CAR T cell therapy, suggesting that multi-antigen-
targeting approaches will be needed to reduce relapse. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common
acute leukemia in adults and the majority of patients will die from their disease. We and others are evaluating
CAR T cells to treat AML. However, AML exhibits heterogeneous expression of TAAs and many of these TAAs
are expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), increasing the risk of antigen-negative AML immune
escape and bone marrow toxicity following AML-targeting CAR T cell therapy, respectively. Additionally, AML
employs many active immune-suppressive strategies that may inhibit CAR T cells.
 To overcome these challenges, I have recently developed a novel viral co-transduction and sorting
system to allow generation and purification of T cells with multiple transgenes such as multiple CARs, immune-
stimulating molecules, safety switches, and secreted cytokines. Preliminary data suggest that multi-functional
CAR T cells can be engineered to overcome antigen-negative leukemia escape and immune suppression
mechanisms. I hypothesize that this novel sorting system can be used to engineer T cells to overcome AML
TAA heterogeneity and immune suppressive strategies. Aim 1 will investigate CAR T cells simultaneously
targeting a set of AML TAAs and predicted to avoid toxicity to HPCs. CAR T cells engineered to overcome AML-
induced immune suppression will also be evaluated. In Aim 2 the goal is to target a set of TAAs expressed by
both AML and HPCs as part of a pre-transplant CAR T cell immunotherapy strategy.
 During the award period, the candidate will conduct research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
under the mentorship of Dr. Marcel van den Brink and an Advisory Committee. He will obtain the critical skills he
needs to become a tenure-track physician-scientist running his own academic laboratory developing synthetic
biology approaches to improve cellular therapies and successfully competing for independent NIH funding. He
will cultivate a detailed and comprehensive skill set for syngeneic, xenograft, and humanized mouse models of
cellular immunotherapy, build upon an existing knowledge base of molecular construct design and cellular gene
modification by mastering multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruptions and site-specific gene integration, and
develop proficiency in genomic analysis to better define T cell activation and exhaustion states and to identify
novel targets for gene therapy."
10685289,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: High-grade astrocytomas (HGA) are rare incurable cancers (combined
USA prevalence < 30,000) with few treatment options. Mayo Clinic is collaborating with Wayshine Biopharma
to develop WSD0922-FU (WSD) (IND 145566) – a novel oral, small molecule orphan drug which potently
inhibits EGFR aberrations specific to high-grade astrocytoma (HGA) (EGFR amplification, EGFRvIII mutation).
Our central hypothesis is that safe and tolerable doses of WSD achieve sufficient tumor concentrations in HGA
to inhibit EGFR signaling and improve efficacy in patients with EGFR-amplified / EGFRvIII HGA. This is being
examined in a first-in-human phase I basket trial which is the subject of this three-year R01 submission to the
FDA (“Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-Tumor Activity of WSD0922-
FU”). The investigators have broad clinical trial experience in early drug development and neuro-oncology.
Early input on trial design was obtained from patient advocates to ensure study feasibility and to reduce patient
burden. We expect that study completion will advance available treatments for HGA with EGFR alterations by
establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for WSD, while generating critical data on central nervous
system (CNS) PK (pharmacokinetics), impact on tumor EGFR signaling, preliminary efficacy and relevant
genetic biomarkers of response/resistance. These data will provide robust evidence to optimize phase II/III trial
design, which may lead to a new indication for WSD in HGA. The central hypothesis is evaluated in three aims:
Aim 1: Evaluate the safety, tolerability and systemic PK of WSD at MTD. Patients with EGFR-amplified /
EGFRvIII HGA or non-small cell lung cancer with CNS metastases will be treated with WSD in a dose
escalation cohort to define the MTD and evaluate the toxicity profile of WSD. Plasma PK will be quantified by
LC-MS/MS to evaluate systemic exposure. A dose expansion cohort will also include a food-effect study prior
to starting continuous dosing. Plasma PK will be quantified in both the fed (WSD dosed after a high fat meal)
and fasted states (WSD dosed one hour before or two hours after eating) to evaluate the effect of food on
systemic PK. Aim 2: Evaluate intratumoral PK of WSD and assess its pharmacodynamic (PD) impact on EGFR
pathway signaling in HGA. Patients with EGFR-amplified / EGFRvIII HGA requiring a therapeutic surgical
tumor resection as part of routine clinical care will preoperatively be dosed with WSD at MTD. During surgery,
tumor tissue will be collected and flash frozen. Tumor PK will be quantified by LC-MS/MS and PD impact on
EGFR pathway signaling will be evaluated by functional proteomics. Aim 3: Characterize the molecular
biomarkers which influence efficacy of WSD in patients with EGFR aberrant HGA. Patients with EGFR-
amplified / EGFRvIII HGA will be treated continuously with WSD at MTD and monitored for treatment efficacy.
Plasma PK will be quantified by LC-MS/MS to confirm sufficient exposure. DNA/RNA sequencing will be
performed on archived tissue to evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance (e.g. EGFRvIII, TP53, etc.)."
10907744,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY
 2 Two percent (2%) of all 120 million annual emergency department (ED) visits in the United States undergo computed
 3 tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for pulmonary embolism (PE) every year. However, many of these are
 4 avoidable. Unnecessary testing subjects patients to additional costs, ionizing radiation, and risk of anaphylaxis from contrast
 5 media. Further, because false positive CTPAs are common (estimated at 5-26%), overdiagnosis and overtreatment are
 6 growing problems in the United States. Despite guidelines recommending the reduction of low-value imaging for PE, the
 7 volume of unnecessary imaging studies for PE in US EDs continues to rise, exposing patients to harm from overtesting and
 8 overdiagnosis. Prior strategies have attempted to close this knowledge-practice quality gap but only had modest success,
 9 possibly because changing provider behavior is challenging and most initiatives focused on isolated strategies. We propose
10 to develop, pilot, and evaluate a multi-dimensional `enhanced' audit-feedback strategy (EAF) to de-implement low-value
11 imaging in PE. The core strategy, audit-feedback, was chosen to target drivers of low-value imaging in PE discovered in
12 our foundational work: knowledge, peer pressure, emotion, and belief about consequences. We designed the strategy using
13 a novel audit-feedback theory, the Clinical Performance Feedback Intervention Theory (CP-FIT). The audit-feedback is
14 `enhanced' by complementary strategies to assist in action planning and empower clinicians to change their behavior. This
15 includes an aid for appropriate testing that guides clinicians through an unambiguous algorithm for evaluation of PE, an
16 educational podcast, and local champions. In Aim 1, we will develop, refine, and operationalize the de-implementation
17 strategy components. We will conduct cognitive testing of the prototypes of the audit-feedback reports, develop an
18 electronic health record (EHR)-integrated aid, record the educational podcast, and identify and train local champions. In
19 Aim 2, we will pilot alternative versions of the EAF strategy in 5 EDs to evaluate acceptability and appropriateness. We
20 will alter the delivery of the components of feedback (local champion versus departmental chair), educational podcast (with
21 or without a real patient narrative), and the aid for appropriate testing (static versus EHR-integrated aid) to ascertain the
22 acceptability, appropriateness, and added value of these iterations. We will pilot different versions of the strategy to evaluate
23 aspects of CP-FIT including complexity, social influence, and actionability, which CP-FIT suggests drive the audit-feedback
24 cycle and, ultimately, behavior change. We will use mixed methods to evaluate the strategy and select a refined strategy for
25 a multi-center trial. In this K23 application, we have proposed a detailed career development plan in which I will gain
26 methodological and technical expertise in advanced implementation science strategies, methods, and trial design. I am well
27 supported by an experienced team of mentors and advisors. At the end of this mentored career development award, I will
28 have a robust empirically-derived and theory-informed strategy and will be positioned to test this strategy in a multi-center
29 trial as an independent investigator.

10895520,"Project Summary/Abstract: Computational Pathology for Proteinuric Glomerulopathies
The presently employed morphology-based classification system of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
and minimal change disease (MCD) does not adequately capture the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of
these diseases and impairs the ability of clinicians to precisely define a patient’s disease, or predict outcome or
effective intervention. The goal of this research is to advance the work of the glomerular disease research
community by identifying biologically-relevant surrogates and subclasses of FSGS/MCD using computational
pathology and machine learning methods. Prospective, longitudinal, multi-dimensional data sets that include
digital kidney biopsies and molecular and clinical information can be analyzed by advanced “computer vision”
methods and machine learning analytical approaches. This project will employ these rich resources and
methods, which offer an unprecedented opportunity to leverage information derived from kidney tissue to
improve the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and identification of glomerular disease mechanisms.
The interdisciplinary team assembled to conduct this study has vast experience and a long-standing history of
collaboration. In our preliminary studies we have demonstrated that (i) structural changes associate with
outcomes and molecular mechanisms and improve clinical outcome prediction beyond current clinical
approaches, and that (ii) computer vision technology can be used to accurately and efficiently detect normal and
abnormal kidney structures and quantify textural (i.e., the spatial relationship between pixel values) and
morphological (i.e., shape, size) information from kidney tissue.
We will test our central hypothesis that inherent in the complexity of the structural changes in the renal
parenchyma is information predictive of underlying disease biology and clinical outcome. We will pursue this
hypothesis (1) by testing the clinical and molecular relevance of automatic detection and quantification of known
morphologic biomarkers of clinical outcomes and mechanisms and of groups of patients with similar DL-derived
morphologic characteristics; (2) by extracting next-generation pathomic features from DL-derived morphologic
parameters and by testing their associations—individually and combined into pathomic profiles—with clinical
outcomes and gene expression; and (3) by building machine learning-based models that integrate computer
vision-derived pathology data with gene expression and clinical data to predict individual patient clinical
outcomes, and to assess the additive prediction value of each data domain. Finally, we will group patients using
the biomarkers identified to be most predictive of clinical outcomes. Ultimately, our work will contribute to a
foundation for the deployment of a comprehensive artificial intelligence-guided precision medicine program for
FSGS/MCD, applying descriptive, predictive, and ultimately prescriptive analytics as support tools for practicing
pathologists and nephrologists."

With urban environments the fastest growing landscapes on the planet, transmission of vector-borne diseases by urban adapted mosquitoes has increased markedly over the past several decades. Urban vectors include Anopheles stephensi, the mosquito responsible for urban malaria across South Asia. Elimination of malaria in South Asia, and preparedness against its further expansion into Africa, hinges on effective action against the disease in cities. We know temperature has strong, non-linear effects on malaria transmission. Although relative humidity also has important effects on malaria epidemiology, its quantitative effects on transmission are vastly understudied and often treated as independent from temperature. Because these relationships are currently not well understood, we have limited capacity to predict the emergence, spread, and control of malaria in urban environments. Our overarching hypothesis is that humidity affects urban malaria transmission by modifying the temperature-transmission relationship. Further, incorporating the effect of humidity will improve predictions of malaria transmission and hot spots of malaria risk in both temporal and spatial models of transmission. Our proposed research will address this knowledge gap through the following specific aims.
Aim 1 will investigate the effects of humidity on the temperature-malaria transmission relationship. Comprehensive experiments will be conducted to characterize the effects of both relative humidity and temperature on mosquito and malaria life history traits relevant for transmission. These experiments will be validated over a subset of conditions in India with the local vector and local strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax. These mechanistic relationships will then be integrated into temporal and spatial models of malaria epidemiology in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will formulate and parameterize a temporal coupled human- mosquito transmission model used to predict the seasonal and interannual variation in malaria incidence and vector abundance. Aim 3 will implement a spatial model to predict transmission risk and incidence across urban environments by using meteorological observations with urban land cover data to map environmental suitability for malaria transmission. Suitability maps will then be overlaid with population density and socio- economic factors to predict hotspots for transmission. Two cities in India, Surat and Ahmedabad, experience notable differences in mean annual relative humidity and have maintained extensive surveillance malaria programs over the last two decades. These two cities will provide contrasting opportunities to test the ability of the climate-trait relationships from Aim 1 to improve transmission models of urban malaria. Major outcomes include an improved conceptual framework for the environmental epidemiology of urban malaria based on mosquito biology, and new modeling approaches that apply this knowledge to make predictions of disease transmission. Prediction of upcoming anomalous seasons combined with identification of hotspots will enhance targeted public health intervention."

683,000 women are sexually assaulted annually in the US, half of whom develop chronic posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). Women with sexual assault-related PTSD are at markedly increased risk for cannabis use
disorder (CUD), a public health problem affecting 13 million Americans and contributing to the >$200 billion US
annual costs of substance use. Indeed, in an observational study of 706 women sexual assault survivors, half
had clinically significant PTSD and reported cannabis use. Those with comorbid PTSD-CUD have more severe
presentations and worse treatment outcomes than either condition alone, underscoring the need for preventive
interventions for PTSD-CUD. 100,000 women annually seek emergency care after sexual assault and are offered
preventive interventions for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, but not the more common sequelae
of PTSD-CUD. Addressing the critical unmet need for preventive interventions for PTSD-CUD after sexual
assault would reduce the public health burden and personal suffering associated with these conditions. Anxiety
sensitivity (AS; fear of anxious arousal) is a malleable risk factor that prospectively predicts PTSD among sexual
assault survivors in pilot data, may underlie the PTSD-CUD comorbidity, and can be reduced with brief digital
therapeutics that lead to reductions in PTSD and CUD. Theoretically, and in our pilot data, AS causes PTSD
symptoms to be interpreted as threatening and to be avoided, leading to substance cravings and use to dampen
physiological arousal measured via electrodermal activity (EDA). Specifically, cannabis is commonly used as an
anxiolytic after sexual assault among those with high AS, but unfortunately can lead to the adverse effects of
comorbid PTSD-CUD on symptoms and outcomes. The proposed K23 will leverage smartphones and an
established research network of emergency care sites for sexual assault to provide a digital therapeutic targeting
AS (based on a validated cognitive behavioral treatment) and conduct biobehavioral assessments of
mechanisms underlying targeting AS to reduce PTSD-CUD. Aims are to test acceptability, initial efficacy, and
mechanisms of an AS digital therapeutic to reduce PTSD-CUD compared to a relaxation control. Women
presenting for emergency care after sexual assault (total N=78) will complete assessments at the emergency
visit and 1 week, then will be randomized and complete their assigned interventions. Outcomes and mechanisms
will be assessed by ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/EMI), a wearable assessing EDA
over 6 weeks, and via 6 week and 6 month self-report follow-ups. In this context, the applicant will receive training
in the design and conduct of preventive multi-site emergency care-based RCTs, advanced statistical analysis
for RCTs incorporating EMA, and biobehavioral assessments of mechanisms underlying PTSD-CUD prevention,
setting the stage for an R01 definitive mechanistic clinical trial and launching her independent research career
focused on reducing the public health burden of PTSD-CUD after sexual assault using digital therapeutics."

The Wisconsin NCORP (WiNCORP) is a consortium of three established healthcare systems in the state of Wisconsin with
a long-standing history of excellence in oncology care – Marshfield Clinic Health System, Gundersen Health System, and
ThedaCare. Through a network of hospitals, clinics, and other facilities spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper
Michigan and adjacent counties in Northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota, WiNCORP institutions collectively
provide care and access to oncology clinical trials to a predominantly rural population. Member sites participate in
numerous NCI-sponsored clinical trials and are active in NCORP research base committees, NCI task forces and steering
committees, research networks, and organizations with a focus on improving cancer care. Investigators from each
system are consistently recognized by the NCI and/or the research bases for their accrual totals, and WiNCORP has been
designated as a high-performing site over the previous grant cycle. Through the work of multidisciplinary care teams and
research staff, WiNCORP will continue to leverage its collective expertise to open numerous cancer care delivery
research (CCDR) trials. With a shared mission to provide patient access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials, WiNCORP
members are well-positioned to increase patient accruals from historically underrepresented populations in clinical trials
such as rural, elderly, and low-income individuals, enhance cancer care delivery, and reduce disparities in cancer burden
across the region. To achieve this goal, WiNCORP leadership has outlined four specific aims for the consortium: 1)
Conduct NCI Phase I/II, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment,
imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery
Research (CCDR) across our integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research
infrastructure. 3) Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. 4) Incorporate a new patient population and
provider group in the WiNCORP consortium that currently has no access to CCDR studies. These specific aims will be
accomplished by expanding communication channels between patients and WiNCORP members, streamlining the
process of site opening for various clinical trials, enhancing resource sharing among member sites, enhancing
community engagement in clinical trial participation, and continual enhancements and developments in infrastructure
and personnel to open and accrue patients to a variety of clinical trial types. It is anticipated that WiNCORP-wide efforts
in staff education, clinical trial feasibility assessment, harmonized internal processes, synchronized regulatory support,
development of system and trial-specific standard operating procedures, and collaboration among investigators from
the three consortium sites will create a synergy that will further enhance clinical trial conduct, efficiency, and quality."
10901895,"Advances in healthcare, and effective public health campaigns to disseminate cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) and portable defibrillators, have doubled the survival rate for cardiac arrest (CA) in the last decade (from
16% to 33%). Patients whose hearts stop beating for many minutes are now resuscitated, kept in a medically
induced coma, and have their bodies cooled to 89°- 93°F (to reduce brain damage), resulting in many more CA
survivors returning to full lives. However, CA patients remain at markedly elevated risk for major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM), and many report poor health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) in the year after CA--despite returning to independence (and often to work) with cognition intact.
We propose that cardiac anxiety (i.e., cardiac specific-fear, avoidance behavior, and excessive cardiac symptom
monitoring) may partly explain MACE/ACM risk and poor HRQOL. It is highly prevalent in CA patients and
has been shown in non-CA cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to be associated with higher rates of CVD-
related distress, avoidance of physical activity, patient-reported disability, and poor perceived health.
We will build a prospective cohort of CA survivors, comprehensively assess cardiac anxiety and other
psychological and behavioral consequences of CA in the first year of survivorship, and estimate the association
of cardiac anxiety, physical activity, and sleep with subsequent MACE/ACM and HRQoL. We will enroll a
cohort of 246 CA inpatients, assess psychological and HRQoL measures at enrollment, and by telephone at 1, 6,
and 12 months. We will assess physical activity and sleep by actigraphy for 2-weeks after discharge and again
for 2 weeks before a 6-month follow-up and follow participants for 12 months to MACE/ACM. This would be
the first major prospective cohort study of CA survivorship, and the first to objectively assess health behaviors.
For our Aim 1, we will estimate the prospective association of cardiac anxiety at CA discharge with subsequent
risk for CVD/mortality after adjusting for general psychological distress and other significant clinical covariates
and test its independent association with HRQoL. Our second aim is to test whether cardiac anxiety after CA is
associated with low physical activity and/or short sleep shortly after discharge. Physical activity (PA) and sleep
are implicated in CVD risk and chronic disease progression, but no study has assessed PA or sleep in CA
survivors. Our pilot data suggest that survivors of other acute cardiac events report avoiding physical activity
because it causes threatening physiological signals (i.e., increased heart rate, shortness of breath), and poor
sleep due to cardiac anxiety. Lastly, our third aim is to quantify the extent to which low PA and/or short sleep
after CA predict MACE/ACM, and mediate the association between cardiac anxiety and 12-month MACE/ACM
post-discharge for CA. By identifying malleable intervention targets for improving both CVD/mortality risk and
post-CA quality of life, this study could ignite the development of the first generation of CA survivorship
interventions."
10851677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The circadian clock, an ancient, evolutionary conserved timing system required for optimal function of organs
and organismal lifespan, is active in peripheral tissues, including the skin. Clocks in peripheral organs are
coordinated by the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but we also know that time-restricted feeding
affects circadian clocks, gene expression, and homeostasis in peripheral tissues. Although new insights are
emerging, especially from studies in metabolic organs like the liver, the interplay between feeding time, clocks,
and tissue health in epithelia is unclear. In particular, we don't know how time-restricted feeding affects the
regenerative function of epidermal stem cells and skin aging. In mice, the circadian clock coordinates progression
of the cell cycle and DNA excision repair with intermediary metabolism, as reflected in the redox state of
epidermal stem cells. Intriguingly, daytime-restricted feeding shifts the phase and decreases the amplitude of
the skin circadian clock, and it shifts the expression of the metabolism-related transcriptome without altering the
phase of the diurnal oscillations in DNA synthesis. Daytime-restricted feeding, then, disrupts the coordination
between metabolism and cell cycle progression in epidermal stem cells. Whereas these cycles in epidermal stem
cells are known to modulate the sensitivity to UVB-induced DNA damage, their role in homeostasis of epidermal
stem cells remains otherwise unknown. Here, we will investigate the idea that the clock coordinates oscillations
of metabolism-generated ROS levels with the cell cycle and the DNA repair machinery to maximize the health
and function of epidermal stem cells. Specifically, we hypothesize that this regulation minimizes metabolism-
generated ROS when most epidermal stem cells are undergoing DNA replication, the cell cycle stage most
sensitive to oxidative DNA damage. This hypothesis predicts that daytime feeding-induced circadian
misalignment in epidermal stem cells causes asynchrony between oxidative metabolism and the cell cycle,
leading to increased ROS-induced DNA mutations, epidermal stem cell dysfunction, and skin aging. To test this
hypothesis, we propose two aims. First, we will define the gene-regulatory mechanisms underlying time-
restricted feeding modulation of the circadian clock and metabolism in epidermal stem cells. Second, we will
determine how time-restricted feeding modulates epidermal stem cell function and affects the rate of age-
associated DNA mutations in epidermal stem cells. The proposal is significant because it tests a new model of
how the circadian clock coordinates the timing of intermediary metabolism and the cell cycle in epithelial stem
cells to minimize the accumulation of somatic DNA mutations, and how time-restricted feeding can enforce or
disrupt this coordination. The proposal is innovative because it pursues a new idea about the role of dietary
intervention and the circadian clock in skin aging, and it uses state of the art approaches, including duplex DNA-
sequencing, fluorescence lifetime imaging, and single cell RNA-sequencing--approaches not previously applied
to skin aging."

 Over the past 18 years, we have published a series of articles demonstrating that human NK cells have

10695942,"Obesity and the ensuing cardiovascular and diabetic complications are a major medical concern in the
Veteran population as approximately 35-40 percent of the Veterans are classified as obese. Activation of
brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the browning of white adipose tissue are among the many strategies
under consideration for weight loss and improvement of insulin sensitivity. Secretory phospholipase A2
group IIa (PLA2G2A) has been studied with respect to inflammation and anti-bacterial actions. However,
the role of this phospholipase in metabolism is not known and that has been the subject of our recent
investigations. PLA2G2A is a member of a large family of secretory phospholipases (sPLA2). PLA2G2A
hydrolyzes fatty acid molecules from the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release a free
fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. We have used C57BL/6 mice expressing the human PLA2G2A gene as
a model to explore the impact of PLA2G2A on metabolism. Surprisingly, we discovered that the mice
expressing PLA2G2A were resistant to weight gain when fed a high fat diet and remained highly insulin
sensitive. In addition, these mice had an elevated metabolic rate due to the activation of uncoupling protein
1 (Ucp1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this application, we will investigate the mechanisms by which
PLA2G2A promotes mitochondrial uncoupling in BAT and enhances insulin sensitivity. Our overall
hypothesis is that PLA2G2A generates eicosanoids or lysophospholipids which enhance BAT
mitochondrial uncoupling in human and mouse brown adipocytes. We propose to determine the impact of
BAT specific expression of PLA2G2A and Pla2g2a knockout on metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity. We
will identify the lipid mediators generated by PLA2G2A and determine their role in BAT metabolism. Finally,
we will delineate the signaling mechanisms by which PLA2G2A activates BAT. These studies are very
novel as few studies have been conducted on the contribution of any secretory PLA2 family member to
energy expenditure. We will define new regulatory pathways in brown adipose tissue metabolism. The
proposed work will have a high impact since elevating the metabolic rate has great potential to reduce
obesity, cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance. These are conditions commonly found in aging
Veterans."
10720885,"Background and Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the
United States, with nearly 150,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths annually. Colonoscopy with polypectomy
remains the gold standard for CRC screening and surveillance since removal of neoplastic polyps during
colonoscopy modifies disease outcomes and informs subsequent management. Standard practice
continues to favor removal of all visualized polyps for histopathological assessment, despite estimates that
nearly half of the polyps are non-neoplastic. Studies have shown that the capability to reliably predict polyp
pathology endoscopically in real time could result in substantial improvement in the cost-effectiveness of
colonoscopy for CRC. The number of colonoscopies performed is increasing, and in the VA more than
doubled in a five-year span. This demand does not include subsequent procedures required in ~30% of
screened patients. Thus, colonoscopy can benefit greatly from efficiency improvements at every level. In
light of this, the past decade has seen an explosion in advances in endoscopic technologies toward
diagnosing and treating colorectal neoplasia more precisely. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in the field of deep learning, and their application to endoscopic imaging, have shown promise
for automating endoscopic polyp pathology predictions, overcoming operator-based polyp pathology
assessment factors such as interobserver variability, skill, and experience. Such capability would finally
open the door to widespread adoption of cost-saving resect-and-discard and leave-behind paradigms for
diminutive polyps, as proposed by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Preservation and
Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations guidelines. More importantly, the incorporation of AI-
based quantitative image interpretation into clinical practice, including in the VA, has the potential to
increase early cancer detection thus reducing patient morbidity and mortality. To this end, the main goal
of the proposed study is to leverage AI, specifically deep learning models, to develop an accurate and
robust computer aided diagnosis (CADx) platform to enable the purely endoscopic, optical assessment of
mucosal pathologies, specifically colorectal polyps. In parallel, the use of AI models to assess colonic
mucosal and luminal features known to inform colonoscopy quality will be investigated.
Methods: The study will be guided by three aims. In Aim 1 robust classification models for predicting polyp
pathology will be developed. Labeled images and clinical data, from existing datasets and clinical records,
will be used to design and validate deep learning models. The design will consist of two steps: outlining
regions in an image containing a polyp, and subsequent analysis of the polyp region to provide a pathology
prediction. Borrowing from aspects of augmented reality, the pathology prediction along with the estimated
polyp boundary, will be presented to endoscopists in an intuitive and clinically friendly manner as a pseudo-
color overlay, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of the models output predictions. This
immediate visual feedback can thus inform clinical decisions during colonoscopy. Aim 2 will focus on using
clinical risk factors associated with colorectal neoplasia in combination with endoscopic imaging data to
enhance predictions of polyp pathology. The goal is to investigate incorporation of recognized CRC clinical
risk factors and biomarkers, obtained from patients’ electronic health records, in our polyp pathology
prediction deep learning models. Finally, in Aim 3 the deep learning-based detection, segmentation, and
classification frameworks developed in Aim 1 will be adapted for scoring bowel preparation, recognizing
cecal landmarks and rectal retroflexion, identifying colonic diverticula, and delineating endoscopic tattoo
markings. These features are associated with performing of high-quality colonoscopy, for which automated
identification could improve and facilitate documentation of endoscopic findings and report generation."
10831378,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal will support the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular
Events in HIV Trial (REPRIEVE) Extension for up to two additional years, with an additional year for study
close-out. This additional time is necessary to collect the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
required to ensure adequate power to address the primary aim of REPRIEVE, to determine the efficacy of
statins as a primary cardiovascular prevention strategy in HIV. Completion of the trial will protect the value of
the initial NIH investment and leverage existing REPRIEVE infrastructure, with its data analytical and oversight
structures. This DCC proposal is a companion to the REPRIEVE Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) proposal.
REPRIEVE is a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, pragmatic trial investigating the efficacy of statins
for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (primary endpoint) in 7,770 persons with HIV
(PWH) without known CVD and with low to moderate CVD risk as per the 2013 ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort
Equations, (referred to as ASCVD risk). To understand the biology of statin effects, 805 participants were co-
enrolled in an embedded mechanistic substudy that will determine the effects of statins on non-calcified plaque
volume and high risk plaque morphology using coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA), as well as
on blood biomarkers of vascular inflammation and immune activation after 4 months and two years. Further, in
response to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, REPRIEVE will address critical knowledge gaps regarding the
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-related CVD complications among PWH, and determine
the protective statin effects for COVID disease across the globe.
In the proposed extension, the REPRIEVE DCC will continue to provide methodological and logistical support
for the collection, quality control, and analysis of data including rigorous, timely, and independent adjudication
of potential MACE events. Furthermore, the DCC remains responsible for statistical design and analysis,
assistance in protocol development, data management, CTA data acquisition and interpretation, biospecimen
analysis, and electronic communications."
11077190,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them
to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance
on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to
independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.
 However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and
requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis
(e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely
inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.
 The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with
their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance
of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for
a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional
(2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose
an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to
issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower-
dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by
the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover
fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.
 The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine
interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body
motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control
signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify
which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2.
The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred
to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for
the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.
 At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body
motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor
skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our
application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform."
11094474,"Project Summary/Abstract
The liver is now recognized as an immunological organ with unique properties. Its immune response is tightly
controlled to ensure immune tolerance to microbial, dietary, and metabolic products flowing from gut to liver
through the portal vein. However, certain risk factors induce hepatic immune dysregulation, resulting in the
development of liver disease. A high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFS), a typical Western-type diet (WD), is
identified as a major risk factor contributing to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
ranging from simple steatosis to the advanced form of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Given dietary
changes worldwide, NAFLD is rapidly becoming the leading cause of liver disease affecting 25% of the
population worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that the HFS and gut microbiota interaction generates a
spectrum of dietary and microbial components and outcome metabolites that can induce inappropriate hepatic
immune activation, suggesting a key role of the Diet/Gut/Liver/Immune axis in NASH . However, the underlying
mechanisms are poorly understood. Furthermore, very little is known about the specific microbes and
metabolites that regulate intrahepatic immunity. To address these major knowledge gaps, the investigators
have developed a NASH model by feeding wild-type mice with a choline-low HFS (CL-HFS) (0.05% choline)
which closely approximates a typical WD in composition. This model is characterized by gut dysbiosis,
metabolic disarray, abnormal hepatic immune response, and liver-resident macrophage (MΦ) and hepatic
stellate cell (HSC) activation, reflecting typical pathologic properties in human NASH patients. Using the model,
the investigators demonstrate that selective suppression of gut microbiota preventively and therapeutically
inhibits CL-HFS-induced NASH. Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses in combination with in vitro and in
vivo experiments identified Blautia producta (B. producta) and its product 2-oleoyglycerol (2-OG) as an
unrecognized bacterium and metabolite contributing to CL-HFS-induced abnormal hepatic immune response.
Of particular clinical relevance, enrichment of gut Blautia and high levels of hepatic 2-OG are found in human
NASH patients. Mechanistic studies suggest that 2-OG primes MΦs via G protein-coupled receptor 119
signaling, subsequently activating HSCs. These exciting results support the hypothesis: CL-HFS, B. producta,
and 2-OG, by activating MΦs through GPR119 signaling pathways, cause hepatic pathogenesis and HSC
activation. This hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine MΦ as a cellular basis of CL-
HFS-induced NASH pathogenesis mediating crosstalk between gut microbiota, HFS, and liver; Aim 2:
Determine GPR119 as a molecular basis of MΦ mediating hepatic pathogenesis induced by CL-HFS, B.
product, and 2-OG. This study will dissect the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms to advance the
understanding of the role of the Diet-Gut-Liver axis in hepatic immunity, which will advance the development of
dietary and microbial interventions that therapeutically suppress this global health threat."
10694219,"Project Summary. In New Jersey, there are significant cancer disparities across population groups that are
also underrepresented in the cancer research and healthcare workforce. To reduce cancer inequities there is
a need to train youth from disparate population groups to pursue cancer research and healthcare careers. The
goal of this program at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (RCINJ) is to increase the diversity of the
biomedical, specifically cancer research workforce. To achieve this goal, we will: 1) provide mentored cancer
research experience and curriculum development support to high school teachers working with students from
underrepresented backgrounds; 2) engage high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented
backgrounds in mentored hands-on cancer research, co-curricular and professional career development
activities; and 3) develop innovative cancer related outreach activities that connect program participants with
schools and families in their communities. Cohorts of science teachers will engage in mentored cancer
research for eight weeks each for two consecutive summers (sixteen weeks total). Experts in curriculum
development will support teachers in developing novel instructional approaches that are related to their
research experience. Cohorts of students will have the opportunity to conduct mentored cancer research for
ten weeks each for two consecutive summers (twenty weeks total). Students will receive co-curricular and
professional development support throughout their research experience. Participants will engage in research
and program related activities for 3 months per year for two years. We will recruit program participants from all
over New Jersey with special emphasis on school districts with high percentages of students from
underrepresented backgrounds. Faculty members with active, well-funded research programs and extensive
mentoring experience will support participants. Experienced leadership team with track-record of developing,
implementing and evaluating pipeline programs for students from underrepresented backgrounds, will ensure
successful implementation of the program. Both formative and summative evaluation by an external evaluator
will be integral parts of the proposed program. We will annually track the educational and professional
activities of trainees for at least 15 years after completing research training. We will disseminate results from
the comprehensive evaluation on the program web site. Additional dissemination will occur through articles
published in peer-reviewed journals and through presentations at regional and national conferences, by
program staff as well as participants. Our program will leverage the multi-disciplinary research environment,
robust educational and outreach resources of RCINJ, the state’s only NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer
Center. Synergistic collaborations with similar initiatives across Rutgers will ensure that the program succeeds
in training the next generation of a diverse cancer research and healthcare workforce."
10765602,"Risk for dementia, including late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia, is
determined by a complex mix of environmental, health, and genetic factors. Veterans have
higher rates of vascular problems, PTSD, combat trauma, and traumatic brain injuries, which
have all been linked to increased rates of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia.
Further, studies have indicated that these Veteran-relevant exposures may interact with AD
genetics to further increase the risk of cognitive decline. This application represents an
outgrowth of a project examining dementia and combat related gene by environment (GxE)
interactions in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), one of the world’s largest electronic-medical
record (EMR) linked biobanks. The original 2-year MVP Gamma project (MVP015) generated
working definitions of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and all-cause dementia from the VA
EMR. These were examined for association with combat exposure, head injury, and PTSD in
aging Veterans. We found evidence that head injury, combat, PTSD symptomatology, and AD
genetic risk variants were all associated with self-reported cognitive difficulties and MCI in
Veterans as young as 45-55, and with AD and related dementias in those age 65+. We
additionally identified GxE interactions between candidate variants in several genes and
combat/head injury on MCI and AD risk. In this application, we propose expanding on the initial
study, by 1) performing a genome wide association study (GWAS) of Dementia cases and
controls in multiple ancestry groups as well as examining the performance of GWAS-based
genetic risk scores in African American and Hispanic MVP participants, 2) performing
multivariate GxE analyses examining a range of Veteran relevant health exposures, 3) Further
developing and validating dementia diagnoses in MVP for genetic analyses including a machine
learning based method of identification of Dementia cases. This project will expand on our
continuing work and increase our knowledge of the impact of Veteran specific environmental
exposures and their interactions with AD genes on risk for AD and dementia."
10721818,"Several current tumor immunotherapies (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and tumor vaccine) are designed to boost
endogenous tumor-specific T cell responses. To improve the efficacy of current immunotherapies and benefit
more cancer patients, it is urgent to advance our knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying the response of endogenous tumor-specific T cells. Importantly, a subset of antigen-specific CD8+ T
cells have been identified as stem cell-like or progenitor-like, which are the ones responding to both PD-1/PD-
L1 blockade and tumor vaccine. However, we know little about how these stem-like T cells respond to tumor
vaccine.
Along a different line of research in mouse acute infection models, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) have
been identified as a unique population of memory T cells. In contrast to other migratory T cell subsets, TRMs do
not re-circulate and reside inside a particular tissue (mostly non-lymphoid tissues) for an extended period. We
and others have established a critical role for TGF-b in the establishment of TRM after acute infection. Our
preliminary findings have demonstrated that tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) function as a unique reservoir
to host stem-like tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Surprisingly, a substantial portion of these TDLN stem-like T cells
adopt a TRM phenotype in a TGF-b-dependent manner. Further, we have discovered that wild type TDLN stem-
like T cells rapidly, but transiently lose TRM phenotype after tumor vaccine. In contrast, TGF-b receptor deficient
TDLN stem-like T cells carry significantly reduced TRM phenotype at baseline and exhibit greatly enhanced and
prolonged response to tumor vaccine. The enhanced response in TDLN is translated into increased migration
from TDLN to tumor and better tumor control for TGF-b receptor deficient CD8+ T cells. Importantly, inhibition of
T cell migration completely abolishes the response to tumor vaccine for TGF-b receptor deficient CD8+ T cells.
Together, our results support a working model that a significant portion of stem-like T cells differentiate into TRM
inside TDLN and will not migrate to tumor site. Loss of tissue-residency is required for stem-like T cells to
differentiate into migratory effectors and elicit robust response to tumor vaccine. Suppression of tissue-residency
in TDLN (e.g., deletion of TGF-b receptor or TGF-b downstream molecular targets) will greatly boost the
differentiation and migration of stem-like T cells, which will lead to better tumor control in response to certain
tumor immunotherapies. In current proposal, we will directly test whether targeting TGF-b or TRM-signature will
boost the migration of stem-like T cells and therefore enhance the efficacy of tumor vaccine as well as local
irradiation released endogenous tumor antigen.
Together, our proposal is primarily focused on the TRM biology of stem-like CD8+ T cells during tumor
immunotherapies, with a special emphasis on TDLN. Our results will have great translational potential to use
TGF-b inhibitors and TRM-targeting strategies as a “universal adjuvant” for tumor immunotherapies. In addition,
our investigation will facilitate the communication between seemly distinct research areas, namely TRM, stem-
like T cells and tumor immunotherapies, which will cultivate novel therapeutic interventions in the near future."

10813113,"PUERTO RICO PREGNANCY RISK ASSESSMENT MONITORING SYSTEM (PR-PRAMS):
COMPONENT A CORE SURVEILLANCE
The major goal of PR-PRAMS is to collect data representative of PR’s population on health status,
maternal attitudes, behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during, and after pregnancy, in
order to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. This will allow for informed decision
making, resource allocation, policies, and systems changes that support effective programming
of services for women and infants, resulting in public health impact and improvements in
population health. The study objectives are: 1) To implement population-based surveillance in
PR on selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during, and shortly after
pregnancy among women with a recent live birth, including emerging issues and post-disaster
surveillance needs, as they arise; 2) To ensure data is of high scientific quality and comparable
to other jurisdictions by following the methodology documented in the CDC PRAMS protocol; 3)
To conduct comprehensive analysis of PR-PRAMS data based on an analysis plan designed to
inform programmatic activities, research and implement public health practices in PR; 4) To
translate and disseminate research analytic results into practical and useful information for public
health action in PR that can guide program development and evaluation, in collaboration with the
PR-PRAMS Steering Committee (SC). PR-PRAMS will follow a standardized data collection
methodology that allows for comparisons with other states and for optimal use of the data for
single-state analysis. The survey will include core, standard and state developed questions,
according to gaps in data identified for PR. PR-PRAMS methodology combines two modes of
data collection: a mailed questionnaire and telephone interviews with follow-up attempts. Each
month, a stratified sample is drawn from the Vital Statistics (VS) data file and the sequence of
contacts is attempted. A questionnaire will be mailed 2 to 4 months to sample selected women
who have recently delivered live born infants. The data collection cycle takes 60 to 95 days.
PR-PRAMS has been implemented since 2016. During the first four (4) years of implementation
of the cooperative agreement, PR-PRAMS has met all its goals and objectives. Staff is already
in place to continue operations. The project’s infrastructure is operating efficiently, reaching a
63% response rate in 2017, 80% in 2018 and 81% in 2019. A SC is organized to continue
providing input on questions selection, development of State Analysis Plan (SAP) and translation
and dissemination of data. PR-PRAMS data is being used to monitor PR national performance
objectives for Title V block, and has served to benchmark select performance measures to
demonstrate the impacts of Title V on health outcomes. The data collected is also used to support
emerging issues and other priorities in Maternal and Child Health (MCH), and to evaluate and
sustain public health efforts, develop plans, and training. Data is being disseminated through
different forums to a variety of stakeholders to raise awareness on maternal and child health
issues. The expected outcomes of the survey are: 1) Produce timely, high quality data
representative of the jurisdiction’s population to monitor risk factors for maternal and infant health;
2) Analyze and disseminate PRAMS data on a variety of MCH topics to inform public health
programs, research and system changes, and health care system changes; 3) Document efforts
to translate data into useable information for public health action; 4) Make PRAMS data available
to stakeholders including public health agencies, clinical providers, health systems, and
researchers for studies to inform knowledge gaps in maternal and infant health."
10749867,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Antimalarial drug resistance has repeatedly thwarted global efforts to treat and control malaria. Chloroquine,
the former gold-standard drug, earlier succumbed to parasite strains harboring mutations in the Plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, PfCRT. Now, artemisinin-based combination therapies have
failed in Southeast Asia, driven in part by novel PfCRT variants that confer resistance to the first-line partner
drug piperaquine. Resistance to other partner drugs including amodiaquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine can
be conferred by variant forms of PfCRT or the ABC transporter PfMDR1. Our R37 AI050234, funded since
2001, has substantially advanced research in this area including: publishing definitive evidence that PfCRT
mutations are the primary determinant of chloroquine and piperaquine resistance; attributing resistance to
PfCRT-mediated drug efflux; solving the PfCRT structure; defining fitness costs and physiological effects that
impact the spread of resistant alleles; globally mapping pfcrt and pfmdr1 variants across the globe; and
characterizing PfMDR 1-mediated multidrug resistance. Since our prior submission in August 2017 we have
published 23 articles including in Nature, Nature Microbiol, Lancet Infect Dis, and Cell Chem Biol. Our R37
MERIT Extension application proposes to advance this with four new Specific Aims. Aim 1: Define whether
mutant PfCRT can mediate piperaquine resistance in African strains. We will determine whether PfCRT
mutations that cause piperaquine resistance in Asian parasites will similarly confer resistance in African
strains with regionally distinct PfCRT isoforms. We will also assess the impact of these isoforms on other
antimalarials and on parasite fitness. Aim 2: Define genetic determinants that function epistatically with PfCRT
to mediate resistance. Using our recent P. falciparum genetic cross, we will positionally map and characterize
genes that are coinherited with mutant PfCRT in chloroquine- and/or quinine-resistant progeny and determine
whether these determinants augment resistance or have evolved to offset fitness costs. Aim 3:
Identify PfCRT-specific inhibitors that can reverse drug resistance. We propose to screen diverse chemical
libraries to identify compounds that block the efflux of chloroquine or piperaquine in drug-resistant parasite
lines. Assays with pfcrt-conditional knockdown parasites and recombinant PfCRT will test for compounds that
can bind this transporter, block efflux, and restore drug potency. Aim 4: Solve the PfMDR1 structure and
define its drug efflux properties compared with PfCRT. Following our recent success with PfCRT, we
propose to solve the PfMDR1 structure using cryo-electron microscopy. We will also perform binding and
transport assays with purified recombinant protein to characterize the resistance properties of PfMDR1
variants. This proposal, which aligns with the NIAID priority of supporting research on antimicrobial drug
resistance, will substantially advance our understanding of antimalarial resistance and yield biomarkers
and new strategies to counter drug-resistant malaria."
10725112,"Project Summary
Recent investigations have revealed that oncogenic mutations are not sufficient for initial stages of tumorigenesis
and that the microenvironment plays a significant role in promoting neoplastic growth of a tumor. This
microenvironment surrounding a mutated cell can be influenced by many promotion processes, including
environmental exposures, tissue damage, and chronic inflammation. This proposal aims to investigate the
mechanisms by which promotion, or non-mutagenic processes, can influence the selection of mutant clones
which eventually populate a tumor. This project will rely on theories from cancer genetics, tumor promotion, and
evolutionary cancer biology in order to provide insight into the coordination between promotion and oncogenic
mutations present in a cell. Through the use of a well-established model of chemical carcinogenesis, this project
will address a fundamental question regarding the molecular consequences of tumor promotion. This
carcinogenic regimen can produce both Hras mutant tumors and Kras mutant tumors, merely by adjusting the
genetic background of the mouse. This provides the ideal tool for us to ask the question, what are the different
promotion mechanisms which select for tumors with different mutations? To address this question, the proposed
project aims to characterize promotion mechanisms on the backgrounds of the mice which are known to produce
tumors with different mutations. The first aim will investigate how macrophage infiltration during promotion
coordinates with oncogenic Hras signaling. This will be addressed by computationally identifying signaling axes
between macrophages and epithelial cells from skin collected at different time points after application of a
promoter. The second aim will define the active functional modules in the Kras-tumor-permissive skin, in
response to a promoter. This will be achieved by constructing gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA
sequencing of skin collected subsequent to promoter treatment in the skin. The proposed research will be
completed by a graduate student with significant experience in both cancer biology and computational biology.
It will be supervised by and conducted in the lab of Allan Balmain, an expert in the field of skin cancer genetics
and tumor promotion. This training plan takes advantage of the highly collaborative and innovative research
environment in the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, which facilitates access to renowned
scientific mentors and guidance in the proposed work. At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the
graduate program in Biomedical Sciences is regarded as one of the best due to its inclusion of professional
development and training resources offered, which will support this highly motivated student to develop an
independent research career. Completion of the proposed work will thus expand knowledge on a critical question
in cancer biology and is enabled by an excellent institutional environment. Understanding how oncogenic
mutations can coordinate with tumor promotion mechanisms in the mutant cell’s microenvironment will provide
novel insights towards early detection and prevention strategies for cancer."
10977449,"SUMMARY
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are composed of abnormal connections between arteries and veins
that lack an intervening capillary network. As a result, high-pressure blood from feeding arteries shunts directly
into veins. These vascular lesions become distended and highly remodeled, resulting in a tangle of enlarged
blood vessels that are prone to rupture. Indeed, bAVMs are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke in children
and young adults. All current treatment modalities for bAVMs, including surgery, embolization or radiation carry
a significant risk of disability or death, and these options are not available for ~20% of bAVM patients due to
excessive risk. Because of these complications, alternative medical strategies with lower morbidities such as
targeted pharmacological therapies are desperately needed. However, we first need a clear understanding of
the biology underlying bAVM development and maintenance. The majority of bAVMs occur sporadically without
a family history of the disease. Using whole exome sequencing, we recently identified somatic, activating
mutations in the KRAS gene, which encodes a GTPase that is involved in signal transduction. The identified
mutations were confined to the endothelium and result in KRAS being locked in a GTP-bound ‘ON’ state. Notably,
we have established mouse and zebrafish models of endothelial-specific expression of mutant KRAS, which
have revealed the sufficiency for these genetic lesions to drive disease. We have gone on to demonstrate,
through transcriptional profiling of cultured cells and in vivo studies in zebrafish expressing mutant KRAS, that
many KRAS-induced molecular and cellular changes require MEK/ERK activity. Much remains to be learned
regarding the etiology of sporadic bAVMs and our cell culture, mouse and zebrafish models will enable us to
define the molecular, cellular and morphological changes that are involved in the initiation and maintenance of
bAVMs. We will utilize our expertise in animal models of bAVMs, imaging, cell biology, signaling and single-cell
RNA sequencing, to gain unprecedented insight into the bAVM disease process. This information will be
leveraged for the design of pharmacological interventions to improve patient outcomes. Our proposal will: 1)
define the threshold of KRAS mutant endothelial cells that can remodel vessels, 2) identify the vascular bed(s)
that are susceptible to active KRAS expression, 3) determine how KRAS mutations impact hemodynamic
signaling and bAVM progression, 4) uncover the cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms of
mutant KRAS, and 4) determine the requirement for KRAS and MEK activation for bAVM maintenance in our
pre-clinical models. Together, these studies will expand our understanding of bAVM pathogenesis and will

10817070,"Abstract
This R25 application seeks renewal of the national Diversity in Addiction Research Training (DART) program
(DA020537-16; formerly the Drug Abuse Research Training program), designed to address the persistent
scarcity of physicians and diverse clinical researchers engaged in addiction research. Greater diversity cultivates
robust learning environments, promotes a broad array of ideas and perspectives thereby enhancing innovation,
and promotes culturally competent care to help eliminate racial/ethnic health disparities in addiction. The DART
program was initiated in 2006 at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) with a primary focus on
psychiatry residents and has since expanded to include a vibrant summer research program, which enrolls
trainees from national and international institutions at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical student
educational levels. DART provides an intensive core research training curriculum including a weekly seminar
series, mentored hands-on research experience, an individualized training plan, and formal near-peer mentoring.
To date, 220 trainees have enrolled in DART and retention is excellent (only one trainee has dropped out).
Program evaluation data demonstrate that the majority of trainees remain engaged in research post-DART, and
trainees have been highly productive, generating 575 conference presentations and 353 manuscripts. During
the next five years, we will significantly expand and innovate the DART program and enhance the diversity of
trainees and faculty through new partnerships with external residency programs. We have established new
partnerships with Howard University and the University of Virginia, and plan to expand to additional residency
programs during the renewal period. In addition, we have assembled an outstanding Advisory Board comprised
of 16 diverse (67% underrepresented racial/ethnic minority [URM] faculty and 72% women faculty) and highly
accomplished researchers, educators, and leaders in the field from 14 different institutions who will bring
exceptional talent and diverse experiences, viewpoints, and areas of expertise to the DART program by providing
input, seminars, mentoring, and one-on-one career advice. We have augmented the curriculum in the areas of
(a) opioid use disorders, (b) remote/virtual clinical trials, and (c) health disparities in addiction, supported by
collaboration with the NIDA Office of Diversity and Health Disparities. During the renewal period, we aim to enroll
122 trainees with at least 50% or more URM trainees. Dr. Colleen Halliday, a faculty member at MUSC with
expertise in racial/ethnic disparities in substance use and mental health outcomes, joined the DART Leadership
Team in 2020 and will help guide targeted recruitment efforts to further enhance trainee diversity. This application
aligns with the NIH UNITE Initiative to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomedical workforce and is
directly responsive to the new NIDA Racial Equity Initiative to increase racial/ethnic diversity within the addiction
research community and address critical research gaps on health disparities in addiction."
10885897,"Stroke induces a cascade of neurophysiologic changes in cortical and spinal circuits that result in 
biomechanical gait impairments (reduced paretic propulsion, footdrop) and gait dysfunction (reduced speed). 
While increasing gait speed is a major goal of stroke gait rehabilitation, targeting walking speed as a primary 
gait rehabilitation outcome without regard to biomechanical and neural mechanisms fails to meet the emerging 
standards of precision medicine, which is the future of rehabilitation research. Thus, here, we will confirm a 
novel theoretical framework regarding neurobiological (top-­down) and biomechanics (bottom-­up) 
mechanisms of how 2 gait treatments improve walking speed post-­stroke. Fast treadmill walking (Fast), a well-­
studied and clinically-­used intervention, improves gait speed. However, Fast-­induced speed improvements in 
people post-­stroke may occur at the cost of inter-­limb asymmetry, energy inefficiency, and maladaptive 
neuroplasticity. Recent work has demonstrated that combining Fast with functional electrical stimulation 
(FastFES) not only leads to improvements in gait speed but also reduces energy cost (EC) of stroke gait. 
Because reduced EC is crucial for sustaining faster gait speeds and promoting community activity, 
biomechanical factors influencing EC post-­stroke merit more in-­depth study. Building upon knowledge gained 
from previous FastFES work and our preliminary data, Aim 1 will test our hypothesis that in contrast to Fast, 
FastFES promotes greater use of the paretic leg for forward propulsion, thereby improving inter-­limb 
biomechanical asymmetry, which we hypothesize reduces EC. Gait rehabilitation essentially involves retraining 
the central nervous system. Our lack of understanding of neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying gait 
interventions continues to be a barrier to improving gait rehabilitation outcomes. Aim 2 will determine, for the 
first time, if and how FastFES and Fast modulate excitability of neural circuits impacted by stroke and 
implicated in locomotor control. Stroke leads to decrease in lesioned motor cortex (M1) excitability and 
corticospinal tract (CST) output, and elevated spinal reflex excitability. New findings from our lab suggest that 
unlike Fast, FastFES enhances lesioned CST and M1 excitability, restoring more normal CST output. FastFES 
and Fast also differ in their effects on spinal excitability. Like most gait treatments, Fast and FastFES must 
contend with high inter-­individual variability in treatment responses (a subset of participants are “non-­
responders”). Aim 3 will address whether baseline measures or short-­term changes in neurophysiological 
biomarkers (CST and spinal excitability) can predict long-­term training-­effects. Results from our mechanism-­
focused clinical investigation will elucidate how, why, and for whom Fast and FastFES induce clinical benefits. 
The overall impact of this work will be future development of cutting-­edge gait treatments that are individually-­
tailored based on neurobiological, biomechanical, and clinical characteristics to improve both gait quality and 
gait function, well-­aligned with the NICHD mission of improving health through ‘optimal’ rehabilitation."
10754499,"Approach: We propose to continue our study of how the human transcription factor CR
E
M (cAMP
responsive element modulator) contributes to the innate immune response to protect from colitis due to
E
ntamoeba histolytica and further explore its role in inflammatory bowel disease. Successful completion
of these studies will identify how and where CR
E
M acts to guard against bowel injury from amebiasis, and
link the findings to inflammatory bowel disease.
Significance: The importance of this project derives from the contribution of amebiasis to diarrhea in
children in the developing world and to the estimated one million Americans who suffer from IBD.
Understanding how CR
E
M protects may provide new approaches to the currently imperfect treatments of
amebic colitis and IBD.
Progress: The past 3.5 years of R37 support advanced the unde rstanding of amebic colitis and resulted in
8 publications, including the identification of CR
E
M as a susceptibility locus for amebiasis, demonstration
of microbiome to bone marrow communication via the secondary bile acid deoxycholate in resistance to
amebiasis, and the role of innate lymphoid cell type 2 in directing a protective type 2 innate response to
the parasite. Additional discoveries include human genes influencing susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis
and shigellosis.
Innovative aspects of the proposal include that cAMP-regulated gene expression has not previously been
considered to contribute to defense of the intestine.
The environment for the work is Dr. Petri's parasitology lab (UVA) with ongoing investigation of amebiasis
in humans, murine models and at the cellular level, and the human genetic epidemiology program of Dr.
Duggal (Hopkins) and the now twenty year collaboration between Drs. Duggal and Petri that has resulted
in 21 publications.

InSight Surgical Technologies, LLC, is a start-up founded by senior members of a long-standing NIH-funded
research effort to develop intraoperative image updating that maintains accurate image correspondence with
the surgical field throughout a procedure. The effort has led to research innovations that have generated an
intellectual property (IP) portfolio of 13 issued and 8 pending patents. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of new
algorithms for assembling multiple intraoperative stereovision (iSV) acquisitions into a composite field-of-view
and accomplishing iSV-to-MRI registration/re-registration, and conversion of existing iSV algorithms for 3D
surface reconstruction and calibration in graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated forms. Additionally,
Phase I results obtained during resection of a large animal (swine) brain tumor indicate this model is a superb
system for testing and validating InSight’s complete image updating system, I2UpdateTM, in vivo in Phase II.
Specifically, we will leverage Phase I results to automate I2UpdateTM fully, and demonstrate its technical
performance and clinical functionality under quality systems sufficient to meet regulatory requirements. Specific
aims will (i) develop a fully-automated, GPU-enabled processing system for intraoperative image-updating
(I2UpdateTM), (ii) complete verification testing and pre-clinical in vivo validation of I2UpdateTM, under quality
system controls sufficient for supporting regulatory filings at the end of Phase II, and (iii) conduct a multi-site
clinical-use study with I2UpdateTM under non-significant risk in patients undergoing brain tumor resection.
Successful completion of Phase II will produce the I2UpdateTM product platform as a finalized commercial
GPU-enabled software system with concomitant design control, software validation, procedural use and quality
systems, accompanied by in vivo animal validation and multi-site, multi-surgeon use demonstrating clinically-
relevant and acceptable image-updating performance in terms of automation, computational efficiency and
registration accuracy."

The overarching long-term aims of VERITY are: 1) to develop state-of-the-art methods for clinical research in
rheumatology and musculoskeletal diseases that are relevant for the Research Community, 2) to deliver
methodologic and bioinformatic assistance to the Research Community, and 3) to train the Research
Community in state-of-the-art methods through courses, seminars, and mentoring. During the last cycle,
VERITY recruited a large and growing Research Community of rheumatic and MSK disease investigators who
participate in courses, mentoring, and utilize the services of the three VERITY Cores. The Overall Section of
the application describes: the progress and future directions for VERITY’s burgeoning Research Community;
how VERITY has developed and delivered courses to respond to the Research Community’s needs, especially
during the COVID pandemic; plans for future courses and mentoring of trainees and junior faculty; and the
services offered and organization of the Methodology Core and the Bioinformatics Core. During the previous
cycle, VERITY developed a diverse Research Community that has included many junior faculty and trainees, a
good number of pediatric rheumatologists, and an increasing group of MSK investigators. These researchers
represent the tremendous diversity of clinical investigators engaged with NIAMS-focused topics. In addition,
the large group of investigators helps provide the Cores with a steady stream of activity and resources.
During the prior cycle of the BWH CCCR, VERITY helped produce 160 original articles already cited 1,287
times. These original articles appeared in high impact journals. The VERITY Research Community has
been successful with 109 grant submissions during the last 4+ years, tabulating a total of $40,073,225
in annual direct research revenues. The three Cores have been extremely productive and learned much
about working effectively with the Research Community. The proposed aims build on the prior successes with:
an enhanced Enrichment Program increasing the focus on URiM researchers in rheumatology; a Methodology
Core that ensures methodologic rigor while incorporating behavioral theory and economics into studies
focused on racial and ethnic minorities; and a Bioinformatics Core that provides bioinformatic support to better
phenotype patient cohorts, allowing for studies of social determinants of health."

10827944,"Prostate cancer has the highest estimate of heritability of any cancer, with 58% of variability in prostate
cancer incidence attributed to inherited genetic factors. Genome wide association studies have validated 269
single nucleotide polymorphisms that are strongly associated with prostate cancer risk. We found that a
multiethnic polygenic risk score (PRS) combining these SNPs demonstrate a 9-fold difference in risk of
disease comparing men with high vs. low PRS in a both Black and White men. This proposal aims to translate
this prostate cancer PRS into clinical practice by addressing four important questions: 1) Can the PRS be
integrated with other tools including MRI and rare genetic variants in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways as
part of an early detection strategy to identify clinically-relevant, potentially lethal prostate cancer? 2) At what
point in a man's life should an early detection program begin if he is at increased genetic risk? 3) What is the
optimal interval of imaging to detect clinically relevant cancer in men at high genetic risk?
 This collaborative U01 proposal addresses these issues in three specific aims. Aim 1 - we will prospectively
determine the ability of a prostate cancer PRS integrated with MRI to identify higher-grade, potentially lethal
prostate cancer. We will recruit 1500 men (600 Black, 900 White) from the MGB Biobank, the Walter Reed
Biobank, and the primary care network at Howard University and Brigham & Women's Hospital. All men will be
stratified into low, average, and high risk on the basis genotyping. PSA, MRI, and DDR variants will be
obtained followed by biopsy for elevated PSA or abnormal MRI. We expect to find the PRS identifies a
population at risk for prostate cancer while the DDR variants and MRI identifies a subset with clinically relevant
disease. In Aim 2, we will evaluate at what point in a man's life an MRI is clinically useful. Our population will
be imaged across 5 year age groups from 40-69 years. In addition, men at the high genetic risk without cancer
will undergo serial MRI imaging at the NCI at 2 year intervals. In Aim 3 we will determine if deep learning
methods applied to mpMRI and informed by genetic risk can more accurately predict significant cancers.
 This will be the first in field prospective trial to integrate germline genetics with MRI to identify men at risk of
clinically-relevant prostate cancer. The results will have short-term impact by establishing an optimal early
detection algorithm and show the utility of incorporating information on the germline into an early detection
strategy. It will establish the role of MRI in detecting clinically relevant cancers among those with high genetic
risk. The longer-term goal will be to use the knowledge gained to design trials of the at-risk populations with
longer follow-up to prove that genetic testing can improve our ability to prevent prostate cancer mortality
through targeted screening and prophylaxis. Importantly, men at low risk for clinically significant disease could
be spared screening, prophylaxis and treatment. This information can be directly translated into patient
populations. An additional strength of this proposal is the inclusion in racially diverse patient populations."
11138263,"Cardiac fibrosis is a grim consequence for almost all myocardial injuries. In myocardial infarction (MI),
what starts as a protective scarring process to prevent ventricular wall rupture becomes a pathological
remodeling of the tissue with the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Eventually, this
adaptation impedes the mechanical and electrical properties of the myocardium resulting in heart failure.
Recently, we showed that periostin (Postn) expressing cells that arise from resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs)
are a potential therapeutic target since they differentiate into the scar associated, matrix-producing cell-type
after MI injury. In fact, deletion of these cells after an acute MI injury eliminates interstitial fibrosis but results in
ventricular rupture which is a hallmark outcome of impaired ECM deposition during the acute phase of MI.
However, if we delete these cells during a chronic injury such as pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis
model, we detect sustained perivascular fibrosis. Previous studies also report heterogeneity of origin and
function for ECM-producing cells associated with different cardiac diseases.
 Consequently, our inability to identify cell- and state-specific therapeutic targets render cardiac fibrosis
yet an incurable disease. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine the cellular composition and functional
heterogeneity within ECM-producing fibroblasts. Until very recently, the main limitation has been the inability to
accurately interrogate and manipulate the activities of different CF sub-populations differentiated from cells,
including pericytes, endothelial cells, resident inflammatory cells in vivo given a lack of cell type-specific
genetic tools. Recently, we and others have generated several novel genetic tools that now allow us to
investigate all of the matrix-producing cells and their activated forms. Utilizing these new genetic tools in
lineage tracing, gain-of-function, and loss-of-function studies, we will interrogate and determine the origin and
function of all ECM-producing cell types as well as the molecular mechanisms that regulate CF sustained
pathological activation and differentiation after acute or chronic disease models in mice. Our recent work where
we effectively interrogated Postn expressing CF lineage in comparison to Postn negative CFs in a single-cell
RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles between these two populations.
Depending on the injury type, such as hearts subjected to MI, TAC, or Angiotensin induced fibrosis, we
observed differences in ECM components as well as cellular composition. Finally, our preliminary data showed
here identify another cell lineage that involves perivascular fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that
pathological ECM deposition resulting in fibrosis comes from disease-specific specialized sub-populations of
CFs with distinct gene expressions. The following aims will rigorously interrogate CF subpopulations and the
molecular mechanisms that regulate CF activation and ECM composition."
10684226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have an initial robust response to combinations of DNA damaging
agents (e.g. cisplatin, etoposide, radiotherapy), however, many patients inevitably suffer from relapse and
resistant disease. A clear understanding of these resistance mechanisms remains elusive. Consequently,
there is a critical need to: (1) understand the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and (2) develop novel
therapeutics.
Poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase enzymes (PARP) protein levels are upregulated in SCLC relative to other lung
cancers, and initial studies suggest that this upregulation is associated with increased sensitivity of SCLC to
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in vitro. PARP inhibitors are synthetic lethal with BRCA1/2 mutated homologous
recombination (HR) deficient tumors and restoration of HR by BRCA reversion mutations is a known
mechanism of PARPi and cisplatin resistance. However, as BRCA1/2 mutations are exceedingly rare in
SCLC non-BRCA mechanisms must be operant.
We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify novel mechanisms of PARPi resistance.
From subsequent functional validation and clinical genomic correlation, we identified deficiency in an F-box
protein coding gene as a putative biomarker of resistance to PARP inhibitors and cisplatin in SCLC that may
be present in up to ~20% of relapse patient tumors. Loss of this F-box protein abrogates the function of its
corresponding SKP1, CUL1, F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. By proximity-dependent biotin
identification (BioID) of this F-box protein, we have identified a high confidence interactor with substrate-like
behavior for SCF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation that is important for regulation of HR and DNA
repair.
This proposal aims to: (1) determine the mechanism of this specific SCF complex with its substrate to engage
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; (2) elucidate the impact of this F-box protein on HR, DNA repair, and
therapeutic sensitivity to PARPi/cisplatin; and (3) identify synthetic lethal interactions with deficiencies in this
F-box protein to provide biologic insight and characterize immediately translatable approaches for relapsed
treatment resistant SCLC."

The mission of the JHU NIMH NeuroHIV Center for the past 15 years has been to catalyze and support
multidisciplinary high-impact science that addresses the NIH strategic plan for HIV research for addressing
comorbidities and complications in people with HIV (PWH). The Center has focused on developing novel
treatments to mitigate the impact of cognitive impairment in PWH by capitalizing on the investigative talents of
JHU thought leaders as well as its strong translational capabilities in drug discovery and development. The
Center has worked to promote NeuroHIV research partnerships within JHU, amongst NIMH HIV Centers and
across NIH supported NeuroHIV research programs. Through these interactions, the Center facilitated the
discovery of three novel first-in-class therapeutic agents which attracted commercial partners to translate
discovered therapeutics into the clinic. With respect to training, the Center has provided infrastructure for
mentoring the next generation of diverse NeuroHIV scientists. The Center’s new investigator training pipeline
has been extensive, ranging from high school seniors to senior faculty new to NeuroHIV, with a particular focus
on training scientists from under-represented minority populations. Most recently, in collaboration with other
NeuroHIV Centers, the JHU Center organized and led the highly regarded weekly virtual joint NIMH Center’s
Joint NeuroHIV Translational Seminar Series. For renewal, the JHU Center for the Advancement of HIV
Neurotherapeutics (JHU CAHN) was reconfigured to be a resource capable of facilitating clinical, biomarker,
and translational research that address a broader range of neurological and psychiatric complications in
NeuroHIV, not limited to cognitive impairment. This important thematic shift aligns with NIMH’s NeuroHIV related
research priorities to foster research that integrates central nervous system (CNS) complications more generally.
To accomplish this, we will capitalize on the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework across the
Center’s Clinical, Biomarker and Therapeutic Cores, collaborations, and training efforts. These changes will help
pivot JHU CAHN toward a new model of innovation in therapeutic development, namely a personalized medicine
approach, developing and disseminating patient data-driven approaches to select therapeutic targets, identify
biomarkers, and predict individual treatment responses."

10795832,"Project Summary/Abstract 
Periodontitis is a highly prevalent infectious, inflammatory disease of the tissues supporting the teeth that can 
lead to tissue destruction, formation of a deep periodontal pocket, alveolar bone resorption, and tooth loss. 
Etiological models suggest that periodontitis is driven by a synergistic community of virulent bacteria that trigger 
host inflammatory responses in the gingival tissues resulting in disease progression. Among recognized 
pathogens, the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) has been strongly implicated in 
periodontitis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) macromolecules produced by Pg strains have been repeatedly shown 
to stimulate pro-inflammatory innate immune responses. Intriguingly, Pg strains can diversify the structure of 
LPS in response to biologically relevant stimuli to temporarily disguise themselves, evade the immune system, 
protect from stresses, and promote survival. Accordingly, at least four LPS variants have been identified in Pg 
strains that may act as agonists or antagonists in the interaction with the innate immune system. Agonistic LPS 
plays prominent roles in the pathological outcome of infection by being involved in the activation of TLR signaling 
pathways leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines, tissue destruction, and bone resorption. However, 
we do not yet know the mechanisms of the regulation of LPS heterogeneity and its biological importance during 
pathogenesis. We discovered that Pg strains possess a c-di-AMP signaling mechanism in which the c-di-AMP 
synthase PGN_0523 (dacpg) and the c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase PGN_0521 (pdepg) control the essential 
turnover of c-di-AMP, and consequently LPS heterogeneity and virulence potential. This study will investigate 
how c-di-AMP turnover regulates the heterogeneity and immunomodulatory properties of Pg LPS using in vitro 
and in vivo models. To this end, two independent but related specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: To 
understand how c-di-AMP-controls heterogeneity of LPS in Pg. Specific Aim 2: To understand the impact of c- 
di-AMP-dependent variation of LPS on the innate immune response. Upon completion of the proposed studies, 
we will learn how c-di-AMP signaling controls Pg LPS heterogeneity and determines the innate immune 
responses. Since c-di-AMP signaling does not exist in humans, it is a potential novel druggable target. Our 
findings will inform the discovery of potent antagonistic LPS isoforms as a foundation for development of anti- 
inflammatory therapeutics."

The University of Louisville (UoL) COBRE in Functional Microbiomics, Inflammation and Pathogenicity (FMIP) 
comprises a multidisciplinary group of investigators addressing thematic aspects that span the human 
microbiome, host inflammatory responses and disease outcomes. The purpose of the Administrative Core is to 
provide a formal governance structure for the administrative, fiscal and scientific oversight of this Phase 2 
COBRE. Following on from the success of Phase 1, we are well-positioned to transition to Phase 2 and maintain 
a coordinated and efficient administrative structure. The departments of Oral Immunology and Infectious 
Diseases (OIID), and Microbiology and Immunology (M&I), are the main contributors to the cross-disciplinary 
nature of the program. These units have established records of federal funding, mentoring junior faculty, 
graduate student training, and collaborative interactions across campus. We will continue mutually supportive 
horizontal interactions with other NIH-funded programs at UoL including the Hepatobiology and Toxicology 
COBRE, and the KY-INBRE, which will enhance the overall research profile of UoL. The activities of the COBRE 
will help recruit, retain and diversify the faculty. The application is led by well-qualified and well-funded Center 
Directors. Governance and evaluation are supported by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and an External 
Advisory Committee (EAC) comprised of five international experts in the thematic area of research. There are 
three outstanding Research Project Leaders (RPLs) with senior, established, funded mentoring teams with a 
track record in developing the careers of junior faculty through to independent funding status and further career 
devlopment. We have developed comprehensive mentoring and career development plans with milestones and 
evaluative metrics. Similarly, mentors and the COBRE program are evaluated formatively and summatively. We 
have a strong commitment of support from the UoL which will ensure sustainability beyond the NIH-funded 
period. The Specific Aims are: to provide the formal governance structure which allows coordination, direction 
and prioritization of all activities, including budget issues, thus ensuring the quality of all functions and growth of

10721827,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly deadly (5-year survival rates <10%), in large
part because most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages when the cancer is inoperable and
medical therapies are limited. In particular, PDAC among Blacks are discovered at later stages
with higher incidence and mortality. To date, PDAC screening has focused on individuals with
hereditary predispositions, neglecting the 90% that is sporadic. Universal PDAC screening in
asymptomatic adults has been deemed infeasible, motivating the quest for new screening
approaches that target high risk individuals. Susceptibility to PDAC is determined by genetic
factors and clinical exposures, but current risk prediction tools to identify these individuals are
inadequate as they do not incorporate genetic data from a trans-ancestry population and fail to
comprehensively integrate clinical and genetic risk factors. To address this problem, we propose
to improve the prediction of PDAC risk by leveraging data from local, national, and international
biobanks/datasets, including the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, VA Million Veteran Program,
Penn Medicine BioBank, UK Biobank, and pancreatic cancer consortia. We hypothesize that the
combination of refined genotypic and phenotypic data will improve identification of high-risk
Veterans for PDAC over traditional risk factor-based approaches. Our specific aims are 1)
develop an electronic health record-based phenotype algorithm for PDAC using structured and
unstructured data, 2) identify Veterans in the general population at high risk for PDAC by
integrating genetics into a clinical prediction model and 3) perform a trans-ancestry genome-wide
association study (GWAS) for PDAC in the Million Veteran Program, meta-analysis with extant
PDAC data, and the first GWAS for individuals of African ancestry. Successful completion of this
project will not only make early detection of PDAC possible in the multi-ancestry general
population of Veterans, but also improve the predictive capability of genetics to ultimately help
bridge the disparities in PDAC-related morbidity and mortality seen in Blacks. These results will
serve as the foundation for developing personalized strategies for screening in PDAC and help
actualize the promise of precision medicine for improving survival in PDAC. This proposal details
a 5-year plan to promote the independent career of Dr. Louise Wang as a physician scientist in
genetic risk prediction for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Dr. Wang is a third-year
gastroenterology fellow who will complete formal training in clinical epidemiology prior to the
funding period and will continue training in genetics and bioinformatics to augment her technical
skills in precision medicine. Her training will be facilitated through a comprehensive mentorship
plan consisting of the following: 1) weekly to monthly meetings with her mentorship team, 2) formal
coursework in programming to visualize biomedical and clinical data, statistical methods for
analyzing genetic data, and advanced prediction modeling to integrate genetics into clinical
prediction through the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB), Genomics &
Computational Biology (GCB) graduate group, and Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and
Informatics (DBEI) at the University of Pennsylvania, 3) structured research seminars and national
conferences, and 4) development of future grants during the latter portion of the award period.
Her long-term goal is to identify Veterans at risk for gastrointestinal malignancies by leveraging
electronic health record-linked biobanks to integrate genetic and clinical risk factors."
10686051,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissues which live within joints, including the anterior cruciate ligament, rotator cuff tendon, meniscus and
labrum fail to heal spontaneously after injury and have high failure rates of surgical repair. The ACL represents
a good model to study the problem of intra-articular healing as there are validated preclinical models and
clinical outcome measures that make it possible to critically evaluate the success or failure of strategies to
enhance tissue healing. The current standard of care for ACL injuries is ACL reconstruction, which is good at
stabilizing the knee but requires compromising other uninjured structures around the knee to obtain a graft that
is subsequently used to replace the ACL. Further the early posttraumatic OA is not mitigated despite ACL
reconstruction. The preclinical studies on ACL repair called BEAR (Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair)
demonstrated a prevention of posttraumatic OA and achieved knee stability. The positive preclinical findings of
BEAR compared to ACL reconstruction provided the foundation for two FDA approved preliminary clinical
trials: 1) the first-in-human cohort study (“BEAR I”), and 2) a small, single-center randomized control trial
(“BEAR II”). The statistical analysis of our pilot data shows a 200 patient trial will be required to demonstrate
non-inferiority of BEAR (a novel paradigm changing technology) when compared to ACL reconstruction
(current gold standard) for the key outcomes of anterior-posterior (AP) knee laxity and a validated patient
reported outcome for knee surgery. Therefore we propose the BEAR-MOON (Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair)
multi-center randomized non-inferiority clinical trial for co-primary outcomes AP (anterior-posterior) knee laxity
and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) validated patient reported outcome measure. The
subjects will be between 18 and 40 years of age with a complete ACL tear and randomized to either 1) ACL
Reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft (ACLR) or 2) Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR). We will
follow subjects at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after surgery. While achieving these aims has the potential to
change the clinical practice of ACL surgery, the impact is potentially far greater, as the availability of an FDA-
approved carrier that can be used to deliver complex biologic therapies to tissues within joints could enable the
clinical translation of the preclinical studies being conducted in multiple areas of regenerative medicine by
providing a delivery vehicle for these therapies."
10580829,"Abstract
This multi-site study aims to establish best practice recommendations and clinical value of a new consensus
protocol for dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. DSC-MRI is one of the most widely used physiologic
imaging techniques in neuro-oncology, with a reported use in 85% of all routine brain tumor scans at sites across
the US and Europe. DSC-MRI measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) can differentiate glioma
grades, identify tumor components in non-enhancing glioma, distinguish tumor recurrence from post-treatment
effects (including pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis) and predict treatment response and patient survival
after targeted therapy. Despite this demonstrated value, translation of consistent clinical DSC-MRI guidelines
across multiple institutions remains challenging owing to variability in acquisition and post-processing protocols.
To improve the accuracy, repeatability, and multi-site consistency of DSC-MRI, the team of investigators on this
proposal identified and validated a DSC-MRI protocol that has since become a consensus recommendation for
patients with glioma. Accordingly, we are well positioned to address critical gaps in this field that, once solved,
will accelerate the widespread adoption of the consensus protocol and direct its use in clinical practice. We first
aim to establish best practices for the pre- and post-processing methods for DSC-MRI. We will then leverage
our expertise with image-localized biopsies and matched image-tissue correlations to establish guidelines for
interpreting rCBV maps generated with the consensus protocol, specifically applied to the differentiation of low-
from high-grade glioma, and progression of high-grade glioma from post-treatment effects. Finally, we aim to
establish the clinical value added of the consensus DSC-MRI protocol for impacting brain tumor patient
management. These studies will address key practical and clinical unmet needs that will directly facilitate the
future use of DSC-MRI in glioma patients, thereby promoting widespread adoption of the consensus DSC-MRI
protocol."
10991288,"Effective medication-based treatment could prevent overdose deaths and help over 2 million Americans
recover from opioid use disorder (OUD), but only a fraction access specialty treatment or receive an
FDA-approved medication. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) works with family
members to get treatment resistant individuals (Identified Persons; IPs) into treatment, and 68% of families
coached in CRAFT achieve treatment entry for their IP; about twice as many as comparison groups. However,
most addiction professionals (counselors) are not trained in CRAFT or deliver it with questionable fidelity. The
goal of this project is to develop and evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a
scalable digital counselor training program for CRAFT. The Counselor product would be tailored to
prepare counselors to work with family members of individuals with OUD. It will allow counselors to deliver
high-fidelity CRAFT and significantly benefit IPs and their families affected by OUD by addressing the critical
barrier of access to a leading evidence-based approach to family involvement in addiction recovery. Current
methods for training counselors and disseminating ESTs, including CRAFT, rely on brief online or in-person
workshops. However, research shows this format is minimally effective in facilitating adoption and
implementation of ESTs. A more efficacious model includes ongoing counselor training with feedback and
coaching. This project will develop an enhanced training model for CRAFT and digitize it to maximize
scalability. In this project, we will: Produce the digital counselor training prototype and coaching process,
tailored to OUD - with stakeholder input (Aim 1); Conduct a pilot study of 3 levels of digital training (Level 1
-Digital tutorial only [T]; Level 2 -Tutorial & digital training materials for self-study [TM]; Level 3 – Tutorial, digital
materials, feedback and coaching [TMC]) to establish feasibility, acceptability, and examine the effects of
training on CRAFT knowledge, fidelity, and treatment entry and retention (Aim 2). Validation of feasibility and
commercial merit in the Phase I pilot study will provide substantiation to advance to Phase II. In addition to
optimizing the product based on Phase I learnings and stakeholder input, Phase II goals will include
completing development of a supervised machine learning (SML) automated coding system that will score
counselor-submitted digital audiotapes of CRAFT sessions and generate written feedback including
suggestions for improvement. This will allow us to demonstrate digital training efficacy at scale and commercial
readiness (Aim 3). We will conduct a fully-powered randomized control trial comparing all piloted outcomes for
the 3 training level conditions (Aim 4). These studies form the basis to demonstrate commercial readiness and
value to purchasers."
10831063,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal describes a 3-year plan to prepare Dr. Kim Liss, MD, for independence as a physician scientist,
studying the role of lipid metabolism in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in steatotic livers. During her Pediatric
Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition fellowship at Washington University School of Medicine, Dr. Liss
undertook research training in Dr. Brian Finck’s laboratory, where she demonstrated that steatosis significantly
worsens hepatic IRI in an experimental model. She also found that manipulation of a single lipid synthesis
pathway has far-reaching effects on inflammation, cell death, and regeneration in the liver. She extended these
findings and found alterations in multiple lipid metabolic pathways and macrophage subpopulations in
response to IRI. These findings serve as the basis for her proposal.
 Washington University School of Medicine is an outstanding environment for Dr. Liss to further her
research training, with its longstanding history of NIH-funded research, breadth and depth of resources, and,
most importantly, commitment to launching young investigators. There is constant crosstalk between
departments and research groups. Dr. Liss’ mentoring committee and collaborators have expertise spanning
Pediatrics, Medicine, Surgery, Chemistry, Immunology, and Developmental Biology. Dr. Finck is a well-suited
primary mentor because he is a leader in the field of intermediary metabolism and has an established record of
training young scientists during their transition to independence. Furthermore, the Finck laboratory is a hub of
intellectual energy with its trainees working on a broad range of inter-related projects. Dr. Liss will have
abundant opportunities to present her work within Washington University and the wider scientific community.
Her mentor team has complementary skills, and her Division and Department are highly supportive of her
goals. She will take graduate classes to enhance her knowledge of metabolomics, genomics, and
bioinformatics, and develop technical skills with her mentors and collaborators. At award conclusion, she will
have acquired the knowledge and skills to become an independent physician scientist with special expertise in
hepatic steatosis relevant to liver transplant care.
 In parallel to pursuing her structured career development plans, Dr. Liss will accomplish her proposed
Aims: 1) determine how adipose tissue lipolysis interacts with the liver in the context of hepatic IRI, and 2)
define changes to the hepatic lipidome that determine the macrophage landscape in hepatic IRI. Using
advanced multi-omics approaches, Dr. Liss strives to develop an integrated understanding of the factors that
contribute to IRI and recovery. Her work will fill the void in our understanding of the pathobiologic mechanisms
underlying IRI in steatotic livers, a condition that limits organ use, and threatens graft function. The efforts
described in this proposal will prompt novel interventions to increase donor organ availability, decrease waitlist
mortality, improve patient outcomes, and, in the process, serve as a springboard for Dr. Liss’ research career."

10794200,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Bacteria on and within the body (the microbiota) influence human physiology, therapeutic responses, and dis-
ease states. Many of these effects are mediated by small molecules, but determining the structures and func-
tions of these small molecule mediators is challenging due to the complex metabolic and genetic background of
the microbiota. Certain strains of E. coli in the human gut contain a gene cluster (referred to as “clb” or “pks”)
that encodes the biosynthesis of a metabolite known as colibactin. Several independent studies have demon-
strated that the clb cluster is epidemiologically-correlated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans, and recently
a casual role for clb+ bacteria in tumorigenesis has been established. However, it has been impossible to link
these effects directly to colibactin because the molecule is unstable and cannot be isolated from the bacteria.
During the prior funding period we indirectly elucidated the overall structure of colibactin by a combination of
chemical synthesis, genetics, stable isotope labeling, mass spectrometry (MS) and enzymology. This work es-
tablished colibactin as a heterodimeric molecule capable of generating interstrand cross-links (ICLs) in DNA via
two-fold nucleotide addition to electrophilic cyclopropane residues. Nonetheless, because the structure was
based largely on MS analysis, alternative colibactin isomers are possible and we now have evidence that the
right-hand warhead of colibactin undergoes ring–chain isomerization to form more complex isomers. Addition-
ally, the central α-aminoketone of colibactin is unstable toward oxidative degradation and it is not yet known
whether or not this residue is present at the time of DNA cross-linking. Here we will carry out the synthesis and
biological evaluation of synthetic colibactins with the goal of resolving these final structural ambiguities. We have
designed and will synthesize colibactin derivatives locked in the ring and chain isoforms and carry out studies to
evaluate the genotoxicity of each of these compounds. We have successfully synthesized the α-aminoketone
core of colibactin and will use this chemistry to prepare colibactin 771, the immediate product of the clb pathway.
We will carry out crystallographic studies to determine the mode of binding of colibactin to DNA, and the mode
of interaction of colibactin precursors with the maturation enzyme ClbP, the self-resistance enzyme ClbS, and
the transmembrane transporter ClbM. Significantly, the synthetic chemistry we have developed allows us to
probe for a causal link between colibactin and tumorigenesis through elucidation of the mutational signature
triggered by the molecule. We will map out the functional host response to colibactin exposure using a high-
throughput CRISPR genomic screen. This work is essential in that it provides the only means to study colibactin
since it cannot be obtained from natural sources. It will test the hypothesis that colibactin is the agent underlying
clb+ bacteria-associated CRC. Overall, these synthetic and enzymological/structural studies will guide future
strategies to diagnose and prevent microbiome-associated cancers."

10819127,"People living with HIV infection (PLWH) on ART live longer today but the incidence and prevalence of
chronic diseases is significantly higher that it is in those without HIV. As many as 50% of PLWH today have been
reported to have left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD), which is associated with atrial fibrillation, exercise
intolerance, and the progression to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The responsible
mechanisms for DD and its progression in contemporary PLWH populations are poorly understood but our
preliminary studies suggest that impaired cardiac energy metabolism may be a central factor linking previously
reported risk factors to DD. ATP is absolutely required for the normal myocellular relaxation and considerable
pre-clinical data and our pilot clinical studies using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) suggest an
“energetic myopathy” as a basis for the DD in PLWH. In addition, inflammation is increased despite combined
ART and viral suppression in PLWH and is known to impair mitochondrial function. We propose here to examine
cardiac high energy phosphate metabolism, its causes, and its relationship to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
(DD) and DD progression in PLWH. The central hypothesis is that cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism is
impaired even in well-treated PLWH, and promotes the development and progression of DD in PLWH as well as
the consequences of DD including cardiac remodeling and HFpEF assessed with echocardiography, increased
circulating heart failure biomarkers, heart failure symptoms and decreased exercise performance. The specific
aims are 1) to define the scope and extent of myocardial energetic abnormalities at rest and exercise using 31P
MRS/MRI in PLWH, 2) to probe the factors underlying cardiac muscle mitochondrial and energetic abnormalities
in PLWH, including those unique to PLWH (ART history and cumulative viral history) and others more common
in PLWH (increased inflammation, immune activation, insulin resistance, cardiac fibrosis, and/or higher cardiac
muscle lipids by MRI), and 3) to determine the functional consequences of observed cardiac muscle energetic
changes in PLWH, particularly the presence and progression of DD. The studies will leverage the expertise,
resources, and established PLWH cohorts at Johns Hopkins and collect novel cardiac energetic, diastolic
function, quantitative exercise tolerance and biomarker data. The results of these studies will deliver novel
understandings of the type and extent of myocardial energetic-mitochondrial abnormalities in PLWH, the factors
prevalent in PLWH that are most closely related to impaired cardiac mitochondrial-energetic metabolism, and
the functional consequences, most importantly diastolic dysfunction. These studies, characterizing the presence
and functional consequences of what appears to be a “mitochondriopathy” of cardiac and skeletal muscle in
PLWH promise new avenues to better understand the pathophysiology of DD in PLWH and suggest the selection
and design of metabolic strategies to reduce the personal and societal impact of HIV disease-related functional
decline in this important and growing population."
11178858,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) has the potential to cure leukemia and other malignant and non-
malignant diseases. However, these processes are associated with significant morbidity, and treatment-related
mortality (TRM) ranges from 10-30%. This is largely due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in which the donor
immune system attacks host tissues. GVHD has been linked to disruptions in the bacteria living in the gut (the
microbiota), which in turn may be caused by factors such as conditioning chemotherapy, radiation and antibiotic
treatment. GVHD and mortality are mediated by the immune system, whose activity in turn is shaped by gut
microbiota. Prebiotics are nondigestible fibers that can be safely given to HCT patients and metabolized by
existing bacteria in the gut to positively impact bacterial communities and metabolic products such as butyrate.
Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid that is an important energy source for colonic epithelial cells and can promote
regulatory T cell development, which in turn can modulate GVHD. Our preliminary data suggest that the
administration of the prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) to mice undergoing HCT, can both increase
butyrate and decrease GVHD. Here we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of GOS in a phase 1 and randomized phase 2 trial. Aim 1A: We will determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of GOS in a phase 1 dose escalation study (Years 1-2). We hypothesize that GOS is tolerable in
doses that increase bacterial diversity and butyrate levels. Aim 1B: We will evaluate the impact of GOS on HCT
outcomes in a randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. (Years 2-5). We hypothesize that patients receiving
GOS will have better outcomes including decreased grade II-IV GVHD. Aim 1C: We will compare the pre-HCT
microbiome of GOS responders (those who received GOS in the phase 1 and phase 2 trials and had increased
bacterial diversity) and non-responders (those with no change or decreased bacterial diversity) to determine
elements of the pre-HCT microbiome that may be associated with GOS response. Aim 2. Evaluate the impact
of GOS on biomarkers of intestinal and systemic inflammation and GVHD as potential mediators of HCT
outcomes. The regenerating islet-derived protein 3 alpha (REG3A), is of particular interest. REG3A is an
antimicrobial peptide that may be affected by the microbiota and has been reported as a biomarker of GVHD.
We hypothesize that patients treated with GOS will have positive changes in biomarkers of inflammation and
GVHD (increased REG3A, primary endpoint). As an exploratory aim, biomarkers will be studied for their
associated with prebiotic interventions, changes in the microbiome, bacterial metabolites, immune reconstitution,
and HCT clinical outcomes (GVHD, TRM, OS). Our long-term goal is to understand how prebiotic interventions
impact the microbiota and bacterial metabolites and use prebiotics to decrease inflammation and improve HCT
outcomes. We expect that the data generated from this study will lead to future clinical trials, including a
multicenter randomized phase 3 trials, or to microbiota-based diagnostic assays to personalize therapies."
10772967,"Project Summary Abstract
Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and others, all share a central feature –
cognitive impairment which results in individuals confronted with difficulty in memory, concentration, and
decision-making. Emerging evidence points to two key factors contributing to cognitive decline beyond the
underlying disease pathology - exposure to 1) environmental chemicals such as endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) during development and 2) chronic stress in adulthood. The interaction of chemical
exposure and stress are unknown; but together may exacerbate cognitive impairment. First, EDCs exert their
toxicity by disrupting nuclear receptor signaling during sensitive brain developmental periods. Numerous EDC
studies have detected cognitive impairments in humans and animals. One group of understudied EDCs are
organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) acting on nuclear and steroid receptors linked with cognition. The
association between perinatal OPFR exposure and cognitive processing has not been explored. We previously
identified an association between perinatal OPFR exposure on neonatal and juvenile hypothalamic gene
expression and adult locomotor activity and approach/avoidance behaviors. Second, mental disorders share a
common feature: exposure to stress, which contributes to cognitive dysfunction by exacerbating symptoms. A
common paradigm to recapitulate chronic stressors in rodents is to apply mild stress for 6 weeks, known as
chronic variable mild stress (CVMS). Using CVMS, the neural circuits underlying maladaptive effects of stress
include corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons. CRF is co-released with norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine
(ACh), and dopamine (DA), which control key brain regions (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex), and all are involved
in cognition and mood. Based on our prior work and the literature, I hypothesize that perinatal OPFR exposure
can disrupt cognition, alone or when combined with adult chronic stress exposure. My central hypothesis is
that EDCs such as OPFRs influence the developing cognitive and stress neurocircuitry potentially
inducing long-lasting functional deficits in cognitive processing and sensitize adults to exposure to
chronic stress in mice. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will first determine if perinatal OPFR exposure disrupts adult
cognition on the behavioral level and through alterations in ACh synaptic transmission using electrophysiology.
In Aim 2 (K99), I will examine the effects of OPFR exposure on regional concentrations of NE and DA and CRF
and associated gene expression in adults, and the role of hippocampal CRF neurons using optogenetics. Lastly,
in Aim 3 (R00), I will combine my prior expertise in spine density analysis and immunohistochemistry, and new
training in electrophysiology, high-performance liquid chromatography, and optogenetics to determine if the
combination of perinatal OPFR exposure and adult CVMS alters cognition. The ultimate goal of my research
program will be to determine the interactions of perinatal EDC exposure and adult chronic stressors on cognitive
processing by influencing CRF and neurotransmitter signaling throughout the brain."

support the primary scientific goal of the P50 in elucidating the genetic and phenomic architecture of rare and
common infertility traits. To achieve this aim, the Core will provide administrative support to: (a) facilitate patient
recruitment for phenotyping protocols; (b) coordinate scientific meetings to enhance efficiency and productivity
of individual Projects & Cores; (c) coordinate space management; (d) facilitate scientific reporting and, (e) ensure
proper regulatory compliance. Aim 2 is to 'un-burden"" P50 investigators, by providing infrastructure and timely
support to catalyze a collaborative think-tank comprised of Center personnel from across the globe. To achieve
this aim, the Core will provide administrative support to: (a) coordinate and disseminate meeting
agendas/materials to participants; (b) coordinate travel arrangements for investigators, fellows and staff within
the two scientific projects and supporting cores; (c) oversee optimal functioning of information technology (IT)
services; and, (d) facilitate post-award grant management. Aim 3 is to serve as a “nuclear hub"" for engagement
and communication between P50 investigators, the patients they serve, mentees and the broader academic
community. To achieve this objective, the Core will provide administrative support to: (a) Education/Outreach
Core patient meetings and focus groups; (b) orient new personnel and staff to the Center; (c) coordinate the
Visiting Professor series through the academic year; (d) coordinate a Harvard-wide Annual Symposium
celebrating reproductive medicine and biology across the Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham & Women’s
hospital and Harvard Chan School of public health; and, (e) maintain a social media presence to disseminate
scientific findings, advertise research positions and publicize activities (i.e. patient meetings, Speaker Series,
Annual Symposium). The Administrative Core will provide end-to-end support for Projects 1 and 2 as well as
Technical Service and Education/Outreach cores to effectively carry out their planned activities. Coordinated
Administrative Core activities will amplify the Center’s productivity and dissemination of results that will in turn
benefit clinical care of patients with infertility and alleviate the physical and psychological burden of infertility for
patients and their families."
10810663,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Progesterone receptor membrane component (PGRMC) 1 and PGRMC2 are thought to mediate
progesterone actions. Our lab recently floxed the murine Pgrmc1 and Pgrmc2 genes in an effort to evaluate the
function of these genes in the context of female fertility. Mutagenesis studies using Pgr-Cre mice revealed that
Pgrmc1 and Pgrmc2 are essential for female fertility in that conditional ablation of each gene results in subfertility
that progresses to premature reproductive senescence. Despite being a purported progesterone receptor,
endometrial PGRMC1 expression is actually highest during the proliferative, estradiol (E2)-dominated phase of
the menstrual cycle in humans and primates. The evolutionary origin of the PGRMC family predates the
appearance of sterols as signaling molecules by at least 300 million years. As such, it is now becoming clear
that PGRMCs have both progesterone-dependent and progesterone-independent functions. An evaluation of
estrogenic responses in Pgrmc1d/d, Pgrmc2d/d, and Pgrmc1/2d/d mice revealed that PGRMC proteins are
fundamentally required for E2-induced endometrial epithelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, we determined that
PGRMC1 expression is elevated in human endometrial cancer. Consistent with these findings, human
endometrial xenograft tumors derived from PGRMC1 over-expressing cells grow faster and are more resistant
to chemotherapy treatment. Recent proteomic efforts in our lab have established that PGRMC1 interacts with
three principal groups of proteins, and these include glycolytic enzymes, RNA-binding proteins and proteins
involved in the initiation of translation. Estrogen is known to induce an endometrial Warburg-like glycolytic effect.
Our central hypothesis is that PGRMC family members help coordinate E2-induced endometrial cell proliferation
through their interactions with RNA-binding proteins and by establishing a Warburg-like aerobic glycolytic state
to ensure that sufficient anabolic carbon-based building materials are available for proliferation and expansion
of the tissue during the proliferative phase of the menstrual/estrous cycle. A linked component of this hypothesis
is that PGRMC family members regulate mRNA processing that favors Warburg-like glycolysis. Through the use
of proteomics, primary cell cultures, mouse models designed for evaluating endometrial epithelial cell
proliferation in vivo, development of a novel transgenic mouse, and RNA-seq/CLIP-seq analysis, this hypothesis
will be tested in the following Specific Aims: 1) evaluate the consequences of PGRMC1 over-expression on
female fertility and development of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer; 2) demonstrate that PGRMC1
contributes to E2-induced proliferation by establishing a Warburg-like glycolytic effect in endometrial epithelial
cells; and 3) demonstrate that PGRMC1 mediates at least some of the proliferative actions of E2 in endometrial
epithelial cells through its interactions with RNA-binding proteins that coordinate post-transcriptional mRNA
processing and translocation to the polyribosome. The outcome of these mechanistic studies will provide novel
information about the molecular details of PGRMC1 functions that may be useful in the development of
countermeasures that could reduce the prevalence and/or severity of E2-driven endometrial diseases."
10814869,"Project Abstract
In much of eastern and southern Africa, the incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
remains high despite the scale-up of promising biomedical and behavioral interventions. Recent studies have
documented the crucial role of transactional sex – the exchange of money, material support or goods in age-
disparate, sexual relationships – and heavy alcohol use in driving HIV/STI incidence and influencing men's and
women's health outcomes. Existing policy responses to this challenge have largely focused on women, with
various interventions to reduce women's engagement in transactional sex such as education subsidies,
vocational training, and cash transfers for economic empowerment. However, the effectiveness of these
interventions has been hindered by the relative lack of programs that target men's behavior. There is a vital
need for interventions that can reduce men's engagement in risky behaviors that increase HIV/STI risk.
This project will test an innovative, theoretically-motivated economic intervention to reduce men's engagement
in transactional sex and other risky behaviors. Leveraging innovations in mobile financial services and
research on savings behavior in low-income countries, our intervention will motivate high-risk, income-earning
men in Kenya to reduce their spending on risky behaviors and instead save their disposable income in local
bank accounts. These bank accounts will include (a) additional incentives to save in the form of lottery-based
rewards linked to amounts saved, (b) opportunities to develop savings goals, and (c) periodic reminders about
the incentives and goals. Through a direct economic mechanism (incentives to shift expenditures from the
present to the future) and a psychological mechanism (increasing future orientation), this intervention can
generate significant behavior change and improve health outcomes. We will conduct a randomized controlled
trial among high-risk men to determine effects of the savings intervention on their health and economic
outcomes.
Specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Determine the impact of the savings intervention on
incidence of HIV and other STIs. Aim 2: Determine intervention impacts on savings and expenditures as well
as risky health behaviors. Aim 3: Quantitatively and qualitatively assess mechanisms of behavior change
among participants and among a sample of female partners. By testing an intervention to promote forward-
looking behavior and reduce the risk of acquiring HIV and other STIs in a high HIV/STI burden setting, this
project has high potential for scientific and public health impact."
10827905,"Project Summary
 The proposed research addresses critical issues of high translational importance concerning the
mechanisms and outcomes of partial dysfunction of the vestibular sensory epithelia, referred to as peripheral
vestibular hypofunction. The research plan utilizes chemotoxin- induced hypofunction, the foundation for which
was identified through recent work from the PI’s laboratory in an animal model enabling precise
intraperilymphatic dosing resulting in the production of highly reproducible lesions. This provides the basis for
producing lesions of graded magnitudes within the sensory neuroepithelia, documented through
histopathologic analyses. The physiologic outcome of these lesions will be evaluated through recordings of
single afferent neuron electrophysiology and the vestibulo-ocular reflex, providing the bases for establishing
histologic and physiologic correlates to a direct behavioral test of vestibular function. Previous work has
demonstrated that the afferent neuron calyx is highly labile to pathologic compromise, and owing to its
important contribution to shaping neural dynamics in untreated epithelia it is a focus for assessing pathologic
damage. The present research plan will enable the direct correlate of afferent discharge dynamics to critical
cellular components of the calyx, including its morphology and expression of KCNQ4 and sodium-potassium
ATPase. In addition, we will examine the distribution of synaptic ribbons within hair cells of lesioned epithelia,
testing whether a systematic synaptopathy also contributes to the compromised vestibular function. In
summary, the present investigation provides critical insight into the histopathologic substrates of vestibular
hypofunction and the alterations in sensory coding that underlies the functional compromise. At the same time,
however, this investigation will reveal important cellular and physiologic metrics that are required for normal
vestibular function, addressing longstanding question in vestibular neurobiology."
10811618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to study age-dependent mechanisms of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
actions in the ovary. FSH is a pituitary glycoprotein consisting of an α-and a β-subunit. Both the subunits are
glycosylated with two N-linked sugar chains on each subunit. Glycosylation of FSH is estrous/menstrual cycle-
and age-specific. Macro-heterogeneity results in FSH variants consisting of 2 sugar chains on the α subunit but
either one or none on the β. These variants are known as hypo-glycosylated FSH glycoforms, FSH21, and
FSH18, in contrast to the fully glycosylated FSH24. Interestingly, the abundance of hypo- and fully glycosylated
FSH is age-dependent, with high levels of FSH21/18 glycoforms predominant in young women and FSH24
predominant in peri/post-menopausal women. This shift suggests a role of FSH24 in ovarian aging. In vitro
studies and pharmacological rescue of Fshb null mice with recombinant hypo- and fully glycosylated FSH
glycoforms indicate differences in regulation of known FSH-responsive ovarian genes and proteins
downstream of FSH receptor (FSHR) signaling. However, the mechanisms by which these FSH glycoforms
regulate ovarian signaling pathways in vivo are unknown. The central hypothesis is that age-specific FSH
glycoforms act via FSHRs but regulate distinct downstream signaling cascades to elicit different gene/protein
expression signatures in the ovary. This hypothesis will be tested using genetically engineered novel mouse
models. In Aim 1, we will perform a trans-omics analysis by overlaying the gene, protein and phosphoprotein
expression signatures in ovaries of Fshb null mice expressing individual FSH glycoforms to identify signaling
networks regulated by each FSH glycoform. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the FSH glycoform
specificity in FSHR-mediated signaling is achieved by recruitment of distinct protein complexes to activate
different downstream gene/protein networks. Fshb null mice expressing individual FSH glycoform and His -
tagged FSHRs in granulosa cells will be used. Pull-down experiments with an His tag-specific antibody
followed by mass spectrometry analysis of ovarian proteins will allow us to identify the FSH glycoform-specific
FSH receptor and receptor co-factor protein complexes in each case. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the direct
effects of recombinant FSH glycoforms in secondary follicles obtained from reproductively young and old mice.
Gene and protein expression profiling will be performed and how FSH glycoforms impact follicle growth and
gamete quality in vitro will be determined. Successful completion of the proposed studies will advance our
understanding of the mechanisms by which FSH glycoforms regulate selective recruitment of distinct FSHR -
co-factor partner complexes to achieve FSHR-mediated signal transduction pathways in vivo in ovaries and
provide a direct read out of FSH glycoform actions during in vitro folliculogenesis and oogenesis. Our
mechanistic studies serve as the foundation for novel therapeutic opportunities to preserve ovarian function
and will enable improved design of ovarian induction protocols, in alignment with the NICHD mission."

10666473,"1 Project Summary: The BRAIN 2025 Report, with the goal to “produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain
 2 by developing and applying improved methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity” is directly
 3 addressed by this application. The Neuropixels probe (Jun et al., Nature 2017) demonstrated that a high
 4 channel count Si shank with continuous, dense, programmable sites yielded a large capacity increase in
 5 monitoring of neural activity (100's vs. 10's of units for typical devices). Neuropixels NXT will increase
 6 substantially the utility of that high capacity shank by optimizing and deploying a new platform technology for
 7 neural recording, direct-to-digital. Neuropixels, while revolutionary over prior art, has an integrated probe
 8 “base” for amplification and digitization and a digital interface board (head stage) that both reside above the
 9 brain. Together, the crowding of these components above the brain limits the number of shanks that can be
10 used in one experimental animal. Follow-on projects are already underway to relieve this crowding and weight
11 such that we expect 2 Neuropixels probes (768 channels of recording capacity) could be used on a freely
12 moving, tethered mouse. While this represents a substantial improvement, it remains far short of the brain wide
13 recording that satisfies the above stated ambition to “produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain”.
14 Building on the demonstrated performance of the Neuropixels shank, we propose to optimize the base
15 electronics so that a probe with ~768 channels would have a base of < 5mm2 (an 18x shrinkage of the base
16 area per channel compared to Neuropixels, and 6x shrinkage compared to Neuropixels 2.0), require no extra
17 digital interface board (head stage), and instead have a 6-conductor micro-cable between the probe and a high
18 speed data hub for digital transmission that can handle multiple probes simultaneously. This smaller probe
19 base will allow it to be made narrow so that each probe will act as a “unit shank” that can be tiled side-to-side
20 into a “comb”, and combs stacked into 2 dimensional arrays of shanks, yielding dense 3 dimensional arrays of
21 programmable recording sites. We project capacities of >16 shanks (9600 sites/channels, all active) in a
22 mouse, 40 shanks (40,000+ programmable sites, 26,000+ channels) in a rat, and up to 100 shanks (450,000
23 programmable sites, 76.800 channels) in a non-human primate. The work plan will first optimize: 1) the design
24 of the direct-to-digital recording channel pixel for size/noise tradeoff, and 2) the data hub to allow up to 12
25 probes to be served by a single output cable. With this information, a family of “unit shanks” will be produced,
26 ready for sale to the research community, which can be fixtured into a wide variety of recording geometries.
27 These developments in an environment capable of long term manufacture and affordable costs will ensure
28 wide availability."

10626952,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a universal health concern and is known as a “silent epidemic”. Each year
in America, 2.53 million patients visit the emergency department after suffering a TBI of which 56,800 die and
over 288,000 require hospitalization, rehabilitation programs, and long-term supportive care. Although the
primary TBI event is typically acute, subsequent secondary injury responses (neuroinflammation) and chronic
tissue loss often result in functional deficits that last a lifetime. Presently, there are no neuroprotective or
regenerative Food and Drug Administration approved TBI treatments. Aruna Bio has recently developed a novel
neuroprotective and regenerative neural stem cell extracellular vesicle (NSC EV) product called AB126™ that
may be used to treat TBI. AB126™ has demonstrated multimodal therapeutic efficacy in divergent species (aged
mouse, rat, pig) and neural injury models (TBI, stroke). In TBI rodent models, AB126™ reduced lesion sizes,
enhanced endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and rapidly attenuated motor function impairments.
Large animal testing has been repeatedly identified by academic, industry, and government agencies as a key
de-risking step in TBI therapeutic development. To this end, this proposal outlines FDA enabling studies in a pig
controlled cortical impact TBI model using clinically relevant assessment tools to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of AB126™ as a treatment for TBI. The successful completion of this study will provide key information pertaining
to AB126™ dosage, therapeutic effects on TBI pathophysiology (edema, hemorrhage) and functional outcomes,
toxicity, and potential adverse side effects that will serve as the basis for an IND submission and future clinical
trials."
11110854,"ABSTRACT
Opioid use, diagnoses of opioid use disorder among pregnant women, and diagnoses of neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) increased dramatically over the past 20 years. In 2017, an estimated 100,000
infants were exposed to opioids, among whom 25,000 infants were diagnosed with NOWS. Opioid-exposed
infants, regardless of whether they are diagnosed with NOWS, are more likely to have adverse outcomes
compared to similar non-exposed infants, including: longer and more complicated initial hospital stays, higher
likelihood of involvement in the child welfare system, higher rates of hospital readmission and emergency
department visits and lower use of recommended preventive services. Further, delivery of medical care to
opioid-exposed infants remains variable resulting in uneven outcomes among US hospitals and communities.
The development of valid and reliable measures for opioid-exposed infants is critical to improving outcomes for
this vulnerable population. To fill this existing gap we will: 1) develop candidate measures of quality for opioid-
exposed infants and refine these measures by engaging key stakeholders including local, state, and national
public policy makers; private and public insurers; health care providers; and families using a modified
RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method; 2) determine the reliability, reproducibility and validity of measures of
candidate quality measures while evaluating the usability, validity, and reliability of the measures using two
unique sets of data, linked maternal-infant data from the Medicaid Analytic Extract from 2007-2014 and
clinically collected data from two large clinical systems and will determine risk-adjusted hospital variation in
measures for opioid-exposed infants in a large population-based sample. This R34 will produce quality
measures for opioid-exposed infants and preliminary data that will subsequently inform an R01 pragmatic
clinical trial that will evaluate how clinician performance on quality measures results in changes to provider
behaviors and subsequent alterations in infant outcomes. In addition, these measures can also serve as the
outcomes for randomized clinical trials that examine the impact of various treatments on the health and
wellbeing of opioid-exposed infants and whether they experience withdrawal symptoms after birth. The ultimate
goal of this R34 and subsequent R01s will be to provide innovative tools for clinicians, researchers,
policymakers, payers, hospital systems and state perinatal collaboratives to improve care for opioid-exposed
infants."
11010043,"Ocular PBPK/PD Model Extrapolation from Animal to Human – Abstract
The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) is tasked, among other things, with reviewing sponsor applications for
ocular dosage forms that purport to be bioequivalent to the approved formulations for the same drug.
Sponsor companies want to have high confidence that applications they submit for locally acting dosage
forms thought to be bioequivalent (BE) will receive favorable reviews. Software that embodies
physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) / pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling can serve as a useful
alternative to conventional BE approaches to evaluate the likelihood that a new locally acting formulation
will be BE to an approved dosage form in the target patient population.
Developing a state-of-the-art capability for ocular PBPK/PD software and defining strategies for
interspecies translation of models requires an extensive knowledge base to serve as the scientific
foundation. Talented scientists apply the knowledge base in the development of useful equations and logic
suitable for software, high-level computer programming skills to encode the equations and logic into user-
friendly software, and other experienced scientists to test, validate, document, and support the software for
the desired application by others not involved in its development.
The goal of this project is to develop and validate a PBPK/PD modeling strategy for ophthalmic drug
products to support translation from preclinical species to human. This will be achieved through a
combination of an exhaustive review expanding the knowledge base of preclinical and clinical PK/PD data
sets and legacy models for ophthalmic products, developing mechanistic PBPK/PD models in preclinical
species in the Ocular Compartmental Absorption and Transit™ (OCAT™) model within the GastroPlus®
software program and extrapolating to human PBPK/PD models, and validating and documenting the
resulting software for use by others. By basing the analyses on the well-established and validated OCAT™
model, which has been funded previously by the FDA and is utilized by both pharmaceutical and generic
drug companies today, we will be able to focus project resources entirely on identifying knowledge gaps
and new strategies to support interspecies translation for ocular drug delivery and establishing scientific
and regulatory standards for supporting innovative development and performing bioequivalence
assessments, rather than having to develop new code for the core program and its many support
capabilities (e.g., integration, plotting, Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, Virtual BE Trial Simulations).
Throughout the effort, we will maintain close contact with the FDA program manager and the Consortium
for Ocular PBPK/PD Model Extrapolation that we propose to form with our collaboration partners and the
FDA to ensure the team focuses on data compilation and model development activities that will result in
successful completion of the specific aims within the scope of the project."
10730538,"Project Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are thin, dense, specialized extracellular matrices built on laminin and type IV
collagen scaffoldings that underlie and surround most animal tissues. BMs harbor over 100 proteins and
provide mechanical, barrier, and signaling support for tissues. Defects in BM assembly and regulation cause
embryonic lethality and are linked to numerous human diseases. Aging BMs accumulate type IV collagen and
progressively thicken, which is associated with declining tissue function, such as reduced blood flow, vision,
hearing, and stem cell renewal. The mechanism(s) driving collagen accumulation and BM thickening during
aging, however, are unclear. Furthermore, it has not yet been possible to establish whether and how collagen
accumulation causes tissue decline. A key gap in the understanding of BM aging is a lack of animal models
that allow visualization of individual BM component accumulation and turnover during aging, as well as the
ability to manipulate the levels of BM components and establish their effects on tissue function. The overall
objective of this proposal is to develop C. elegans as a powerful new model to elucidate mechanisms of BM
aging and its consequences on tissue function. C. elegans offers unique advantages for studying BM aging—a
short lifespan (~two weeks), tissue decline during aging is well characterized, all tissues are accessible to live
imaging, and facile conditional gene knockdown and overexpression approaches. In addition, most BM
components have been endogenously tagged with the genetically encoded fluorophore mNeonGreen (mNG)
(~60 BM genes) and core components with mEos2 (photoconvertible), allowing for comprehensive
examination of BM component levels and turnover of key components. Preliminary studies have revealed that,
similar to vertebrates, collagen IV accumulates dramatically in BMs (as much as 9-fold) on multiple tissues as
C. elegans age. Additionally, preventing collagen accumulation via RNAi slows the decline of the germline
stem cell niche. To determine the mechanisms and consequences of BM aging, the following specific aims
will be pursued: (1) using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), photoconversion, and screening
of collagen regulators, the mechanism(s) of collagen IV accumulation in aging BMs will be determined, (2)
using RNAi to deplete collagen and examining markers of tissue health and decline, the role of age-dependent
BM collagen IV accumulation in stem cell renewal, oocyte quality, ovulation, fertility, and muscle decline will be
established, and (3) using a comprehensive toolkit of endogenously tagged BM components, a BM aging atlas
will be generated that reveals how BM components change in abundance on all major tissues during aging.
The proposed research is significant, as it will establish a new model to study BM aging, elucidate how BM
collagen IV accumulates during aging and its effects on tissue decline, and create a comprehensive atlas of
BM aging that will reveal additional components with age-related changes that will drive future research on BM
regulation, aging, and tissue health."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is among the most fatal of all cancers, and is on track to become the
second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the US by 2030. There is significant heterogeneity among PDA
tumors, mitigating the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy and highlighting the need for more
individualized approaches to treatment. Personalized medicine (PM) strategies, which take tumor and/or patient-
specific data into account when deciding on a course of treatment, have shown great promise within the context
of many different types of cancers in recent preclinical and clinical studies. However, most PM approaches rely
on molecular profiling data that require relatively large samples of tumor tissue. Unlike other cancers in which
surgical resection is standard-of-care, PDA patients rarely undergo surgery at diagnosis. In the absence of
upfront surgery in the majority of PDA patients, access to sufficient tumor tissue for comprehensive molecular
and drug profiling in PDA is limited. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) represent a unique opportunity to
circumvent this limitation. Patient-derived organoids can be successfully established from the scant tissue
collected during endoscopic biopsies, which are routine in PDA diagnosis. Moreover, such organoids can
recapitulate the phenotype of their tissue of origin and can predict patient drug response in clinic. The primary
goal of the current proposal is to establish pre-clinical predictors of tumor-specific circadian clock dynamics and
chronotherapeutic efficacy using normal human pancreas tissue, well characterized PDA cell lines and patient-
specific biopsy-based PDOs. Specifically, we will: (1) characterize baseline molecular rhythms and clock
dynamics in the normal human pancreas over 24 hours; (2) determine the role of PDA cancer events in tumor
clock perturbations and patient survival and (3) validate the use of molecular and drug response profiling data
from PDOs to inform time-based drug treatment (“chronotherapy”) strategies. Altogether, these studies will help
advance the use of tumor specific circadian profiles in clinical settings, with particular implications for bringing
more individualized and targeted time/circadian-based strategies to PDA patients."
10720904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This Collaborative Merit Award application (CMA), consisting of three projects (CMA1-3), addresses a critical
challenge in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. The most common and most lethal subtype of ovarian
cancer is high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Standard treatment for HGSOC combines surgical
cytoreduction with platinum-based chemotherapy. The treatment is initially successful in achieving remission.
However, cancer recurs in most women. Patients with recurrent disease may continue to respond to additional
rounds of platinum but will ultimately develop platinum resistance (PtR). At that point, the tumor is typically
resistant to other treatment strategies. The key to increasing survival in HGSOC is to prevent the development
of PtR or identify alternative means of targeting resistant tumors. The main goal of this interdisciplinary and
collaborative project is to identify novel targets and biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy for HGSOC. This requires
a better understanding of the mechanisms that either select for, or promote transformation of, HGSOC cells to
an aggressive, therapy-resistant phenotype. While previous studies on PtR have focused on DNA repair
pathways or altered membrane transporters, new concepts support the hypothesis that a key contributor to PtR
is the reprogramming of cancer cells into a less differentiated and metabolically adaptable state. This
collaborative proposal by three established ovarian cancer researchers will leverage their interdisciplinary
expertise and rich resources to define new molecular mechanisms of PtR in ovarian cancer. CMA1 will utilize
deep imaging to define clinically-relevant biomarkers of PtR while digital spatial profiling and systems biology
will be used to identify molecular pathways underlying PtR. Preclinical immunocompetent mouse models will be
used to test potential targeted therapies discovered in CMA1,2&3. CMA2 will study metabolic adaptation
associated with the emergence of PtR focusing on a shift to fatty acid oxidation in resistant HGSOC cells and
tumors. CMA2 will use resources shared with CMA1&3 and cellular biology and novel single cell metabolic
imaging to define unique metabolic dependencies of PtR HGSOC. As resistant tumors are highly susceptible to
death induced by oxidized lipid membranes, mechanisms of ferroptosis will be examined in PtR models treated
with novel metabolism targeting agents, which will be tested together with CMA1. CMA3 will define the emergent
de-differentiated phenotype in recurrent HGSOC through transcriptomic analysis of patient tumors collected at
various stages of disease progression. By defining molecular pathways that lead to cellular de-differentiation,
we will reveal new vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited using small molecules, kinase inhibitors,
and cell-based immune therapy approaches Multi-omics data, patient derived organoids, and PDX models will
provide valuable shared resource for collaborative projects in CMA1&2.
The overarching hypothesis of CMA2 is that metabolic reprogramming is a key and necessary step in the
development of PtR. We speculate that this shift is initiated through altered oxidative status in cancer cells, due
to DNA injuries inflicted by platinum. To test the hypothesis, we will determine whether Pt-R cancer cells and
tumors undergo a metabolic shift to fatty acid oxidation caused by increased generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). We will measure intracellular ROS, glucose and lipid consumption and quantify expression and
function of key lipid transporters and rate limiting enzymes regulating lipogenesis. Molecular findings will be
validated by using high content stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) metabolic imaging and multimodal SRS /
two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF). We will test whether by blockade of key enzymes or transporters
involved in metabolic reprogramming can overcome the state of resistance and whether these inhibitors induce
cell death in PtR cells through ferroptosis. Mechanistic understanding of this process will lead to new treatment
opportunities for fatal PtR HGSOC and other cancers."

This Fast Track SBIR proposal submitted by Potluck LLC (Philadelphia, PA) requests funds to design and
rigorously test the integration of multiplayer games into the online social engagement platform (OneClick) for
adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The long-term goal is to benefit health outcomes that are affected
by social engagement or lack thereof, such as survival and the onset of dementia. Older adults are at risk of
social isolation, and therefore, negative health and quality-of-life outcomes. The existing OneClick platform
connects people through live, small-group, video conversation, and has been optimized for older adults with
MCI. In this new project, games already well known and enjoyable to older adults will be integrated into the
OneClick platform to enhance social interaction between older adults, their family, and close friends. In
collaboration with experts in aging, cognitive decline, and technology and game design, new game interfaces
will be designed, tested and integrated into the existing platform. Phase I will establish feasibility and optimize
in-game social interaction for older adults with and without MCI. In Aim 1, facilitators and barriers of online
social gameplay and interaction will be identified through formative research and observational studies of older
adults with and without MCI playing in-person and online games. In Aim 2, Aim 1 findings will be used to
design and implement an intuitive and pleasant gameplay interface that will be compared against in-person
gameplay experiences to demonstrate technical feasibility. In Phase II, the efficacy of online game play as a
social engagement intervention will be tested in a properly-powered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), and
the scalability and market-readiness of the new product tested in a real-world pilot with an established industry
partner. In Aim 3, the new OneClick platform, intervention content, and implementation protocols will be
finalized based on Phase I learnings. This will prepare for Aim 4, a 12-week RCT that tests intervention
efficacy: 124 older adults with and without MCI (62 each) will be randomized to the OneClick intervention group
or a Wait-list control group. The intervention group will use OneClick for 12 weeks, while the Wait-listed control
group receives no intervention. Both groups complete social isolation and engagement assessments after 6
and 12 weeks. Subsequently, participants in the Wait-listed control group will start the intervention, with
assessments after 6 and 12 weeks. Within and between-group comparisons over time will determine effects
on social engagement, quality of life, technology acceptance, and subjective stress. In Aim 5, proven methods,
materials and content will be handed over to an industry partner to assess scalability by evaluating whether the
new online social gaming platform can be readily implemented and support social engagement among the
independently living older adults they serve. The deliverable is a rigorous and effective social engagement
technology ready for broad commercialization."
10720900,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a largely adult-onset, progressive, fatal (death usually occurring in 3-5
years) neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiology and a heterogenous clinical presentation. There
are numerous genetic and non-genetic risk factors, with new ones discovered frequently. Among the non-
genetic risk factors, age, male sex and several environmental factors, including military service, are the most
salient. Accordingly, ALS is a fully compensable condition in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans
Health Administration (VHA). As the Veteran population ages, the incidence and prevalence of ALS, with its
staggering personal, financial and societal costs, will continue to increase. Establishing large national cohorts
essential for ALS research is limited by the low prevalence (6-8 cases per 100,000) and short survival time (3-5
years) of persons with ALS (PALS). This is particularly true for efforts to develop biorepositories that collect
central nervous system (CNS) tissue samples annotated with clinical information essential to biomedical ALS
research. Although a number of mouse models have been developed to study ALS, these models are limited
and the need for research quality human CNS tissue for genomic and proteomic research in ALS is critical.
The VA funded the VA Biorepository Brain Bank (VABBB) to support ALS research and improve clinical care.
The VABBB is presently the only national prospective cohort study and CNS tissue bank in the U.S. that is
enrolling and conducting ongoing follow-up on Veterans with ALS. The VABBB is a multi-site collaboration
among VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) and the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS).
The VABBB utilizes the strengths across the Boston and Tucson sites in enrollment, assessment, tissue
banking operations, neuropathological diagnosis, medical informatics and data management. The VABBB
cohort is notable for its size (over 300 PALS), the amount and quality of CNS tissue and clinical data available,
and for the relatively long duration and slow disease progression in this unique cohort. Tissue and clinical data
from the VABBB are available for distribution to qualified researchers. In this application, we seek to further our
support of cutting-edge ALS research and enhance the value of VA’s investment in the VABBB. Over the next
four years our specific aims are: 1) To continue, and further enhance, the VA Biorepository Brain Bank
(VABBB) as the nation’s only national prospective cohort study and central nervous system (CNS)
tissue/biofluid bank supporting international ALS research; 2) Conduct state-of-the-art diagnostic
neuropathological evaluation; and 3) To continue our characterization of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction
in our cohort to support emerging clinicopathological studies of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
Specific Aim 1 will involve 1) generation of a larger and more diverse (e.g., sex) national sample of Veteran
PALS and controls; 2) enhanced antemortem biofluid (e.g., blood) and postmortem tissue (e.g., bone, muscle)
collection and analyses (e.g., whole genome sequencing); and 3) conduct in-depth clinical characterization of
our large cohort of long duration (>10 years) PALS. In Specific Aim 2, we will 1) establish comprehensive
neuropathological diagnoses on all brains using strict diagnostic criteria; 2) prepare and store CNS tissue in
optimal conditions (including pH and RNA), 3) maintain an extensive neuropathological database to
accompany banked tissue; providing clinicopathological correlation, and 4) communicate the neuropathological
results to family members when requested. Regarding Specific Aim 3, we will continue our telephone/mail
assessments to improve the cognitive/behavioral characterization of our cohort. There is consensus that
cognitive/behavioral dysfunction in ALS is related to the genetics and neuropathology of the disease. We aim
to facilitate clinicopathological studies of the ALS-frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) continuum by
providing cognitive/behavioral data with genetic and neuropathology data – another unique aspect of the
VABBB."
10909792,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive part of the pathological spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) that has evolved into a world-wide epidemic and is the most common chronic liver
disease in the United States. NASH is strongly linked to obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and may
progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Disturbingly, prevalence rates of NASH appear to be greater in the
Veteran population compared with the general US population. Thus, the burden of NASH is substantial to
Veterans. Despite the recognition of NASH as a major public health problem, only lifestyle modifications aimed
at increasing physical activity and reducing caloric intake are currently recommended as treatments with
limited success. Thus, there is a great need for effective therapy of NASH. The goal of this study is to test
whether low dose thyroid hormone administered to Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH, at a titrated dose that
will maintain thyroid function within normal range, can result in histological improvement of NASH, measured
by significant reduction in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease score (NAS). The hypothesis is that low dose thyroid
hormone causes histological improvement in NASH by increasing mitochondrial FAO in the liver mediated by
an increase in mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), the key enzyme in FAO cycle. The preliminary clinical
studies in human subjects, including Veterans, support reduced FAO in NASH. In addition, preclinical in vivo
animal studies and in vitro cell culture studies support that low dose thyroid hormone can effectively increase
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and rescue NAFLD. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled
clinical trial, Veterans with normal thyroid levels and biopsy-proven NASH will be recruited and randomized to
receive 52 weeks of either active treatment (low dose levothyroxine) or placebo control to accomplish the
following Specific Aims. 1) To determine the efficacy of low dose thyroid hormone in improving NASH
histological features. To accomplish this aim, NAS will be measured in pre- and post-liver biopsy samples. 2)
To determine the effect of low dose thyroid hormone on mitochondrial FAO, MTP, and mitochondrial health
markers in the liver compared to control. To accomplish this aim, mitochondrial FAO and the expression of
genes supporting mitochondrial health will be measured in the pre- and post-liver biopsy samples. The primary
clinical outcome is histological improvement in NASH measured by improvement in NAS and the secondary
clinical outcome is improvement in fibrosis stage. The mechanistic outcomes include improvements in
mitochondrial FAO, MTP, and quality markers. This project will be conducted in two stages. In stage 1 (proof-
of-concept, 2 years), 32 Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH will be recruited and randomized to either the
active treatment or placebo groups (16/group). At the end of the second year, interim analysis will be
performed based on criteria that will include conditional power analysis for early efficacy to determine the
probability that the full study will yield a statistically significant finding in the primary outcome (histological
improvement in NASH) in the clinically relevant direction. Other milestones include trend in the secondary
outcome, adverse events, and feasibility. The outcome from the proof-of-concept stage will guide the Go or
No-Go decision to stage 2 for continuation of the study with recruitment of additional Veterans for a full 6-year
clinical trial (total recruitment of 128 Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH: 64/active treatment group and
64/placebo control group). This project will exert a sustained and powerful impact in the field by providing new
information and strategies for treatment of NASH that will be highly relevant and impactful to the health of the
Veteran population."
10640937,"Project Summary
Specific interactions between carbohydrates (also known as glycans) and proteins underlie the initiation or
progression of many diseases. Carbohydrate-binding proteins (human, bacterial or viral lectins and adhesins)
and carbohydrate-processing enzymes (glycosyltransferases and glycosidases) are therefore important targets
for therapeutic intervention, however the creation of drug-like molecules that can competitively inhibit
carbohydrate-binding sites is uniquely challenging. The optimization of a glycomimetic inhibitor involves the
synthesis and screening of chemical analogs in an attempt to increase the inhibitory potential and biological
activity. Given that carbohydrate synthesis is notoriously laborious, the task of evaluating innumerable analogs
with incrementally increasing affinities introduces a particularly significant bottleneck for glycomimetic
development. Despite the challenges, the benefit of employing the native carbohydrate as a scaffold is that it
intrinsically confers the desired specificity. The fundamental challenge in the creation of a glycomimetic is that
of divining which modifications will lead to enhanced affinity without compromising specificity.
Computational approaches that are specifically designed to screen analogs of carbohydrates could be
invaluable aids to both increasing the objectivity of the synthetic choices and to prioritizing the synthetic effort
required for glycomimetic development. Virtual screening is commonplace in mainstream medicinal chemistry
and has led to the discovery of non-glycomimetic small molecule inhibitors with nanomolar affinities (12,29).
However, it has yet to be widely applied in glycomimetic design. We believe that this is due to several factors,
including the complexity of carbohydrate structure and nomenclature, which creates a significant barrier for
non-glycoscientists, and, for glycoscientists, a lack of familiarity with sophisticated modeling methods.
In the present application, we propose to develop, validate, and implement an alternative strategy to ligand
docking that leverages the benefits of computational modeling and structural biology. Specifically, we will
develop an online computational approach that uses carbohydrate-protein co-crystal (or NMR) structures as
the basis for lead optimization by modifying the bound oligosaccharide in situ. We have assembled a group of
experimental glycobiologists and chemists who have agreed to provide data and independently validate the
predictive accuracy of the tools we are developing. These scientists have over 200 years of combined
experience in glycomimetic synthesis and evaluation.
Successful completion of the aims will lead to a validated computational tool to aid in the discovery and
optimization of therapeutic agents that target carbohydrate-protein interactions that are particularly relevant in
the ongoing battle against multidrug resistant bacteria."
11057040,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 4.4 million individuals are on community supervision in the United States, with the majority (about
80%) being supervised under probation.1 Justice involved persons (JIPs) have a 474% increased lifetime
experience with heroin, a 303% increased use of OxyContin in the last 12 months, and a 256% increased use in
pain medication in the last 12 months, compared to the general population.3 One important step in addressing
substance use and addiction is getting individuals engaged in the treatment process, as initiation and retention
rates are very low for substance use treatment among this population. Q2i successfully developed the
Probation/Parole And Reentry Coach Application (PARCA) technology, which includes a Justice Team (JT)
Dashboard connected to a mobile app designed for JIPs. The platform enables JIPs to set and manage their
personal goals while assisting them in addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) in order to
facilitate and supplement the substance use treatment process. It provides a step-by-step guide and identifies
local services and resources that the JIPs can connect with to accomplish these goals. At the same time, it gives
the JT a dashboard that enables greater insight on how a JIP is managing their plan. This increased connection
and communication between the JT and the JIP is designed to improve the community supervision process. In
this Phase 1/Phase 2 Fast Track STTR application, Q2i’s PARCA platform will be refined and implemented in
Dallas and Hidalgo Counties to test its efficacy. The primary goal of Phase I is to enhance the PARCA
platform for JIP. The study team will accomplish this by recruiting three sets of 2 PPOs/Case Managers willing
to use PARCA with five of their clients who have used any opioids in the last 12 months (total JIPs = 30) for 2-
weeks. The team will conduct interviews with PPOs and their clients that will inform our user-centered design
iterations. Initial interviews will describe barriers and challenges to successful community supervision
including accessing MOUD treatment and how PARCA can be improved to address these challenges. Follow-
up interviews will describe feasibility (use of the PARCA platform features) and acceptability (engagement
with PARCA platform through user engagement logs) of using PARCA platform to locate and access MOUD
treatment. The overall goal of Phase II is to test the relative efficacy of supervision as usual (SAU) and
PARCA in helping JIPs under community supervision engage in substance use treatment process and reduce
subsequent involvement in criminal behavior. Using a stepped wedge effectiveness design, we will evaluate the
PARCA platform across probation/parole officers (PPOs) (N=60), probationers/parolees (N=600). PPOs will
be randomized in three clusters of 20 people to utilize PARCA. Lastly, we will assess the acceptability and
feasibility of PARCA platform by supervision officers and justice-involved persons (JIPs) and whether
PARCA improves the working alliance between supervisors and JIPs."
10767122,"Stress is a major risk factor for the development of various neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression,
anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which disproportionately affect our military personnel and
Veterans. We have discovered that brain conversion of 17β-estradiol (E2) from circulating testosterone promotes
a maladaptive response to stress in male mice. We have found that the absence of E2 in brain, but not
testosterone per se, underlies this susceptibility. Our preliminary data provides evidence for the effectiveness of
E2 as a novel antidepressant and have established a circuit-based mechanism through which stress interacts
with hypogonadism to mediate depressive-like behavior in males. We hope to translate these basic scientific
discoveries into tangible benefits for military personnel and Veterans of both sexes who urgently need improved
care for stress-related disorders. While E2 is not a viable treatment in human male populations due to its
peripheral side effects, the E2 bioprecursor 10β,17β-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED) overcomes this
limitation by delivering E2 directly to the brain after conversion by NADPH-dependent reductase. Unfortunately,
DHED has poor oral bioavailability, which limits its potential use as a novel therapeutic in patients. We propose
to advance knowledge regarding the role of targeting E2 signaling as a treatment mechanism for stress-induced
neuropsychiatric disorders, and further the discovery of a brain-selective and orally bioavailable prodrug of DHED
based on the previously characterized structure of the molecule.
In Specific Aim #1, we will use rodent models of psychiatric disease treatment effectiveness to further determine
the role of E2 signaling in mediating stress susceptibility in males. These studies will address hypogonadism-
and age-dependent mechanisms of enhanced susceptibility to stress and pathological fear, relevant to
neuropsychiatric conditions that disproportionately affect those who have served in the military. This will help
identify which psychiatric disorders, in addition to depression, may be most amenable to E2-mediated treatment.
In Specific Aim #2, we will assess candidate prodrugs for improved oral bioavailability. We will determine the
oral bioavailability of DHED prodrugs by comparing levels of DHED and E2 in the brain following intravenous
and oral administration in male and female rodents. Those prodrugs that exhibit favorable oral bioavailability and
E2 production in the brain will be tested for in vivo response to E2-related biomarkers and therapeutic efficacy
for stress-related phenotypes.
At completion of our experiments, we will have an improved understanding of the role of estrogen signaling in
depression, PTSD, and other stress-influenced neuropsychiatric conditions in males and have better defined a
novel treatment approach for both males and females with estrogen responsive disorders. Additionally, we will
generate preclinical data that will support a future treatment for military personnel and Veterans suffering from
stress-induced neuropsychiatric conditions."
10720879,"Objectives: Cryptococcus neoformans is the most important fungal pathogen causing CNS-related mortality
and morbidity world-wide. Although CM is generally viewed as a disease caused by weak immunity, evidence
accumulates that exuberant host immune responses significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of CM. To this
end, we developed a murine model of CM that reproduces major features of inflammatory CNS injury in CM
patients and found that the exuberant CNS inflammation, driven by ultra Th1-polarized T cells and
inflammatory monocytes, promotes severe immunopathology with neurological deterioration.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the crucial component of this immunoregulatory network, and their dysfunction
is linked to inflammatory complications of CM in human patients. Our published and unpublished Preliminary
Data now support that Treg play crucial roles in limiting the pathological inflammation within the
Cryptococcus-infected CNS. Our preliminary data further show that Treg specifically express chemokine
receptor CCR8 and that Treg-recruitment kinetics is paralleled by the upregulation of CCR8 ligand chemokine
CCL1, supporting the importance of the CCL1/CCR8 axis in mediating CNS migration of Treg. We show that
among all cellular populations within the CNS, Treg are the major, if not sole producer of the immune-
regulatory cytokine IL-10 and Amphiregulin (Areg), factor known to promote wound healing and tissue repair.
Hypothesis: Hypothesis that CCL1/CCR8-axis-recruited Treg protect against severe CNS damage and
subsequent mortality in mice with CM via production of IL-10 and Areg and that Treg-based immunotherapies
will reduce morbidity and mortality in mice with CM. To test distinct parts of this hypothesis we will:
Aim 1. To demonstrate that CCR8-recruited Treg protect the brain from inflammatory pathology in CM
1.a. determine if Treg limit excessive CNS inflammation during CM, especially reducing pathological elements
of the CNS host response
1.b. define whether and how Treg reduce neuropathological processes in the CM-afflicted brain
1.c. demonstrate the dependence of the CCR8 axis for CNS Treg accumulation and their function during CM.
Aim 2: To define the therapeutic effects of Treg in CM
2.a. demonstrate that Treg enhancement by IL-2 immune complex therapy protects mice from fatal CM
pathology
2.b. determine if CCR8+ versus CCR8- Treg adoptive transfer protects mice from fatal CM pathology
Aim 3: To determine the mechanisms by which Treg limit CNS inflammation and promote
neurological repair during CM
3.a. determine if Treg-derived IL-10 is required for limiting pathological CNS inflammation during CM
3.b. define whether Treg-derived Areg promotes neurological repair during CM.
Research Plan and Methods: This proposal will use our established mouse model of CM, which accurately
recapitulates severe paradoxical immune responses experienced by patients with C. neoformans CNS infection.
We will manipulate Treg system (remove or expand T reg responses, to determine if they would worsen or
improve condition of CM animals, respectively). We will also perform a series of adoptive transfer experiments
with isolated Tregs to determine if their administration would alleviate the symptoms. Finally, we will use T-
cell restricted IL-10 KO mice and T-cell-restricted Amphiregulin KO mice to determine the molecular
mechanism of their anti-inflammatory and CNS protective effect and how they will affect different aspects of
CNS pathology in CM. Overall, these studies will provide significant insight on T cell mediated pathology and
how Tregs oppose this process during fungal CNS infections, that down the road will likely identify new
biomarkers or therapeutic opportunities."
10741779,"Background: Over two decades following the Persian Gulf War, up to 250,000 veterans are still plagued by
chronic conditions. Debilitating respiratory symptoms were neglected in initial studies. However, airway
inflammation with abundant of alveolar macrophages has been discovered, along with diffuse constrictive
bronchiolitis, possibly associated with deployment-related inhalation, but with no infectious etiology. Yet, only
limited investigation into the underlying pathogenesis of Gulf War respiratory illness (GWRI) has been
undertaken and the role of alveolar macrophages and the airway microbiome in GWRI remains unexplored.
 Our group has discovered severe alveolar macrophage dysfunction underlying the pathogenesis of COPD.
Alveolar macrophages in COPD are dramatically hyporesponsive to bacterial antigens. Exacerbation-prone
adults with COPD have significantly diminished pathogen-induced alveolar macrophage function. Moreover,
COPD alveolar macrophages have a fundamental phagocytic defect for respiratory pathogens that is directly
linked to progression of COPD. While impaired innate immune responses and decline in lung function are
integral to COPD, they are not unique to COPD, but rather highlight the key potential contribution of alveolar
macrophage dysfunction to progression of numerous inflammatory lung diseases.
 Hypothesis: Dynamic alveolar macrophage-microbial interactions are fundamental to the pathogenesis of
Gulf War respiratory disease.
 Specific Aims: The following specific aims will be accomplished:
Aim 1: Characterize the human airway microbiome of Gulf War Illness with and without respiratory disease.
Aim 2: Elucidate the role of alveolar macrophage innate immune dysfunction in Gulf War respiratory illness
and the relationship with airway microbiome composition.
Aim 3: Elucidate the relationship of specific deployment exposures, demographics and respiratory disease in
Gulf War Illness.
 Research Design: As GWRI is an exclusively human disease, these studies are designed using alveolar
macrophages obtained from Gulf War participants. Four groups of volunteers will be recruited. Group 1: GWI
with respiratory symptoms. Group 2: GWI without respiratory symptoms. Group 3: Gulf War veterans without
any evidence of GWI. Group 4: non-Gulf War veterans. Groups 3 and 4 provide important controls for Gulf
War exposures. Each participant will undergo bronchoalveolar lavage. Aim 1 will be the first investigation into
the lung microbiome of GWRI. In Aim 2, differences in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, TLR-2 and -4
regulation of inflammation and of transcriptome expression will be determined between groups, and will be
integrated with results from Aim 1 to begin to explore the dynamic interplay between the airway microbiome
and immune dysfunction in GWRI. In Aim 3, demographic and deployment exposures, and pulmonary function
will be investigated and will be integrated with results of Aims 1 and 2.
 Impact: There are no established therapeutics for GWRI and no established benefit from antibiotics,
bronchodilators or steroids. Studies of this proposal are directed at identifying taxa or combinations of taxa,
associated not just with aberrant alveolar macrophage functions, but with select functions chosen from a broad
immunologic array. This approach holds the promise of modulation of select alveolar macrophage function
through transfer of lung microbiota, an approach that has revolutionized the treatment of C. difficile colitis. We
anticipate results of this proposal will lead to regulation of alveolar macrophage function through microbiome
restoration in GWRI, a completely novel approach aimed at interrupting the progression of disease.
 The overall goal of this research is to identify fundamental, modifiable regulatory innate defense
mechanisms of alveolar macrophages in GWRI, to serve as therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes."
10816973,"Only 25% of women in the United States breastfeed exclusively for six months. Insufficient milk
production is a primary cause of premature breastfeeding cessation. Globally, nearly a million annual deaths of
women and children each year could be prevented if all mothers breastfed for six months. Maternal stress due
to infant hospitalization or traumatic birth predisposes women to poor breastfeeding outcomes. The
glucocorticoid (GC) hormone contributes to the stress response by activating the mineralocorticoid (MR) and
glucocorticoid receptors (GR). When GC secretion is dysregulated, as occurs in obesity, lactation initiation is
disrupted leading to poor breastfeeding outcomes. Moreover, synthetic GCs cause a transient suppression of
milk production. The mechanism by which excessive GCs suppress lactation must be defined so that low milk
supply can be prevented or treated.
 In vitro studies suggest that the biphasic regulation of alpha-lactalbumin (LALBA) synthesis by GCs is
central to the pathophysiology of stress-induced lactation suppression. LALBA is a modifier protein required for
lactose synthesis and milk production. The mouse mammary gland explant model will be used to test the
hypothesis that the MR and GR heterodimerize with the Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription
(STAT-3 or -5) to regulate Lalba transcription. Aim 1 will define the effect of GC concentration over time on the
expression of Lalba and its candidate transcriptional regulators. Aim 2 will interrogate DNA-protein binding of
MR, GR with phosphorylated STAT3 or STAT5 at the Lalba promoter. The findings from this research will provide
an absent mechanistic insight into the regulation of milk production by GC and stand to serve as the foundation
for the development of guidelines for the prevention, management, or treatment of insufficient milk supply.
The applicant will train in the outstanding environment at UC Davis with Dr. Russ Hovey, a leading
scientist in the hormonal regulation of lactation, and Dr. Caroline Chantry, a founder of the breastfeeding
medicine field and clinical lactation researcher. The proposed research and training program will establish
research expertise in the molecular genomics of the mammary gland, strengthen knowledge of clinical lactation
and breast health, and provide skills in scientific communication and conduct. The overall training plan aligns
with the recent recommendations from the NIH to increase knowledge and research on safe and effective
therapies for lactating women and will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent physician-scientist
in breastfeeding medicine and lactation biology."
10934383,"Consistent with the vision of the Analytical Validation of a Candidate Biomarker for Neurological
Disease PAR, we assembled a multidisciplinary team and propose to conduct analytical validation of two
emerging TBI biomarkers: Tau and phospho-Tau (P-Tau). Although recently FDA approved a pair of markers
(neuronal cell body marker UCH-L1 and astroglia injury marker GFAP) to diagnose cranial CT abnormality in
mild TBI patients, however, to date, there are no qualified and validated biomarkers linked directly to axonal
degenerative axonal injury and after TBI, especially in the acute and subacute phases after TBU. Emerging
literature evidence and our own data point to blood-based Tau/P-Tau levels can fill these unmet biomarker
needs. We propose two types of context of use (COU) for Tau/ P-Tau as prognostic biomarkers for complicated
mild TBI patients at risk for persistent post-concussive symptoms lasting more than 3 months. While Tau/ P-
Tau are promising TBI prognostic biomarkers, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding Tau/P-Tau
biomarkers, as well as their detection assays. In this proposed study, we will (1) create Tau and P-Tau gold
standards and pooled positive/negative controls samples for use in Tau/P-Tau platform testing and
standardization, (2) assess the analytical performance of new assay platforms for Tau/P-Tau at two analytical
sites, (3) establish the baseline blood levels of Tau and P-Tau in normative controls of different adult age
intervals, (4) provide supportive data for acute/subacute Tau and P-Tau levels as blood-based biomarker for the
indicated COU, (5) establish the temporal profile of blood Tau, P-Tau levels in TBI patients of varying severity
and injury types, and lastly (6) assemble Tau/P-Tau TBI biomarker qualification plan for submission to FDA's
Biomarker Qualification Program."

11193421,"The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) to study women for whom the current pregnancy will lead to their first delivery (nulliparas). Nulliparas comprise about 40% of pregnant women in the United States. Because no information is available from previous pregnancy outcomes to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction are interrelated, and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study.

The NuMoM2b study was a prospective observational study of over 10,000 nulliparous women followed from the first trimester through delivery to understand the mechanism and etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes starting in the first trimester. It was conducted at eight clinical sites including Columbia University, Indiana University, Case Western and Ohio State Universities, University of California at Irvine , University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Northwestern University, and University of Utah. The data coordinating center was Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International  and the Network.  Enrollment of all I0,000 participants was completed in September of 2013 and the last participant delivered May 2014. All study participants underwent serial evaluations including demographics, nutrition, family history , maternal anthropometric measurements, medical history, assessments of psychosocial factors, ultrasound measures of fetal growth, placental function (uterine artery Doppler) and biospecimen collection (maternal serum, plasma, urine, cerv ical/vag in al samples, placenta at delivery)."

10640978,"Compared to civilian students in higher education, student Veterans have high rates of mental health
disorders (PTSD: 40% vs. 9% and Depression: 24% vs 12.1%). As a result, Veterans with mental health disorders
can be more likely to experience academic issues, such as lower enrollment rates and slower degree attainment
on average. In addition, student Veterans with mental health disorders can experience substantial challenges
with the already-difficult transition to the student role, with difficulties related to education planning, academic
skills, and mental health management. Though many student Veterans could benefit from programming
embedded in supported education interventions, current in-person VA supported education treatments are often
difficult to access - or not available locally - for these Veterans. In addition, there is no widely available, VA-
specific online or mobile-app based resource for students, which is a substantial gap in resources for student
Veterans.
 The goal of this SPiRE project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive mobile app for student
Veterans with mental health disorders. This intervention will use the principles of Veteran supported education
research and manualized treatments to develop a personalized academic success app, VetEd, to address a variety
of academic and psychiatric symptom-related educational barriers for student Veterans. Specifically, VetEd will
provide a resource to (1) orient student Veterans with mental health disorders to successfully transition to the
role of student as defined by their self-created educational roadmap, which will include helping students
acquire (2) academic skills, (3) mental health management skills, and (4) up-to-date information on psychiatric,
academic, and financial resources to help them successfully meet higher-education expectations.
 The proposed SPiRE will involve three aims: 1) Developing a Veteran-centered educational support app
by conducting three focus groups (n= 21) with student Veterans with mental health disorders to identify their
perceived academic needs, app preferences, and evaluate Veteran-centered content; 2) Testing and iteratively
revising the VetEd app (n =15) by assessing app software, content, human-computer interface, usability,
satisfaction data, and preliminary exploration of changes in educational functioning (course activity completion,
academic self-efficacy, and retention; and 3) Completing final revisions of the VetEd app for a future grant
application of a larger RCT. This pilot project is significant and innovative in three key respects: (1) it extends
services based in previous, effective supported education research to address both psychiatric and academic
concerns for Veterans with mental health disorders; (2) is potentially cost-effective and easy to disseminate
nationally; and (3) focuses on improving Veterans’ academic functioning and quality of life is substantially
different than current VA mobile app offerings. Results from this pilot project will inform the development of a
Merit Review application for a larger, randomized clinical trial of VetEd with student Veterans."
10474276,"Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. (CogRx) is developing CT1812, a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s disease.
CT1812 is the first highly brain penetrant selective sigma-2 receptor antagonist small molecule. This drug
candidate selectively displaces amyloid-β oligomers bound to neuronal receptors at synapses and protects
synapses from toxic oligomer effects, clearing oligomers from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid. When
administered once daily for 28 days to mild to moderate AD patients, CT1812 significantly increases CSF
concentration of AβOs, increases plasma concentrations of lipids and metabolites, and reduces concentrations
of synaptic degeneration markers in AD patient CSF, consistent with the disease-modifying and
synaptoprotective mechanism of action established in preclinical studies. No other therapeutic currently in
development selectively targets the most toxic form of the Aβ protein – oligomers (AβOs) and has
demonstrated selective clearance of AβO into CSF in AD patients. No other AD drug candidate has
demonstrated normalization of dysregulated protein and lipid/metabolite analytes in AD patient biofluids or
reported reduction of synaptic damage markers in AD patients as much, and as rapidly, as CT1812. We
hypothesize that the effects of oligomer displacement and clearance on cognitive function wil l be
detectable in symptomatic patients, and the effect on disease modification will be detectable in
presymptomatic patients. CogRx discovered CT1812, its mechanism of action and the role of the sigma-2
receptor complex in AD. No other group is pursuing this mechanism of action for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.
CT1812 has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and mild-to moderate AD
patients in placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a trials. Adverse events were predominantly mild and included
headache and GI disturbances. Two doses of CT1812 are currently being evaluated in follow-on safety trials in
mild to moderate AD patients (Q.D. for 6 months, MMSE 18-26). These same two doses will be tested in early
AD patients (MMSE 20-30) in the current trial, with treatment duration extended to 18 months. This project
proposes to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of two doses of CT1812 in patients with early AD (MMSE 20-30, corresponding to FDA late stage 2
to early stage 4) given q.d. over 18 months. This trial will determine whether CT1812 beneficially affects
cognition as measured by CDR-SB and other secondary cognitive measures, as well as measuring the impact
of CT1812 on biomarkers of target engagement (CSF concentrations of Aβ oligomers and synaptic
degeneration proteins) and disease modification (CSF concentrations of total tau and NfL, serum NfL as well
as hippocampal and whole brain volume change by MRI). Completion of this study in early AD patients will
inform the design and methods of the subsequent long term disease modification Phase 3 trials with CT1812."
10721351,"Diabetes is a costly and complex chronic illness and a serious public health problem. Currently, the prevalence
of diabetes in the VA patient population is approximately 25%, with many more Veterans at risk for diabetes due
to obesity, aging, and poor lifestyle, as well as exposure to known diabetogenic chemicals in the line of duty.
The number of Veterans with diabetes is certain to increase over the next decades, as the children of today have
an estimated overall lifetime risk of developing diabetes of nearly 50%. Therefore, developing new methods for
preventing diabetes and identifying and properly treating diabetic patients is very timely and of great significance.
By definition, diabetes occurs when insufficient insulin is produced from the β-cells of the pancreas to properly
stimulate the body cells to take up glucose from the blood and shut off production of more glucose. While they
have different etiologies, the pathophysiology of type 1 (immune-mediated) and type 2 (obesity-related) diabetes
is increasingly being linked by dysfunctional cellular and molecular signaling processes that act in the insulin-
secreting β-cells. One molecule that is a cornerstone of our research program, termed Gαz, has the potential to
act as a hub in one or more signaling processes impacting on β-cell function, replication, growth and/or survival.
Thus, targeting these dysfunctional Gαz signaling processes could potentially help to improve functional β-cell
mass in both types of diabetes. Our long-term goal is to fully characterize the Gαz activation and signaling
pathways in the diabetic state at the organismal, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels, guiding us in modulating
this pathway for preventative and therapeutic purposes. The overall objective of this work, which is the next
logical step in pursuit of our goal, is to characterize the molecular and cellular signaling pathways responsible
for the impact of Gαz signaling on diabetes pathophysiology. Our central hypothesis is activated β-cell Gαz
negatively modulates specific intracellular and autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways critical for β-cell
compensation, ultimately leading to β-cell death and dysfunction and exacerbating the diabetic condition. We
will test our central hypothesis in multiple pre-clinical models of diabetes and, thereby, accomplish the objective
of this application, by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1. Determine the requirement of islet CCKAR
and/or GLP1R in the T2D protection of full-body Gαz-null mice and the mechanisms behind this
protection; And 2. Determine the molecular mechanisms downstream of constitutively-active and
agonist-stimulated EP3 and how these are altered in the highly-compensating and T2D beta-cell. In both
aims, the relationship between agonist-dependent and -independent signaling of EP3 splice variants in islet
responsiveness to GLP1-RAs will be determined. With the completion of these aims, we anticipate a much more
complete understanding of the role of the β-cell and its signaling molecules in the pathophysiology of diabetes.
Ultimately, isolating Gαz effects to the β-cell and fully characterizing its signaling mechanisms will aid in rationally
and specifically targeting this pathway in the β-cell to improve diabetic β-cell dysfunction and loss of functional
β-cell mass."
10721823,"Alzheimer's disease, a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease of aging and the most common form
of dementia, affects an estimated 30 million people worldwide. Pathologically, Alzheimer's disease is
defined by the presence of both amyloid plaques comprised of the protein amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary
tangles containing the protein tau in disease affected brain regions. However, more than half of Alzheimer's
disease patients also exhibit TDP-43 aggregates as an additional co-pathology. The presence of TDP-43
pathology in Alzheimer's disease correlates with hippocampal sclerosis, worse brain atrophy, more severe
cognitive impairment, and more rapid cognitive decline. Given the recent recognition of TDP-43 as a
frequent co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease, understanding its contribution to neurodegenerative disease
processes and potential synergies with other pathological disease-promoting proteins is a critical need in
the field. Recent work using C. elegans found that co-expressed tau and TDP-43 leads to increased
neurotoxicity and pathological protein accumulation. Building on this foundation, the proposed Aims will
develop and utilize new models of co-expressed tau and TDP-43 in order to understand the biology
underlying their synergistic toxicity. Aim 1 will define tau isoform and TDP-43 protein domain requirements
for enhanced neurotoxicity using precision gene editing, combined with sensitive behavioral and
neuroimaging assays in C. elegans. Aim 2 will use a new mouse model of tau and TDP-43 co-expression to
map neuronal vulnerabilities, pathological protein accumulation, and neurodegeneration through aging in
the mammalian brain. We will also determine cell specific responses to co-morbid tau and TDP-43 using
spatial transcriptomics. This work will characterize mechanisms underlying tau and TDP-43 neurotoxicity in
Alzheimer's disease and identify new therapeutic targets and strategies. Completion of this project will
significantly advance understanding of Alzheimer's disease with comorbid TDP-43, and provide the
groundwork for future therapeutic development targeting TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease."
10758190,"Project Summary/Abstract
C9orf72 expansion mutations are the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (C9-FTD), a
fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disease. C9-FTD is most commonly neuropathologically characterized
by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (C9-FTLD) and the accumulation of phospho-TDP-43 (pTDP-43)
inclusions in neurons and glia. In C9-FTLD, the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is affected early in the
disease course, and individuals with mOFC lesions phenocopy patients with FTD, suggesting that mOFC
dysfunction impacts FTD clinical phenotypes. In disease, the mOFC exhibits pTDP-43 inclusions, neuronal
degeneration, and neuroinflammation, including the development of pathologic microglia. In other diseases,
pathologic microglia increase extracellular glutamate and induce death in excitatory neurons. However, these
factors’ relative contributions to C9-FTLD pathogenesis are not well understood, and the molecular profiles of
degenerating neurons (termed vulnerable neurons) and pathologic microglia in the mOFC are unknown.
We hypothesize that in C9-FTLD, pathologic microglia contribute to the selective degeneration of
vulnerable populations of excitatory neurons, resulting in dementia. This proposal aims to use
transcriptomic methods to identify vulnerable neuron and pathologic microglia subtypes and characterize their
molecular profiles, spatial distributions, and interactions that may be contributing to disease progression. To
this end, Aim #1 will use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify and characterize the pathologic microglia
subtypes that arise and the vulnerable neuron subtypes that degenerate in C9-FTLD. Cellular proximity is the
basis for intercellular interactions, and Aim #2 will use spatial transcriptomics to identify where these pathologic
microglia and vulnerable neurons are spatially distributed as well as their spatial proximities in relation to each
other and to pTDP-43 inclusions.
A better understanding of how C9-FTLD changes neurons’ and microglia’s gene expression patterns, their
spatial distributions, and their interactions may lead to strategies to protect cells from disease and patients
from dementia. These studies will emphasize how pathologic microglia can contribute to neurodegeneration,
enabling the development of microglia-targeted therapies for C9-FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Through this project, I will develop expertise in the use of histological and computational techniques. My
sponsor, Dr. Edward Lee, is committed to my training and success as a physician-scientist."

The BRAIN Initiative is supporting a broad portfolio of neuroscience research aimed at revolutionizing our
understanding of the brain. The sharing of data obtained from this research is critical both to leveraging this
major public investment and to ensuring the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded research. We propose a
renewal of support for the OpenNeuro data archive, which provides a platform for the storage, processing, and
sharing of neuroimaging data collected as part of the BRAIN Initiative. OpenNeuro enables researchers to easily
share a broad range of neuroscience data types, based on the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard for
organizing datasets. The platform shares data openly and provides researchers with several avenues to access
and reuse the data. In the renewal period we propose to continue supporting a high level of performance for the
archive, and to extend the work done in the initial grant period. First, we will provide a specialized portal for
BRAIN Initiative investigators, which will help more clearly link their research to funding sources, and to provide
them with the ability to more flexibly select an appropriate data use agreement. We will also implement enhanced
user profiles, linking shared datasets to standard researcher identities through the ORCID system. Second, we
will enhance the ability to search for datasets by improving the ability for researchers to specify metadata that is
linked to standard ontologies. Third, will improve the reusability of OpenNeuro datasets by providing support for
the sharing of derivative data as well as statistical models, and by providing preprocessed data and quality
control reports. Together, these improvements will sustain the success of the OpenNeuro archive and provide
neuroscientists with increasingly usable data to address fundamental problems of brain function and health."

10485552,"Malignant melanoma is one of the top five cancers in Veterans. If diagnosed early, like the
majority of melanomas in the U.S., it is highly curable with local surgery alone in the outpatient
setting. In contrast, clinically aggressive melanoma, defined in this proposal as tumor stage
pT1b, requires sentinel lymph node biopsy under general anesthesia and has a worse
prognosis, accounting for a double the number of melanoma deaths compared to early-stage
disease. There are no melanoma screening guidelines, and thus, there is a critical need for
personalized easy-to-use approaches for melanoma screening to improve health outcomes and
reduce treatment costs. Dr. Rebecca Hartman is a clinical dermatologist and researcher in
epidemiology and health services research who seeks to improve melanoma screening
approaches through personalization of risk assessment in a clinically applicable manner. The
aims of this CDA-2 proposal are to (1) create and validate a clinical risk prediction model for
clinically aggressive melanoma in Veterans and (2) create a genetic risk prediction model for
clinically aggressive melanoma in Veterans and validate a combined genetic and clinical risk
prediction model in an external civilian cohort. Aim 1 will conduct logistic regression analyses to
examine for associations between potential phenotypic risk factors and clinically aggressive
melanoma, including demographics, co-morbidities, disease history, immunosuppression,
military history, environmental exposures, and healthcare utilization. This aim will produce an
easy-to-use clinical risk prediction model for clinically aggressive melanoma that is specific to
Veterans and can be integrated into the electronic health record. Aim 2 will conduct a candidate
gene analysis of previously established cutaneous melanoma SNP risk factors as well as
GWAS to examine for novel genetic risk factors for clinically aggressive melanoma. Cox
proportional hazards regression will be used to create a polygenic risk score for clinically
aggressive melanoma and model performance will be evaluated using decile percentiles of risk
and ROC curve. This aim will produce a polygenic risk score for clinically aggressive melanoma.
Subsequently, the combined clinical and genetic risk prediction model will be validated in an
independent civilian cohort using the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Future directions include
a clinical trial of the clinical risk prediction model, integrated into the electronic health record, to
examine prospective real-world model performance as well as examination of any novel genetic
associations found in GWAS for potential therapeutic applications. This clinical risk prediction
tool will help VA clinicians select patients to triage to dermatology for melanoma screening. The
mentorship, research, and training programs described in this CDA-2 application will propel Dr.
Hartman’s career as an independent VA-based dermato-epidemiologic researcher. Her
mentorship team includes Drs. Mary Brophy, Maryam Asgari, Michael Gaziano, Nathanael
Fillmore, and Luc Djousse, who are experts in oncology, dermato-epidemiology, epidemiology,
genetic epidemiology, and big data analysis from the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) and the Harvard Dermatology Program. Through
this CDA-2 application, Dr. Hartman will develop skills in big data analysis, risk prediction
modeling, and genetic epidemiology as well as undergoing professional development to prepare
her to apply for a VA Merit Award and continue toward becoming an independent VA-based

10721765,"Abstract:
Many cell types together assemble the functional circuitry of the human brain. For over a century, neuroscientists
have categorized brain cell types by their features, including shape, position, physiology, molecules, and
function. Single cell transcriptomics studies are now defining molecular cell types at a resolution not previously
possible, uncovering a taxonomy of hundreds to thousands of brain cell types. These studies have also revealed
dramatic differences in molecular signatures of homologous cell types across species, showing decisively that
the difference between mouse and human brain is not simply the total number of neurons. However, the function
of each cell class or type in brain circuitry, and dysfunction in disease, is only beginning to be evaluated. To
characterize the roles of human brain cell classes in normal function and disease, it is critical that tools be
developed to allow genetic access to cell classes in vivo. Such tools would enable precise therapeutic gene
delivery to brain cell classes, permitting targeted treatment for class-specific etiologies like some epilepsies.
Few genetic tools are available to mark and manipulate cell classes and types in non-genetically tractable
species like human and non-human primate (NHP). Viruses including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs),
containing cell class and type selective enhancers can be leveraged to gain genetic access to, and drive gene
expression in specific brain cell classes in these species. We have initiated a project through the BRAIN Initiative
to generate and validate reporter AAVs to mark specific cell classes in the mouse cortex in vivo and in human
neocortical tissue ex vivo. Our groups have engineered AAV vectors and optimized capsids to access neurons
and express transgenes in many discrete cell classes and types in mouse and primate. New and improved AAV
tools promise to fuel human brain scientific discovery and clinical progress, but one impediment has been the
costly and time-consuming process of validating new vectors in primates.
We present three Aims to translate these promising new AAV vectors into a high-value set of primate-optimized
tools that could eventually be used for gene therapies in humans. First, we will develop a platform for screening
AAV vectors in NHP ex vivo brain slices, followed by individual validation of promising vectors in NHP in vivo
and human ex vivo brain slice cultures. Second, we will identify optimal AAV capsids to: a) support widespread
NHP neuronal transduction in vivo when applied intravenously or to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), two preferred
routes of delivery for human CNS gene therapy, and b) support AAV transduction of human primary brain tissue
ex vivo. Third, we will perform proof-of-concept experiments using cell class-selective vectors to express a
therapeutic transgene in defined classes to treat a severe and intractable form of childhood epilepsy called
Dravet syndrome (DS). These experiments represent a significant step towards converting cell class-selective
AAVs into first-in-class viral tools optimized for in vivo NHP brain studies and human gene therapy applications."
11057291,"PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC
The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication
and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and
standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare
the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the
continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA
(ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful
consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure
that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim
2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol;
some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will
reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of
revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on
coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature
committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene
nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming
genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in
chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other
species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of
machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate
orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both
explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates
in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and
account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with
experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family
to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the
glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts
to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well-
studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing
systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice;
this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health."

10721341,"Overall Research Strategy: To ensure aging Veterans remain active and mobile with as little musculoskeletal
pain as possible, new approaches to the prevention of osteoporosis and promotion of timely bone regeneration
following a fracture are necessary. This collaborative research study brings together a group of VA investigators
with diverse perspectives, insights, models, and techniques, to synergistically attack a major clinical problem
that leads to high morbidity and mortality among Veterans, a bone fracture. The overall research strategy of each
integrated project is to use pre-clinical models of a disease that either weakens bone or delays bone repair, to
investigate novel ways to utilize or enhance the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to promote bone formation,
and to assess disease and treatment effects on bone in a unified, stringent manner. Already under-diagnosed
and under-treated, osteoporosis is likely to increase the number of fragility fractures being treated at VA hospitals
without novel tools for early detection and novel treatment strategies that circumvent the rare but devastating
side effects of current therapies that inhibit bone loss. Addressing this unmet clinical need, the overall aims are
to identify therapeutic strategies to improve bone health among Veterans and to enhance the bone anabolism of
PTH signaling. The collaboration will address this overarching hypothesis: health problems disproportionately
affecting Veterans activate signaling pathways that increase bone resorption, suppress bone formation, or
impede the transition of cartilage to bone in a fracture callus such that improvements in the clinical management
of osteoporosis lie in understanding how these health problems hurt bone health.
Project Research Strategy: The traditional clinical standard of care for fracture prevention, is to screen for
osteoporosis late in the course of the disease, after bone has been denuded and fracture is imminent, before
resorting to anti-osteoporotic pharmacotherapies. Such therapies however, are inefficient at regenerating lost
bone, and bone quality, an important aspect of load bearing strength, often remains deficient. Thus, the clinical
standard of care is frequently inadequate and many patients ultimately go on to sustain a fracture, irrespective
of therapy. Compounding the problem, anti-resorptives (especially bisphosphonates) have significant immediate,
as well as rare, but serious long-term side-effects, making for poor compliance and refusal to initiate therapy.
Given this array of issues associated with late drug intervention, this project will investigate whether “a stich in
time, saves nine”, by examining if early prophylaxis using anti-catabolic drugs, anabolic drugs and a non-
pharmacological nutritional supplement, to prevent bone loss from occurring early in the etiology of the disease,
is more effective at preventing bone fracture than late therapy after bone has already been denuded and
regeneration is more difficult. We will study two maladies associated with increased fracture incidence and that
disproportionally affect Veterans. 1. Postmenopausal Osteoporosis, the archetypal bone disease of women and
an escalating problem in the VA healthcare system given women are the most rapidly increasing demographic.
2. Immune reconstitution bone loss (IRBL) which is caused by antiretroviral therapy (ART) used to treat HIV
infection. We will test in mouse models, the hypothesis that short-term intervention to preserve bone mass during
the early course of the disease, is superior to the traditional standard of care approach of withholding
interventions until the skeleton has been seriously denuded, before intervening with pharmacologic approaches
that are inherently inefficient at rejuvenating lost bone, and at best delay rather than prevent fractures. We will
leverage our VA collaborative partners to synergistically expand the depth and scope of our studies and allow
us to perform extensive state-of-the-art bone phenotyping to assess bone structure, quality and fracture
resistance in the two-model system. Should our studies reveal a significant advantage for early therapy, this
would support studies future studies in humans towards a change in the standard of care for fracture prevention."
10907404,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The most pressing issue with hearing aids and cochlear implants is that they function poorly in noisy
environments for most users, where even mild hearing loss can make it difficult to ignore background sound.
Suppression of unwanted sound is crucial for communication in social settings, such as the workplace. Inability
to understand speech in these situations, called masking, can lead to social isolation and reduced employment.
Two principal types of masking interfere with optimal function of hearing aids and cochlear implants. The first
type, called energetic masking, is well characterized through psychophysics, physiology and modeling. The
second type, called informational masking, is currently only defined as a psychological construct and much less
understood. Energetic masking occurs when target speech and background sound excite the same auditory nerve
fibers at the same time. Even an ideal listener would be mostly unable to recover an energetically masked target.
In contrast, informational masking occurs even when target and background sound do not overlap in time and
frequency, and when an ideal listener could restore the target information. Informational masking thus holds a
key to improved hearing aid and cochlear implant design. Moreover, individual listeners differ dramatically in
their ability to suppress informational masking. However, hearing aids and cochlear implants only intend to
mitigate energetic masking, ignoring vulnerability to informational masking. Towards improved fitting of
hearing aids and cochlear implants, we propose to develop an objective scale of vulnerability to informational
masking based on cortical function.
We propose to examine cortical mechanisms of informational masking in humans and in an animal model
organism of human auditory processing, the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). First, we will test
normal-hearing human listeners as well as gerbils under conditions of informational masking and
simultaneously record from auditory cortex. In humans, we will record the hemodynamic response of blood
oxygenation, using a quick and robust assessment technique with clinical relevance. In gerbils, we will measure
neuronal activity in auditory cortex from trained animals. We will use this data to develop an objective metric of
an individual’s vulnerability to informational masking. Second, we will examine the neuronal mechanisms of
informational masking by introducing rapid unpredictable changes in background sound and assessing if high
vulnerability to informational masking is due to predominant reliance on suppressing background activity (as
opposed to enhanced responses to the target) in humans and gerbils. Third, using our animal model, we will test
how hearing loss affects susceptibility to informational masking.
Collectively, this proposal will functionally define informational masking at both perceptual and cortical
processing levels. The results are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the origins and scope
of this central auditory processing deficit in common everyday situations with background sound."
10721340,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a globally prevalent disease, especially among US
veterans. NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are recognized as hepatic manifestations of
metabolic syndrome. The disease progression from simple steatosis to NASH, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is promoted by multiple-hit instead of two-hit, including disruption of intrahepatic
bile acid (BA) homeostasis, aberrant activation of the innate immune response, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,
and dysbiosis. Although much new information on the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH has been gained during
the last decade, no effective therapy has been developed due to the incomplete understanding of the
pathogenesis of this complex disease. Considering the rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence worldwide
of fatty liver diseases, the development of new therapeutic interventions for NAFLD is especially urgent and is
the long-term objective of this application. BAs are important signaling molecules involved in regulating lipid,
glucose, and energy metabolism by activating nuclear receptors and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such
as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), TGR5, and sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). We have reported that
conjugated primary BAs activate the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways via Gαi protein-coupled S1PR2. It also has
been reported that phosphorylation of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) by ERK1/2 increases nuclear sphingosine-
1 phosphate (S1P) levels. Nuclear S1P is a potent endogenous inhibitor of specific histone deacetylase 1 &2
(HDAC1 and 2). Inhibition of HDAC1 has been reported to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation. BAs are also
important modulators of innate immunity. Our previous studies reported that deletion of S1PR2 or SphK2 in
hepatocytes significantly increased lipid accumulation. Both S1PR2-/- and SphK2-/- mice are more prone to
western diet (WD)-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In the liver, both S1PR2 and SphK2 are highly
expressed in hepatocytes, macrophages, and cholangiocytes. A recent study reported that SphK2-generated
S1P activated an anti-inflammatory response by suppressing the stimulator of type 1 interferon gene (STING)
signaling in macrophages. It has also been reported that hepatic STING expression is upregulated in NASH
patients and activation of STING in macrophages contributes to NASH disease progression. Our preliminary
data further indicate that serum BA composition and levels were significantly changed in a diet-induced mouse
NASH model, which was similar to the finding in human NASH patients. Furthermore, the expression of SphK2
was significantly down-regulated, but the expression of STING was upregulated in the livers of human NASH
patients and the NASH mouse model. Therefore we HYPOTHESIZE that BA-mediated activation of
S1PR2/SphK2 is pivotal in the maintenance of hepatic lipid homeostasis and modulation of innate
immune response under metabolic stress. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1:
To investigate the role and mechanisms of BA-mediated activation of S1PR2/SphK2 in regulating hepatic lipid
metabolism during NASH disease progression. Aim 2: To define the role of BA-mediated activation of
S1PR2/SphK2 in modulating the innate immune response under metabolic stress and further identify the
underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms. The hepatic cell-specific knockout mice of S1PR2 and SphK2 and a
well-characterized western diet plus sugar water (WDSW)-induced NASH mouse model will be used.
Completion of this study will not only identify the potential novel cellular/molecular mechanisms in the initiation
and progression of NAFLD/NASH but will also make a significant conceptual advance linking BAs and
sphingolipids with metabolic diseases which will create a fundamental base for developing novel therapies for
NAFLD/NASH. Therefore, the subject matter of this proposal is timely, clinically significant, and directly fits into
the mission of the US Veteran's Administration."
10896474,"Corticosteroids provide an important drug class for treatment of numerous forms of heart failure and chronic
inflammation, together affecting over 432 million people. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), drugs that
target corticosteroid receptors are used to treat heart and skeletal muscle. Our lab developed a first-in-class
dissociative steroid that shows efficacy as both a heart-protective and anti-inflammatory drug. Our work in the
mdx mouse model of DMD was critical for moving this drug, vamorolone, into DMD clinical trials (now in Phase
2b). In early cell and animal studies, vamorolone showed anti-inflammatory efficacy while avoiding key side
effects. Subsequently, we discovered new readouts of drug activity and important impacts of corticosteroids on
dystrophic hearts. Cardiomyopathy is a feature of both the severe muscle disease DMD (caused by loss of
dystrophin) and the milder muscle disease Becker muscular dystrophy (dystrophin in-frame deletions). As
promising new therapies are being developed that seek to convert severe DMD genotypes into milder Becker-
like phenotypes, importance of treating dystrophic hearts should grow because cardiomyopathy is the leading
cause of Becker mortality. Moving forward, it will be important to address knowledge gaps regarding the
mechanisms of selective steroids, roles of specific steroid receptors in the heart, and impacts of steroids on
Becker-like hearts. This knowledge is important because cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of DMD mortality
and current corticosteroids have problematic safety profiles.
Our long-term goal is to dissect mechanisms of steroid signaling that can be selectively targeted to improve
treatment of chronic pediatric diseases. This can greatly improve outcomes for DMD in a way that also impacts
much larger groups of heart, muscle and inflammatory diseases. The objective of this grant is to dissect
mechanisms of corticosteroid receptors that impact dystrophic cardiomyopathy. The advanced expertise and
tools developed by our lab place us in a unique position to accomplish this using a combination of cell culture,
receptor mutation, tissue-specific knockout, micro-dystrophin gene therapy, and animal model systems. We
propose the central hypothesis that 11β-hydroxysteroid agonists activate receptor transactivation to drive
progression of dystrophic heart pathology. Our rationale is that identifying corticosteroid mechanisms which
can be selectively targeted will provide a basis for the improved treatment of DMD and other diseases with
heart failure or chronic inflammation."
11042932,"Understanding protein mutations requires learning which specific mutations disrupt a protein's function and offers the
opportunity to further understand how to restore the normal function by introducing additional mutations. The approach
here builds upon analyzing the huge protein sequence and structure data with two novel statistical frameworks, including
high-dimensional Potts model inference with structure information, and inference on matrix-valued partial correlations,
to develop quantitative predictions of which mutants disrupt function with a new uncertainty measure and models the
mutation finesses by integrating the sequence and structure data. Together these innovative approaches with the
uncertainty quantification will enable the prediction of compensatory mutations and the final construction of a protein
mutant atlas that broadly disseminates the collective mutation information. The project will learn which mutants disrupt
protein function, and what additional mutants will restore function. This project will demystify the interdependencies
within the sequences to yield a deeper understanding of how protein mutations can change phenotypes. Preliminary
results demonstrate how mutations that are intrinsically destabilizing, and destructive can persist but be neutralized by
the introduction of additional compensatory mutations. The major aims of this project are to reliably distinguish
between the neutral and deleterious mutations and learn how to repair these problems by introducing additional
compensating mutations, by applying the new statistical inference frameworks. The tools developed in this project will
have the power to make direct connections between gene mutations and changes in phenotypes. This is a highly
interdisciplinary collaboration essential for establishing meaningful assessments of protein mutations and that will
develop an important tool for informed protein editing."
10654004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This goal of this K01 is to provide the mentorship and training for Dr. Sarah Gordon to become an independent
investigator studying access to mental health services among low-income populations. Nationally, 1 in 8
women experience symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), and rates of PPD are twice as high among
women enrolled in Medicaid compared to commercially-insured women. This research examines the effects of
postpartum Medicaid eligibility and benefit policies on PPD care among low-income women using a two-phase
explanatory mixed-methods design. Aims 1 and 2 will analyze secondary data from a novel linked database of
all payer claims data, birth certificates, and individual-level income data, consistent with NIMH's strategic
objective to combine data from multiple sources to identify underserved groups. Using a regression
discontinuity design, Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of retaining Medicaid eligibility beyond the pregnancy-
related eligibility limit of 60 days postpartum on PPD screening, diagnosis, and treatment rates in the
postpartum year. Aim 2 will use a difference-in-differences approach to measure the effects of Medicaid
reimbursement for PPD screening during well-child visits on PPD screening, diagnosis, and treatment rates in
the postpartum year, comparing outcomes among women who maintain versus lose Medicaid eligibility
postpartum. Aims 1 and 2 will implement multi-level modeling techniques to examine county-level moderators
of policy effects. In Aim 3, I will conduct qualitative interviews with key policy informants, providers, and patient
focus groups to explore how postpartum Medicaid policies impact access to PPD services. Purposive
qualitative sampling will be guided by county-level moderators of policy effects observed in Aims 1 and 2 and a
ZIP-code level geospatial cluster analysis of PPD screening and treatment rates. Dr. Sarah Gordon is an
assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. She has four key training objectives: (1)
acquire content expertise in the organization and delivery of mental health services, with a focus on maternal
mental health; (2) obtain skills in mixed-methods research; (3) develop expertise in qualitative data collection
and analysis, and (4) acquire skills to measure and map area-level variation in policy effects. Postpartum
mental health conditions are a leading cause of preventable postpartum maternal morbidity and mortality. The
goal of this proposal is to examine the effects of Medicaid policies in order to increase detection and treatment
of PPD, thereby improving postpartum mental health. This research aligns with NIMH's high priority research
area on women's mental health during the perinatal period and is responsive to the NIMH Strategic Plan
priority to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH research by testing approaches for reducing empirically
documented disparities in care access for socioeconomically disadvantaged persons."
10720887,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is devastating and most often affects younger Veterans. There is significant long-term
morbidity, a shortened life span, and a high financial burden. Because of the poor regenerative capacity of the
spinal cord, development of early interventions that minimize secondary tissue injury is a priority. A major
contribution to secondary tissue damage and the initiation of neuropathic pain is the inflammatory cascade
triggered by activated glial cells (microglia and astroglia). This cascade begins immediately after SCI with glial
release of cytokines, reactive species, and vasoactive substances. This secretome produces damage to
neurons, oligodendrocytes and other cells at and beyond the level of injury through direct cytotoxic
mechanisms or indirectly through the promotion of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema, vascular compromise, and
tissue ischemia. These inflammatory mediators also trigger pathways that lead to chronic pain. The
inflammatory cascade is further accelerated by glial production of chemokines which recruit peripheral immune
cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, within the acute phase of injury. A major driver of the initial glial
response is HuR, an RNA regulator that promotes expression of key inflammatory mediators through
posttranscriptional mechanisms. Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS contain
adenine- and uridine-rich elements in the 3’ untranslated region (ARE) to which HuR binds and positively
regulates their expression. Our prior work in SCI shows that HuR is activated in the acute phase of SCI and
exacerbates injury when overexpressed in glia. Our team has developed a novel class of small molecule HuR
inhibitors that blocks induction of inflammatory mediators in glial cells. In a pilot study of SCI using a mid-
thoracic contusion model, we observed attenuation of clinical deficits and neuronal loss with the prototype HuR
inhibitor, SRI-42127. We also found that SRI-42127 reduced allodynic pain in a peripheral nerve injury model.
In this proposal we hypothesize that HuR drives expression of a pro-inflammatory and toxic secretome
by resident glia that is triggered in the early stages of SCI, and that inhibiting HuR will reduce
secondary tissue injury, improve motor outcome and reduce neuropathic pain. We propose 3 specific
aims: (1) Further characterize the beneficial effect of HuR inhibition by SRI-42127on SCI recovery, (2) Assess
mechanisms by which HuR inhibition improves recovery after SCI, and (3) Assess the contribution of glial HuR
to inflammatory responses and tissue injury in SCI. The long term objectives of this proposal are to advance
our small molecule HuR inhibitors as a therapy in acute SCI and to gain a mechanistic understanding of how
ARE-mediated post-transcriptional regulation impacts SCI (secondary tissue injury, motor recovery and
neuropathic pain). The innovation of this proposal is the investigation of a novel class of HuR inhibitors for
therapeutically targeting the acute inflammatory response in SCI and the mechanistic investigation of post-
transcriptional pathways (to date essentially unexplored) in SCI. The significance of this application is its
focus on a treatment approach that might eventually be used in the battlefield at the time of acute injury as our
preclinical studies indicate excellent and fast penetration of SRI-42127 into the central nervous system with
peripheral administration, and a mitigating effect on neuronal loss and neuropathic pain. The signfiicance
extends beyond SCI as the same HuR-regulated pathways drive neuroinflammation in other acute CNS
injuries (e.g. traumatic brain injury or stroke) and chronic neurological diseases (e.g. ALS and Alzheimers)."
10720889,"Current treatment options for the spectrum of cognitive disorders brought about by vascular disease, termed
vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), are limited due to a fundamental gap in
understanding the underlying mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to elucidate key mechanistic drivers of VCID
to identify potential therapeutic targets. The objective of this application is to explore the mechanisms underlying
the role of brain insulin in vascular function in a model of insulin resistance and VCID. The central hypothesis is
that elevated levels of endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) reduces insulin transport and
signaling contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction and VCID. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data
produced in the applicant’s laboratory. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the
mechanisms underlying reduced brain insulin levels and signaling and its impact on vascular function may lead
to innovative approaches to ameliorate VCID. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
test the hypothesis that elevated levels of PTP1B in endothelial cells reduces brain insulin levels and signaling,
thereby reducing vascular function and 2) test the hypothesis that increasing brain insulin levels restores
cerebrovascular function reversing VCID. Under Aim 1, insulin levels/signaling using molecular techniques and
structural/functional changes using multiphoton imaging in capillaries will be assessed in young and middle-aged
transgenic mice lacking PTP1B in endothelial cells on either a standard diet or high-fat diet (model of insulin
resistance). Under Aim 2, cerebrovascular function, assessed via measuring cerebral blood flow, neuronal
activity, and cognition, and functional recovery, assessed via evaluating survival, neurological, and sensorimotor
function, will be examined in a young and middle-aged insulin resistant mouse model of VCID (middle cerebral
artery occlusion model of stroke). The approach is innovative because of the study design, combination of
methods, use of intranasal insulin, and focus on PTP1B as a mechanism underlying reduced brain insulin
levels/signaling and vascular dysfunction associated with VCID. The proposed research is significant because it
is expected to lead to the development of therapies targeted to key mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular
dysfunction and VCID."
10761693,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Veterans and ischemic heart disease-related
congestive heart failure is among the most common conditions for hospitalization. With aging along with
prevalent risk factors such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and hypertension,
ischemic heart disease is a cardiac malady that is linked to a variety of pathologies, such as coronary
arteriosclerosis and coronary thrombosis. Activated protein C (APC) was first identified as a natural
anticoagulant enzyme. Besides its anticoagulant activity, APC exerts cytoprotective effects such as anti-
inflammatory and anti-apoptosis. We revealed that APC activity was decreased in the heart during
ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), and APC receptor EPCR was impaired in aging. Intriguingly,
administration of APC can stabilize EPCR from shedding by I/R and strengthen cardiac tolerance to
ischemic insults in aging. However, the mechanism involved in cardioprotection stimulated by APC is still
unclear. The objective of this project is to illustrate the mechanism by which APC mediates
cardioprotection against ischemic injury, and characterize the APC signaling in myocardial infarct veteran
patients versus healthy veterans. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cardioprotective signaling, was
activated in APC treated mouse heart. Moreover, I/R-induced stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK)
signaling was attenuated by APC treatment. We hypothesize that APC protects against myocardial
ischemic injury by triggering crucial signaling pathways to modulate substrates metabolism and reducing
inflammatory response under ischemic stress. Two specific aims will be addressed to test the hypothesis:
(1) to characterize the role of APC derivatives in cardiac inflammatory response during reperfusion injury
in aging; (2) to determine the mechanisms by which APC modulates glucose metabolism and redox
homeostasis that responsible for the inflammatory response in the ischemic heart. APC signaling could be
impaired in myocardial infarction Veteran patients versus healthy Veterans. We will elucidate which
domains of APC is critical for its cardioprotection against I/R injury, which will provide evidence that
recombinant APC can be used for therapy of ischemic heart disease without the risk of bleeding.
VETERANS HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease, which affects approximately one million
Americans each year, is most often caused by ischemic insults leading to myocardial damage. This grant
pursues studies to explore the signaling mechanisms underlying APC’s role in inhibiting inflammation
thereby modulating the heart’s response to ischemic insults. The results could lead to novel therapeutic
strategies aimed at limiting cardiac damage for myocardial infarction Veteran patients."
10911774,"This application responds to the RFA titled, “Understanding Skeletal Effects of Type 1 Diabetes”, FOA RFA-
DK-18-002. Low-trauma (osteoporotic) fractures are epidemic in the U.S. and the world(1-7). About 50% of the
variation in risk of these fractures is due to low bone density, and the remaining 50% is due to defective
mechanical properties of bone tissue(8). Diabetics suffer a significantly higher incidence of osteoporotic
fractures than do non-diabetics(9-13), and their bone densities are higher at the time of fracture than in
fracturing non-diabetic patients(13). These mechanical defects may be the result of episodes of hyperglycemia
which could cause accumulation of compounds, such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that weaken
bone mechanical properties(14-16). These compounds accumulate in many tissues in diabetics(14-18), and
this has stimulated some interest in the development of anti-glycation treatments because of their therapeutic
potential. Indeed, one approved osteoporosis anti-fracture drug, raloxifene, has been shown to reduce
fractures in non-diabetic osteoporotics without the usual accompanying increase in bone mass(19-22). It has
also been shown to reduce the concentration AGEs in bone in an animal model(23), and improves bone
mechanical strength by increasing matrix-bound water(24). Our hypotheses are: 1. Type 1 diabetics have
greater risk of osteoporotic fractures for any given bone density due to reduced mechanical quality of their
bone tissue, and 2. This mechanical defect is due to excess accumulation of chemicals such as AGEs, and to
loss of bone tissue-bound water(17;24). Our study plan is to recruit 40 female, postmenopausal, type 1 insulin-
dependent diabetics, who are over age 50, and have had diabetes for 10 – 30 years. We will perform 2
transilial bone biopsies(25) on each subject, one for mechanical testing(25) and imaging,(26;27), and the other
for tissue analysis of AGEs, other candidate chemicals, and bone tissue-bound water(28). A matched, non-
diabetic, healthy control will be recruited at the time each diabetic is recruited and biopsied as in our previous
study of 60 fracturing patients, each compared with 60 matched controls(25). Heretofore, we have not had
FDA approval for the use of agents such as raloxifene(19;21;23;24;29) for prevention of fractures in diabetics,
and thus they are rarely prescribed. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide more documentation of the
cause of the excess fracture burden in diabetics in order to encourage development of treatment options, i.e.
anti-glycation compounds, for their prevention. The absence of approved pharmaceutical options for reduction
of fracture-risk in diabetics represents a serious problem for the large population of diabetics, and the results of
this work are necessary on behalf of these patients."
10907476,"Project Summary/Abstract
The MATCHES (Making Telehealth Delivery of Cancer Care at Home Effective and Safe) Telehealth Research
Center aims to build the evidence base necessary to establish best practices for telehealth-enabled cancer
care. The overarching goal of the Center is to create a research hub that generates evidence, trains
investigators, and develops the research methods required to ignite the field of precision cancer care delivery.
Prior work demonstrates that oncology-focused telehealth can achieve favorable outcomes, but large-scale
trials have been limited to specific contexts like palliative care or survivorship. Adoption has been constrained
by restricted reimbursement. The MATCHES Center will help remediate this evidence gap by executing
prospective trials, conducting observational analyses, and training transdisciplinary researchers. Our research
theme focuses on the integration of multi-layered data from telehealth platforms, patient portals, mobile
tracking devices, and the electronic medical record to develop analytic methods that support personalized
care. We aim to develop a new paradigm in oncology—precision delivery—with the ultimate goal of matching
individual patients with the most beneficial combination of clinic-based or telehealth-supported home-setting
care at the appropriate time—all based on the totality of dynamically available data. We will accomplish this
goal by applying data science methods—including nimble trial designs and machine learning—that have had
limited application to telehealth to date. By establishing a research hub that nurtures investigators across
disciplines and provides training, tools, data, analytic methods, and venues for sharing knowledge and building
partnerships, we expect to accelerate progress in the science of care delivery. Our specific aims are 1) to
conduct impactful pragmatic trials of telehealth in oncology, 2) to analyze a large existing cache of
multidimensional observational data characterizing telehealth utilization and outcomes, 3) to train investigators
and equip them with the skills necessary to innovate within an evidence-based framework, and 4) to integrate
telehealth with other data streams and create and apply analytic methods to transform the field of precision
care delivery. An Administrative Core will coordinate activities and engage feedback from internal and external
stakeholders—including patients and the oncology workforce. Our Clinical Practice Network serves as an
innovation laboratory and comprises 7 outpatient clinics in NY and NJ with a shared informatics ecosystem
including telehealth capacity, digital monitoring, and a highly trafficked patient portal. This will enable us to
launch and execute a large pragmatic trial comparing in-person care to telehealth, with resources designed to
support home-based care using a cluster-randomized design. The Research & Methods Core will support the
Center by applying data science methods to extract and synthesize insights from telehealth and other data
streams to develop methods relevant to advancing precision cancer care delivery and the goals of equity,
efficacy, and efficiency to create an optimal experience for people being treated for cancer."
10903867,"The rapid uptake of telehealth since the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted not only the potential for
telehealth to improve access and quality of care for some but also how telehealth can exacerbate the “digital
divide,” increasing disparities in care and highlighting the need to focus on health equity. Social, economic,
environmental, and structural factors collectively known as social determinants of health (SDH) – account for
30-50% of the variance in health outcomes, far more than the 10-20% ascribed to health care. In order to
achieve health equity, it is crucial to target these SDH. We will particularly focus on race/ethnicity, poverty and
rurality and how they affect use of telehealth, which we refer to as social determinants of telehealth (SDTH).
The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest integrated health care system in the US, providing care
to 9 million patients across 171 medical centers and 1,112 outpatient sites. VA provides a unique opportunity
to examine how SDTH affect use of telehealth for cancer across a health care system with equal access and
without focus on reimbursement. Therefore, the entire VA system will serve as our clinical practice network for
this Center. All three THRIVE PI’s are experts in implementation science and will use the NIMHD Health
Disparities Research Framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to guide our
understanding of telehealth care delivery for patients with cancer and to explore and understand disparities.
We propose a Center called Telehealth Research and Innovation for Veterans with Cancer (THRIVE), whose
overarching aim is two-fold: 1) to understand how SDTH impact the delivery of telehealth for cancer and 2) to
develop methods to address SDTH and thereby improve access and quality of cancer care for all patients.
THRIVE will focus on four highly important and prevalent cancers within VA: lung, colon, prostate, and breast.
Our findings will be extremely valuable in understanding how telehealth implementation affects the quality of
cancer care for the entire population and how VA and other US health systems can leverage telehealth to
improve cancer outcomes and health equity. Our Specific Aims for this Center are: (1) efficiently manage all
components of THRIVE, including coordination, communication, fiscal management, recruitment and
dissemination (Administrative Core); (2) Identify the impact of SDTH on disparities in telehealth use for cancer
care and on overall quality of care and to develop and test implementation strategies to mitigate disparities
(Research and Methods Core); (3) Create a high functioning learning network to facilitate research on
telehealth for cancer (Clinical Practice Network); (4) conduct a trial assessing the impact of a comprehensive,
multilevel virtual oncology program on promoting engagement with telehealth and reducing SDTH-related care
disparities (Pragmatic Trial); and (5) Train the next generation of oncology researchers in virtual care and
health equity."
10893640,"Project Summary/Abstract: Speech is multimodal in nature: communication partners have access to both
auditory and visual speech cues during face-to-face communication. In adults, access to visual speech cues
are particularly critical for maintaining accurate speech recognition when the auditory components of
speech are compromised by hearing loss, background noise, or sound distortion. In the absence of visual
speech cues, poor auditory-only speech recognition has negative cascading effects on the ability to
comprehend and learn from the speech input. Despite this evidence, there is an unresolved debate about
whether visual speech cues facilitate speech recognition or disrupt the development of auditory skills in
children with hearing loss. This debate is reflected in the variety of language intervention approaches that
vary in their reliance on visual speech cues. The extent to which visual speech cues are critical to spoken
language processing and development in children with hearing loss, however, has not been directly tested.
As a first step at addressing this gap in knowledge, the objective of the proposed study is to examine the
extent to which the addition of visual speech cues facilitates lexical processing in school-age children with
or without hearing loss. Children who are expected to benefit the most from audiovisual speech are children
with cochlear implants (CIs), who have permanent bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss.
Children with CIs often have poor recognition of auditory-only speech due to limitations of the CIs to fully
compensate for the loss of high fidelity auditory representations of speech. The proposed study will test the
hypothesis that audiovisual speech facilitates lexical processing relative to auditory-only speech in children
with CIs and that this improved processing has positive downstream benefits for language comprehension.
Children who are ages 4 to 10 years who use CIs or who have normal hearing (NH) will be recruited. The
age range was chosen because audiovisual speech perception matures over the first decade of life. The
study will utilize existing validated measures of incremental lexical processing and language comprehension
to test the hypothesis. Real-time lexical processing of auditory-only speech (Aim 1) and of audiovisual
speech (Aim 2) will be characterized in children with CIs and children with NH. The effects of audiovisual
speech on language comprehension skills will also be characterized in the same children (Aim 3). We will
relate performance on lexical processing and language comprehension tasks. Theoretically, the results will
support the creation of a comprehensive model of lexical processing with and without visual speech cues in
school-age children with CIs and children with NH. This work has practical implications for spoken
language interventions for children with CIs as well as children with less severe hearing loss, who may
differentially utilize visual speech cues. In addition, the results will inform future studies of spoken language
interventions that vary in their inclusion of visual speech cues."
10721352,"The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasing in the general U.S. population and especially in the
population of veterans served by the VA medical system. Studies by us and others have implicated the innate
immune system as both a promoter of the initial kidney damage from AKI and a mediator of the recovery process.
In addition, during the recovery period, interstitial stromal cells are activated and transiently increase extracellular
matrix production, which can help maintain structural integrity. In addition to the increased morbidity and mortality
resulting from an episode of AKI, incomplete recovery can result in persistent myofibroblast activation, leading to
tubulointerstitial fibrosis and development of chronic kidney disease.
 The ErbB family of receptors consists of EGFR (ErbB1), which is activated by EGFR ligands, including EGF,
TGF-a, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epigen and epiregulin, and ErbB3 and ErbB4, which are activated
by neuregulins 1-4. ErbB2 does not contain an extracellular ligand-binding domain and serves as a binding
partner for the other receptors. In addition to activating EGFR, HB-EGF can also activate ErbB4. We have studied
the role of renal epithelial EGFR in response to acute and chronic kidney injury. We found that selective deletion
of proximal tubule EGFR delayed recovery from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) kidney injury {Chen, 2012 #13872},
but persistent EGFR activation resulted in development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis {Chen, 2011 #7520;Zhang,
2019 #16570}. In contrast, we recently found that inhibition of ErbB4 increased tubulointerstitial injury in response
to either unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or IR renal injury {Zeng, 2018 #16565}. However, we not identify
the ErbB ligand(s) involved.
 In addition to epithelial cells, we find that EGFR and ErbB4 are expressed in myeloid cells (specifically
macrophages and neutrophils). EGFR activation promotes a proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages, and
our recent studies indicate that selective myeloid deletion of EGFR promotes recovery from IR kidney injury and
inhibits development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We have also found similar responses in mice with deletion of
the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin. In contrast, we now find that selective myeloid deletion of HB-EGF inhibits
recovery from IR injury and promotes development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Therefore, we propose that renal
myeloid HB-EGF directly activates epithelial EGFR to promote recovery from acute injury and also activates
both myeloid and epithelial ErbB4 to inhibit subsequent development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis.
 In preliminary studies, we have also found that EGFR is expressed in stromal cells in the kidney, pericytes
and resident fibroblasts. Although the role of the EGFR ligand-EGFR axis in renal stromal cells to mediate
alterations in interstitial matrix production has not been previously investigated, in our preliminary studies we
have found that selective deletion of EGFR in pericytes and resident renal fibroblasts has a profound effect
to limit development of tubulointerstitial injury following UUO or IR kidney injury. We propose that following
ischemic injury, EGFR activation induces renal pericytes and fibroblasts to migrate and proliferate, which if left
unchecked, will develop into irreversible interstitial fibrosis. We further propose that HB-EGF activation of
fibroblast ErbB4 can serve as a check to limit the recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts and their
transformation into matrix-producing myofibroblasts. We propose three specific aims:

Viral reservoir cells are an extremely small but highly durable population of HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells that
persist despite treatment with highly-effective antiretroviral therapy and are responsible for viral rebound once
treatment is interrupted. Understanding and characterizing the physiology of these cells will likely be critical for
any effort to successfully target these cells but has turned out to be extremely difficult, due to their low fractional
abundance and considerable heterogeneity in blood and tissues. Moreover, there is growing evidence
suggesting that viral reservoir CD4 T cells are dynamically evolving over time, and subject to selection
mechanisms that favor the long-term persistence of some reservoir cells, while eliminating others. Here, we plan
to take advantage of recent progress in molecular single-cell and imaging analysis techniques and propose to
comprehensively profile the longitudinal evolution of viral reservoir cells in blood and tissues. We hypothesize
that continuous suppressive antiretroviral therapy selects for intact proviruses with features of deeper latency,
likely as a result of immune selection mechanisms that preferentially eliminate proviruses more susceptible to
reactivation signals, while proviruses in deeper latency persist. These studies will be conducted using samples
of a unique, prospectively followed cohort of HIV-1-patients who were identified in acute infection and started
antiretroviral treatment immediately after diagnosis. In Specific Aim 1, we will use novel next-generation
sequencing technologies to longitudinally profile the chromosomal position of intact and defective proviruses
from blood and tissues, and evaluate their microanatomical location in lymphoid tissues. Subsequently, we will
characterize the epigenetic chromatin environment within chromosomal proximity to intact proviruses from blood
and tissues, using a platform of next-generation sequencing assays to evaluate chromatin accessibility, inhibitory
or activating histone modifications and DNA methylation (Specific Aim 2). In Specific Aim 3, we will perform
novel, functional single-cell assays to simultaneously analyze the proviral sequence, the corresponding
integration sites and HIV-1 RNA expression profile of single virally infected cells from blood and tissues; this
assay will allow us to individually characterize the viral gene expression pattern of single infected cells encoding
for intact and defective proviruses, and enable testing the hypothesis that continuous antiretroviral therapy is
associated with progressive accumulation of proviruses with deeper levels of latency and lower responsiveness
to viral reactivation stimuli. Together, these studies have the potential to provide significant advances in
understanding the complexity and longitudinal evolution of viral reservoir cells and may allow to identify
susceptibilities and vulnerabilities of residual HIV-1-infected cells that could be therapeutically targeted."
10883883,"The intestinal epithelium plays an essential role in homeostasis and health by maintaining a barrier and responding appropriately to luminal antigens and bacterial signals. The epithelium accomplishes these functions via thousands of actin-rich protrusions known as microvilli. Microvilli harbor proteins which relay information to the epithelial cell. One important protein at the tips of the microvilli is intestinal alkaline phosphatase -an enzyme that detoxify pro-inflammatory bacterial and host derived compounds and minimizes epithelial insults. Microvilli are maintained at the proper height, distance and density by linker proteins known as the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC). Our preliminary data indicates that IMAC compounds and intestinal alkaline phosphatase are delivered to the apical member of epithelial cells by the molecular motor Myosin 5b. Loss of functional Myosin 5b and subsequent mislocalization of IMACs and intestinal alkaline phosphatase alters the structure and function of microvilli in our animal model, and we postulate that this sets the stage for epithelial dysfunction. Recently it has been demonstrated that patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have decreased gene expression of Myosin 5b and have shortened, disordered microvilli on their epithelial cells. Our preliminary data indicates that Myosin 5b protein is decreased in colonic biopsies of IBD patients and in a TNBS mouse model of colitis. We hypothesize that inflammation decreases Myosin 5b gene expression and protein levels, which leads to the mislocalization of IMAC and intestinal alkaline phosphatase protein and perpetuates a cycle of inflammation. To address this question, we propose to define the role of Myosin 5b in intestinal inflammation using acute (DSS) and chronic (T-cell transfer) animal colitis models (Aim 1) and define the mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory stimuli downregulate Myosin 5b and how decreased Myosin 5b sets the stage for further insults using mouse and human intestinal organoids (Aim 2). This work has the potential to identify key pathways involved in intestinal inflammation; targets which could be used to develop next generation therapeutics. This research may lead to treatments which enhance patient health outcomes and quality of life."
10879324,"The goal of our research program is to identify specific, low-level “building blocks” of cognition that are
impaired in people with schizophrenia (PSZ), are linked with neurobiology, and can explain deficits in higher-
level cognitive function. Our prior research has led to the hyperfocusing hypothesis, which proposes that many
aspects of cognitive impairment in PSZ can be traced to overly narrow and intense focusing of processing
resources on a subset of available inputs, and an inability to distribute resources among multiple sources of
information. Hyperfocusing can explain reduced working memory capacity and impaired performance in a
variety of attention tasks, and measures of hyperfocusing are strongly correlated with measures of broad
cognitive function (e.g., IQ). We have also found that PSZ exhibit an aberrant working memory dynamics in
tasks that require storing a single location or orientation in working memory on each trial. As the current-trial
maintenance period increases, working memory representations in healthy control subjects (HCS) drift closer
and closer toward the location or orientation of the previous-trial target (attraction), whereas working memory
representations in PSZ drift farther and farther away (repulsion). Working with a computational neuroscientist,
we have identified two potential neural mechanisms that could explain these aberrant working memory
dynamics and may also explain our prior hyperfocusing results. One hypothesis is that short-term synaptic
plasticity mechanisms are impaired in PSZ. The other hypothesis is that neuronal adaptation mechanisms are
exaggerated in PSZ. The main goal of this project is to test these two hypotheses of microcircuit disfunction in
schizophrenia and determine whether and how they are related to hyperfocusing and broad cognitive function.
 In Aim 1, we will use sophisticated behavioral tasks that can determine whether the aberrant working
memory dynamics in PSZ are a result of impaired short-term synaptic plasticity or exaggerated neuronal
adaptation. In Aim 2, we will provide converging evidence from other experimental paradigms, including both
behavioral and neural measures. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the aberrant working memory dynamics
and hyperfocusing reflect a common underlying mechanism, distinct from executive control. Aim 3a will
address this statistically by obtaining multiple measures of working memory dynamics, hyperfocusing,
executive control, and broad cognitive function in a relatively large sample of PSZ and HCS. Aim 3b will use
neural network modeling to address the same issue by determining whether an alteration in a single
component of the neural microcircuitry (e.g., reduced short-term synaptic plasticity) leads to patterns of
aberrant behavior across models of different tasks that match the pattern of aberrant behavior exhibited by
PSZ in these tasks.
 The results of the research will have important implications for efforts to develop new treatments that target
the specific neurocognitive systems that are disrupted in schizophrenia."

10745640,"A nanocoating for continuous disinfection of frequently touched surfaces
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) represent a constant risk for patients and healthcare workers and have
a large impact on public health. Fomites, inanimate surfaces contaminated by pathogens, are a passive source
of infection and their role in infection propagation in hospitals has been recognized as an important health
problem. Fomites can be contaminated with microbes by direct contact with body fluids such as blood or saliva
or by airborne microbial particles, like sneeze droplets. In the nosocomial setting, noncritical frequently touched
surfaces (FTS) such as doorknobs, countertops, bedrails, and bedside tables may contribute to fomite-mediated
HAIs by contaminating the hands of health care providers or by contact with medical equipment that will
subsequently come in contact with patients. To prevent and reduce the risk of HAIs transmission, the low-level
disinfection (LLD) of FTS is a widely used strategy. LLD aims to inactivate vegetative bacteria, virus, and fungi,
but not spores. To do so, liquid disinfectants or wipes are used to wet the surface for the amount of time
recommended by the manufacturer, usually 10 minutes or less. LLD has been found to be highly effective (>4-
log10 reduction) in removing/inactivating epidemiologically important pathogens. Nevertheless, since
recontamination can occur at any moment after cleaning, an important drawback of LLD is the need for repeated
disinfectant application. To address this, here we propose the use of a nanocoating (NC) for continuous LLD of
FTS. The NC will be able to attain >4-log10 reduction of gram positive and gram-negative bacteria in 15 minutes
or less by using visible light to kill pathogens via oxidative stress. It will be formulated for an environmental-
friendly application and will keep its antibacterial activity for about 60 days. The specific aims to reach the
objective are:
AIM 1. Formulation and optimization of NCs. The material will be formulated and optimized for high bacterial
reduction (>4-log10) in 15 min or less against S. aureus and E. coli.
AIM 2. Characterization and optimization of NC properties. The mechanical, physiochemical, and
antibacterial properties of new and aged coatings will be assessed to optimize performance and duration.
AIM 3. In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the safeness of NCs. Studies using human cells and animal
models will be performed to evaluate adverse health effects of NCs."
10792461,"Project Summary
 Detection of neurochemical transients within the brain have led to better understanding of how underlying neural
circuits function and correlate to behavior, and have contributed to the development of several therapeutic drugs and
treatments targeted to a multitude of neurological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, consequences of stroke, and injury.
Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is one of the most common methods of neurochemical sensing, as it provides 1.) sub-
second temporal resolution to capture chemical transmission, diffusion, and uptake events, 2.) physiologically relevant
chemical resolution at ~10-100 nM limits of detection, and 3.) sub-micrometer spatial resolution to target specific brain
regions of interest by sweeping working electrode voltage and measuring the resultant faradaic current from oxidizing and
reducing analytes at their specific redox potentials. However, FSCV selectivity is limited for molecules with similar redox
potentials, such as dopamine and ascorbic acid. FSCV also suffers in long-term performance, as implanted electrodes
foul due to adsorption of cells, degradatory enzymes, and redox intermediates. This limits FSCV to practical
experimental time windows of approximately 90 seconds and functional implant use to just a couple of months. Furthermore,
the fast scan rates used in FSCV result in background capacitive currents that are several orders of magnitude higher than
the desired signals. This necessitates background subtraction, which results in an inability to detect basal concentrations,
limiting traditional FSCV to transient measurements in-vivo. Calibration also cannot be performed in-situ and is
traditionally done in a beaker before implantation and after removal of the probe, leading to questionable measurement
accuracy requiring confirmation by other methods such as mass spectrometry.
 The innovation of this proposal is to develop a miniaturized neurochemical sampling probe with integrated
electrodes within its microfluidic channels for sensitive, on-line detection while improving long-term sensor
performance by leveraging mature silicon microfabrication techniques. The envisioned device can 1.) sense
neurochemicals on-line with considerably reduced electrode fouling and drift by physically separating the sampling
site and harsh inflammatory response from the detection electrode site, and introducing flow to combat analyte adsorption
and increase sensitivity; and 2.) demonstrate in-situ calibration and regeneration of the electrodes through sophisticated
microfluidic design, combatting eventual fouling and drift. Aim 1 focuses on electrochemical flow-cell optimization of
sensitivity and selectivity with in-vivo validation. Aim 2 focuses on valve-less flow redirection for electrode calibration and
regeneration in-situ with demonstration of long-term in-vivo sensing. Successful completion of this project results in an
electrochemical neural probe capable of enhanced long-term and sensitive neurochemical detection, validated with in-vivo
studies. Slower and more gradual changes in neurochemical composition, such as those mediated by neurohormones, basal
concentration measurements, and use in longer-term behavioral studies and applications (such as brain-machine interfaces)
are poised to benefit from the success of this proposal."
10686368,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The chemotherapy decision-making process in older women with early-stage breast cancer is complex.
Although older women derive a similar degree of benefit from chemotherapy as compared to their younger
counter-parts, there are other issues such as medical comorbidities and unique adverse effects that may
influence the recommendations of physicians and preferences of patients, subsequently impacting treatment
outcomes. Currently, there are no decision aids available to guide patients in considering tradeoffs between
quality of life and prognosis conferred by their disease and treatment. The literature supports that older
patients desire more active roles in decision-making, and a critical need exists for tools to facilitate patient-
centered communication and shared decision-making. Evidence supports that decision aids enhance shared-
decision making processes. In the proposed project, I will develop a decision aid to meet the information and
clinical needs of older adult women making breast-cancer treatment decisions, and support their physician in
navigating this conversation. The tool will include two components: (1) a physician-facing component that will
incorporate validated breast-cancer risk outcomes, and (2) a patient-facing component that will include an
include education (overview of the disease, goals of therapy), description of benefits/risks of treatment,
feedback on tailored outcome probabilities, and values clarification. My overall hypothesis is that a decision
support tool will provide patients and physicians with tailored information regarding the risks and benefits of
chemotherapy and values clarification to support high quality, shared decisions. An advisory panel composed
of patients, oncologists, geriatricians, nurses and patient advocates will provide regular feedback throughout
the development process and engage in an iterative process of development. We will subsequently evaluate
the tool for acceptability and feasibility through a field test of 20 patients. After incorporating feedback from the
field test to create a finalized version of the tool, we will carry out a cluster-randomized pilot study that will
include randomization to a usual-care arm with the objective of evaluating the efficacy of the decision support
tool by measuring patient-reported outcomes of decisional conflict, knowledge, and a measure of the decision-
process/approach. Ultimately, the results of this project will inform a larger randomized control trial to assess
whether the decision tool improves patient knowledge, decision quality/processes, and quality of life.
Furthermore, through my work on this project and the proposed training activities, I will strengthen by skill-set
in decision science, health communication, qualitative/mixed-methods methodology and clinical trial design
which allow me to transition to my long-term goal of becoming an established independent investigator."
10661072,"In the United States alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~15% of adults. While those numbers alone are striking,
patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 3 times more likely to develop AUD compared
to the population at large. This relationship is even more worrisome in Veteran populations as VA medical records
suggest 63% of Veterans with AUD are co-diagnosed with PTSD. Co-morbid AUD and PTSD represents a major
healthcare issue given that chronic excessive alcohol consumption in Veteran populations with PTSD intensifies
symptoms of PTSD including overgeneralization of the fear response and impaired fear memory extinction.
Clinically, the ability to treat co-morbid AUD and PTSD has not been addressed and our understanding of
maladaptive changes in common neural pathways which contribute to co-morbidity AUD and PTSD is limited.
Therefore, in order to develop effective therapies for co-morbid AUD and PTSD we must improve our knowledge
of why these disorders exhibit a strong relationship by pursuing new hypotheses using cutting edge techniques.
Recently, the endocrine hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), known for its potent metabolic effects,
was illustrated to significantly reduce alcohol consumption via an undescribed mechanism requiring expression
of the obligate FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho (KLB) in the brain. Importantly, single nucleotide polymorphisms in
both FGF21 and KLB genomic loci are highly associated with increased alcohol consumption in humans. Our
preliminary data presented in this proposal illustrates that excessive alcohol consumption promotes FGF21
secretion from the liver. Additionally, mice lacking FGF21 expression in the liver exhibit increased preference for
alcohol suggesting FGF21 signaling in response to alcohol consumption represents a homeostatic feedback
loop to negatively regulate alcohol consumption. Furthermore, we find that FGF21 signaling through KLB
expressing (KLB+) neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is necessary for FGF21 to suppress alcohol
consumption. Interestingly, FGF21 signaling in the BLA also appears to be necessary for enhanced fear memory
associated with chronic alcohol consumption suggesting FGF21 signaling in the BLA influences both alcohol
consumption and fear memory. In the BLA we have identified two distinct populations of KLB+ neurons which
project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or the central amygdala (CeA). Neurons in the BLA which project to
these regions have previously been illustrated to regulate alcohol consumption and fear memory. Relatedly,
these same projection populations have been described to encode the emotional valence of cues associated
with reward and aversion. Thus, in this proposal we hypothesize that FGF21 signaling through KLB+ neurons in
the BLA which project to the NAc or the CeA influences alcohol consumption and fear memory through
modulating the valence encoding properties of these neurons. This proposal takes advantage of optrode
recording, in vivo calcium imaging, and optogenetics to investigate how FGF21 signaling in projection defined
populations of KLB+ neurons in the BLA influences valence encoding, alcohol consumption, and fear
conditioning to improve our understanding of how shared neural substrates contribute to AUD and PTSD. As a
postdoctoral research fellow with experience investigating how FGF21 signaling in the brain regulates
physiological homeostasis I will perform the experiments described in this proposal under the mentorship of Dr.
Matthew Potthoff and Dr. Ted Abel. The career development plan accompanying this proposal is designed to
achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent VA-funded researcher. Immediate goals associated with
this proposal, such as learning optrode recording and calcium imaging, as well as obtaining a tenure track faculty
position will facilitate accomplishing my long-term career goal. Key aspects of the career development plan
include technical and professional mentorship provided by my mentors and a Scientific Advisory Committee
designed specifically to accomplish the goals of this proposal. Formal courses on scientific writing and leadership
as well as research conferences will supplement the training provided by my Scientific Advisory Committee."
10894589,"Seasonal influenza (flu) infections kill hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world each year and morbidity and mortality rates increase even further when a new pandemic virus emerges. The annual flu vaccine provides an important line of defense against influenza infections but there are many documented examples of poor vaccine efficacy, even in healthy individuals. Thus, there is an unmet public health need to improve influenza vaccination. However, before we can improve the vaccine, we must first better understand the immune cells that respond to the vaccine. One cell type of particular importance is the memory B cell, which is rapidly recalled following infection and vaccination and can contribute to anti-viral immunity by differentiating into short-lived antibody secreting cells (ASCs) that produce antibodies (Ab) that can either neutralize the virus or facilitate its rapid clearance. Memory B cells also seed the vaccine-driven humoral immune response and can give rise to new cohorts of long-lived ASCs and memory B cells that will protect against future exposures to the circulating flu virus. Despite the fact that memory B cells are the direct targets of vaccination in adults, we know remarkably little about these cells. This substantial knowledge gap is due, at least in part, to an inability to isolate and characterize these cells. Studies of memory B cells in humans have been even more difficult as we can typically only look at the cells in the blood and many immune cells, including the memory B cells, reside in tissues that are usually inaccessible in humans. We developed new tools to track flu-specific memory B cells in both mice and humans and have now identified and characterized distinct populations in the tissues of mice that we believe are likely to contribute to long-lasting vaccine induced immune responses. The central hypothesis of this application is that a flu-specific memory B cell subset that expresses the transcription factor T-bet is maintained long-term in tissues like the lung and is preferentially recalled by vaccination. The specific goals for this proposal are to identify the vaccine-elicited signals required to establish lung-resident T-bet expressing memory B cells, to determine whether vaccination and infection induce distinct populations of memory B cell with differing functions and life- spans, to identify which memory B cell subsets are preferentially recalled following antigen exposure, and to evaluate whether the repertoire of the T-bet expressing memory B cells found in human tissues are enriched for reactivity to older “historic” flu antigens that the individual likely encountered early in life. The long term goal of this proposal is to fill our gap in our knowledge by developing the tools and animal model systems that will allow us to systematically and comprehensively study the heterogeneous populations of flu-specific memory B cells that persist in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues and are the direct targets of vaccination in adults. We believe that this contribution is significant as we expect to provide new insight into the complex and heterogeneous memory B compartment that is critical for vaccine-induced responses to flu."
10843785,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) are characterized by progressive structural
changes of brain tissue that results in a debilitating loss of cognitive and functional abilities and has profound
social and economic implications. While hallmark AD pathology (e.g. beta amyloid depositions and
neuroﬁbrillary tangles) are remarkably pronounced at the cellular level, there are currently no successful non-
invasive brain imaging techniques to report these microstructural changes.
 Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a widely available non-invasive clinical imaging method
with this potential, as it is sensitive to the subtle motion of water within the complex brain gray matter (GM) and
white matter (WM) tissue architecture. In principle, dMRI can report both the local tissue structure and the long
range connectivity of neural tracts in order to identify pathology and determine the effects of AD on functional
brain networks. Unfortunately, the clinical utility of the standard dMRI methodology is severely compromised by
its lack of speciﬁcity to microstructural tissue changes below the image resolution.
 Recently, however, we have developed a novel acquisition and analysis method called Joint Estimation
Diffusion Imaging (JEDI) that is highly sensitive to microstructural features of GM and GM/WM border regions,
and also provides improved connectivity maps from WM. JEDI is easily implemented on a clinical scanner and
we have recently incorporated it into a ﬁrst study on subjects ranging from cognitively normal (CN) to Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to early AD in order to assess its ability to detect changes in these groups.
 Two critical steps in extending the clinical utility of JEDI in AD are: 1) To characterize the relationship
between the JEDI data and speciﬁc tissue microstructural features in order to develop quantitative clinical
metrics and 2) To develop efﬁcient acquisition protocols for both microstructural sensitivity and limited patient
scan time. That is the focus of this proposal, which will involve three lines of work: 1) Numerical computer
simulations of the JEDI experiment in realistic tissue models that will allow us to efﬁciently optimize the
acquisition protocol for maximum speciﬁcity and minimal time; 2) Validate these optimizations through in-vivo
evaluation of normal aging processes in the ferret and in ex-vivo radiologic-pathologic analysis in post-mortem
human tissue from patients with different stages of AD; 3) Incorporate these optimizations into the JEDI
acquisition and analysis of human protocols on our clinical scanners with speciﬁc application to examining the
prodromal microstructure tissue changes across the aging-MCI-AD continuum.
 By enabling a reliable, validated and clinically viable method for the quantitative characterization of subtle
brain tissue changes across the aging-MCI-AD continuum, JEDI will signiﬁcantly enhance our ability to
understand the earliest neurodegenerative features of AD and provide new insights into its causes,
consequences, and possible treatment targets."
10846604,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Surviving a serious, life-threatening illness in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) often comes at the cost of
new child morbidity and detriments to child and parent mental health. Parents are integral in a child’s PICU
recovery. Yet, parent mental health and caregiver self-efficacy can be significantly and negatively impacted by
the trauma associated with a child’s PICU admission, affecting parents’ ability to help their child optimally
recover. Recognizing the key role of parents in child health, the National Academy of Medicine has identified a
crucial need for psychosocial interventions for parents in vulnerable situations, such as PICU admission.
However, a recent systematic review found a paucity of parent interventions in the PICU. Thus, a critical need
exists for an effective psychosocial intervention for PICU parents that reduces PTSS and enhances caregiver
self-efficacy after discharge. The overall objective of this proposal is to gain the skills to build and test the
feasibility of a theory-driven and evidence-based parent psychosocial intervention through three specific aims:
Aim 1) Build EMPOWER, an intervention for parents whose children are admitted to a PICU. Dr. Yagiela will
collaborate with PICU stakeholders and use the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and
Maintenance) framework to integrate and adapt evidence-based components from existing parent interventions
to create EMPOWER. Aim 2) Develop and test a training curriculum to prepare parent mentors to deliver the
EMPOWER intervention. Principles of adult learning, didactics, role-playing exercises, and delivery of the
intervention in standardized scenarios will be used to train and test the readiness of parent mentors to deliver
the intervention. Aim 3) Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation factors of the EMPOWER
intervention. Parent mentors will deliver the intervention to PICU parents in a feasibility trial. The expected
outcome of these aims is a feasible theory-driven and evidence-based intervention called EMPOWER, that
helps parents gain skills to reduce immediate distress, which my conceptual model posits can reduce future
PTSS and enhance caregiver self-efficacy. This is expected to have a positive impact by improving parents’
ability to support their child’s recovery, thereby increasing the potential for improved PICU child outcomes. This
K23 proposal also includes a four-year training plan. With the support of an expert team of mentors and
advisors, Dr. Yagiela will gain training in developing behavioral interventions, designing and conducting clinical
trials, and qualitative and mixed methods, and develop professionally. The training goals will be accomplished
through frequent interaction with mentors / advisors, didactic coursework, mentored study, seminars, and
conferences. This K23-supported data and training will provide a foundation for a future R01-funded
randomized controlled trial of the EMPOWER intervention and enable Dr. Yagiela to achieve her long-term
goal of becoming an independent clinician-researcher who develops, tests, and implements psychosocial
interventions that improve mental and physical health outcomes in parents and critically ill children."
10840909,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex disease driven by genetic and environmental components, which converge
upon inflammation as a common driver. Notably, inflammatory insults to the central nervous system (CNS), such
as viral infection, are correlated with AD and other forms of cognitive decline although the mechanisms linking
prior neuroinflammatory exposure to later AD development are unclear. Pathogenic infection leads to profound
remodeling of tissues that can have long-term effects on the composition of immune cells in tissues including
inflammatory and epigenetic states. For example, after infection, memory T cells infiltrate and persist in the brain
long-term as tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. While TRM cells provide protection against re-infection in tissues,
their presence can also lead to dysregulated inflammation. Moreover, the brain resident macrophages, microglia,
and astrocytes can be functionally and epigenetically reprogrammed after exposure to infection, leaving the cells
poised to produce inflammatory mediators upon re-infection. While protective to re-infection, these poised
inflamed states of brain TRM cells and glia may put the brain at risk of potentially elevated and harmful inflammation.
Nearly all AD animal research is performed in animals in specific- pathogen free (SPF) conditions, protected from
exposure to environmentally-relevant microbes. Therefore, this project aims to develop more physiological AD
models by examining how successive viral infections remodel the CNS and brain-resident microglia, astrocytes
and TRM cells, to test if this increases brain inflammation and hastens neurodegeneration and AD pathogenesis.
To this end, mice genetically predisposed to develop AD-like symptoms will be serially infected with different
pathogens over the first half of their lifetime to replicate exposure to multiple pathogens over one’s lifetime. As the
mice age, they will be examined for changes in the composition, transcription, epigenome and function of immune
cells, glia, and neurons, and look for earlier signs of AD pathology and dementia. This application will test if a
history of infection increases age- related inflammation in the CNS, such as Type I and Type II interferons. By
defining pathological links between serial infection, chronic inflammation, and brain resident immune cells, these
studies will address this gap in knowledge between one’s infection history and age-related inflammation in the
brain that supports AD pathogenesis, and define environmental drivers of sporadic AD. Furthermore, these studies
will shed light on the role of brain TRM cells and how they regulate the inflammatory tone of the brain. Considering
that most cases of AD are sporadic, and it is an irreversible pathology that currently lacks therapies, it is crucial
to elucidate more precisely how environmental factors and the immune system are involved in this disease. Thus,
the goal of this grant is to develop more physiologically relevant pre-clinical models that can better inform how the
immune response and inflammation contribute to AD and neuronal health with age."
10721344,"To ensure aging Veterans remain active and mobile with as little musculoskeletal pain as possible, new
approaches to the prevention of osteoporosis and promotion of timely bone regeneration following a fracture are
necessary. This collaborative research study brings together a group of VA investigators with diverse
perspectives, insights, models, and techniques, to synergistically attack a major clinical problem that leads to
high morbidity and mortality among Veterans, a bone fracture. The overall research strategy of each integrated
project is to use pre-clinical models of a disease that either weakens bone or delays bone repair, to investigate
novel ways to enhance the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to promote bone formation, and to assess
disease and treatment effects on bone in a unified, stringent manner. Already under-diagnosed and under-
treated, osteoporosis is likely to increase the number of fragility fractures being treated at VA hospitals without
novel tools for early detection and novel treatment strategies that circumvent the rare but devastating side effects
of current therapies that inhibit bone loss. Addressing this unmet clinical need, the overall aims are to identify
therapeutic strategies to improve bone health among Veterans and to enhance the bone anabolism of PTH
signaling. The collaboration will address this overarching hypothesis: health problems disproportionately
affecting Veterans activate signaling pathways that increase bone resorption, suppress bone formation, or
impede the transition of cartilage to bone in a fracture callus such that improvements in the clinical management
of osteoporosis lie in understanding how these health problems hurt bone health. This project recognizes that
hypertension and osteoporosis often develop together as patients grow older beyond 50 years of age and that
female and male Veterans are susceptible to both chronic diseases. Based on our preliminary studies of what
happens to bone in standard pre-clinical mouse models of hypertension, we will investigate a mechanism by
which hypertension weakens bone with the ultimate goal of identifying a new therapeutic strategy in the
prevention of osteoporosis. Specifically, the first aim of the project will be to test the hypothesis that sex steroids,
namely estrogen and testosterone, influence the decline in bone mass and bone quality that occurs with the
onset of hypertension. Achieving this goal involves assessing the relative effect of estrogen deficiency (or
testosterone deficiency) and hypertension on the fracture resistance of mouse bone. Furthermore, by
investigating treatment and surgery effects on gene and protein expression in bone and bone marrow, on
markers of bone resorption and bone formation, and on the number and activity of bone cells, the project will
provide insight into how rising blood pressure and rising sympathetic tone negatively affects bone. In the second
aim, we will ascertain whether an inflammatory factor known as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is a major
mediator of bone loss in hypertension and do so with respect to the cellular source of this cytokine. Doing so
requires the induction of hypertension in 2 different mouse strains engineered to either prevent bone forming
(mature osteoblasts) and bone sensing cells (osteocytes) from producing CSF1 or preventing cells lining blood
vessels (endothelial cells) from producing CSF1. Transitioning from mechanic studies to translational studies,
we will determine whether inhibiting CSF1 signaling in combination with intermittent parathyroid hormone
treatment, an approved therapy for osteoporosis, and/or with a calcium channel blocker, an approved therapy
for hypertension, improves the fracture resistance of bone in aged, hypertensive mice. In all these aims, the
assessment of fracture resistance is comprehensive going beyond bone mass and bone volume to include the
matrix. By understanding how hypertension affects bone and by working as a collaborative research team, new
therapeutic strategies will be sought to prevent the age-related increase in fracture risk. This is needed because
osteoporotic fractures lead to many complications in Veteran population and because osteoporosis is
underdiagnosed and undertreated."
11021257,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), synthetic opioids are currently the most common cause of
overdose death in the U.S., and have increased opioid deaths by >500% from 2015- 2020. In 2020 alone, over 80% of the
69,700 opioid deaths were attributed to these synthetics (fentanyl). Despite the widespread availability of naloxone, the
only FDA approved treatment for opioid overdose, deaths from fentanyl and fentanyl analogues (F/FA) continue to rise in
parallel with increasing reports and pharmacological evidence of F/FA resistance to naloxone. High doses of rapidly
injected F/FA cause airway obstruction from vocal cord closure (VCC) and severe chest wall rigidity (CWR) within 60-90
seconds, lethal effects that can persist for up to 10 minutes and appear to be resistant to naloxone. In contrast, morphine
derived opiates (e.g. heroin) cause respiratory depression and mild muscle rigidity that is responsive to naloxone, but are
not known to cause VCC in humans. The rapidly lethal phenomenon of VCC suggests unique pharmacological
mechanisms underlying F/FA effects and may be a factor driving the dramatic increase in community overdose deaths. In
support of this hypothesis, our published pharmacological data demonstrate F/FA, but not morphine or naloxone, have
affinity for off-site targets that regulate these F/FA-induced effects. These in vitro data include F/FA concentrations that
may be physiologically relevant to humans, based on available models of brain lipid concentrations for F/FA and by
comparison with plasma levels in decedents of fentanyl overdose. Additionally, we have demonstrated in our published
animal model that intravenous fentanyl induces VCC in <10 seconds, is not reversed by high dose naloxone and involves
these off-site receptor targets. These data suggest that the development of effective therapies for overdose requires a
biological model that replicates clinical effects of F/FA toxicity and a re-conceptualization of the underlying causes of
F/FA overdose deaths to include VCC, in addition to respiratory depression. Therefore, the goal of this Fast-track
proposal is to use an animal model of fentanyl toxicity, to identify specific drug classes that address F/FA induced VCC
and respiratory depression. There are currently no Federal Drug Administration approved treatments that target these
F/FA toxicity effects, and this project directly addresses the need for the development of a new class of therapeutics,
specific to F/FA overdose."

Project summary
 Advances in human health rely on valid animal models of disease. Inbred or genetically engineered rodent
models can answer important questions about disease pathogenesis and test promising therapies, but can
sometimes fail to predict disease responses seen in humans.
 Spontaneously occurring diseases in companion and other domestic animals can complement the use of
engineered laboratory models to understand human diseases, especially those that involve complex genetic
traits, disease-modifying gene loci, environmental-gene interactions, or chronic disease progression.
Veterinary clinician-scientists have expertise in these naturally occurring animal diseases, and have much to
contribute to interdisciplinary research teams that are working to solve human health problems.
 The purpose of this proposal is to support the development of veterinary specialists into clinician-scientists
capable of being productive contributors to translational research. This proposal outlines 3 initiatives: 1)
targeted post-residency Translational Research Fellowships for veterinary specialists, to perform research with
inter-disciplinary teams on spontaneous diseases shared by humans and animals; 2) a Translational Research
Immersion Program for early career clinical faculty, to provide key training in grant writing and mentorship, and
showcase successful models of interdisciplinary research collaborations; and 3) convene Translational
Research Summits for established veterinary and human medical researchers working on the same diseases,
to accelerate the use of spontaneous animal models to understand human disease.
 The long-term goals of this Translational Research Workforce Training proposal are to catalyze
interdisciplinary translational research among veterinarians, basic scientists, physicians and other
human health professionals. These three initiatives will provide a generalizable model to recruit clinical
specialists of all backgrounds to centers of excellence within the CTSA network, provide immersion research
training for clinical faculty followed by evidence-based mentoring support, and bring together clinicians and
scientists from different walks of life to collaborate around shared disease interests."
10721348,"Cardiac disease, is a common cause of death in PKD patients. Study of the mechanisms of cardiac
hypertrophy, beyond hypertension, is an unmet need. Furthermore, testing of novel agents that block
mTORC1/2 outputs e.g. 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation mTORC1/2 inhibitors and palmitate conjugated ASOs that
vigorously penetrate heart muscle, is an unmet need in cardiac hypertrophy in general as well as PKD
specifically. The most exciting development in the field of mTOR inhibitors has been the development of
compounds that are highly mTORC1 specific and have less side effects than first generation mTOR inhibitors.
DL001 was found to be 40 times more selective for mTORC1 than rapamycin in cells and in vivo and unlike
rapamycin, had no effect on glucose tolerance test, did not affect plasma lipids, had a significantly smaller
effect on total T cell numbers and no effect on CD3+CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells. We will test DL-001
in our PKD models. The experiments challenge the pre-existing paradigm that hypertension is the main initiator
of cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in PKD. We propose that there is increased mTORC1/2
signaling in the heart, cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction before hypertension in Pkd1RC/RC mice.
Based on the known effects of mTORC1/2 on mechanisms that are deleterious or protective in cardiac
hypertrophy, the overall hypothesis is that mTORC1 causes cardiac hypertrophy in PKD while mTORC2 is
protective. We propose that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylation of mTORC1 (4E-BP1,
eIF4E, pS6) will improve cardiac hypertrophy while pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTORC2 (Rictor,
Akt, PKCα) will be harmful in cardiac hypertrophy. In the short term, the genetic studies will offer mechanistic
insights into novel mTORC1 and 2 signaling pathways in the heart. It is crucial to understand the
pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy as it relates to mTORC1/2 to provide insights into the development of
new therapies to treat the cardiac hypertrophy. In the long term, the potential future use of novel
pharmacological mTOR inhibitors/activators in PKD will be tested in mouse models, orthologous of the human
disease. The development of novel mTORC1 and 2 inhibitors, that may have a better therapeutic profile and
fewer side effects than existing mTOR inhibitors, may change future clinical practice regarding the use of
mTOR inhibitors in cardiac hypertrophy. The proposal is significant as it explores unanswered questions of
mTORC1/2 signaling in cardiac hypertrophy: 1) The effect of genetic knockout, ASO therapies and
pharmacological inhibition of different components of the 4E-BP1/eIF4E pathway, 2) The effect of new 2nd, 3rd
and 4th generation mTOR inhibitors, 3) The effect of pharmacological inhibition/activation of mTORC2. 4) The
effect of inhibition of mTORC2 outputs, Akt or PKCα. 5) The effect of mTORC1/2 inhibition on autophagic flux
in the heart, 6) The effect of AMPK activators to restrain mTORC1 under conditions of already increased p-
AMPK activation. Successful completion of the Aims of the study will lead to more attention being paid to the
heart in pre-clinical/clinical studies in PKD, earlier testing of cardiac function in PKD patients and clinical
studies of novel agents that target mTORC1/2 in cardiac hypertrophy in general as well as PKD specifically."
10953524,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The objective of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms by which gut microbes regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby coordinate host nutrient
homeostasis in health and disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most-prevalent chronic liver
disease worldwide and can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The absence of approved pharmaceutical
treatments for NALFD identifies a significant unmet need. Whereas the gut microbiome contributes to NAFLD,
the underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that gut
microbes play a key role in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis through portal vein metabolites, providing a clear
rationale for this research. We propose the central hypothesis that specific biologically-active microbial
metabolites are transported by the portal circulation to the liver, where they downregulate hepatic
gluconeogenesis in health, and that ultra-processed western diets disrupt this pathway to contribute to the
excess glucose production observed in NAFLD. Specific Aim 1 will identify the specific microbes and downstream
metabolites that regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. Mice will be colonized with defined microbial consortia and
in vivo glucose production assays and in vitro primary mouse hepatocyte cultures will determine the specific
microbial metabolic components that control hepatic glucose production. Mice with diet-induced hyperglycemia
and NAFLD will be colonized with specific microbes or administered metabolites to restore normal hepatic
gluconeogenesis. Specific Aim 2 will define the maladaptive changes in gut microbiome function that contribute
to excess hepatic gluconeogenesis in human NAFLD. Donor stool from patients with NAFLD and controls will
be used to create mice with humanized gut microbiomes. Portal vein serum metabolomics and microbial whole
genome sequencing will be used to identify microbes and microbial-metabolites that contribute to excess hepatic
gluconeogenesis in human NAFLD. This research is significant because it will identify novel mechanisms by
which the microbial component of the gut-liver axis regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis in health and disease.
This research project will be performed in the context of a comprehensive career development plan that will
permit the investigator to acquire expertise in metabolomics, microbiome engineering, and bioinformatics
analysis. The work will be conducted at Weill Cornell Medical College, which together with The Rockefeller
University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center constitutes the highly stimulating Tri-Institutional
research network. Seminars and specialized coursework will augment tailored guidance from the candidate’s
co-mentors, as well as from a distinguished advisory committee with complementary expertise. The candidate’s
ultimate goal is to become an independent investigator whose research program integrates expertise in the gut
microbiome with hepatic metabolism in order to advance the management of chronic metabolic diseases,
including NAFLD."

ABSTRACT
Surgery triggers a cascade of humoral, cellular, and subcellular events involved in inflammation and its
resolution. These profound immune responses have a major influence on postoperative outcomes, and many
complications of surgery are due to dysregulated inflammation. Older persons have more surgery than younger
ones and are especially prone to serious postoperative morbidity. The immune system becomes dysregulated
with age and this dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases, including cognitive
decline. Poor cognition is a potent and consistent risk factor for adverse surgical outcomes; we have shown it
doubles the risk of postoperative delirium and halves the chance of being discharged home after elective joint
replacement surgery. We have also demonstrated that between 22-40% of elective surgical patients ≥ 70 years
of age are probably cognitively impaired at the time of surgery. Therefore, the combination of poor preoperative
cognition and poor surgical outcomes is both common and clinically important. Yet, it is not known how poor
cognition increases susceptibility to postoperative morbidity, and the situation is little studied. We propose that
poor preoperative cognition signifies a state of immune disequilibrium / dysfunction that shapes the immune
response to surgery and increases postoperative morbidity. We will test this proposition by examining humoral
(plasma inflammatory and resolution mediators; Aim 1), cellular (monocyte transcriptome and function; Aim 2),
and subcellular (circulating extracellular vesicle [EV] concentration, cargo, and function; Aim 3) components of
inflammation in cognitively screened patients having surgical procedures common in old age (total joint
replacement; spine surgery), with delirium and discharge to place other than home as clinical and patient-
centered-outcomes, respectively. Preliminary results showing cognition- or outcome-related differences in the
ratio of circulating proinflammatory and proresolution mediators, the transcriptome of blood-borne monocytes,
and the distribution of plasma extracellular vesicles support our model. This research is innovative because the
impact of preoperative cognition on the immunology of surgical recovery has not been studied previously, it will
test novel pathogenic mechanisms (monocyte dysfunction, EVs) for preoperative cognition-driven risk and use
state-of-the-art ex vivo and in vitro methods (multiplexed gene panels), and may identify a molecular signature
for adverse postoperative outcomes and, thereby, potential therapeutic targets. Given the magnitude and
importance of the clinical problem being addressed, this is a high impact proposal that may increase the
precision and personalization of surgical care and improve outcomes for older patients.

10657578,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) are responsible for more than twice the number of skin cancer
deaths than melanoma, representing up to 50% of all skin cancers. Approximately 700,000 cases are
diagnosed annually in the United States, but Veterans have a higher risk for cSCC because of age and
extensive exposures during the line of duty to UV radiation and arsenic-based chemical warfare agents. Most
cSCC can be successfully treated by surgical excision or Mohs Micrographic Surgery (Mohs); however, a
subset of cSCC cases result in locoregional recurrence, metastases, and death. The poor prognoses for many
Veterans with cSCC result in a substantial unmet need for better treatment options, especially for those who
request a non-surgical treatment option or who are not a candidate for surgery because they are
immunosuppressed or have other comorbidities. The novel technology in this proposal, Laser-Activated
NanoTherapy (LANT), can meet this unmet need for an alternative to radiation when surgery is not an option.
LANT is a thermal ablation platform therapy using near-infrared laser excitation of gold nanorods (AuNRs)
that generates enough heat to induce site-specific cellular death. The innovation of our technology is the
nanoparticle design and the resulting therapeutic outcomes. In our preliminary studies, LANT demonstrated
(a) 100% SCC cell death at the highest concentration on our dose-escalation curve in vitro, and (b) complete
tumor regression after one treatment iteration with clear tumor margins in subcutaneously-xenografted
squamous cell carcinoma in mice, compared to three control groups, no-treatment, laser-only, and AuNRs-
only. Based on these findings, we propose a study designed to demonstrate that LANT is safe and translate
LANT from bench to bedside with three aims. For Aim 1, we will demonstrate the biodistribution, clearance,
and safety of AuNRs in a murine tumor model and a domestic swine model
to acquire PK/PD data
using ICP-
MS, hematology/serology, and histology. We will verify the distribution of AuNRs, heat generation, and LANT-
induced injury to the tumor, tumor margins, and surrounding tissues using 3D ultrasound imaging, K-type
thermocouples, and IR thermographic cameras. We will also validate LANT safety at different laser output
powers by capturing gross appearance changes with photographic imaging and analyzing morphological
changes with histological evaluation of tumors, tumor margins, and surrounding tissues. We will work with our
FDA consultant and seven (7) clinical partners to obtain FDA and IRB approvals before beginning the pilot
study. For Aim 2, we will recruit Veterans (n = 10) who have biopsy-confirmed local, low-risk cSCC. Veterans
will receive 3-D ultrasound-guided injections of AuNRs during LANT. Veterans will also receive the standard
of care Mohs Micrographic Surgery to confirm clear tumor margins 21 days after LANT. We will employ an
adaptive Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) to determine and adjust the LANT dose,
measured by local skin toxicities and tumor regression measured by 3-D ultrasound imaging and digital
calipers. For Aim 3, we will evaluate the morphological and histopathological changes of the tumor, tumor
margin, and surrounding tissue before and after LANT. Histopathological evaluation of the locoregional
biopsies and treated tumors will be used to characterize the appearance of melanocytes, the epidermis,
dermis, hypodermis, and subcutis of the tumor, tumor margin, and surrounding tissue before and after LANT.
We will gain biological, morphological, and histopathological insight into LANT's cellular and gross impact,
demonstrating that LANT is a safe and effective treatment option for cSCC."
10720894,"Bladder dysfunction is a common, distressing finding in patients afflicted with two
disorders that are increasingly prevalent in the general population but significantly over-
represented in the veteran population—type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Currently, treatments for bladder dysfunction address the symptoms, not the cause, which
remains largely unknown. Though bladder dysfunction manifests early in the course of each
disease, it frequently remains unrecognized and worsens with disease progression. T2DM and
PD can occur independently, however these disorders are related and sometimes coincident. It
has been shown that T2DM increases the risk of PD, and PD patients with T2DM develop more
aggressive motor and cognitive impairment. Such reciprocity is likely to spring from a common
biochemical mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of both chronic diseases, with adverse
consequences for bladder function. The pathology of PD is associated with aggregation of alpha
synuclein (αSyn), a protein abundant in presynaptic nerve varicosities whose biological function,
though incompletely understood, encompasses a role in facilitation of neurotransmission. In this
proposal, we present and rigorously test our proposed mechanism of αSyn interaction with the
unconventional motor protein, myosin 5a (Myo5a), as well as with cytoskeletal actin, in functional
processes involving neurotransmission and glucose regulation in the bladder. We will examine
perturbation of this mechanism in both T2DM and PD animal models and under in vitro
hyperglycemic conditions. We also propose to investigate the influence of glucagon-like peptide
agonists, agents used in T2DM treatment, on restoring the αSyn-Myo5a-actin axis. The
multidisciplinary studies proposed herein will integrate biochemical, molecular, cellular and
physiological approaches that exploit state of the art methods combined with proven conventional
techniques. The information gained will provide a foundation for more effective interventions
addressing the foundational causes of bladder dysfunction and deficits in bladder
neurotransmission in patients with T2DM and PD."
10721353,"The mortality rate for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high (35-40%),
and there are no FDA-approved drug treatments. Overwhelming data demonstrate that ARDS patient
outcomes are significantly worse among the elderly population. However, we do not yet understand the
mechanisms that account for this age-associated predisposition. The NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzymes are
an important cellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and signaling. We previously
demonstrated that Nox4-dependent ROS plays a critical role in mediating endothelial cell (EC) barrier
function during acute responses to lung injury. However, a growing body of evidence supports a link between
excessive Nox4-derived ROS and numerous age-related diseases. We have demonstrated that in
response to lung injury, aged mice exhibit persistently elevated Nox4/ROS levels that result in
susceptibility to severe pre-clinical ARDS and failure to resolve injury. We discovered highly divergent
induction of Nox4/ROS in “young” control vs. senescent ECs; control ECs exhibit a rapid and transient
induction of Nox4, whereas senescent ECs exhibit persistently elevated levels of Nox4/ROS ROS leading to
impaired barrier function. We identified a novel mechanism by which Nox4 expression can be rapidly altered
in ECs via post-translational modification. Further, senescent ECs exhibit defective ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of Nox4, which promotes sustained Nox4/ROS levels. Finally, we identified a small molecular
weight splice variant of Nox4 (Nox4D) to be expressed only in the lungs of aged mice with severe pre-clinical
ARDS and in the lungs of ARDS patients from 3 different cohorts. Finally, targeting of Nox4/D-dependent ROS
in senescence/aging provided the most significant therapeutic benefit (as compared to young), and may be the
key to improving outcomes for elderly ARDS patients. The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis
that age-dependent persistent Nox4/D expression promotes redox imbalance leading to senescence-
associated barrier disruptive EC phenotypes and greater inflammatory injury, ultimately resulting in the
increased susceptibility and impaired resolution of ARDS in aging. Aim 1 studies will determine the role of
Nox4 in mediating age-dependent barrier disruptive EC phenotypes and severity/resolution of pre-clinical ARDS.
Aim 2 studies will investigate the association of Nox4D in ARDS patients and its functional role in ALI in vivo.
Aim 3 studies will evaluate post-translational mechanisms contributing to the persistence of Nox4/D in senescent
ECs. The proposed studies will provide insight into the roles of Nox4/D in regulating EC barrier and inflammatory
responses, and how age-dependent dysfunction of Nox4/D contributes to ARDS pathogenesis. These studies
will offer a novel mechanistic link that may help to explain the increased incidence and mortality of ARDS
associated with the elderly and will provide proof-of-concept for therapeutic development."
10768662,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neonatal and perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) is a major cause of acute mortality and chronic
neurological morbidity in infants and children occuring in 2% of full-term infants and approaches 60% in
premature infants. 20% to 50% of asphyxiated newborns die. Among the survivors, up to 25% show permanent
neuropsychological handicaps such as cerebral palsy, generating lifetime costs to the US healthcare system at
an estimated $11.5 billion USD. Therapeutic hypothermia was the first evidence-based neuroprotective
therapy for neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and has become the clinical standard of care
(SOC). Despite reducing the combined rate of death and disability, therapeutic hypothermia has to be initaited
within 6 hours of HIE, a very narrow diagnostic window. Neonates diagnosed within this time frame are treated
with hypothermia for 3 days. Currently about half of hypothermia-treated HIE neonates experience adverse
outcomes with personal and socioeconomic implications. Clearly, there is an unmet need for adequate
therapeutic interventions against HIBI beyond current SOC. The divalent ion channel-kinase fusion protein
TRPM7 controls critical cellular processes involved in ischemic events, including experimental HIBI, and
is a biologically logical and highly promising target for drug development, particularly in light of the discovery of
a highly selective and potent inhibitor, waixenicin A (WaixA). This provides an excellent starting point to
develop semi-synthetic derivatives of WaixA with improved pharmacological properties towards therapeutic
intervention in HIBI.
Due to the established
involvement of TRPM7
in hypoxia and WaixA
effectiveness in HIBI, we
hypothesize that semi-
synthetic waixA
derivatives protect
against HIBI; that semi-
synthetic analogs of WaixA covalently bind to TRPM7; and that, based on its excellent predicted blood-brain-
barrier properties, optimized semi-synthetic analogs of waixA with improved physiochemical properties can serve
as therapeutic leads against HIBI.
To address the above, our interdisciplinary IGNITE team proposes to employ a combination of
complementary approaches that rest on our respective core expertises and competencies: (1) Semi-
synthetic optimization of WaixA analogs through proposed derivatization of isolated WaixA (R61); (2) Potency,
selectivity, ADME and safety screens of semi-synthetic waixenicin derivatives in vitro through a Medicinal
Chemistry Screening Cascade and selection of 3 WaixA analogs as lead compounds for in vivo work (R61); (3)
Therapeutic validation of these 3 qualifying semi-synthetic waixenicin derivatives in an established mouse model
of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) in vivo (R61 and R33) to ulitmately enable transition to Blueprint."

The Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services (CHIPTS) proposes an HIV/AIDS
research agenda aimed to reduce HIV transmissions. CHIPTS promotes science, networking, and capacity
building to aid viral suppression for people with HIV (PWH) and reduces HIV infections for those at-risk, for
those living with mental health and substance use disorders and barriers to social and structural determinants
of health (which we termed as comorbidities). CHIPTS is a collaboration of leading scientists from UCLA,
Charles Drew University, Friends Research Institute, and RAND Corporation. Five research themes are
proposed: (1) guide a Southern California regional strategy to End the HIV Epidemic; (2) stimulate HIV
prevention research that addresses comorbidities among key populations in U.S. and globally (MSM of color,
transgender women, etc.); (3) catalyze multi-level combination behavioral, biomedical, technological and
structural prevention research; (4) promote diversity, demand equity and support inclusion in the developing
the next generation of HIV science and HIV scientists; and (5) create innovative methods to advance these
themes. The specific aims are: (1) Science: To promote novel, high impact and transformational research that
disrupts barriers to implementation, uptake, adherence, and persistence across HIV prevention, care, and

10744221,"Alcohol-associated diseases and disorders (AAD) account for over 5% of global health problems. AAD
is more common among veterans, and more than 30% of young men in the military are heavy drinkers, twice as
much as their civilian counterparts. Alcohol misuse is high in veterans exposed to combat-related traumatic
stress or experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AAD and PTSD symptoms feedback into one
another and impede the recovery from both disorders. Therefore, treating AAD patients comorbid with PTSD is
complicated and requires a deeper understanding of the cross-talk between alcohol and stress. Behavioral
intervention is not efficacious in moderate to heavy alcohol drinkers, and its benefit in PTSD is inconsistent. The
common conditions associated with AAD and PTSD are endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Clinical and
experimental evidence indicates that intestinal dysbiosis (depleted beneficial species, increased pathobionts,
and decreased diversity) is necessary for developing endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Therefore,
dysbiosis is a crucial therapeutic target for treating AAD and PTSD. The critical barrier in this field is that the
mechanisms involved in alcohol and stress-induced dysbiosis are poorly defined. There is no treatment with
clear evidence of efficacy available for treating AAD or AAD comorbid with PTSD. Our long-term goal is to
describe the pathophysiology of AAD-stress comorbidity and develop novel therapeutic strategies by targeting
the gut microbiota. Our preliminary studies have identified that: 1) chronic restraint stress (CRS) and
corticosterone exacerbate ethanol (EtOH)-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation,
liver damage, and neuroinflammation in mice. 2) Corticosterone reinforces EtOH-induced dysbiosis and
depletion of Paneth cell a-defensin mRNA. 3) Deleting intestinal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) prevents
corticosterone and EtOH-induced gut permeability and systemic response. 4) Knockout of intestinal NR3C1
(encoding GR) prevents corticosterone and EtOH-induced defensin mRNA depletion and dysbiosis. 5)
Corticosterone and EtOH reduce intestinal mRNA for T-cell receptor 4 (TCF4), the transcription factor required
for a-defensin production. These findings form the scientific premise and support
the central hypothesis that the Paneth cell GR drives stress and alcohol-associated dysbiosis, gut
permeability, and systemic responses by suppressing a-defensin production. Our overall objective is to define
the role of Paneth cell GR and the downstream mechanism in stress and alcohol-associated organ damage and
identify the therapeutic potential of a-defensins in treating AAD comorbid with chronic stress. This objective will
be achieved by determining that 1) Paneth cell GR is required for stress and alcohol-induced TCF4 down-
regulation, a-defensin depletion, and microbiota dysbiosis. 2) TCF4 down-regulation mediates GR's role in stress
and alcohol-induced a-defensin depletion and dysbiosis. 3) GR-mediated TCF4 regulation in Paneth cells plays
a role in stress and alcohol-induced gut permeability and systemic response. 4) GR-regulated microbiota
composition reinforces alcohol-induced gut permeability and systemic response. 5) HD5 and HD6 attenuate
stress and alcohol-induced intestinal dysbiosis and systemic response. 6) Stress and alcohol-induced dysbiosis
and multi-organ injury is reversed by HD5 and HD6. The proposed research will utilize novel in vitro and in vivo
models to identify GR, a-defensins, and dysbiosis as therapeutic targets for AAD and PTSD."

There is a gap in the knowledge for staging in patients with primary mitral regurgitation (PMR) because there is
a 20% chance of having an LV ejection fraction (EF) < 50% after mitral valve repair despite having an LVEF >
60% prior to surgery. Current predictive models such as STS-PROM and EuroSCORE, do not incorporate
individual responses to oxidative and inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This is
especially important in PMR because there is severe cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal breakdown, myofibrillar loss,
oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage despite LVEF > 60%. Red blood cell hemolysis during CPB and
resultant free hemoglobin (Hb) and heme produce oxidative stress and cell injury. Formation of exosomes
(Exos) constitute a protected delivery system of Hb and heme through the circulation to cells throughout the
body. Here we show that Exos Hb content peaks 30 minutes after aortic cross clamp release (XCR) is related
to the extent of acute cardiac injury in PMR patients. Injection of XCR Exos into rats results in acute cardiac
and kidney injury. Another important factor is that current guidelines incorporate Echo/Doppler imaging that
underestimate the severity of LV remodeling in PMR. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the gold
standard for cardiac volume and mass from serial short axis slices independent of geometric assumptions. We
have shown that CMR is essential in PMR, where simple LV dimensions and geometry-based volumes belie
true LV volumes. Taken together, we hypothesize that CPB through Exos Hb release subjects this already
adversely remodeled LV and damaged myocardium to an acute injury from which it does not completely
recover resulting in a decrease in post-surgical LVEF < 50%. This grant addresses this problem in a series of
three connected Aims that 1) relate Exos Hb content to heart and kidney injury and LVEF post-surgery in PMR
patients and in our in vivo rat model system, 2) develop treatment strategies that not only target Exos Hb but
also block Exos uptake by cells. Compared with conventional methods, machine learning methods have
advantages in improving prediction performance. 3) Develop machine learning models that use parameters
including baseline CMR LV function and blood Exos Hb content, and post XCR Exos Hb content, free Hb, urine
KIM-1 and NGAL, blood creatinine, and hsTroponin to predict the CMR LVEF six months post PMR surgery.
Timing for surgical intervention in patients with PMR is a major question today because of the now well-
accepted 20% risk of a decrease in LVEF post-surgery. The current study will not only establish LV functional
guidelines for surgical risk but also intraoperative heart and kidney injury. The findings may identify new CMR
guidelines for surgical intervention and potentially novel myocardial protection strategies that minimize further
damage to the already compromised PMR LV."
10721357,"Project Summary:
OA is a leading cause of chronic pain and disability in our Veterans who develop OA at significantly younger
ages and in higher numbers than non-Veterans. Consequently, the disease burden of OA is disproportionately
borne by Veterans and the VA Healthcare system (VAHCS). Currently there are no disease modifying anti-
osteoarthritis drugs (DMOAD) due in part to a historical focus on identification and tracking of radiographic OA
outcomes rather than pain and function-related disease pathways. Our integrated research program in the Treat
Osteoarthritis Pain and Progression (TOPP) Collaborative Merit program will test the central hypothesis that
variability in OA pain and structural progression is related to heterogeneity in the cellular and molecular
responses of bone, cartilage, and synovium to inflammation and joint loading. This Collaborative Merit will
pursue two overarching Specific Aims: Aim 1: To improve understanding of osteoarthritis (OA) pathogeneses to
enable development of targeted therapeutic approaches, and Aim 2: To establish preclinical data for new
therapeutic targets to reduce pain and prevent OA progression. Using early and late OA clinical cohorts
prevalent in the VAHCS and joint injury animal models to test novel therapeutic approaches will require
coordinated multidisciplinary bench to bedside work for that no single project can adequately address. Further,
we will couple results from treatment efficacy of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), targeting nerve growth factor
(NGF), and targeting mast cells in preclinical OA animal models with human OA phenotyping and stratification
will allow for rapid transition to clinical trials in OA and joint injury. The goal of Project 4 is to determine if
transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulations (tVNS) reduces pain and prevents structural progression in
acute and chronic preclinical OA models. VNS, currently FDA approved for epilepsy and depression,
activates a cholingeric anti-inflammatory pathway, driving production of acetylcholine (Ach) in nerves and non-
neuronal cells, and provides a strong systemic anti-inflammatory effect that reduces synovial inflammation and
joint pain in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis. Within the joint, cholinergic fibers innervate the synovium,
trabecular bone, and periosteum and studies suggest that the parasympathetic nervous system modulates
nociceptive pain and possibly OA pathogenesis. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 (α7NAChR) in macrophages,
T cells, and chondrocytes may mediate VNS effects. Based on these and our exciting preliminary data showing
improved pain after 4 weeks of VNS in the destabilized medial meniscal injury model, our hypothesis is that tVNS
reduces pain and prevents structural progression in OA. We will test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) Test if
tVNS reduces pain in acute and chronic mouse models of OA, (2) test if tVNS slows structural progression of
acute and chronic mouse models of OA, and (3) Integrate outcomes of tVNS in OA animal models with human
OA phenotyping to identify biomarkers predictive of VNS response or OA progression. Results will have a
substantial impact on Veteran Health by providing critical preclinical evidence that VNS improves pain and
prevents progression of OA and will provide important human biomarkers to improve selection of patients with
early or late-stage OA for clinical trials of VNS and other emerging treatments."
10687232,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the incident of stroke by identifying the most vulnerable patients
using MRI scans. Currently roughly 1 of every 8 patient who have had an initial stroke from intracranial
atherosclerosis disease (ICAD) will suffer a second stroke within a year. Patients who are likely to fail medical
management have loss of cerebrovascular reserve, poor collateral arterial blood supply, and/or plaque that is
vulnerable to rupture from active macrophage infiltration. Our goal is to identify vulnerable patients to inform the
selection for new medical management protocols, stenting or stent-less angioplasty. We will develop a suite of
new MRI scans and evaluate them in the intended patient population, comparing to reference standard CO2
Challenge CVR, HMPAO SPECT or direct imaging of active macrophages.
Significance: ICAD is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide and carries an extremely a high risk
of recurrent stroke. ICAD patients with severe stenosis (70 to 99%) are at particularly high risk for recurrent
stroke in the vascular territory of the stenosis (~12 to 20% within 12 months) despite treatment with aspirin,
Plavix and management of risk factors (hypertension, smoking etc). The use of new, preventative treatment
including angioplasty, new anti-platelet medication would benefit if the most vulnerable patient can be identified.
Our imaging biomarkers will improve risk stratification for the of stroke in a vulnerable, high risk
population.
Innovation: We have developed time resolve MRI scans that are targeted to risk factor of stroke in ICAD:
 (1) Cardiac Gated “Snapshot” images of transient changes in the cerebral vasculature in response to arterial
 pressure changes induced by the cardiac cycle. These changes are muted by a loss of cerebrovascular
 reserve a risk fact of stroke.
 (2) A new mathematical deconvolution algorithm based on linear time-invariant system theory to quantify
 perfusion supplied to a vascular bed through collateral arterial blood supply distal to a stenosis.
 (3) First ever high-resolution permeability of the intracranial arterial walls to identify macrophage infiltration.
Scientific Rigor: The geometry of the human head and topology of the vasculature are unique, and we therefore
perform all our studies in the intended patient population: humans with ICAD. To ensure scientific rigor, we will
compare directly to reference standard values of CO2 cerebrovascular reserve, collateral arterial supply, and
macrophage infiltration in plaques.
Probability of Success: We have built a strong, multi-disciplinary team with a long track record of successful,
collaborative neurovascular research. We believe this high probability of successful completion of the aims and
high likelihood of clinical translation."
10661744,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of this NCI K08 career development proposal is to facilitate Dr. Erin Gillespie’s
development into an independent investigator in cancer health services research focusing on strategies to
enhance quality and evidence-based care in radiation oncology. This proposal focuses on shortening the
course of radiation from 7-9 weeks to 3-5 weeks (called “hypofractionation”) which is associated with
equivalent cancer control, improved patient-reported outcomes, and decreased costs in patients with breast
and prostate cancer. Nonetheless, adoption has been slow. Dr. Gillespie’s prior work has revealed that the
individual radiation oncologist is highly influential in whether patients with breast cancer receive
hypofractionation or a longer course of radiation.
 The overall hypothesis is that radiation oncologists are the linchpin in radiation treatment decision-
making, and that implementation strategies that harness behavioral economics will be most likely to impact
practice change. My primary objectives are to 1) identify and characterize positive deviant radiation oncologists
(high users of hypofractionation) that will 2) elucidate implementation strategies and associate them with
adoption of hypofractionation across various settings, and 3) pilot test a multi-pronged strategy that promotes
use of hypofractionation in preparation for a large pragmatic multi-center controlled trial. The rationale that
underlies the proposed research and training plan is that, with new knowledge about the levers that drive
physician decision-making (beyond knowledge gaps), healthcare leaders and policymakers can optimally
design and implement systems that evoke change. Dr. Gillespie will harness the resources and expertise at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she is a faculty member in the Department of Radiation
Oncology and the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes. She is also engaged in research in the community-
based setting through the MSK Cancer Alliance. Her training plan has a foundation of implementation science
that incorporates large dataset analysis, mixed methods, and behavioral economic theory.
 In Aim 1 of the proposed study, the investigators will analyze a Medicare dataset that includes claims
linked to prescribing radiation oncologist and organization, and is supplemented by the AMA Masterfile. They
will systematically conduct the first-ever evaluation of implementation strategies in radiation oncology using
mixed methods. Lastly, in Aim 3 the investigators will develop and pilot test a multi-pronged strategy informed
by Aims 1-2 and including audit and feedback. This proposal, together with the new skills Dr. Gillespie will
acquire, will generate new knowledge about the impact of implementation strategies on de-implementation of
long-course radiation – key parameters necessary to design optimal strategies to encourage physicians to
adopt high value radiation. This will specifically support the development of an implementation strategy that will
be tested in a subsequent prospective randomized trial to assess real world efficacy."
10906123,"Project Summary
Despite the existence of promising osteoarthritis (OA) drugs, its treatment remains a challenge due to ineffective
drug delivery systems. Intra-articular (IA) delivery is inadequate as drugs rapidly clear out from joint space and
are unable to penetrate through the dense, negatively charged cartilage and reach their cell and matrix target
sites at optimal concentrations. As a result, no disease modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) have passed clinical
trials due to concerns of systemic toxicity and lack of cartilage targeting. For effective treatment, it is critical to
stimulate a disease modifying biological response within multiple joint tissues, including cartilage, synovium and
subchondral bone. Interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is proven to be a promising DMOAD for
modulating both synovium inflammation and cartilage catabolism in preclinical models of post-traumatic (PT)OA;
however, it has failed to show sustained clinical effect owing to lack of cartilage targeting and short joint residence
time. The high negative charge density of cartilage provides a unique opportunity to use electrostatic interactions
for enhancing uptake, depth of penetration, and retention of cationic drugs or drug carriers. We have shown that
the cationic glycoprotein Avidin, owing to its optimal size and charge, was effective for intra-cartilage delivery as
it rapidly penetrated through full thickness of cartilage in rats and rabbits following IA injection, resulting in 400-
fold higher intra-cartilage uptake compared to its neutral counterpart and was retained inside cartilage for 3-4
weeks. Based on Avidin’s structure, we have designed a Cationic Peptide Carrier (CPC) that displayed similarly
high uptake in both normal and glycosaminoglycan-depleted cartilage. This project will develop electrically
charged IL-1RA by conjugating it with Avidin and CPC to make it cartilage penetrating and binding, thus
increasing its tissue specificity and residence time. This way, cartilage can be converted from a barrier to drug
entry into a drug depot, such that the anti-catabolic effects of charged IL-1RA in both cartilage and nearby
synovium are significantly enhanced compared to unmodified IL-1RA. In Aim 1, Avidin-IL-1RA and CPC-IL-1RA
will be characterized and their key transport properties (diffusivities, equilibrium uptakes, partitioning, binding
constants) will be compared with unmodified IL-1RA in normal and arthritic cartilage. Aim 2 will evaluate the
biological efficacy of a single dose of charged IL-1RA for inhibiting cytokine induced catabolism in a cartilage-
synovium co-culture OA model, comparing Avidin/CPC-IL-1RA conjugates with single and continuous dose of
unmodified IL-1RA. Aim 3 will determine the therapeutic potential of a single IA injection of charged IL-1RA
relative to unmodified IL-1RA using a rabbit PTOA model. This work will advance the field of charge based drug
delivery in targeting multiple joint tissues for effective, holistic OA treatment by applying fundamental concepts
of bio-electrostatics and bio-transport. This charge-based platform can be used for delivering a wide range of
drugs to other tissues with similar properties, such as meniscus, intervertebral disc and fracture callus, and also
enable clinical translation of various OA drugs that have failed clinical trials due to lack of tissue targeting."
10907027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain ischemia accounts for ~87% acute stroke cases and constitutes a leading cause of deaths in adults and
permanent disabilities among survivors. The current intravenous thrombolysis is the only available medication
for ischemic stroke; mechanical thrombectomy is an emerging alternative treatment for occlusion of large arteries
and has shown promise in selected subsets of patients. However, the overall narrow treatment windows and
potential risks largely limit the patient eligibility. It is thus urgently needed to identify novel drug targets to develop
new, safer, and more effective treatment for ischemic stroke. As the rate-limiting enzyme in biosyntheses of
prostanoids, cyclooxygenase (COX), particularly the inducible isozyme COX-2, has long been implicated in
mechanisms of acute stroke-induced brain injury and inflammation. However, therapeutically targeting COX-2
has been greatly dampened due to unacceptable complications of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems
caused by long-term use of COX-2 inhibitors. As a major COX product in the brain, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is
elevated by excitotoxic insults and in turn aggravates the neurotoxicity largely via the Gαs-coupled receptor EP2,
inspiring us to target this key pro-inflammatory pathway and to develop bioavailable brain-permeable antagonists
for the EP2 receptor. Recent studies redefined neuropathogenic roles of PGE2/EP2 signaling in ischemic brain
and validated the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the EP2 receptor for ischemic stroke in mouse model
of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using our first-in-class EP2 antagonists. Our overarching goal is to
develop new EP2 antagonists that can be given after cerebral ischemia onset to prevent inflammatory
neuropathology and improve behavioral outcomes. Specifically, utilizing rational design and targeted synthesis,
we will identify novel EP2 antagonists with improved PD, PK, metabolic, and safety profiles (R61 phase). We will
then evaluate therapeutic effects of new EP2 antagonists in multiple animal stroke models (R33 phase).
Successful completion of this project will lead to a proof of concept that EP2 antagonism might represent a novel
strategy to mitigate ischemic injury. Anticipated results will also justify future studies on ADME-Tox, formulation,
off-target activities, efficacy, and more extensive lead-optimization if needed to devise a delayed adjunctive
treatment – along with reperfusion therapy – for brain ischemia."
10721356,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with a
disproportionate burden on U.S. Veterans. Recent data demonstrates that acute kidney injury (AKI), despite
initial renal recovery, is a major risk factor for CKD. The proximal tubule (PT) is the primary target in AKI due to
its high susceptibility to ischemia and DNA-damaging nephrotoxins such as chemotherapeutic agents.
Damaged PT cells dedifferentiate, and initially undergo cell cycle arrest, predominantly at the G2/M checkpoint.
This cell cycle arrest may allow repair of DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species secondary to
mitochondrial damage or directly by DNA-damaging toxins. Sustained cell cycle arrest is associated with a
switch to secretion of pro-fibrotic signaling molecules, inducing resident fibroblasts to proliferate and
differentiate to myofibroblasts, beginning the transition to a fibrotic injury. PT cells also undergo metabolic
reprograming, with severe downregulation of fatty acid b-oxidation (FAO), and limited compensation by
anerobic glycolysis. While restoring FAO either by overexpressing Ppara or by using a peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor alpha (PPARa) agonist attenuates AKI and CKD in murine models, this has not translated to
use in clinical AKI, suggesting additional factors are required to mitigate the progression from AKI to CKD.
 Krüppel-Like Factor 15 (KLF15) is a kidney-enriched transcription factor, involved in a diverse range of
cellular processes, including cell differentiation and FAO. In the initial funding period of the VA Merit, we
demonstrated the salutary role of KLF15 in glomerular disease leading to a composition-of-matter IP on KLF15
agonists by the Veterans Affairs. During this initial period, we also identified that KLF15 is highly expressed in
differentiated PT cells, but is significantly reduced in murine models of PT injury. Utilizing a murine model of
PT-specific injury secondary to DNA damage, we observed that PT-specific knockdown of Klf15 exacerbated
AKI as well as CKD. PT-specific knockdown of Klf15 also increased pathways involving cell cycle arrest,
oxidative stress, pro-fibrotic signaling and a decrease in pathways utilizing FA for the generation of acetyl-CoA,
a central metabolic intermediate in macromolecule biosynthesis and energy production. We also observed an
enrichment of genes critical for FA utilization with putative and proximal KLF15- and PPARa-binding sites,
suggesting potential KLF15-PPARa co-operativity in the regulation of FA utilization. In addition, we
demonstrated a significant increase in glycerolipid synthesis pathways and lipid droplet formation in the setting
of suppressed FAO, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism post-DNA damage. KLF15 expression
was also associated with PPARA expression in human kidney biopsies with and without CKD. In addition,
multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that a decrease in KLF15 expression was independently
associated with eGFR decline, suggesting that the loss of KLF15 might be a key driver of PT injury.
 Based on these preliminary data and strong scientific rigor of prior research, we hypothesize that
KLF15-PPARa co-operativity drives the utilization of excess free fatty acids for acetyl-CoA and glycerolipid
synthesis to prevent maladaptive PT repair post-DNA damage. We propose to test this hypothesis by (1)
determining the mechanism by which KLF15-PPARa co-operativity restores PT metabolism after PT injury
secondary to DNA-damage and (2) to investigate the requisite role of KLF15-PPARa in PT injury secondary to
DNA-damage. This proposal will address a current gap in the field by investigating the mechanisms mediating
transcriptional regulation of FA utilization in the PT cells post-DNA damage. The long-term goal of our project
is to demonstrate that the combination of KLF15 and PPARa agonists is a novel therapeutic strategy to
mitigate PT injury post-DNA damage. Identification of novel targets for the treatment of AKI is of major interest
to the VA, given the high burden of CKD among U.S. Veterans."

The clinical introduction of antibiotics in 1930s-40s represented a major medical breakthrough enabling many
advances in modern medicine, agriculture and industrial practice. Unfortunately, the rise of antibiotic-resistant
microorganisms globally is now considered one of the most challenging public health threats of the 21st century.
The call for action against the threat of antibiotic resistance has now reached the highest level of government
including the Office of the US President (with the creation of the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria) and the initiative for global action by the United Nations, among others.
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended spectrum β-lactamases and
carbapenemases (ESBL-E/CRE), and Clostridiodes difficile are particularly concerning for high-risk patients
who are immunocompromised and/or admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Having the potential to cause life-
threatening infections, particularly in those patients who have already been subjected to multiple antibiotic
regimens, each of these organisms colonize the intestines, and their presence impacts subsequent colonization
by other pathogens further contributing to serious disease progression and even mortality in these high-risk
patients. Although these pathogens have been studied in isolation, elucidation of the dynamic interactions
between pathogens and commensal gut microbiota and their implication for predicting outcomes and,
thus, treatment strategies is more urgent than ever and requires a strategic, coordinated effort. The Texas
Medical Center in Houston, Texas is home to several world leaders in antimicrobial resistance research and
clinical practice with patient access and tremendous expertise in the cutting-edge genomic and phenotypic
techniques who are uniquely positioned to perform concerted and synergistic systems-level studies of the
multiple players that must be understood to address this challenge. These experts have recognized this
exceptional opportunity and the strength of addressing the critical and unmet challenge through the formation of
a multi-institutional collaborative research program Dynamics of Colonization and Infection by Multidrug-
Resistant Pathogens in Immunocompromised and Critically Ill Patients (DYNAMITE). Crucial for the
effectiveness of this multi-institutional research effort, is dedicated centralized administrative oversight and
support. The Administrative Core will serve as the central “hub” for program oversight, accountability,
communication, and project/process coordination for the three Projects and the Functional Genomics Core. To
achieve these goals, the Administrative Core will provide integrative accountability and oversight through the
Executive Leadership Team and the Internal and External Advisory Committees, and administrative support for
all project leaders, research personnel, key collaborators and advisors, and institutional administrative liaisons."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact have been recognized by the WHO, CDC, FDA, and NIH as one
of the most important public health threats facing society today. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
extended spectrum β-lactamase/carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E/CRE), and
Clostridiodes difficile are of particular interest as they disproportionately affect immunocompromised and
severely ill patients. The CDC has designated VRE as a serious threat and both ESBL-E/CRE and C. difficile
as urgent threats. Each of these pathogens is able to colonize and infect the gut, with disruption of the
protective gut microbiome by antibiotics a leading risk factor for infection. The overarching hypothesis of the
DYNamics of colonizAtion and infection by Multidrug-resIstant paThogens in immunocompromisEd patients
program (DYNAMITE) is that patient susceptibility to nosocomial acquisition, gut colonization, and subsequent
infection by pathogens is critically dependent on functional microbiota-pathogen interactions that determine
disease progression and clinical outcomes. Importantly, we posit that shotgun metagenomics data coupled
with inferred metabolic potential is not enough to predict and interpret susceptibility to colonization and
infection in a dysbiotic patient, and a combination of genomics, metagenomics, metabolomics, and
metaproteomics is necessary to elucidate the complex interplay between the pathogen, the microbiome, and
the host. To enable this multi-omic approach, the Functional Genomics Core (FGC) will provide a central
resource to all three projects contained within this application, providing facilities and expertise for whole
genome sequencing, metagenomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. Additionally, leveraging the robust
bioinformatics infrastructure housed within the FGC, we will provide the application of existing analytical
pipelines and disease classifiers–as well as the development of novel pipelines—that will integrate and
facilitate the comprehensive analyses of the data generated for each individual project. As an example, we
have built a high-throughput pipeline for the generation and annotation of reference-quality fully circularized
bacterial chromosomes and accompanying plasmids, and with accompanying metaproteomics data have
mapped 92% of protein signatures back to the source gene. Overall, to achieve the scientific goals outlined in
this P01 application, the FGC will undertake three aims: i) coordinate the transfer of pure microbiological
isolates and patient stool samples from the study sites to the FGC; ii) complete genomic, metagenomic,
metaproteomic, and metabolomic processes of each project; and iii) assist in the analysis and integration of
the multi-omic data generated under each project. The FGC provides a unique and unparalleled ability to
combine multiple omics data types to create a truly multi-omic assessment of the complex interplay between
VRE, ESBL-E/CRE, and C. difficile, the gut microbiome, and the host metabolome, facilitating the goals of this
DYNAMITE program."

Genomics of Pathobionts and Transition From Colonization to Infection
 (Project #1)
Antibiotic resistance has become a critical public health priority due to the devastating consequences that it
may have on the US, world health and global economy. Among the most recalcitrant pathogens, extended
spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E/CRE), Clostridiodes
difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are among the highest priority organisms. A common
theme among these priority pathogens is that the intestine is usually the major reservoir and source of
nosocomial infections. Additionally, most of what is known about clinical infectious disease pathogenesis of
these organisms is based on studies that view symptomatic disease as being “mono-microbial” in nature,
considered to be dominated by the virulence mechanisms of a single pathogen alone without significant
contributions from other microbes or pathogens. Moreover, a major challenge to understand the process of
pathogen colonization to infection in critically ill patients is that these individuals are captured into studies at the
time of event onset (i.e. when they become colonized and/or infected). This situation prevents key mechanistic
insights into why only a subset of vulnerable patients develop pathogen colonization and subsequent infection
and the factors that increase mortality when this process occurs. Our preliminary data show that functional
interactions between these organisms are important determinants of clinical disease susceptibility and severity
in vulnerable patients. Using the facilities of the Houston’s Texas Medical Center, we plan to prospectively
follow two robust cohorts of highly immunocompromised and critically ill patients, namely, patients with
hematological malignancies subjected to stem cell transplant (SCT) transplant and those critically ill individuals
admitted to medical intensive care units (ICUs). A common feature in the care of these patients is the massive
use of antimicrobials causing dysbiosis on the gastrointestinal tract. Our hypothesis, as part of this P01
application (DYNAMITE program) is that patient susceptibility to gut-derived nosocomial colonization/infection
by high-threat AMR pathogens is critically dependent on pathogen adaptability (including acquisition of
antibiotic resistance determinants) and host-microbiome-pathogen interactions that determine disease
progression and clinical outcomes. The specific aims of this project are, i) dissect the population structure of
VRE, ESBL-E/CRE and C. difficile in colonizing vs infecting isolates, ii) Identify genomic features in VRE,
ESBL-E/CRE and C. difficile that correlate with major clinical outcomes and dissect the clinical impact of
colonization in high-risk patients, and iii) determine the impact of antibiotic use on the dynamics of
colonization/infection and development of antibiotic resistance in these gut-derived pathogens. Our
comprehensive translational approach of the DYNAMITE program, incorporating genomics, metagenomics,
proteomics/metabolomics and clinical features would provide novel insights into major factors that influence
outcomes of critically ill and immunocompromised patients."

Leveraging Metagenomics of the Microbiome to Predict Colonization/Infection by Antimicrobial-
 Resistant Pathogens (Project #2)
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing, global threat to public health. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
extended spectrum β-lactamase producing/carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E/CRE) and
Clostridiodes difficile are key antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens that share the intestine as the initial site
of colonization. Therefore, colonization resistance provided by the commensal microbiota of the intestines is a
critical aspect of the pathophysiology of these organisms. The completion of the initial stages of the Human
Microbiome Project has provided new understanding of how the microbiome impacts infections and has
generated novel tools for further advances in this critical area of human health. Additionally, unbiased
approaches to bacterial identification have resulted in increasing appreciation that VRE, ESBL-E/CRE, and C.
difficile often co-colonize patients suggesting that these organisms are interacting with each other in addition to
the commensal microflora. The long term goals of this project, in synergy with other portions of this P01 proposal,
are to dissect the mechanisms underlying how interactions among the commensal microflora, the host, and VRE,
ESBL-E/CRE, and C. difficile impact intestinal colonization and subsequent infection by these AMR pathogens.
Although it is well known that microbiome disruption by antimicrobials is a key initial step in colonization by these
pathogens, we seek to address the key knowledge gap of why only a subset of patients receiving antimicrobials
become colonized and eventually infected by these organisms. To this end, we propose performing longitudinal
studies of intensive care unit and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients at two distinct hospitals in the Texas
Medical Center. Patients will be classified depending on both initial and longitudinal colonization status, and
these classifications will be correlated with metagenomics based microbiome analyses of serial stool samples.
In concert with computational biologists, the metagenomics data will be mined for particularly species or
combinations of species that are either protective against or positively associated with colonization and infection,
including co-colonization. Additionally, we will test whether samples from the clinical cohort can protect mice
from AMR pathogen challenge to validate associations observed clinically. Finally, we will also use animal
models to test how pre-existing colonization with a particular organism under study impacts subsequent
colonization by a distinct AMR pathogen. By synergizing with microbiota experts, computational biologists, and
physician-scientists from the highly integrated Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance, this proposal
seeks to sharpen understanding of how critical AMR pathogens colonize and infect humans in order to provide
a critical platform for novel preventive or therapeutic approaches to mitigate the AMR scourge."

 Project 3: Functional Microbiome and Host Signatures in Transition from Commensal to pathogen
Overuse of antibiotics and adaptability of bacteria has resulted in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pathogens
of significant public health concern. Identifying individuals who are susceptible to infection is critical in
implementing an effective treatment plan and in promoting good antimicrobial stewardship. This project focuses
on developing innovative systems technology to develop microbiome-based risk algorithms that identify
susceptible patients in the general hospitalized population. The project premise being tested is that nosocomial
pathogens that colonize the intestines specifically target individuals with immature infant-like gut microbiota
features that are permissive to pathogen colonization. The notable AMR-pathogens of our study include
Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae,
and extended spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriacae (ESBL-E/CRE) because these organisms
often colonize the intestines before causing infection. Specifically, we show that these priority pathogens often
co-colonize vulnerable patients who are missing keystone microbiota species that appear to be broadly
protective against these bacteria by producing diverse bacteriocins. In Project 3 of this PO1 application, we will
perform synergistic functional profiling of these unique host-microbiota-pathogen interactions to address the
following two specific aims:
 • Aim 3.1. Define the metabolically active microbiota community structure identified with
 pathogen colonization and disease progression in the susceptible patient.
 • Aim 3.2. Characterize keystone microbiota features and their protective antimicrobial
mechanisms.
The study is impactful because we intend to establish predictive microbiome-risk algorithms for precision
infection management of immunosuppressed and critically ill patients. The long-term goal is to advise the
physician and healthcare stakeholders of clinical surveillance and therapeutic interventions that match the risk
posed by each individual’s infection, as well as define host-microbiota-pathogen interactions that are permissive
to other emerging infections."
10889022,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology with mortality still
approaching 10% in 5 years. The leading cause of death in SLE are infections due to the toxicity of
immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for effective and non-toxic
medications to treat SLE. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the basis that effective treatment
should target key checkpoints of pathogenesis, such as the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), which
underlies the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inflammatory lineage specification
of T cells, B-cell activation and antinuclear autoantibody production in SLE. The rationale for this study is
supported by evidence that 1) GSH is depleted in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of SLE patients; 2) GSH
depletion contributes to mTOR activation that drives T-cell dysfunction in SLE; 3) administration of N-
acetylcysteine (NAC), which serves as a cell-permeable amino acid precursor of GSH, blocks the development
of murine lupus; and 4) the preliminary studies suggest that NAC is safe, reverses GSH depletion and mTOR
activation and improves disease activity in SLE patients. In our completed double-blind placebo-controlled pilot
study, NAC was tolerated by 100% of patients on 1.2 g/day and 2.4 g/day dosages, while 33% of those
receiving 4.8 g/day had reversible nausea. Placebo and 1.2 g/day NAC did not influence disease activity.
Although both 2.4 g/day and 4.8 g/day NAC dosages showed preliminary evidence for clinical efficacy, 4.8
g/day NAC achieved greater drops in SLEDAI and BILAG scores. NAC raised GSH, blocked mTOR, and
expanded T regs. The proposed phase II trial will employ the SLE Responder Index (SRI), as a clinically
meaningful primary outcome measure that provides easily interpretable results and yields a feasible sample
size that is associated with adequate power to detect therapeutic benefit over 1 year. To minimize potential
intolerance of NAC and subject withdrawal, the study design includes an open-label dosage titration period.
Patients who tolerate 2.4-4.8 g daily NAC for 3 months will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue treatment on
their tolerated dosage of NAC or matching placebo for 9 additional months. Beyond the premise of validating
clinical efficacy and durability of this therapy in SLE, the proposed studies will test the hypothesis that depletion
of GSH and cysteine and activation of mTOR predict immunobiological and clinical responsiveness to NAC.
The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of immune-metabolic pathways that control
T-cell lineage specification with translational relevance for the pathogenesis and treatment of lupus. The
approach is innovative as it will employ a safe therapeutic intervention to define the role of cysteine depletion in
redox-dependent mTOR activation and pro-inflammatory T-cell development in lupus patients in vivo. The
results will bring new perspectives to our understanding of disease pathogenesis with broad translational
relevance for clinical management of patients with SLE."

Our mission is to develop an innovative anti-cancer drug delivering bone cement for bone metastasis patients,
which can be injected into metastasis-caused bone degeneration sites in a minimally invasive manner, to regress
cancer, regenerate bone, and stop the pain. Metastasis is the main cause of cancer death. Bone is one of the
most frequent cancer metastatic sites. About 350,000 Americans die due to bone metastasis each year.
Metastasized cancer cells can extensively destroy the bone by over-activating osteoclasts. Fragilized bone easily
gets fractured by simple movement, causing intolerable pain and immobility to bone metastasis patients. As a
result, the life quality of bone metastasis patients is extremely poor.
 Bone metastasis is currently incurable. In the clinic, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement is
dominantly used to instantly stabilize the metastasis-caused bone fractures of dying cancer patients to reduce
their devastating pain, based on its excellent mechanical strength. However, PMMA is plexiglass that does not
regenerate bone and has a high risk of serious adverse events. As cancer therapeutics are rapidly advancing,
bone metastasis patients are living longer than before. Therefore, there is an urgent and unmet medical need
for an advanced cement that can support the recovery of cancer patient health. To overcome the drawbacks of
PMMA cement, calcium phosphate cement has been used for bone regeneration based on its similar
composition to native bone. However, existing calcium phosphate cement products burst release drugs and none
of them received FDA approval for drug delivery purposes.
 To solve this important medical problem, we aim to develop a paradigm-shifting “healing cement” that
can deliver anti-cancer drugs and regenerate bone by using innovative whitlockite material. Whitlockite is the
second most abundant bone mineral in the human body, which exists with a higher ratio in younger aged people
and earlier stage of mineralization. Our team has developed a large scale, facile synthetic method of whitlockite
and showed its superior bone regeneration capacity and mechanical strength compared to existing calcium
phosphate bone substitute products in the clinic. Recently, excitingly, we advanced the synthetic process of
whitlockite and developed an injectable whitlockite-based cement. Strikingly, this advanced whitlockite-based
cement could load a significantly large quantity of drugs and release them in a sustained manner. Based on this
innovative invention, through this NIH STTR program, we aim to manufacture the first anti-cancer drug delivering
bone cement product and translate it into the clinic to benefit bone metastasis patients. We envision that our
innovative anti-cancer drug delivering whitlockite-based bone cement product will provide a breakthrough to
overcome bone metastasis. We also expect this whitlockite-based bone cement will significantly reduce the side
effects of anti-cancer drugs on other organs by enabling targeted therapy to the bone."
10889181,"The decidua is thought to play a central role in pregnancy by providing trophic and structural support for the
placenta. In addition, recent work has indicated that it actively inhibits tissue reactions that, while normal for
other tissues, would be problematic for pregnancy. One particularly important example is the suppression of
acute inflammatory reactions, including ones that could recruit activated T cells from the blood. This proposal
investigates the extent to which such suppression is due to the epigenetic silencing of inflammatory target
genes in decidual stromal cells (DSCs). Specifically, we seek to gain insight into how repressive histone
modifications generated in DSCs upon their differentiation from endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) prevent gene
expression that would otherwise engender maladaptive inflammatory and immune reactions. Importantly,
inflammation itself is known to regulate the generation and erasure of histone marks in a variety of non-uterine
contexts, and once altered, the histone configuration of an affected gene locus can persist for extended
periods of time. Thus, we will also test the hypothesis that pre-implantation uterine inflammation can affect
post-implantation pregnancy outcomes in part by permanently altering the histone configurations of select gene
loci in endometrial stromal cells. These configurations might be detrimental to early pregnancy to the extent
they allow for maladaptive inflammatory reactions, but they also might be advantageous to the extent that they
limit such reactions. In Aim 1, we will determine, in genome-wide fashion and in both mice and humans, how
repressive histone mark (H2AK119Ub, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) distributions change in ESCs upon
decidualization. This Aim will assess ESCs from endometrial biopsies of non-pregnant women and DSCs from
first trimester decidual specimens. The specimens will moreover come from normal women and women with
endometriosis, thus providing insight into how endometrial inflammation influences mark generation in vivo. We
will perform parallel studies in mice, inducing uterine inflammation in the pre-implantation period to determine
its effects on histone mark generation in post-implantation DSCs. Aim 2 then utilizes genetic mouse models in
order to functionally dissect the consequences of disrupted mark generation on the early decidua, including
whether it now mounts overly robust immunological responses that might impair fetoplacental development.
Lastly, Aim 3 will identify the mechanisms regulating the genome-wide distributions of repressive histone
marks in primary human endometrial stromal fibroblasts induced to decidualize in vitro. This Aim will directly
test the effects of pre-decidual inflammation, thus creating models to dissect the effects of endometrial
inflammation uncovered in Aim 1. Together we expect our studies to provide insight into key regulatory circuitry
that underpins the immunological quiescence of the first trimester decidua, and into how inflammatory
endometrial pathology disrupts such circuitry to reduce female fertility."
10889186,"Abstract
Project 3 aims to understand the origins of asymmetry in the human chorion and whether defects in the
component processes arise early in pregnancy. The goal is to test the hypothesis that the smooth chorion (SC
or chorion laeve)—the outer surface of the fetal membranes—arises via a cytotrophoblast (CTB) developmental
program distinct from that of the CTBs of the villous chorion (VC) or placenta proper, resulting in the anatomical
differences of the two regions. CTBs in the SC form a stratified epithelium; CTBs of the VC form highly branched
chorionic villi (CV) that give rise to an extravillous (EVT) subpopulation that invades the uterus. The hypothesis
is supported by recent scRNA-sequencing that enabled dissection of the types and molecular programs of cells
resident in the 2nd trimester SC vs. VC and their neighbors. Unexpectedly, the CTB progenitors (CTB1) resident
in both compartments have very similar transcriptomes, but those in the VC differentiate into STBs or EVTs while
those in the SC differentiate into EVTs and a novel CTB4 population. Likewise, the EVTs resident in the SC and
VC have nearly identical transcriptional programs, but instead of invading the decidua, the SC EVTs remain
intermixed with CTB4 cells. Preliminary data suggest that CTB4 cells actively inhibit VC EVT migration/invasion.
To test the main hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine when the distinct trajectories of the CTB1 cells resident in the
SC vs. the VC diverge. scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and immunolocalization approaches will be applied
to analyze the chorionic sac across early gestation. By comparing the results with our 2nd trimester data, we will
learn how the development of chorionic villi is repressed in the SC and why CTB1 cells in this location form a
stratified epithelium. We will also determine how a pre-existing inflammatory condition, endometriosis (vs.
polycystic ovary syndrome and obesity), impacts CTB1 differentiation. Aim 2 will dissect the signals underlying
the distinct developmental trajectories of CTB1 cells of the SC vs. the VC. The experiments will determine if this
process is under cell autonomous or non-autonomous control by using RNA-seq and computational approaches
to uncover potential ligand-receptor pairs that signal among CTB subpopulations and from neighboring decidual,
mesodermal and immune cells. The effects of candidate regulatory signals will be tested on CTB1 cells from SC
or VC sources in trophoblast stem cell and organoid models for their ability to skew fate. Aim 3 will dissect the
signals underlying the distinct functional trajectories of EVTs resident in the SC vs. the VC. Preliminary evidence
suggests that conditioned medium from SC CTBs inhibits EVT invasion. We will use the strategy described in
Aim 2 along with protein profiling approaches to identify candidate regulators and assay their ability to promote
or inhibit EVT invasion. By completing this project, we will have constructed the first molecular map of human
CTB differentiation that includes the placenta and fetal membranes. The major significance lies in enabling
identification of defects in these regulatory mechanisms that are associated with early pregnancy losses and/or
abnormal inflammatory states such as endometriosis that negatively impact fertility and pregnancy outcomes."
10884146,"Although women and men have about an equal prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DM), DM imposes a clinically
significant excess relative risk of coronary heart disease (44% higher), stroke (27% higher) and vascular
dementia (19% higher) in women compared to men. Understanding these sex differences could inform
research to improve DM outcomes for both women and men. Postulated reasons for the “female disadvantage”
include an adverse cardiometabolic profile (particularly greater obesity) and disparities in aggressiveness of
CV preventive treatments (e.g. use of statins). In addition, differences in endogenous sex hormones, including
estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), may contribute to the excess risk
for women conferred by DM. Although lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight loss) are the cornerstone of
diabetes management, it is not known if weight loss and healthier lifestyle can modulate the trajectory of sex
hormones over time, and the role of these hormonal changes on cardiometabolic risk factors. The Action for
Health In Diabetes (Look AHEAD) Study was a randomized controlled trial among 5,145 overweight individuals
with obesity and type 2 diabetes designed to evaluate the effect of an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI)
compared to a control group on incident CVD events. A major strength of Look AHEAD is its capacity to
address questions of causation, because study participants were followed over 8 years (~3000 with
longitudinal biospecimens for sex hormone measurements), with significant and well-characterized alterations
in weight and with adjudicated clinical outcomes. In this proposal, we will first analyze the stored biospecimens
for sex hormones (E2, T), SHBG and albumin. We will then 1) Test whether the ILI improves endogenous sex
hormones over time and whether the effect of ILI is moderated by sex; 2) Evaluate the longitudinal
associations between endogenous sex hormones and cardiometabolic risk factors (HbA1c, lipid levels, body
mass index and weight, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure) (primary outcomes); 3) Test
the effect of the time-trajectory of endogenous sex hormones on improving cardio-metabolic risk factors and
long term DM outcomes (i.e. CVD, stroke, chronic kidney disease and vascular dementia) over 8 years of
followup, and whether differences exist by sex. Our overall hypothesis is that ILI improves the sex hormone
profile, and that an unfavorable sex hormone profile, i.e. high free T in women and low free T in men, is
associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. Ultimately, understanding the biological role of sex
hormones in DM could target treatments, particularly lifestyle modification, and inform the prevention of CVD
and other DM complications, to reduce DM-related morbidity and mortality for both women and men."

With this K43 Career Development Award, I will develop the skills necessary to reach my ultimate goal of
becoming an independent investigator focused on the use of pharmacoepidemiology and experimental
pharmacology to inform improved strategies for achieving sustained viral suppression in HIV treatment.
Career Development Plan: My long-term career goal is to become an independently funded researcher with
expertise in pharmacoepidemiology (epidemiology and clinical pharmacology) to inform improved strategies
for achieving sustained viral suppression in HIV treatment. In the short-term during this K43 period, my goals
are to
Identify and characterize a retrospective cohort of PLWH in the IeDEA West Africa Database and
determine the epidemiology and predictors of HIV-1, HIV-2 low-level viremia (LLV) in the cohort; and to
determine the relationship between low-level viremia (LLV) and adherence to ART in a prospective cohort
using 3 different adherence measures (pharmacy refill records (PRR), innovative urine-tenofovir POC test,
and innovative TFV-DP in DBS). To attain these goals, I will be mentored during this K43 award period by a
group of experienced career scientists: Dr. Cecile Lahiri, a clinician scientist whose focus is on HIV
cure/eradication; Dr. Oliver Ezechi, a specialist in reproductive and population health whose focus is on the
clinical impact of infectious diseases on women and adolescent health; Dr Antoine Jaquet, a
clinician/epidemiologist with focus on the epidemiology of HIV and related chronic comorbidities; Dr. Igho
Ofotokun an HIV translational clinician scientist with focus on women’s health and Dr. Castillo-Mancilla, a
translational researcher focused on applied clinical pharmacology. For this K43 award, I will complete
coursework and hands-on training in large data analysis and experimental pharmacology, I will also conduct
research that exemplifies the undetectable = untransmissible (U=U) agenda with the goal of learning new
ways of monitoring adherence to achieve effective HIV treatments that will stop transmission and eliminate
HIV eventually. Merging my background in pharmacy practice in HIV care and infectious diseases, with
advanced analytic skills, mathematical modelling, epidemiology, and experimental pharmacology from this
K43, will give me the capacity for a career as an independent researcher.
Research Plan: Emerging evidence suggests that persistent low-level viremia (LLV) in persons with
HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a barrier to achieving the goal of zero transmission
and eradication of HIV1-8, but not much is known about the impact of LLV on attaining the goal of
viral suppression in West Africa; thus, this proposal aims to provide information vital to understand
the impact of LLV in ART outcomes in West Africa. It will also be important to understand if
differences exist between HIV-1 and HIV-2 treatment outcomes in the presence of LLV, since West
Africa is one of the few regions in the world where HIV-2 is endemic. While literature is unanimous
that sub-optimal adherence results in LLV, controversy surrounds the prognostic value of LLV for
clinical outcomes. Some studies attribute the cause of LLV to drug resistance and reactivation of
viral reservoirs, but other studies name these factors as consequences of LLV9-11. The
‘Undetectable=Untransmissible (U=U)’ concept is hinged on exploring pharmacologic, psycho-
socio-economic, and other interventions to improve adherence and achieve undetectable viral
load12,13. Individuals with LLV have been shown to be significantly less likely to subsequently
achieve complete undetectable viral load. The upper limit of LLV (200-1000 copies/ml), has also
been shown to be associated with virologic failure, development of resistance to ARVs, AIDS events
and AIDS-related deaths1. Current WHO guidelines do not advise monitoring or treatment
interventions even after repeated measurements of low-level viraemia. Consequently, patients are
kept on failing ART regimens. Non-monitoring of LLV may result in an epidemic of resistance to
currently used antiretrovirals and poor clinical prognosis in PLWH. Thus, it is vital to understand the
predictors of LLV and its impact on PLWH, to inform improved clinical care of PLWH. Our proposed
aims are: 1).
To identify and characterize a cohort of from the IeDEA West Africa Database and
determine the epidemiology and predictors of low-level viremia (LLV) in the cohort (for HIV-1 and
HIV-2) and ii). Establish a prospective cohort of PLWH in Lagos, Nigeria, to estimate adherence to
ART, using 3 different adherence measures (pharmacy refill records (PRR), innovative urine tenofovir
POC test, and innovative TFV-DP in DBS). To accomplish this, We will assess the prevalence of LLV in a
large West African database (IeDEA West Africa) and also determine the relationship between adherence
with low-level viremia (LLV) in a cohort of 272 PLWH in Lagos, Nigeria and predict future LLV. This will be a
2-year follow-up prospective longitudinal study (3-monthly appointments for urine and DBS collection and 6-
monthly viral load testing)."
10668348,"Photoreceptor dysfunction is one of the hallmark pathologies associated with retinal degenerative (RD)
diseases that manifests in patients as a progressive loss of vision. This encompasses heterogenous diseases
such as retinitis pigmentosa, which affects 1 in 3500 people worldwide and age-related macular degeneration,
which affects over 196 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 288 million people by 2040.
Specifically, in our Veteran population, roughly 7,000 Veterans become visually impaired each year due to RD.
Clinical trials and retrospective studies suggest that RD patients may respond to exercise as a neuroprotective
treatment to preserve vision. Recently, our labs filled a significant knowledge gap by demonstrating that
modest exercise protects retinal function and structure in models of RD and were accompanied by increased
levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact BDNF-TrkB signal transduction. To date,
the cell-types and molecular processes mediating the neuroprotective benefits of exercise are unknown.
Others have shown that astrocytes and endothelial cells in the brain express BDNF and its high-affinity
receptor, TrkB, and that altered BDNF-TrkB signaling in these cell-types contributes to neurodegenerative
disease progression and severity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes modify their morphology
in response to BDNF in the brain during neurodegeneration. Likewise, vascular endothelial cells express BDNF
under exercise-induced physiological stress. These data suggest that astrocytes and endothelial cells may
mediate the neuroprotective effects of exercise in the retina. Our approach is to understand the morphological,
gene expression and functional alterations in retinal astrocytes and vasculature induced from exercise and how
these alterations contribute to neuroprotection. For this proposal, we will use the BALB/c light induced retinal
degeneration model, which exhibits phenotypes found in patients with RD. We hypothesize that exercise
induces retinal astrocyte plasticity and improved vascular function through increased BDNF signaling
mechanisms, promoting neural repair and protection. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate if exercise
influences retinal astrocyte biology, by assessing retinal astrocyte morphology, cellular gene expression
profiles, and retinal astrocyte-mediated phagocytosis. Immunohistochemical labeling, AnalyzeSkeleton and
Sholl analysis will be used to quantify astrocyte cell morphology and density. Retinal astrocytes will be isolated
using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to examine astrocyte gene expression profiles. To monitor retinal
astrocyte function, a novel in vitro live-imaging of astrocyte-mediated phagocytosis will be used. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the effects of exercise on retinal vascular morphology, gene expression and function.
Angiotool will be used for retinal vascular morphology quantification analysis. Retinal vascular cell gene
expression profiles will be assessed by MACS and vascular function will be assessed using retinal functional
hyperemia. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine if exercise-induced BDNF signaling mechanisms influence
retinal astrocyte and vascular morphology, gene expression and function, by blocking BDNF signaling using a
highly specific TrkB receptor antagonist, ANA-12. Retinal astrocyte and vascular assessments performed in
Specific Aims 1 and 2 found to be most informative will be used to compare experimental groups. The
expected outcome of this study is that exercise-induced BDNF signaling alters retinal astrocyte and vascular
morphology, gene expression and improves function in order to promote retinal neuroprotection. Results from
this study will illuminate the morphological, gene expression and functional alterations that ultimately result in
gain of function(s) and or loss/upregulation of homeostatic function(s) in retinal astrocytes and vasculature.
This proposal holds profound potential for the long-term goals of optimizing exercise-based therapeutics and
creating new pharmacological strategies targeting the underlying mechanisms of exercise-induced protection
in patients with RD that can be extended to other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases."
11193651,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goals of this proposal are to: 1) obtain experimental skills and career training necessary to develop an
independent research program investigating mechanisms of bone development and disease, and 2) characterize
a novel target of bone remodeling called G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K+ channel 3 (Girk3), a key regulator
of potassium flux and physiological processes. Our data demonstrate that Girk3-/- mice develop high bone mass
after skeletal maturity and have low interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and other circulating cytokines. The overall
objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that Girk3 deletion enhances bone density in adult skeletons
by altering the secretion of IL-1β and other monocyte-derived cytokines that modify bone resorption. During the
mentored K99 phase, the specific aims are to identify how deletion of Girk3 in monocytes affects bone mass
(Aim 1) and to determine how Girk3 regulates cytokine production by blood and bone marrow monocytes (Aim
2). Methods used to evaluate the role of Girk3 in bone remodeling will include dynamic and static
histomorphometry, osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation assays, cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), single
cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and bioinformatics. Completion of this aim will facilitate my transition into the
independent R00 phase when the specific aim (Aim 3) will be to determine if Girk3 deletion can prevent bone
loss in a murine model of osteoporosis via inhibition of IL-1β. The K99 phase will be conducted at Mayo Clinic
and will focus on obtaining mentored training in professional development through meetings with a curated
mentorship team, regular attendance and presentations at research seminars and national research
conferences, participating in workshops on grantsmanship and responsible conduct in research, and seeking
out networking opportunities, as well as conducting the experiments in Aims 1 and 2 and publishing the results.
The R00 phase will be conducted in my independent laboratory and will focus on completion and publication of
Aim 3 and developing an R01 application based on the results. The proposed plan synergizes new skills in
osteoclast and ion channel biology, unbiased spectometry, single cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatics, and
bone histomorphometry with prior expertise in endocrinology and osteoblast biology to create my own unique
research trajectory. The career development plan and research strategy outlined in this application will produce
a robust foundation for an independent research career in musculoskeletal biology."
10676791,"Stroke is a leading cause of death, long-term disability, and socioeconomic costs, highlighting the
urgent need for more effective treatments. Intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is
the only FDA-approved therapy to re-establish cerebral blood flow. But because of increased risk of
hemorrhage beyond 4.5 hr post stroke, few stroke patients (<5%) benefit from t-PA. Further, t-PA disrupts the
blood-brain barrier integrity (BBB) and is neurotoxic, aggravates reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS), generated soon after ischemia and during reperfusion and thereafter, are considered the main
mediators of ischemia/ischemia reperfusion injury. To support this notion, in our previous studies, we showed
that sequential treatment with t-PA first, followed by delivery of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and catalase (CAT) encapsulated in nanoparticles (nano-SOD/CAT), both administered via carotid
artery 3 hr post ischemia in a thromboembolic rat stroke model, significantly reduced reperfusion injury than did
tPA alone. This sequential treatment neutralized elevated ROS levels, inhibited vascular leakage/prevented
edema formation, reduced inflammation, and protected neuronal cells from apoptosis. Most important, we
found out that the sequential treatment stimulated migration of neuronal and circulating progenitor cells into the
infarcted brain, whereas tPA alone inhibited that movement. Based on these promising results, we designed a novel dual-action tPA nanoconjugate – tPA conjugated to nano-SOD/CAT – to achieve neuro and vascular protection from reperfusion injury while retaining the thrombolytic effects of tPA. Our preliminary data show that the tPA nanoconjugate a) has markedly better thrombolytic effects than tPA alone (at 1/4 of the dose of tPA, the conjugate yielded the same degree of thrombolysis), b) causes no tPA-associated neurotoxicity, and c) when given via intravenous (tail vein) injection at 6 hr post stroke, effectively reduces infarct volume, resulting in improved neurological recovery over time and increased survival (~85%), significantly more so than in rats given tPA alone (~20%). We hypothesize that our tPA nanoconjugate, with its sustained neuroprotective effects from oxidative stress and significantly better thrombolytic effects than t-PA alone, could overcome the limitations of tPA alone in
minimizing reperfusion injury and achieving neurological/functional recovery, even if treatment is delayed. Ou
goal is to investigate and develop our tPA nanoconjugate as a safe and effective treatment for stroke. Specific
aims are: AIM 1: To analyze the neuroprotective/thrombolytic effects of the tPA nanoconjugate. AIM 2: To
evaluate the extent of neurological recovery and motor functions over time. AIM 3: To confirm the brain repair
mechanisms following ischemic/reperfusion injury. An effective treatment could benefit more stroke patients
than can be treated with tPA alone because of the extended window of treatment and reduced risk of
hemorrhagic complications. Such a therapy could significantly diminish the extent of post-stroke disability."
10911775,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) remains a major public health issue, with 2020 containing the highest number
of OUD-related deaths on record. Prescription opioids contribute towards a substantial portion of OUD-related
deaths, with the opioid oxycodone (OXY) among the most prescribed opioids and underlying a significant
percentage of OUDs. OUD-related traits, including use and misuse, behavioral traits, and metabolism have a
heritable component, yet genetic variants underlying OUD traits remain largely undiscovered. Rodent genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) with quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping can efficiently identify quantitative
trait genes and mechanisms through robustly powered sample-sizes, controlled environmental conditions, and
the ability to perform direct genetic manipulations to validate candidate genes; all distinct advantages over
human system genetics. We previously identified increases in OXY state-dependent reward learning and
locomotion in female BALB/cJ (J) mice compared to the closely-related BALB/cByJ (ByJ) mice, despite these
substrains differing by only ~8,000 genetic variants. These behavioral changes corresponded to increases in the
highly potent OXY metabolite oxymorphone (OMOR) within the brain in female Js. A reduced complexity cross
between Js and ByJs identified a robust QTL on chromosome 15, accounting for 29% of variance underlying
increased whole brain [OMOR] in J females. Further expression QTL analysis using striatal and hippocampal
brain tissue identified the transcriptional repressor gene Zhx2 as our top candidate gene. Js contain a mouse
endogenous retroviral element (MERV) within Zhx2, decreasing transcription and subsequent protein
expression. Zhx2 regulates expression of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver, the primary site
of drug metabolism, and interestingly we observed increases of brain CYP2D11, a mouse ortholog of human
CYP2D6 that metabolizes OXY to OMOR, correlated to decreased ZHX2 in female Js. Our findings suggest that
decreased ZHX2 expression increases CYP2D expression, consequentially increasing both brain [OMOR] and
OXY addiction model behaviors. The primary objective of this proposal is to assess the contribution of Zhx2 to
OXY addiction model behaviors through regulation of CYP2D expression and subsequent OMOR production in
the brain vs. the liver. In Aim 1, we will identify hepatic transcriptomic and proteomic associations with [OMOR]
and OXY addiction model behaviors through RNA-seq and protein mass-spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will delete
the Zhx2 MERV through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to determine the necessity of this genetic variant in
increasing OMOR production and OXY addiction model behaviors. In Aim 3, we will identify the relative role of
brain vs. liver Zhx2 in regulating CYP2D expression, OMOR production, and OXY addiction model behaviors
through tissue-specific AAV genetic manipulations. Our results will provide critical insight into the genetic,
molecular, and tissue-specific mechanisms underlying OXY metabolism and addiction model behaviors that
could have implications for personalized medicine in opioid therapeutics and OUD treatments."
10764190,"Abstract:
Melanoma is the fifth most common skin cancer; however, it is the most lethal. A minority of patients achieve a
durable complete response to current standard of care immune and targeted therapies. Clues to new
therapeutics may be found in understanding why melanoma incidence and outcomes differ significantly between
groups of people that differ based on sex, geographic ancestry, and environmental exposures beyond UV light.
Numerous epidemiological studies identified an inverse relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption
and cutaneous melanoma. Daily caffeine consumption of at least 350mg (3 cups of coffee) is associated with a
20% risk reduction of cutaneous melanoma. Caffeine is arguably the most widely and frequently consumed
bioactive molecule in the world and is known to alter activity of several cellular proteins; however, its specific
impact on melanoma is unknown. The best characterized caffeine targets are the adenosine receptor family
(ADORAs) which are G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). There are four ADORA subtypes, A1, A2A, A2B,
A3. My preliminary data suggests that caffeine inhibits melanoma proliferation, and that this effect is mediated
by A2A, as cells with genetically depleted A2A were insensitive to caffeine. Additionally, pharmacologic A2A
activation increased melanoma proliferation, together suggesting that A2A promotes melanoma and may be a
druggable target. In preliminary in vivo studies using mouse melanoma models, daily consumption of caffeinated
water delayed tumor growth and extended animal survival. This proposed study aims to understand the
mechanism by which caffeine displays an anti-melanoma effect and if it is through modulating tumor intrinsic
A2A. The central hypothesis is that caffeine inhibits melanoma through a pro-proliferative G protein-coupled
A2A receptor signaling pathway and that caffeine may be beneficial alone or in combination with standard of
care immune and/or targeted therapeutics to improve melanoma outcomes. In Aim 1, I will determine whether
caffeine inhibits melanoma proliferation via modulation of A2A signaling and elucidate which G proteins are
coupled to A2A in melanoma. In Aim 2, I will determine if caffeine’s anti-melanoma effect is mediated by tumor-
intrinsic expression of A2A and if caffeine can potentiate the effects of the current standard of care. This project
will delineate the anti-melanoma effects of caffeine and provide mechanistic/biomolecular insight to the many
epidemiological observations, potentially leading to new therapeutics."
10720880,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is 3-4 times more prevalent in Veterans than in the general population,
and this disparity is anticipated to increase due to heightened awareness, better diagnostic procedures, extension
of ongoing conflicts, and prolonged, repeated deployments. PTSD has been described as a life sentence due to
its association with increased risk of chronic disease, accelerated aging, and premature mortality. Most studies to
date have focused on understanding the direct impacts of PTSD on mental health. Only recently has attention
shifted to understanding the comorbidities that lead to this life sentence. Meta analyses suggest that low bone
mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis are significant comorbidities for patients with PTSD. Thus, identification of
PTSD-related risk and subsequent mechanisms for the development of low bone mass disease is critical and
highly relevant to providing comprehensive health care for our Veterans.
 To begin to address this growing health concern, we have established a murine model that exhibits key clinical
DSM-5 characteristics of PTSD, including intrusiveness, avoidance, hyperarousal, and lasting symptoms. Using
this preclinical model, we have shown that mice with a PTSD-like phenotype exhibit trabecular bone loss and
decreased mechanical properties. Mechanisms driving this bone loss are unclear; however, our preliminary data
implicate inflammation and the ubiquitously expressed src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2
(SHP2) as drivers of PTSD-associated bone loss. SHP2 has been shown to integrate multiple signaling events
across a variety of physiological and pathological functions, including inflammation, to regulate PI3K/AKT and
MEK/ERK signaling. In our model of PTSD, we show SHP2 expression is increased in bone and that inhibition of
SHP2 results in increased osteogenesis and decreased osteoclastogenesis in vitro and improved bone health in
mice with PTSD in vivo. Based on these data, Specific Aims will test the hypothesis that PTSD negatively impacts
bone health through SHP2-mediated regulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Aim 1 will uncover
cellular mechanisms by which PTSD alters osteoblast-osteoclast balance to promote bone loss. Clinically-relevant
readouts will be used to determine the comprehensive impact of PTSD on bone health. Based on our identification
of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived osteoprogenitors, studies will evaluate if PTSD differentially affects
osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis from multiple progenitors to lead to observed bone phenotypes. As
inflammation has been shown to play a significant role in disrupting osteoclast-osteoblast equilibrium, the role of
inflammation in PTSD-related bone loss will also be examined. Aim 2 will define mechanistic roles of SHP2 in
PTSD-driven bone loss. This aim will determine the impact of SHP2 inhibition on progenitor cell, osteoblast, and
osteoclast survival, proliferation, differentiation/maturation, and function in vitro. Both downstream effectors and
upstream mediators, including inflammatory factors, will be examined. To demonstrate the functional role of SHP2
in PTSD-related bone loss, SHP099 will be delivered to mice that exhibit a PTSD-like phenotype, and effects on
bone loss will be quantified and compared to standard of care bisphosphonate treatment.
 Given the increased incidence of PTSD in Veterans, PTSD-driven bone loss represents an important, yet
underappreciated, clinical problem. Our study is significant because it is the first to test the impact of PTSD on
osteogenic and osteoclastogenic progenitors and to determine if PTSD causes an imbalance of these cell types
and/or inflammation through altered SHP2 signaling to cause net bone loss. Using an innovative preclinical model
with high face and etiological validity, this study will provide new insight into mechanisms at the intersection of
PTSD and bone health, identify unique markers for PTSD-related skeletal comorbidity, classify PTSD as a critical
risk factor for bone loss and subsequent bone morbidities, inform clinical practice by increasing awareness of
the importance of monitoring bone health in patients with PTSD, and define SHP2 as clinically relevant novel
therapeutic target to mitigate bone loss induced by PTSD."
10909789,"Obesity and associated metabolic disease, including type II diabetes, is a public health crisis, the risks of which
are elevated in military Veterans. Adipose tissue metabolism is dysregulated in obesity and is a central
mediator of diabetes pathogenesis, but underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. The extracellular matrix
(ECM) is an understudied component of adipose tissue, and our preliminary data demonstrate that that ECM
regulates adipocyte metabolic dysfunction in the context of diabetes and identify Advanced Glycation End-
products (AGE) modification of the ECM as a mechanisms of adipose tissue dysfunction in diabetes. These
observations suggest adipose tissue ECM as a novel therapeutic target for diabetes.
The scientific goals of this proposal are to define the role of the ECM and AGE in regulating adipocyte
metabolism, and to develop novel adipose tissue-based vehicles to manipulate systemic insulin resistance in
vivo. Our central hypothesis is that in diabetes, adipose tissue ECM regulates adipocyte cellular metabolism
via an AGE-integrin-cytoskeleton signaling axis triggered by increased matrix stiffness in DM, and that
manipulation of matrix stiffness can be exploited to modulate adipocyte cellular metabolism and the effects of
ASC on systemic insulin resistance. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on extensive literature linking
alterations in adipose tissue ECM and metabolism to obesity and diabetes, and our preliminary data confirming
ECM regulation of adipocyte metabolism and implicating AGE- mediated regulation of the adipocyte
cytoskeleton in ECM-adipocyte crosstalk. Aim 1 will define the role of AGE-integrin-cytoskeleton signaling in
regulating human adipose tissue dysfunction in vitro in the context of diabetes in a human ECM-adipocyte
culture system. Aim 2 will study the role of AGE in regulating human adipose tissue metabolism in an in vitro
human 3D-adipocyte hydrogel culture model that permits manipulation of matrix mechanics. Aim 3 will study
the role of adipose stromal cells and matrix in regulating systemic metabolism using a murine xenograft
transplant model in which human adipose tissue stromal cells are transplanted into mice in engineered
hydrogel vehicles to ameliorate systemic insulin resistance. This project is significant because it will define
mechanisms of ECM-adipocyte crosstalk in diabetes, bridging an important knowledge gap and advancing an
understanding of ECM control of adipose tissue and systemic metabolism. This project also studies transplant
of human adipose tissue stromal cells delivered in engineered artificial matrix in murine obesity addressing an
important knowledge gap that will study the role of human cells in regulatinging system metabolism, and
serving as a first step towards development of novel treatment strategies for diabetes with significant
translational potential.
The PI, Robert O’Rourke, MD, is a VA clinician-scientist with extensive experience in adipose tissue and
metabolic disease research. Our research team includes co-investigators Andrew Putnam, PhD, a bioengineer
with expertise in matrix-cell engineering, and Carey Lumeng, MD, PhD, an adipose tissue biologist with
expertise in murine models of obesity. This proposal extends an already unique, robust obesity-research
program within the VA system established by the PI that has been in place for nearly a decade. This diverse
team and infrastructure maximizes the likelihood of this proposal generating novel, clinically relevant findings."
10721355,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects over half of all Veterans and threatens the lives of those with
impaired immune systems. HCMV is the leading infectious cause of birth defects. There is no HCMV
vaccine, and the antiviral drugs have problems with potency, toxicity, and drug-resistance. The long-range
goal of this research is to identify critical points in the viral transcription-DNA replication cycle that would
serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention. This proposal is based on the premise that our gap in
knowledge of how viral early transcription produces viral DNA replication and how viral DNA replication
results in viral late transcription limits our ability to design new therapeutic treatments for the viral disease.
By customizing advanced technologies and developing new tools, we have used integrated functional
genomics (dTag system, PRO-Seq, ChIP-Seq, genetically engineered test viruses, and promoter function
assays) to determine where and when Pol II initiates transcription, identify sites of viral transcription factor
binding genome-wide, and quantify change in Pol II nascent transcripts from individual promoters in relation
to core promoter sequences, transcription factor loss, stage of infection, and viral DNA replication. We find
that there are three distinct pathways to viral late transcription. Two of these pathways involve the HCMV
IE2 and late transcription factor (LTF) group members. The individual role of each of the 3 different IE2
isoforms (IE2-86, IE2-60, and IE2-40) in viral late transcription is unknown. The six-member set of LTFs
bind to Pol II and a DNA sequence signature in gene promoters, forming a preinitiation complex (PIC) that
drives transcription. Diversity in sequence signature pattern likely determines the amount of individual
promoter output. It is unknown precisely when and how the LTF complex assembles on viral promoters and
how the LTF assembly engages Pol II in transcription. Our use of a new high-resolution ChIP-Seq technique
and bioinformatics pipeline to map genomic locations of nucleosomes, as well as IE2 and LTF PICs,
suggests that LTF PICs occupy genome regions not occupied by nucleosomes. This new ChIP-Seq
technique will strengthen our integrated functional genomics approach to further determining the
mechanisms controlling viral promoter transcription in relation to chromatin structure. Our preliminary data
indicate that: 1) the early-late transcription switch lags many hours behind the onset of viral DNA replication;
2) the HCMV promoter population members that are active differs by cell type and condition, and this
difference may involve IE2 and LTF functions; and 3) the HCMV promoter population that is active during
viral reactivation in the NT2 model differs from that in acute productive infection. We will test the hypothesis
that HCMV transcription factors usurp host Pol II that navigates a modified chromatin environment suited to
bring about viral late transcription (Aims 1 and 2) and to coordinate the viral transcription program in diverse
cell types (Aim 2) and under cellular conditions supporting quiescent and reactivation infections in the NT2
model (Aim 3). We will apply a multifaceted approach to each of the specific aims to: 1) elucidate the
regulators of the early-late transcription switch, 2) determine the mechanistic basis for cell type differences
in viral transcription, and 3) determine how activation of quiescent infection changes viral transcription. Our
proposal integrates the expertise of the Meier and the Price labs in virology and transcription, respectively.
We will build on this productive collaboration to complete the proposed research plan. The discoveries
coming from these studies will identify generalizable features of gene regulation that pertain to other
members of beta- and gammaherpesvirus subfamilies, which include human herpesvirus 6 and the
oncogenic herpesviruses, Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus."
10721342,"The decline in immunity with age results in poor responses to vaccines and novel pathogens. Pneumonia and
influenza are the most common causes of infectious hospitalization and death in people who are > 65 years of
age and yet the effectiveness of influenza vaccine lessens with age. An effective immune response requires the
appropriate interaction between the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system and the proper balance
of activation and regulation. Aging affects multiple components of the immune system and we propose that the
cumulative defects and imbalances in the aging immune system that exist before vaccination contribute to
vaccine outcomes. This application will examine immune phenotypes in elderly and young participants before
annual influenza vaccination and determine how these phenotypes affect the B cell and T cell responses to
seasonal influenza vaccine. Aim 1 will determine whether older age, lower naïve T cell number or dysfunctional
naïve T cells prior to vaccination is associated with development of host T and B cell response to seasonal
influenza vaccine. We will evaluate age and naïve T cell phenotype in PBMC samples before vaccination to
determine whether these parameters correlate with host influenza specific T cell responses by ELISPOT (IFNγ
and IL2) and antibody responses by ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). We will pay special
attention to a novel subset of T cells that are expanded in elderly, memory T cells with a naïve phenotype (Tmnp).
These cells express the lymph node homing receptor CCR7 but are transcriptionally and functional distinct from
naïve cells. In Aim 1a we will determine the antigen specificity of Tmnp cells in elderly by examining their specificity
to common viral antigens from influenza, CMV, and EBV using tetramers. In Aim 2, we will examine the
contribution of preexisting monocyte/macrophage phenotypes in elderly to influenza vaccine responses. We will
examine the phenotype of peripheral monocytes in elderly patients directly ex vivo using flow cytometry and
determine if the phenotype before vaccination is associated with the T and B cell response to influenza vaccine.
We will examine the systemic environment by measuring plasma levels of both inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory cytokines. Aim 2a will examine the influence of the elderly systemic microenvironment on monocyte
derived macrophage differentiation. We will generate monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in the presence of
autologous serum and then analyze the development of inflammatory (M1) or alternatively activated (M2)
macrophages and compare elderly and young MDM. In Aim 3 we will determine if T regulatory (Treg) or
dysfunctional T regulatory (TregDys) cell frequencies prevaccination are associated with impaired response to
influenza vaccine in the elderly. Although previous studies suggest there are elevated plasma levels of TGFβ
and an accumulation of Tregs with age, this contradicts the well-established observation of inflamaging. In Aim 3a
we will test an alternative hypothesis that M2 monocytes drive the development of Tregs, but because of the high
levels of IL-6 in elderly, these Tregs are dysfunctional (TregDys). We propose that elevated levels of IL-6 drive the
development of TregDys and that this contributes to persistent chronic inflammation in the elderly. To this end, we
will use in vitro assays with autologous serum and IL-6 blockade to investigate the mechanistic role of IL-6 in
promoting TregDys cells. Results from this proposal will provide insight into the immunologic phenotype that
precedes influenza vaccination in elderly and is predictive of poor vaccine response. Immunologic parameters
of elderly and young preceding vaccination will permit us to propose improvements to current vaccine practices
in the elderly."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is highly resistant to frontline surgical resection and
chemotherapy treatments. Many treatment-resistant cancer types have benefited from immunotherapies that
activate cytotoxic anti-tumor T cells against the somatic mutations, or neoantigens, expressed in cancer cells.
One major challenge to the development of neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy for PDAC has been the low
number and weakly immunogenic profile of identified neoantigens. Efficient activation of neoantigen-specific T
cells is dependent on the recognition of 8- to 11-mer neoepitopes displayed on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
class I molecules. This recognition is the culmination of the biophysical and stereochemical contacts between
the peptide, HLA, and T cell receptor (TCR) molecules. One mechanism to improve neoepitope
immunogenicity is by modifying the peptide amino acid residues to enhance HLA binding or TCR recognition,
thereby enhancing cognate T cell activation, while conserving reactivity to the parental epitope. These modified
epitopes are termed heteroclitic epitopes. However, the stereochemical features of heteroclitic epitopes that
enhance HLA binding or TCR recognition are understudied. Additionally, heteroclitic epitopes have been
explored in the context of a limited number of HLA subtypes, restricting their development and application
across patients. We hypothesize that rational design of heteroclitic neoepitope vaccines through structural
modelling will improve T cell responses against PDAC neoantigens. To address this hypothesis, we will define
the structural binding and spatial display dynamics of both shared and private PDAC heteroclitic neoepitopes in
diverse HLAs. Among shared neoantigens expressed in PDAC, activating mutations in KRAS at codon 12 are
present in up to 80% of PDAC tumors. In Specific Aim 1, we will interrogate the structural mechanics and
immunogenic profile of heteroclitic KRAS G12D/V/C epitopes in a panel of 18, globally representative HLA
subtypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a computational pipeline to identify, prioritize and optimize patient-
specific heteroclitic neoantigen vaccine candidates based on structural epitope features. We will use HLA
binding measurements and T cell reactivity assays to validate immunogenic features of our computationally
modelled heteroclitic epitopes. Together, these aims will define the structural features of immunogenic
neoantigens in diverse HLAs, generate heteroclitic epitope vaccine candidates for shared and private PDAC
antigens, and improve the therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines for hard-to-treat cancers such as PDAC."
10694091,"Project summary
In spite of the major advances in the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, currently some 2 million new
infections still occur annually worldwide and over 95% via heterosexual contact. While prevention measures
have made progress, such as PrEP, these measures are frequently either ignored, misused, or often non-
negotiable for the female partner. Thus, providing choices for prevention of infection that are female controlled
will be an asset in the fight to curb the rate of new infections worldwide. With the recent explosion of broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) from HIV infected patients, several have been used to demonstrate prevention
of virus acquisition, even when administered post exposure. Unfortunately, vaccines have so far fallen short of
inducing bnAbs, and though topically delivered bnAbs have shown protection, such protection has to date shown
limited durability. To that end, a novel approach for expressing antibodies, with surprisingly long kinetics, in the
female reproductive tract (FRT) via synthetic mRNA was recently demonstrated. Delivery was achieved through
direct, rapid, aerosol exposure of the FRT epithelium to naked mRNA in water. Persistence of the antibody was
achieved through the incorporation of a GPI-linker into the heavy chain. In rhesus macaques, the ability to
protect macaque FRT explants from SHIV infection ex vivo has been shown. The long-term goal is to develop
a cost-effective mRNA-based approach for expressing bnAbs in the FRT, providing a new paradigm for
generating anti-infection barriers at the mucosal port(s) of entry. The short-term goals are to optimize the
delivery, longevity and protective efficacy of bnAbs against SHIV infections of rhesus macaques by: 1) optimizing
the delivery approach and protocol such that we have efficient transfection of the vaginal and cervical epithelium,
2) optimization of the antibody linker strategy to promote long-term expression in macaques, and 3) testing of
single antibodies and combinations, including bi-specific antibodies. The efficacy of the optimization will be
tested in a true challenge study in the macaque model. If successful, design information vital for making a proper
device for delivering mRNA to the FRT in humans will be provided, and sufficient pre-clinical data in support of
a future FDA IND application."
10908986,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of the proposed project is to examine alcohol-related sexual assault in sexual minority (i.e.,
lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another non-heterosexual sexual orientation [LGB+]) college students to determine
(1) whether alcohol use temporally precedes and increases the risk for sexual assault perpetration and
victimization, (2) whether sexual assault victimization temporally precedes and increases the risk for alcohol
use, (3) whether daily (e.g., sexual orientation discrimination) and distal (e.g., internalized homophobia, LGB+
community connectedness) sexual minority stress and protective factors moderate the alcohol-sexual assault
links, and (4) whether findings vary for LGB+ students with other intersecting social identities (i.e., gender
identity; ethnic minority).
Sexual assault encompasses any forced sexual act, including forced touching or kissing and verbally/physically
coerced intercourse, including vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Rates of sexual assault perpetration and
victimization are as high, if not higher, among LGB+ college students relative to their heterosexual peers. The
proposed project will investigate the temporal relationships between alcohol use and sexual assault in 352
LGB+ heavy drinking college students. Unfortunately, there is no research on whether sexual minority stress
(e.g., internalized homophobia, identity concealment, sexual orientation discrimination) and protective factors
(e.g., LGB+-specific social support, LGB+ community connectedness) moderate the temporal relationships
between alcohol use and sexual assault among LGB+ populations. Moreover, no research has examined how
holding multiple marginalized identities (i.e., gender minority; ethnic minority) intersect to impact the
associations between alcohol, minority stress, and sexual assault among LGB+ students.
Participants will complete a baseline assessment followed by brief daily surveys each day for 60 consecutive
days. The daily assessments will allow for accurate reporting on the temporal relationship between alcohol,
minority stress, and sexual assault. A subsample (n = ~75) of participants who experience sexual assault
during the daily diary period will complete a follow-up interview to further examine the impact of
intersectionality on alcohol, minority stress, and SA associations. An integrated theoretical framework, which
considers theoretical models of alcohol-related sexual assault (i.e., alcohol myopia) and sexual minority stress,
is utilized to guide this study. This project has the potential to provide crucial information that can be used to
inform the development of LGB+ affirming sexual assault prevention and intervention programs."
10905979,"Project Summary
Invasive fungal infections are a serious public health threat and are associated with high mortality rates,
demonstrating that current antifungal therapies are inadequate. While innate immunity is known to be critical
for host defense against fungi, these complex host-pathogen interactions remain poorly elucidated. Recently, a
novel behavior of neutrophils, a key innate immune cell for antifungal defense, has been characterized, that of
neutrophil swarming. Swarming is thought to play a role in the containment of pathogenic microbes, but its role
in antifungal defense is poorly characterized, representing a significant gap in knowledge in neutrophil
function. The hypothesis driving this research application is that the early events in swarming are critical
determinants of if the pathogen will be successfully contained and that characterization of these pathways will
highlight novel therapeutic options for optimizing neutrophil function during infection and inflammation.
Unfortunately, detailed study of these host-pathogen swarming interactions has been hindered by the
shortcomings of current experimental assays. To address this, we have developed and optimized a novel
microscale device to allow us to characterize human neutrophil swarming to live fungal pathogens. This
microspotting assay allows us to pattern live microorganisms in large arrays, with direct access both visually
and to supernatants for molecular analysis. The objective of this application is therefore to leverage novel
microscale tools to allow rigorous investigation of the dynamic interactions between host immunity and live
fungi during swarming to expand our understanding of swarming biology. We will do this by via the pursuit of
two specific aims (1) Identify the molecular mechanisms by which neutrophils decide to initiate swarming
behavior and (2) Elucidate the molecular pathways that enhance swarming mediated fungal killing. In the short
term, this research is expected to generate critical knowledge on the role of neutrophil swarming in antifungal
defense. Leveraging these tools and the knowledge they generate, the long term goal is the development of
improved and novel therapeutic options for patients with invasive fungal infections.
The work will also provide a strong foundation which the candidate can use to achieve his immediate career
goals of attaining an independent, tenure-track faculty position and to progress towards his long term career
goals of a tenured research faculty position with a unique academic research program studying innate host-
pathogen interactions during fungal infection. In order to attain these career goals, the candidate will also
assemble an effective mentoring and consulting team to promote the successful completion of research and
the continuing improvement of grantsmanship and lab management skills. These career goals and the
proposed research are therefore fulfil NIAID’s mission to pursue and identify novel therapeutic strategies to
combat infection and to support the transition of junior scientists into independent faculty positions via the K22."
10836337,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has been successful across multiple diseases. However, only a small subset
of patients respond to these regimen and identifying patients likely to benefit from these therapies remains
challenging. Current clinical standard relies on histopathology that fail to accurately predict PD-L1 due to
spatial and temporal heterogeneities among patients. Further, screening patients for PD-L1 alone is not
predictive of treatment response due to significant variabilities in PD-L1 assays across labs necessitating
simultaneous detection of multiple immunomarkers. This establishes our scientific premise that an urgent
need exists for accurate noninvasive diagnostic tools that enables detection of both PD-L1 and other markers
involved in immune modulation directly in vivo. Whereas ImmunoPET (positron emission tomography) imaging
has transformed our ability to detect single immunomarkers in vivo, multiplexing cannot be achieved with PET
as signal between radionuclides cannot be distinguished. Without the ability to multiplex, patients would
undergo multiple radiotracer dosing and repeated radiation exposure. Further, dynamic changes in
immunomarkers during treatment would be missed as sequential dosing of different radiotracers would require
>1 week wait time between doses to allow for decay of the radiotracers. Our objective is to address the
limitations of current approaches and enable multiplexed detection of both PD-L1 and CD8+ T cells in vivo with
an innovative nanoprobe, immunoactive gold nanoparticles (IGNs). IGNs labeled with antibodies, Raman
reporters, and 89Zr radiotracers synergistically integrates the merits of immunoPET with surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS, an optical technique, uses near-infrared light to enhance the vibrational
signal of Raman reporters enabling narrow spectral features amenable for multiplexing. Our approach is
unique because clinically-translatable IGNs seamlessly combine the depth-resolved whole body imaging of
PET with the high resolution and multiplexing ability of SERS enabling simultaneous detection of both
immunomarkers in vivo with high specificity. Detection of both immunomarkers in vivo is important because
dynamic changes occur in both PD-L1 and CD8 during and after treatment that are not captured by static
measure of receptors or by single biomarker imaging. Whereas immunomarker detection with IGNs is relevant
to many diseases, we will use mouse models of breast cancer (BC) since PD-L1 and CD8 immunomarkers
play a critical role in BC treatment response. IGNs will detect both PD-L1 and CD8 in orthotopic BC mouse
models (Aim 1), monitor response to immunotherapies (Aim 2), and validate in clinically-relevant humanized
mice (Aim 3). IGNs is a generalizable platform and ultimately our strategy can be mapped onto other diseases
including infection and autoimmunity where PD-L1 and CD8 biomarkers also play a key role. Further, IGNs
can also be targeted to a number of other biomarkers via antibodies facilitating treatment response in multiple
disorders with unprecedented accuracy not achievable with current clinicopathological approaches."
11014842,"There is an unmet medical need for development of more efficacious therapies for castrate-resistant (CR)
prostate cancer (PC). The castrate resistant state of PC is incurable and results from a failure of androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), which targets androgen receptor (AR) activity in PC cells. This has led to development
of second-generation AR-targeted therapies that more effectively antagonize the AR ligand binding domain
(enzalutamide) or reduce androgen synthesis (abiraterone acetate). However, after AR-targeting therapies, AR
and its splice variants are still expressed at high levels and remain transcriptionally active in CRPC and drive
castrate-resistant growth, ultimately causing patient death.
 A major gap in the field is the lack of understanding of targetable mechanisms that induce persistent AR
expression and transcriptional activity in CRPC. In this mPI proposal, we will interrogate the novel concept that
Jak2-Stat5 signaling represents a critical driver of AR gene expression in PC and, therefore, pharmacological
targeting of Jak2 signaling by the new-generation Jak2 inhibitors represents a novel therapeutic strategy to eliminate
AR in CRPC. This is supported by our rigorous preliminary data showing that activation of Jak2-Stat5 signaling is a
strong inducer of the AR gene transcription leading to high AR mRNA and protein levels in PC. Likewise, inhibition
of Jak2-Stat5 signaling blocks expression of AR and AR-Vs in PC cell lines, PC xenograft tumors in vivo and in
patient-derived clinical PCs grown as explant cultures ex vivo. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis
that activation of Jak2-Stat5 critically promotes CRPC progression by sustaining expression of AR and
constitutively active AR variants. We will pursue two aims:1) Determine the mechanisms underlying control of AR
and AR variant mRNA expression by Jak2 signaling in PC, and the overlap of the Jak2-Stat5 and AR transcriptomes;
2) Determine the efficacy of the new-generation Jak2-inhibitors Fedratinib (FED) and Pacritinib (PAC) in
eliminating AR-FL/V7/V9 mRNA and protein expression in CRPC and suppressing growth of CRPC in vitro and
in vivo.
 The proposed work is significant because it will determine the mechanisms by which Jak2-signaling drives
persistent AR expression in CRPC. Moreover, the proposed work will establish whether Jak2 inhibition by PAC and
FED can block AR expression and growth of PC resistant to AR-targeted therapy. The novelty of the proposed
concept is that Jak2 regulation of AR opens an entirely new avenue to directly control AR levels and PC growth
through pharmacological suppression with new-generation Jak2 inhibitors currently FDA-approved or in clinical
development for other purposes. These first-in-the-field studies will have near-term impact for therapy
development for CRPC patients because they are expected to establish PAC and FED as novel agents to target
AR in PC, and translate to a phase I/II clinical study in CRPC."
10811569,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third major cancer in the USA and accounts for 9.5% of all the
cancers among the Veterans. Polypectomy during screening colonoscopy has significantly
reduced both the CRC incidence and associated patient mortality. However, despite the
significant progress, the CRC risk reduction remains suboptimal and specifically worse in relation
to CRC arising in the right colon. Although quality metrics in endoscopy have focused on
improving detection of standard adenomas, there is a lack of concordance between the
conventional adenoma detection rate and ability to visualize sessile serrated polyps underscoring
the need for adjuvant approaches. Also, despite high R0 resection rates in patients with CRC,
local and distant recurrence is still a significant problem and has been cited as high as 40%. The
complete resection of tumor is critical to patient outcomes. We and others have shown that
Claudin-1(CLDN-1), a tight junction (TJ) protein, expression increases in colorectal cancer (CRC)
in stage specific manner, and is highly upregulated during colon cancer progression and
metastasis. Several studies have further validated a causal role of Claudin-1 colon cancer
progression and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In brief, CLDN1 expression increases in a stage
specific manner and an upregulated CLDN1 expression characterizes both, pre-malignant SSA/P
adenomas and CRC metastasis. Notably, in our study, 8 out of 9 metastatic patients derived
orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) demonstrated high CLDN1 expression. We further demonstrated
that using antibody-guided imaging anti-CLDN1 antibodies conjugated to NIR fluorophores clearly
labeled tumor and liver metastases enabling successful fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS).
Similar ability of CLDN1 fluorescent peptides for detection of CRC adenomas was reported by
another lab. Taken together, we hypothesize that intraoperative use of CLDN-1-targeted near-
Infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging probes will improve the detection of high-risk pre-malignant
adenomas and CRC metastasis, and also improve their resection. To this hypothesis, we propose
following specific studies: SPECIFIC AIM 1: To synthesize, characterize, and perform the pre-
clinical safety evaluation of CLDN-1 antibodies-conjugated to NIR fluorophores. The antibody-dye
conjugate ratio providing maximum tumor signal, minimum short and long-term tissue retention,
and lowest toxicity will be established for pre-clinical studies. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Assessment of
the pre-clinical and clinical efficacy of CLDN-1-targeted imaging probes in polyps and CRC
metastasis. The clinical-guiding efficacy of CLDN-1-NIRF probes will also be validated in surgical
samples from adenomas and metastatic tumor tissues using ex vivo imaging of patient tissues.
Characterization of the key molecules involved in the processes critical for CRC progression to
develop novel early detection and therapeutic approaches would not only decrease patient
mortality among VA-CRC patients but will also help reduce associated financial burden for the
Veterans Administration. The outcome from the preclinical studies using the imaging technology
for accurate detection/resection of premalignant polyps and CRC will strongly impact the
management of CRC patients. Successful accomplishment of the study goals will pave the path
for a Phase-I clinical trial for urgently needed novel imaging probes for improved detection,
resection, and management of the CRC and its high-risk precursor lesions."
10721354,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) predisposes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) which often progresses to organ failure.
One of the hallmarks of CKD is tubulointerstitial fibrosis characterized by extracellular matrix accumulation,
tubular atrophy and inflammatory cell infiltration. The main cells targeted by AKI are proximal tubule epithelial
cells (PTECs) that contribute to CKD by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix and by
stimulating myofibroblast differentiation of surrounding fibroblasts, leading to interstitial fibrosis. The goal of this
grant is to investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby PTECs control pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
signaling in order to devise more effective therapies to halt and prevent AKI and its progression to CKD. Although
many pathways have been implicated in both initiation and progression to kidney fibrosis, we will focus on
Recepteur d'Origine Nantai (RON) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) receptor II (TβRII).
Based on the evidence that TβRII contains 5 phosphorylatable tyrosines and some of these tyrosines control
activation of TβRII-mediated profibrotic signaling, we started to investigate the mechanisms whereby tyrosine
phosphorylation of TβRII is controlled. We identified RON as a major receptor tyrosine kinase able to
phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of TβRII. We show that RON and TβRII are expressed on PTECs and
RON activation leads to TβRII tyrosine phosphorylation and enhances TβRII-mediated pro-inflammatory (e.g.
IL-18 secretion) and pro-fibrotic (e.g. SMAD3 activation) signaling. In addition, we show that treatment of PTECs
with the RON ligand MST1 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of pro-fibrotic STAT3 and secretion of TGF-β, a
key determinant in myofibroblast differentiation and development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Importantly, mice
treated with the RON inhibitor Crizotinib show reduced AKI-induced proximal tubule injury characterized by
decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylated RON and TβRII, macrophage infiltration, SMAD3 and STAT3
activation, and collagen production. Based on these results and the finding that increased tyrosine
phosphorylation of RON and TβRII is detected in the kidneys of mice subjected to severe AKI that progresses
to CKD, we propose that RON in PTECs contributes to kidney injury and fibrosis by promoting 1) tyrosine
phosphorylation of TβRII thus enhancing TβRII-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-18) and
activation of pro-fibrotic molecules (SMAD3); and 2) TGF-β secretion in a STAT3 dependent manner thus
inducing myofibroblast differentiation. The aims of this grant are designed to define the contribution of
RON/STAT3 and RON/TβRII axes in kidney disease and to determine if their inhibition is beneficial in
slowing/halting AKI and its progression to CKD.
In Aim 1 we will study the role of RON-mediated phosphorylation of TβRII in AKI and AKI-to-CKD progression
using a genetic and pharmacological approach. We will investigate the response of mice expressing a kinase
dead RON (RONTK-/-) and RONTK-/- mice crossed to mice lacking TβRII in proximal tubules to severe AKI that
progresses to CKD. We will determine whether IL-18 mediates RON/TβRII pro-inflammatory action by blocking
IL18-mediated function with IL-18-binding protein. Finally, we will translate the relevance of these findings to a
more clinically relevant setting by investigating the response to kidney injury in mice treated with a small molecule
RON inhibitor. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms whereby RON contributes to inflammation and
fibrosis. We will use protein assays and in vitro cell cultures to determine the role of STAT3 in RON-mediated
TGF-β production. We will also identify the key tyrosines on TβRII directly phosphorylated by RON and PTEC
cultures to determine their role in regulating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling.
Understanding how the RON/STAT3 and RON/TβRII axes regulate kidney injury and exploring the
consequences of RON inhibition in reducing TGF-β-mediated pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses will
offer a novel approach for the treatment and, ideally, prevention of CKD and ultimately end stage kidney disease."
10721819,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans despite recent therapeutic advances. The
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has provided compelling evidence of the efficacy lung cancer screening,
using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), to reduce lung cancer mortality. The benefits of screening,
however, must be reconciled with potential harms, including high false-positive rates and the possibility of
overdiagnosis. Recent studies demonstrate that lung cancer often exhibits significant molecular heterogeneity
because of genomic mutations, facilitating the initiation and expansion of diverse cell populations within the
tumor, promoting resistance to targeted and immune therapies, and impacting patient survival. It is critical to
characterize and predict tumor behavior in order to develop appropriate clinical management of early-stage lung
cancer. We have profiled lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in the NLST by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and
multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF). Available data includes clinical and nodule information, LDCT images
acquired at three time points, and long-term clinical follow-up, which allows us to assess aggressive versus
indolent behavior. We hypothesize that somatic mutations impact immune responses, shaping the tumor
microenvironment (TME) and morphology, can be described by quantitative features extracted from LDCTs. Our
goal is to develop a systematic approach integrating molecular signature and clinical imaging profiles to
distinguish between aggressive and indolent early-stage lung cancer by utilizing data collected in the NLST study
and validating findings through the analysis of publicly available data sets. We plan the following specific aims:
1) To identify the somatic mutation profiles associated with aggressive tumor behavior. In addition to analyzing
the NLST data, we will extend our analysis to publicly available data sets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) and the Stanford Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Radiogenomic dataset. From these two data sets, we will
select subjects with equivalent clinical features to the NLST cohort. 2) To identify tumor microenvironment
alteration characteristics associated with aggressive behavior in the NLST cohort. We will cross-validate our
TME findings with the signatures derived from transcriptome data of publicly available data sets, as noted in Aim
1. We will deconvolute the transcriptome data to estimate the composition of cell types in TME by utilizing the
cell lineage markers, which we have identified from single-cell transcriptome data of lung cancer. 3) To integrate
the LDCT features and molecular profiles that differentiated aggressive from indolent behaviors in the NLST
cohort. We will leverage machine learning techniques to extract and combine features from LDCT with genetic
and TME signatures, as identified in Aim 1 and 2. Predicting disease aggressiveness will improve personalized
patient therapy for early-stage lung cancer."
10799540,"Project Summary/Abstract
A major obstacle in diagnosing, understanding, and treating Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has been its
characterization by patterns of tau and beta-amyloid (Aß) pathology, only adequately seen through traditional
methods of histological sectioning and staining. To address this, recent efforts following the 2018 framework
put forth by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer’s Association (AA) have focused on
identifying in vivo biomarkers that can be used instead to characterize AD and specifically along a continuum.
Measures gleaned from MRI, such as cortical thickness, constitute one category of such biomarkers. While
they have been shown to correlate with clinical stage of AD, MRI biomarkers have not been shown to be
specific for AD as they have not been able to be linked to AD’s signature patterns of tau/Aß with current
computational tools and modeling frameworks. The goal of this project is to address this deficiency with the
development and implementation of a multi-modal, multi-scale image registration and analysis platform that will
be used to integrate and statistically correlate microscopic pathology data with macroscopic MRI measures of
cortical thickness. The Johns Hopkins Brain Resource and AD Research Centers have prepared 2D digital
histology images stained for tau (PHF-1) and corresponding 3D MRI of medial temporal lobe (MTL) tissue from
control brains and those with intermediate and advanced AD. Individual tau tangles were detected with a
convolutional neural network (UNET) based approach trained on a subset of manually annotated histological
samples. MRI was manually segmented into regions of the MTL, and cortical thickness will be measured from
from generated surface representations of each of these regions. The project’s overall goal will be
accomplished through two main aims. First, tau tangle and cortical thickness measures will be co-localized in
the coordinate space of the Mai-Paxinos Atlas through the development of a registration algorithm that uses 1)
a multi-target model to account for possible distortion in both histology images and MRI, 2) a “Scattering
Transform” to capture textural features in histology images that help predict delineations between grey vs.
white matter, 3) non-rigid transformation of regional surface representations to those of the Mai-Paxinos Atlas.
Second, statistical correlations will be computed between tau tangles and cortical thickness using a hierarchy
of “varifold” measures that capture both data values and relative tissue area to account for differences in scale
(microscopic vs. macroscopic) and sampling frequency (irregular vs. regular) of these two datasets. Application
of these methods to both control and AD brain samples will characterize the correlation of cortical thickness
measures to tau tangle density along the clinical continuum of AD and physically in 3D space, within specific
regions of the MTL, and along particular axes of the brain. These correlations will characterize the specificity of
cortical thickness measures for AD, and the sharing of these methods via an open-source platform will enable
this characterization for other MRI biomarkers in the future."

The brain has the remarkable capability to change in response to experience. This plasticity is essential for
learning and memory, and is an important feature of the auditory cortex, especially for learning the significance
of sensory signals such as speech, recovery after short-term deafness, and the use of devices such as cochlear
implants for hearing restoration. These changes are thought to occur primarily at synapses, basic units of
information processing and plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity requires sensory experience and activation
of neuromodulatory systems which convey behavioral context to local cortical circuits. It is generally believed
that these mechanisms are important for initial adaptation and performance with cochlear implants. However,
little is known about how single neurons and circuits of the auditory system are modified during cochlear implant
training to support performance, or how these mechanisms might be leveraged to improve hearing restoration.
 Over the last decade, the Froemke and Svirsky labs at NYU School of Medicine have been collaborating
with the NYU Department of Otolaryngology and Cochlear Americas to examine unilateral multi-channel implant
use in bilaterally profoundly-deafened rats. Rats are ideal for studying the neuroscience of neuroprosthetic use,
as we can monitor neurophysiological changes in highly-trained rats reporting auditory percepts, recording in
behaving animals to measure single-trial neural correlates and longer-term forms of neuroplasticity over days to
weeks of implant use. Furthermore, we can take advantage of recent advances in optogenetics and imaging
technologies in transgenic rat lines, to monitor and manipulate neural activity in specific brain regions and in
select cell populations. We have found that implanted rats show analogous variable individual performance and
learning rates as with human subjects. In our prior publications supporting the proposed experiments, we found
that response levels and tuning curves in auditory cortex related to individual rat performance. We also found
that activity in the brainstem locus coeruleus- a major source of the modulator noradrenalin- could predict when
rats would begin performing well with implant stimulation, and that optogenetic stimulation of locus coeruleus
produced high levels of performance in all animals. This indicates that neuromodulation and cortical plasticity
are predictive biomarkers and potential avenues for improving performance with cochlear implants.
 Here in Aim 1 we make µ-electrocorticography and single-unit recordings as rats learn to use cochlear
implants to perform an auditory 2-alternative forced-choice task; we will monitor larger-scale cortical cochleotopy
and single neuron responses on individual trials during implant training. In Aim 2, we use whole-cell recordings
in vivo ask how cortical inhibition shapes cortical responses and regulates plasticity for cortical implant learning.
In Aim 3, we ask how cholinergic and noradrenergic modulatory systems respond during implant training and
could be stimulated to improve implant use."

 The development of a high-throughput biotechnology highly relies on relevant computational methods for
systematic optimization and data analysis. On the other hand, the development of bioinformatics methods
requires in-depth understanding of the biological systems and the experimental protocols. The long-term goal
of our lab is to develop computational methods that can be seamlessly integrated with high-throughput
experiments to address biological questions, with a focus on transcriptional and epigenetic regulations.
 Understanding protein functions is a fundamental aim in biology. The recent advances of CRISPR screening
techniques have enabled functional studies of proteins in a high-throughput manner, leading to novel discoveries
beyond the capacity of traditional methods. During the next five years, our short-term goal is to develop
solutions to boost the utilization of high-throughput CRISPR screens for protein functional analysis. To achieve
this goal, we propose three research topics:
 1) Prediction of sgRNA knockout effects for improved sgRNA library design in CRSIPR screens. This will
 address the bioinformatics needs in the design of CRISPR screens;
 2) Protein domain analysis using CRISPR tiling-sgRNA screens. This will lead to innovative solutions for the
 studies of protein domain and structure.
 3) Inference of transcriptional regulatory networks from CRISPR screen and -omic data. This will lead to the
 development of new methodology to address an open problem involving protein-protein interactions and
 regulations of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators.
 Collectively, the proposed project will contribute new methods to enrich the toolbox for protein functional
analysis, and will provide novel insights into the fields of transcriptional and epigenetic regulations."

Creation of Trusted Data Broker to Implement Data COUNTS Program
 September 16, 2024
The Data Collect Once Use Numerous TimeS (Data COUNTS) initiative will facilitate better data access to
address health outcomes, eliminate costly and burdensome data collection processes, and improve the
quality and speed of time-to-access data. The intent of Data COUNTS is to deliver a federated electronic health
record (EHR) and health data collection and transmission architecture based on open-industry data and
interoperability standards for HHS. The FNIH will use its extensive experience designing, soliciting, and
managing complex data infrastructures and public-private partnerships in the health sciences ?eld to establish
a Trusted Data Broker (TDB). The TBD will establish a secure, cloud-based platform for quality-controlled data
collection, transmission, and analysis. The TDB will establish the necessary relationships and governing bodies
to coordinate activities across all stakeholders, from data ingestion to analysis. The system will use extensive
provenance and data lineage tracking and a robust data model to enable HHS researchers to interrogate
patient data in novel ways. The FNIH is committed to meeting the goals of the Data COUNTS initiative and
revolutionizing health science capabilities, addressing a critical gap in the United States’ ability to advance
biomedical sciences compared to other industrial nations. Patient engagement and trust will be central
features of all activities, and the system will be designed and implemented with the eventual goal to empower
patients with full control and transparency over how their data are accessed and used. The ?rst year of the
project will focus on (1) design and implementation of a phased strategic plan for creation of the TDB, (2)
creation of an engagement strategy and a management strategy, and (3) securing technical contractor(s) to
design and deliver a minimal viable product to execute HHS-de?ned use cases. Activities in the ?rst year will
lay the foundation for sustainable and scalable development in the future."
10691871,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common and deadly forms of cancer. In South Carolina, our group
has documented racial CRC disparities that exceed national rates. Most colon tumors arise from adenomas
(adenomatous polyps) that are detected via a screening colonoscopy. Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and
aberrant DNA methylation are key processes driving adenoma formation and CRC risk. Sleep loss and
circadian rhythm disruption can induce inflammation, alter DNA methylation, and increase CRC risk. African-
Americans (AAs) differ from European-Americans (EAs) in their endogenous circadian timing, and they are
more likely than EAs to have poor sleep and excessive stress (allostatic overload or ‘weathering’). This case-
control study will test the hypothesis that disruption of circadian processes and sleep is associated with
inflammation and adenoma risk among AA and EA patients receiving a screening colonoscopy. Molecular
timekeeping is controlled by ‘clock genes’ that regulate circadian gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms.
Clock genes can modulate inflammation (e.g., TNFα, IL-6 expression), and they act as tumor suppressors
(e.g., the ‘Period’ or PER genes). Our research suggests that genetic variation or aberrant methylation in PER
genes is associated with increased adenoma risk, and that sleep disorders can increase CRC risk. Melatonin is
a clock-regulated hormone that suppresses GI inflammation and inhibits colon tumor growth by binding to its
cellular receptors (MT-1, RORα). This study will characterize biobehavioral circadian disruption indicators
(sleep disturbances, social jet lag, fatigue, stress), along with key molecular correlates (PER3 genotype and
methylation of: clock genes [PER1, PER2, PER3]; clock-controlled genes [MT-1, RORα, TNFα, IL-6]; and
global DNA methylation [LINE-1]) to determine their role in inflammation and adenoma risk. A biobehavioral
framework will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Conduct a case-control study among patients
undergoing a screening colonoscopy to determine whether circadian disruption indicators (DNA methylation,
biobehavioral, genetic) are associated with adenoma case status relative to controls, and if the relationship is
modified by race (N=1,000; 400 cases, 600 controls); 2) Determine if circadian disruption indicators are
associated with inflammation in normal GI tissue (TNFα, IL-6 mRNA expression); 3) Determine whether
behavioral and molecular circadian disruption indicators are related; 4) Among adenoma cases, determine if
methylation of candidate circadian genes in adenomas differs from normal GI tissue. Our team has a strong
track record of providing high quality colonoscopy services and in engaging AA and EA communities in
research. Prospective data collection (relative to colonoscopy) and the use of valid, quantitative biobehavioral
and molecular measures will limit the potential introduction of bias. This study will rigorously examine
circadian-based behavioral and molecular risk factors as they relate to GI inflammation and colorectal
adenoma risk. Circadian-based risk factors may serve as novel, modifiable targets for CRC prevention."
11083346,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Here we propose a rapid, field-deployable, cost-effective, highly sensitive and specific lateral flow assay (LFA)
that meets all the requirements recently defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in a target product
profile (TPP) for surveillance activities of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). LF is a disfiguring and debilitating neglected
tropical disease that affects 40 million people in 72 countries and is due to the parasitic filarial worm Wuchereria
bancrofti. To combat this disease, WHO has deployed mass drug administration (MDA) programs globally on an
unprecedented scale. Today, WHO recommends repeating transmission assessment surveys (TAS) twice in 2- to
3-year intervals after MDA cessation, while acknowledging that more research is urgently required to improve
diagnostic tests for TAS and post-treatment surveillance (PTS) until 2030, and beyond. In March 2021, WHO has
published a TPP for the test it seeks, where the key requirements are that the test should be able to detect early
infection, have >85% clinical sensitivity and > 98.8% specificity.
The only proven field-deployable tests for LF are the immunochromatography testcard (ICT) and its subsequent,
more stable version, the Filariasis Test Strip (FTS). These tests have been used for 2 decades to detect active
infections. However, they are not suited for surveillance activities, as they detect the disease only 18 months
after a person has been infected and lack sensitivity in post-MDA settings due to low parasite burden.
According to the WHO TPP, LF surveillance requires an RDT indicative of early exposure to W. bancrofti infective
larvae (L3 stage). Currently, the best biomarker to this effect are IgG4 antibodies specific for the Wb123 antigen
expressed by infective larvae. A commercial IgG4/Wb123 ELISA exists (inBios) and is routinely used at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is not field-deployable. A portable rapid test was introduced by
Standard Diagnostics, now part of Abbott, but fell short of the expected sensitivity and was abandoned (SD
BIOLINE Wb123 IgG).
We have recently succeeded in developing an LFA prototype for the detection of Wb123-specific IgG4 which is
characterized by an analytical sensitivity 16-32 greater than that of the Abbott RDT and equal to the commercial
Wb123 ELISA. We view this as a major achievement. This test is poised to meet the > 85% clinical sensitivity
criterion. However, it is not clear if it will also meet the minimal (>98.8%) or ideal (>99.8%) specificity criterion.
We now propose a biplex test allowing to simultaneously detect antibodies against two antigens, of which one
will be Wb123, and the other one chosen from a series of five novel antigens, termed WbAg1-5 or WbAgX. The
purpose of the dual test is to achieve a superior specificity by imposing the condition that both test lines must
be visible to count the test as positive, and no line must be visible for the test to be counted as negative.
We have been awarded a grant from the Task Force for Global Health (TFGH) and USAID to develop a prototype
version of such a biplex assay. We are now requesting additional funding from the NIH to (1) optimize one or
more biplex assays (2) establish a biorepository of 2000 clinical samples to demonstrate that the TPP meets the
required sensitivity and specificity with > 95% statistical confidence and (3) progress one biplex to manufacturing
and commercialization. By the end of this Phase I/II Fast-Track grant, a total of 100,000 assays will be available
for testing by the TFGH, the CDC, and other stakeholders to generate the field data necessary to secure its
international endorsement. The developed manufacturing process will be able to meet the estimated demand
of 0.5-1 million assays/year at a cost point acceptable to the sponsoring agencies.
It is noteworthy that USAID, which is the largest customer for LF tests worldwide, covering over 40% of the global
demand, has already sponsored our initial research, showing their interest, and providing a clear path to
commercialization. In short, our RDT will thus be poised for the surveillance of lymphatic filariasis, a disease that
figures prominently on the WHO’s 2030 roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases, and which the international
community, supported by major pharmaceutical companies and NGOs, has vowed to eliminate in the 2012
London Declaration."
10895443,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately affect individuals from socially
disadvantaged groups, but the role of lifespan psychosocial stressors in these disparities is uncertain. Social
networks are hypothesized to be key sources of resilience against psychosocial stressors, but it is unknown if
they moderate the adverse effects of stressors on ADRD risk or whether the buffering provided by social
networks is consistent across diverse racial/ethnic groups. Sleep disturbance is a potential biobehavioral
mechanism via which stressors may increase ADRD risk, but the mediating role of sleep has not been formally
evaluated. Understanding the effects of psychosocial stressors and modifiable sources of resilience and
biobehavioral mechanisms on ADRD risk will guide potential interventions to reduce ADRD disparities.
 This proposal encompasses a training and research plan to develop the candidate’s expertise in ADRD
research, preparing her to launch a career focused on reducing social inequalities in ADRD. The research
proposal applies causal inference methods to elucidate the complex relationships between early social
disadvantages, psychosocial and biobehavioral factors, and cognitive outcomes in older adulthood. The
specific aims are to 1) quantify the association between cumulative stressors and cognitive function and
determine how stressors explain social disparities in cognitive function (F99 dissertation research); and 2)
determine the roles of social networks and sleep disturbances in the adverse effects of early-life stressors on
ADRD risk across four racial/ethnic groups (K00 postdoctoral research). This research will use two large
NIA-funded longitudinal cohorts:1) the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS) (F99); and 2)
the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experience Study (KHANDLE), a life-course study linking risk factor
data collected in mid-life (40-50 years ago) with contemporary assessments of risk factors, cognitive decline,
and dementia in a sample of older non-Latino Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Latinos in California (K00).
 This fellowship application aligns with the 2012 National Alzheimer’s Project Act priority to address social
disparities in ADRD. The proposed project will generate new knowledge and provide crucial training for the
candidate’s advancement to become an independent epidemiologist focused on ADRD disparities by
developing expertise in 1) measurements and mechanisms of psychosocial stress (F99); 2) causal inference
methods, including mediation modeling (F99/K00); 3) the epidemiology of ADRD and quantitative ADRD
research methods, including longitudinal analyses and psychometrics (K00); 4) the physiology and psychology
of sleep disturbances (K00); and 5) professional skills for an academic research career (K00). The advanced
training, mentorship, and protected time provided by this award will provide the candidate with the skills and
experience necessary to lead the highest quality aging research and succeed as an independent investigator."

The University of Pennsylvania Telehealth Research Center in Cancer Care (Penn TRC) will apply insights
from communication science and behavioral economics to design and test innovative telehealth strategies to
improve effectiveness and equity across the cancer care continuum, with an emphasis on understanding
mechanisms of action. The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic growth in the use of telehealth for cancer care
delivery, fostered by both clinical need and temporary waivers. Telehealth strategies have included both
synchronous communication (real-time video or telephone conferencing) and asynchronous communication
(sequential health information exchange through text messaging or secure portals). Yet, fundamental
knowledge gaps include the extent to which telehealth may be superior to non-telehealth care delivery
strategies for access, quality, and outcomes; how telehealth may enhance or detract from achieving health
equity in cancer care in the context of the digital divide and persistent cancer disparities; and the impact of
telehealth on health care efficiency. The Penn TRC will address an overarching research theme: to apply
insights from communication science and behavioral economics to design and test synchronous telehealth
strategies, supported by asynchronous elements, to improve access, quality, outcomes, equity, and efficiency
across the cancer care continuum. We focus on lung cancer as a model for telehealth across the care
continuum, from screening to treatment to survivorship. We bring together a team of international experts in
communication science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery, telehealth, health care innovation, mixed
methods, and health equity to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Apply concepts, strategies, tools, and
methods from communication science and behavioral economics to design and test synchronous telehealth
strategies, supported by asynchronous elements, to improve access, quality, outcomes, equity, and efficiency
for patients across the care continuum; 2) Conduct a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to compare the
effectiveness of telehealth strategies to increase shared decision making for lung cancer screening using a
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design; 3) Conduct two rapid-cycle pilot projects,
with methods and measures aligned with the pragmatic trial, to design and test the effectiveness of telehealth
to improve cancer care, identify multilevel mechanisms of action, and lay the foundation for future, more
definitive pragmatic trials; and 4) Build capacity to advance a national telehealth research agenda and train the
next generation of investigators with expertise in cancer care, telehealth and health equity. By joining together
interdisciplinary faculty across Penn, the Penn TRC will result in novel, scalable, and generalizable
disseminated strategies to drive lasting improvements in cancer care and health equity. Penn has an
unparalleled environment in which to bring together these areas of study."
10749003,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Age related traumatic and pathologic fractures are expected to increase greatly in incidence in the coming
decades with aging populations. Older patients are at higher risk for non-healing, ‘critical-size’, bone defects
following fracture. This is exacerbated in composite injuries with concomitant soft tissue defects. These require
multiple surgical interventions and still a majority of patients remain significantly disabled. Therapies, like
bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 are inconsistent
and ineffective or limited by dose related side effects, such as inflammation, respectively. These drawbacks
may be overcome by osteogenic stimulation with biomaterial platforms for non-viral gene delivery.
The Murphy laboratory has developed nanostructured mineral coated microparticles (MCM) that improve
and sustain delivery of therapeutic nucleic acid complexes. These biomimetic mineral coatings were inspired
by the structure and characteristics of fossils. Ancient DNA has been recovered from fossils which implicates
a role in mineralized surfaces preserving nucleic acids. New stabilization strategies are essential as current
mRNA products, like COVID-19 vaccines, require extensive cold-chain infrastructure limiting their
application. Biomimetic mineralized materials may provide a platform for the binding, long term stabilization,
and delivery of mRNA therapeutics.
This fellowship proposal will develop a biomaterials-based method for storage and delivery of mRNA
encoding for osteogenic growth factors and train the applicant for a career as a physician scientist. We
hypothesize that MCM delivery of mRNA can 1) improve mRNA transfection after lyophilization, 2) promote
an osteogenic phenotype in BMAC and 3) mRNA for osteogenic growth factors will reduce inflammation and
improve bone defect healing. Aim 1 will optimize and characterize how MCMs stabilize mRNA complexes
after lyophilization. Aim 2 will assess the impact of MCM delivery of mRNA for bone morphogenetic protein
-2/-7 heterodimers in a rat model of a critical size bone defect. Aim 3 will investigate the efficacy of R-
Spondin-2 mRNA on a rat model of composite muscle and bone injury. Outcomes will focus on 1) transfection
after simulated accelerated degradation studies, 2/3) gene expression as well as radiographic,
biomechanical and histologic bone healing. The goal of this work is to improve storage and application of
materials guided mRNA therapeutics for bone regeneration. The proposal will combine the biomaterials and
orthopedic expertise of the proposal sponsor, with the vast medical, scientific, graduate training and
translational resources available at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. This pre-doctoral fellowship will
provide for the development of research, clinical, mentorship, innovation, and communication skills
necessary for a career as an independent physician scientist."
10680387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this grant application is to understand how mutations in tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7a (TTC7A)
affect formation of the polarized apical membrane; and how these mutations cause human disease. TTC7A loss
of function mutations result in severe infantile-onset gastrointestinal disease, with phenotypes related to both gut
epithelial and immune cell dysfunction. Previous studies suggest that loss of function in TTC7A results in altered
apico-basolateral polarity and lumen formation in intestinal epithelial cells, although how this occurs remains
unclear. Prevailing models suggest that initial organization of the apical membrane occurs at an initiation site
(AMIS), which is enriched with distinct phosphoinositides compared to the basolateral membrane. The putative
function of TTC7A is to serve as a chaperone and scaffolding protein for the phosphoinositide (PI) kinase –
PI4KIIIα - at the plasma membrane. This kinase is principally responsible for the generation phosphoinositide
PI4-phosphate (PI4P), which is one of the major precursors to the apically enriched PI(4,5P)2 and basolaterally
enriched PI(3,4,5)P3. The role of PIs in specialized compartments is thought to partly direct vesicular cargo to
the correct subcellular compartment – also responsible for proper polarity and lumenogenesis. Given the known
function of TTC7A in coordinating PI4KIIIα localization, we hypothesize that TTC7A mutations perturb PI4KIIIαs
normal functionality in cells, resulting in disordered spatiotemporal production of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, thus
driving improper cellular polarity, lumenogenesis and endosomal trafficking. To test this idea, we investigate the
role of TTC7A in cell polarization, epithelial lumen formation, and endosomal trafficking. We propose studies
using patient-derived enteroids, intestinal epithelial cell (Caco2) monolayers and Caco2 cyst cultures to
determine the contribution of TTC7A to cell polarity and lumenogenesis. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will further
develop novel technology to monitor the formation of the early apical membrane, protein and lipid movement
during apical membrane formation (and lumenogenesis), and how the proper subcellular localization of TTC7A
contributes to these processes. We will carry out high resolution confocal and lightsheet imaging of
phosphoinositide and apical and basolateral proteins localization in the polarization and lumen formation of
Caco2- cysts and enteroids. In Aim 2 of this proposal we further translate our recently established high-
throughput, quantitative endosomal trafficking assays for studies on primary patient derived enteroids. Further,
we develop novel imaging to spatially probe endosomal trafficking in live enteroids. Our studies seek to identify
if the membrane scaffolding function of TTC7A is important for correct spatial orientation of epithelial cells, and
how the loss of TTC7A induces abnormal intestinal lumen formation. The results of these experiments may
plausibly reveal general rules underlying epithelial development and suggest therapeutic approaches for TTC7A
deficiency as well as other more common GI pathologies. Further, successful completion of these aims will
provide extraordinary training towards my goal in becoming an epithelial biologist."

positive CD4+ T cells, are central to intestinal tolerance; they prevent the development of IBD disease and
suppress inflammation during infection. In this application, we seek to understand the mechanisms that
maintain intestinal Tregs during health and inflammation. Regulatory T cells include two developmentally
distinct subsets: thymus-derived (tTreg or natural (nTreg) and peripherally-derived (pTreg) that differentiate
from conventional naïve CD4+ T cells. Human and mouse intestine contain cells of both lineages and both are
necessary to maintain tolerance. Foxp3-deficient IPEX patients, lacking natural Tregs, develop autoimmune
enteritis as infants. Separately, loss of the genomic region that controls peripheral differentiation of pTregs also
leads to intestinal inflammation. Thus, both murine and human studies demonstrate a requirement for both
populations for the maintenance of intestinal tolerance. There are no data defining distinct mechanistic or
anatomic requirements for the two populations.
 Treg localization and phenotypes were examined in mice lacking peripheral TCR-MHCII interactions
and peripheral conversion of Tregs (pTregs). Thymically-generated nTregs entered the small intestine lamina
propria (siLP) to fill the compartment in the absence of MHCII. Imaging of intact tissue shows that Tregs in the
siLP have two distinct anatomic locations: individually localized within the siLP villus or clustered within
organized structures resembling isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs). Our data suggest that a subset of Tregs
preferentially localize to ILFs; this association is altered during infection. Additionally, nTregs and pTregs
occupy an overlapping niche despite having different requirements for costimulatory signals. Thus, we present
the hypotheses that 1. thymic-derived and peripheral Tregs occupy distinct physiologic niches in the
small intestine, and 2 ILFs provide a niche for Tregs that is malleable during inflammation.
2. Research Design: In our first Aim, we will utilize murine models and healthy human tissue to determine if
ILFs are required for the maintenance of siLP Tregs, define the costimulatory signals present in the ILF, and
then ask if the ILF specifically attracts and maintains thymic Tregs in contrast to pTregs. Multiple studies in
mice and men find that both infectious and autoimmune intestinal inflammation is associated with expansion of
ILFs and altered Treg dynamics. Yet, there are no data on how these changes affect the positioning and
maintenance of Tregs and recovery from inflammation. In our second Aim, we will examine murine models of
inflammation and specimens from IBD patients to define how inflammation alters ILF-Treg interactions.
3. Methodology: Mice with altered MHCII expression will be compared with wildtype mice. Small intestine
from healthy Our data suggest thymic Tregs preferentially localize to ILFs.and IBD patients will also be
examined. The immune system will be altered utilizing blocking antibodies, antibiotics, genetic manipulations,
and infections. Methods will include molecular and cellular analyses of cell populations and responses by flow
cytometry, expression profiling, and imaging techniques.
4. Findings: This proposal not been funded.
5. Clinical Relationships: The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease has been increasing amongst
veterans. The current study is directed towards defining pathways that can be manipulated therapeutically to
increase the number of localized regulatory T cells to improve IBD outcomes."
10721339,"Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacteria that is the
cause of the most common healthcare associated infection. C. difficile infections (CDI) are
estimated to cause nearly 450,000 infections and 30,000 deaths within the United States per year.
Since the early 2000s, the epidemic strain identified as restriction endonuclease analysis (REA)
group BI, PCR ribotype (RT) 027 (BI/RT027) has been the most common cause of CDI in the
United States. However, in the past 10 years there has been a drastic change in the molecular
epidemiology of C. difficile as BI/RT027 prevalence has decreased. Furthermore, there is
evidence that healthcare-associated CDI (HA-CDI) is on the decline and community-associated
CDI (CA-CDI) is increasing. One strain identified as REA group Y, which commonly correlates to
RT 014 and 020 [Y(RT014/020)], has been endemic in the United States accounting for >5% of
all CDI since the 1980s. As BI/RT027 associated CDI has decreased over the past 10 years,
Y(RT014/020) related CDI have steadily increased and now account for 10-15% of all CDI. With
the rise in CA-CDI, there is rising evidence that Y(RT014/020) resides within an unknown
community reservoir. Despite a decades long prevalence and increasing concern with CA-CDI, a
detailed molecular analysis of Y(RT014/020) has never been completed. Therefore, our proposal
will be to complete a detailed molecular and clinical analysis in conjunction with a rigorous
genomic analysis of Y(RT014/020) and BI/RT027 to assess the factors which contribute towards
our overarching hypothesis that Y(RT014/020) resides within an unknown community reservoir.
 Support from the career development award (CDA) will provide Dr. Skinner with the
necessary foundation and training to establish himself as a successful VA biomedical and
laboratory clinician-scientist focused on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of C. difficile. The
molecular epidemiology of C. difficile has continually shifted over multiple decades. These shifts
are the results of underlying pathologic factors which influence strain selection. This innovative
project will utilize C. difficile from multiple decades to understand the factors which have allowed
for one strain (REA group Y) to remain endemic for decades. This information could be further
utilized to understand which factors (i.e., antibiotic exposure) place Veterans at risk for developing
a CDI and provide a deeper understanding into the mechanisms by which C. difficile is resistant
to particular antibiotics. Therefore, the completion of this CDA will provide a critical foundation for
Dr. Skinner and results from this project will be used to support Dr. Skinner's VA Merit Review
application to study the mechanism by which C. difficile is resistant to certain cephalosporin
antimicrobials."
11171082,"ADMINISTRATION
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Administration encompasses the Office of Research Affairs, Finance, Public Affairs and Communications,
Development, and the Translational Research Office, all of which work actively and collaboratively to support
the Director and Senior Leadership, the seven Research Programs, seven Shared Resources, the Clinical
Trials Office, and the 12 Disease Aligned Research Teams (DARTs) in carrying out the YCC mission.
The YCC Administration manages more than $88M (direct costs) in cancer-relevant research funding, tracks
over 700 publications from 286 YCC members per year, plays a central role in both the development and
implementation of the strategic plan, supports faculty recruitment, all the internal and external advisory,
operational and leadership committees, the internal grants programs, communications, research program and
center-wide meetings and retreats, and provides financial and administrative oversight to the Clinical Trials
Office, which manages over 200 open clinical trials that recruited 859 patients to interventional treatment trials
in the most recent year. Administration played key roles in the establishment of new research alliances with
both industry and other cancer centers during the funding period and actively works to create new
transdisciplinary collaborations across our research programs.
During this funding period cancer focus for YCC increased as reflected in a 51% increase in cancer-relevant
funding from $58.2M to $88M including an increase from $17.8M to $23.5M in NCI funding (all direct costs).
Cancer-relevant publications increased by 33% to 3653 of which 19% (695) were published in high impact
(IF>10) journals. With more than twice the number of Cell, Science and Nature papers (>180) as compared to
the prior funding period, it is clear that the impact of our members’ science is widely recognized. Both inter-
and intraprogrammatic publications increased across the center, from 9% to 17% and from 15% to 21%,
respectively. Accruals to interventional treatment trials grew by 82% from 471 in FY2012 to 859 in FY2017,
supported by a corresponding 70% increase in Clinical Trials Office staff, much of which is now co-located in
newly renovated office space. Administration’s efforts were key to supporting all of these advances."
11193576,"Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of co-morbidity and mortality in patients living with immunodeficiency and transplantation. A limited antifungal arsenal and emergence of antifungal drug resistance have made the need for novel antifungal therapies paramount. Cellular protein synthesis carried out by the ribosome is a known and well-vetted target for pharmaceutical intervention in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but has not been exploited in antifungal development because of the presumed inability to target the core catalytic function of the ribosome with specificity in fungi. Using the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, we have leveraged two approaches to identify factors that associate with the fungal ribosome under stress conditions encountered in the host. Using a homology based approach, we have identified Cryptococcus-specific homologues of the conserved eukaryotic mRNA cap-binding complex (eIF4F) that we have names alternative eIF4G (AFG1) and alternative eIF4E (AFE1). Deletion of AFG1 results impairs hypoxia adaptation, which is a major pathogenesis-associated pathway in the major human fungal pathogens. Further work on the function of Afg1 and Afe1 as components of a novel eIF4F complex are outlined in Aim 1, and the identification of the mRNA targets they bind is outlined in Aim 3. Our second approach developed a novel proteomic pipeline that we’ve termed RiboPROT to identify the factors associating with translating ribosomes during adaptation to temperature stress and oxidative stress. Aim 2 of this proposal will investigate the role of these proteins in stress-responsive translation and pathogenesis. We have prioritized hits from our initial RiboPROT experiments to investigate further, and propose to identify additional factors under additional conditions relevant to cryptococcal pathogenesis and biology. For those with RNA-binding domains, cognate mRNA targets will be identified in Aim 3, identifying stress responsive translational regulons. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have a comprehensive set of ribosome-associating factors to investigate in future work as antifungal targets. These unique stress-specific and fungi-specific ribosome-associating factors may provide a novel pathway to targeting the fungal ribosome with specificity."
10877813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION)
 More than 2 in 3 adults in the US are overweight or obese [1, 2]. Both conditions, and especially
obesity, contribute to many health conditions including diabetes, heart disease, and cancers [3-5]. National
costs due to obesity are high: $342 billion dollars (2013) in medical costs, which is 28% of all adult healthcare
spending [6]. One form of behavioral intervention for weight loss is telephone-delivered coaching [7-9].
Telephone coaching has clear advantages: high population level reach and individually tailored training from a
coach [10-12]. Telephone coaching for weight loss reaches over 1.2 million US adults per year [7, 12-14].
However, a critical barrier to progress in the field is that standard behavioral therapy (SBT) telephone coaching
interventions have small effect sizes that are rarely evaluated against active treatment controls. Needed now
are telephone coaching programs with the potential to boost weight loss success over and above SBT. We
propose a new behavioral intervention for telephone coaching: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
[15]. Unlike SBT, ACT interventions address the fundamental challenge of weight loss: overeating in response
to internal (e.g., stress) and external (e.g., high calorie foods) cues [16-19]. ACT for weight loss addresses
disinhibition by focusing on (1) increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts
that cue eating and impede physical activity while (2) making healthy diet and physical activity choices guided
by deeply held values [16, 20]. While ACT has been applied to many behaviors and in a variety of delivery
modalities [21-24], for weight loss it has only been tested in RCTs for in-person interventions [23, 25-30]. Dr.
Bricker’s team recently conducted a multi-step design process that yielded an ACT telephone coaching
protocol. We tested the protocol in a pilot RCT (N = 105), comparing it with telephone coaching SBT.
Compared to SBT, ACT participants had greater success on the 10% or more weight loss main outcome, at
both the 3- and 6-month follow-up. Building on these encouraging results, we propose to conduct a fully
powered randomized controlled trial of ACT telephone coaching (n = 199) versus SBT telephone coaching (n =
199), in order to determine if telephone coaching ACT: (1) has significantly higher weight loss at 12 months
post randomization, and (2) has 12-month weight loss on the main outcome (and secondary outcomes)
mediated by these ACT-consistent psychological processes: (a) acceptance of food cravings, (b) acceptance
of discomfort from physical activity, (c) mindful eating, and (d) values guided motivation to change. We will
explore whether the 12-month weight loss main outcome for ACT, versus SBT, differs by these baseline
factors: (a) age, (b) sex, (c) race/ethnicity, (d) BMI, (e) depression, (f) anxiety. If successful, telephone
coaching ACT will offer a more effective, broadly scalable weight loss treatment—thereby making a high public
health impact."
10741754,"During combat, burn injuries to our military personnel often leave our Veterans with severely scarred skin,
painful contractures, with impaired barrier or temperature function. Novel therapies that can prevent or reverse
fibrosis are desperately needed. Outside of fetal wounds, regeneration of native hair follicles, sweat glands, and
adipose tissue, was previously thought impossible. Recent work has shown that, in principle, very large skin
wounds in adult mice can spontaneously regenerate new hair follicles and adipose tissue, while small wounds
or large burn wounds in mice end with the same fate as clinical wounds in humans: fibrotic scarring. We recently
discovered that when our innovative biomaterial, Microporous Annealed Particle (MAP) hydrogel, activates an
immune response, it can induce hair follicle regeneration in small murine wounds that would otherwise heal by
scarring. This proposal combines state-of-the-art molecular, bioinformatic, and bioengineering techniques to: 1)
improve our understanding of why burn wounds in mice result in fibrosis while large excisional wounds result in
regeneration; and 2) use immunomodulatory MAP hydrogel formulations to transform the fibrotic burn wound
microenvironment into one conducive of skin regeneration.
 This application will test our hypothesis that by engineering immunomodulatory MAP hydrogel to specifically
target pro-regenerative immune responses and limit pathways contributing to burn wound fibrosis, we can induce
a highly desirable regenerative response in burn wounds. The first aim will leverage single cell transcriptomics,
a novel bioinformatics methodology to assess cell to cell communication, and loss of function mutants to define
molecular programs responsible for fibrotic wound healing in burn wounds versus regenerative healing in large
excisional wounds at single cell resolution. The second aim will test whether two immunomodulatory MAP
formulations that regenerate hair follicles in small excisional wounds can reprogram immune cell to fibroblast
communication networks in the burn wound microenvironment to activate regeneration. In the third aim, we will
confirm that immune and fibroblast signaling networks in murine fibrosis are active in human burn wounds to
identify novel anti-fibrotic strategies activated in regenerating wounds.
 The proposed studies are significant because they will establish new immune cell-driven mechanism for
diminishing fibrosis and provide opportunities to develop anti-fibrotic and/or proregenerative targets for therapies
for reducing scarring in burn wounds. The proposed studies are innovative because they will establish new
types of immune-modulating biomaterials, and enable a new paradigm of biomaterial-triggered regenerative
response for burn wounds tissues. In the future, the results of this study will drive the development of next-
generation immune-modulating wound biomaterials for potential clinical use."
10721345,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
accounting for about 40% of all newly diagnosed cases in the United States. Despite the relative success of
upfront R-CHOP therapy, the frequent occurrence of relapsed/refractory cases and the limitations to treating
patients with co-morbidities has provided the impetus to discover novel actionable molecular targets to improve
outcomes. Two of these rewired metabolic gene signatures of fatty acid synthase (FASN) & LKB1 (Liver Kinase
B1) and the protein translational machinery components are emerging as putative candidates for therapeutic
intervention in DLBCL. Supported by robust data from several independent laboratories, identification of unique
molecular, metabolic signatures such as perturbation in fatty acid metabolism and depletion of LKB1 signaling
are associated with DLBCL survival and underlying lymphomagenic mechanism(s). However, limited success in
the clinical and pre-clinical arena targeting FASN and LKB1 due to pharmacological limitations has motivated
investigators to identify downstream effectors, providing alternative actionable candidates with applicability in
suppressing heterogenous DLCBL tumor growth. To point, exciting preliminary data from our lab identified eIF4B
(Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B), a critical translational machinery component, is activated by enhanced FASN
activity. It is broadly accepted that unregulated FASN activity is strongly correlated with multi-drug resistance, a
prominent feature observed in patients with R-CHOP resistant disease. Further, we reported that FASN (an
essential enzyme in the altered metabolome of DLBCL) directly regulates PI3K/S6Kinase mediated USP11
(Ubiquitin Specific Protease 11) driven eIF4B activity, which enhances oncogene expression in DLBCL.
Unfortunately, there are no available murine models to delineate their physiological roles in B-cell
development and homeostasis. Another critical question raised from our earlier published work was interrogating
the molecular partners associated with the eIF4B ubiquitination machinery. Preliminary findings revealed
PARK2 as a potential E3 Ligase, polyubiquitinating eIF4B. Further expanding our observation of the rewired
metabolic impact on eIF4B driven translation, we found that LKB1 phosphorylates eIF4B, hindering eIF4B-
sensitive gene expression. To address these findings in-depth, we will pursue the following three specific
aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the molecular role of PARK2 in polyubiquitination of eIF4B and DLBCL
proliferation, Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of LKB1 activity on eIF4B-dependent translation and
Specific Aim 3: Determine the molecular dependence of eIF4B in B-cells. While we have acquired
compelling cell-based data demonstrating the functional importance of eIF4B in DLBCL, we will expand our
mechanistic understanding by characterizing the physiological inputs of eIF4B in B-cells using engineered mouse
models as well as crossing them with other clinically relevant oncogenic drivers (Myc) to assess their contribution
to the development and progression of lymphomas. We have synthesized complementary mouse models (knock-
out and transgenic/overexpression) to establish prima facia in vivo evidence, which will establish the
pathophysiological impact of eIF4B expression in B-cell lymphomagenesis. Further, using molecular, cellular,
and in vivo tools, we aim to validate how our proposed putative E3 ligase, PARK2, and the energetics kinase,
LKB1, impact eIF4B functionality. Interestingly, we noted a significant positive correlation between PARK2 and
LKB1 expression in the DLBCL dataset. We anticipate that the proposed studies will shed light on the functional
and molecular events of eIF4B-dependent and independent roles in the ontogeny and pathophysiology of B-
cells. In addition, molecular studies related to PARK2 and LKB1 will significantly enhance our understanding of
this crucial post-transcriptional/translational mechanism(s) regulating eIF4B-driven lymphomagenesis.
Ultimately, the successful completion of these experiments will lead to the identification and validation of novel
actionable molecular target(s) in DLBCL and related lymphoid malignancies."
10690563,"Although metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity and results in
robust average improvements in weight and medical comorbidities, weight outcomes are markedly variable
after MBS and weight regain with reoccurrence of medical comorbidities is common, suggesting that MBS
alone is often not enough. To date, only one reliable modifiable predictor of post-MBS weight loss has
emerged - “loss-of-control eating” (LOC-eating), the core feature of binge eating. LOC eating, which occurs in
30% of patients following MBS, is associated prospectively with poorer weight-loss and functioning outcomes.
 There exists little guidance as to what treatments should be provided to enhance MBS outcomes in
general or to enhance outcomes among the high-risk subgroup with LOC eating. Emerging research suggests
that behavioral treatments for LOC-eating adapted from obesity and binge-eating disorder (BED) literatures
might have utility. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined effectiveness of any pharmacologic
agents for either LOC-eating or to enhance weight loss following MBS. This study aims to perform a two-stage
RCT to test the effectiveness of treatments for LOC-eating and improving weight outcomes following MBS.
 In Stage 1 RCT, N=160 patients with obesity and LOC-eating following MBS will be randomly assigned
(double-blind) in a balanced factorial (2 X 2) design, to one of four 16-week conditions to test BWL and
pharmacotherapy with naltrexone/bupropion (NB; FDA-approved for weight-loss): BWL+NB, BWL+Placebo,
NB, or Placebo. In Stage 2 RCT, “Responders” to Stage 1 treatments (defined as less than once weekly LOC
eating) will be randomized (double-blind) in equal proportions (stratified blocked randomization with first
treatment as stratifying variable) to NB or placebo for 12 weeks. “Non-responders” to Stage 1 treatments will
be randomized (double-blind) to an alternative (distinct) medication, lisdexamfetamine (LDX; recently FDA-
approved for BED) or to placebo for 12 weeks. Independent comprehensive (blinded) assessments of LOC
eating and obesity and their associated outcomes will occur monthly during treatments and then at 6- and 12-
month follow-ups after completing all treatments (i.e., 19 months after randomization).
 The first stage RCT will provide new findings regarding effectiveness of BWL and of NB weight-loss
medication and whether this specific combination of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments is effective for
patients who have LOC-eating and obesity following MBS. The second stage RCT will provide new and novel
findings from a controlled test, amongst Responders to Stage 1 treatments, whether NB medication results in
superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo. The second stage RCT will also explore, in
double-blind fashion, amongst Non-responders to Stage 1 treatments, whether switching to an alternative
(distinct) LDX medication enhances outcomes."
10626788,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Humans encode and store vast numbers of memories. An inevitable consequence of our impressive memory
capacity is that many of the memories we store are similar to other memories, which can lead to interference
between memories. The hippocampus plays an essential role not only in forming new memories, but in
preventing interference between similar memories. In rodents, patterns of activity in the hippocampus have been
shown to dramatically change—or remap—with subtle changes in the environment. While it has been speculated
that similar remapping may occur in human episodic memory and play a key role in reducing interference, direct
evidence of remapping in human episodic memory remains limited. Our preliminary data demonstrate that as
memories for highly similar experiences are acquired, human hippocampal activity patterns exhibit changes that
exaggerate the representational distance between similar memories and that are temporally-coupled with
behavioral expressions of successful memory disambiguation. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that –
similar to remapping of spatial environments in the rodent hippocampus – the human hippocampus
remaps episodic memories in order to reduce interference between similar memories. To test this
hypothesis, I will gain new training in applying advanced computational approaches (Hidden Markov Models)
that are ideally suited for studying remapping in the hippocampus. These methods have not yet been widely
applied in human neuroimaging research, but they represent a promising approach for understanding how
hippocampal representations change with experience and the relationship of these changes to the resolution of
memory interference. Aim 1 will apply Hidden Markov Models to human fMRI data to detect hippocampal state
changes (remapping) and will test whether the timing of these state changes predicts (a) the timing of behavioral
expressions of learning and (b) changes in the representational structure of competing episodic memories. Aim
2 will test for hippocampal remapping in the context of a spatial learning task in which internal representations
of the environment are experimentally manipulated while holding the objective environment constant. Again,
Hidden Markov Models will be used to detect state changes, but in this case to determine whether remapping is
coupled to experimentally manipulated changes in internal representations. Collectively, the proposed research
will leverage novel, sophisticated computational methods to provide new insight into the neural mechanisms that
resolve episodic memory interference. These findings will also be relevant for understanding memory-related
impairments associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases."
10676747,"Influenza virus infection of neonates can lead to life-threatening disease. The rate of LRTI-associated
hospitalizations is >4 times higher in children less than 1 year of age compared to those between 1 and 4
years and infants younger than 6 months of age are particularly vulnerable to the development of severe
disease. Current influenza vaccines on the market are not approved for infants <6 months of age as a result of
their limited effectiveness in this age group. Overcoming this poor responsiveness will require development of
vaccines with greater immunogenicity in this population. Another important area of investigation is the ability of
infants to respond to universal vaccines designed to provide protection across multiple strains of influenza.
While targeting production of these antibodies by vaccination is highly desirable, our understanding of how
effectively newborns can produce them or the accessory signals that can optimally elicit these antibodies is
unknown. The ultimate goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify a vaccine approach for
influenza that is safe and broadly protective when delivered to neonates. To evaluate potential strategies, we
will use our established African green monkey (AGM) nonhuman primate neonate model. Using this model we
previously found that conjugation of the TLR7/8 agonist R848 to inactivated influenza promotes significant
increases in virus-specific IgG and IFNγ-producing T cell responses, providing rationale for the continued
exploration of this adjuvant in neonates. We will utilize R848 together with heterologous boost or an HA stem
construct as approaches to elicit broadly reactive antibody. As part of our analyses we will evaluate the role of
Tfh responses in modulating broadly reactive antibody quantity and quality. The results of these studies will
provide mechanistic as well as practical information that may lead to the improved design of vaccines that will
be efficacious in the vulnerable neonate population."
11193731,"It is well established that cancer metastases develop from early disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), which can stay dormant but reactivate into overt proliferation. Studies on dormant cancer cells across multiple cancers have revealed the nuclear receptor NR2F1 as a key indicator and determinant for cellular dormancy. Global epigenetic modulators such as 5-aza-C and retinoic acid, or specific agonist C26 increased NR2F1 protein levels and enhanced NR2F1- dependent dormancy programs in pre-clinical in vivo models of breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer, suggesting the clinical potential of NR2F1 to induce DTC dormancy for delay of metastatic onset. In prostate cancer (PCa), NR2F1 was also a dormancy marker and expressed highly in the dormant PCa cells in the bone microenvironment. However, the mechanistic understanding of PCa DTC dormancy in the bone microenvironment remains lacking, which limits the development of therapeutic approaches that directly act on DTCs to stop the lethal bone metastases. Specifically, whether manipulation of NR2F1 protein levels can benefit PCa patients is elusive. 
The NR2F1 expression is decreased in PCa tumors compared to normal prostate and further decreases in metastatic tumors; intriguingly, NR2F1 does NOT have a prognostic effect in PCa patients. Although NR2F1 levels consistently increase in dormant DTC cells in the bone microenvironment, our preliminary data suggested that overexpression and knockout of NR2F1 did not affect PCa cells’ dormancy responses. We hypothesize that NR2F1 is a dispensable downstream effector in the dormancy program; instead, an unexplored upstream transcription regulator (UTR) determines the PCa DTCs dormancy. The objectives of this proposal are to identify the master UTR and NR2F1- independent downstream effectors. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop targeted therapies to manipulate tumor dormancy in PCa patients so that we can either prevent metastasis and relapse or eliminate dormant DTCs. We propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis. 
Specific Aim 1. Determine the upstream transcription regulators (UTRs) of NR2F1 in PCa dormancy. Using an unbiased novel loci-specific proteomic approach and a targeted screen against a pre-determined candidate list from RNA-Seq, we will determine the driver of PCa cell dormancy using NR2F1 as one of the markers. 
Specific Aim 2. Determine the NR2F1-independent dormancy effector in PCa dormancy. Using a targeted screen in PCa cells with NR2F1 KO, against an up-regulated gene list from RNA-Seq of dormant PCa cells, we will identify the indispensable downstream effectors of PCa dormancy. 
The successful identification of dormancy drivers, including the UTRs and downstream effectors, will yield a better understanding of how PCa cells respond to dormancy induction signals from the bone microenvironment and also facilitate the development of targeted therapies to induce or maintain the DTCs as dormant, thus stopping the lethal bone metastases."
10748276,"Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth
leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year.
There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal
behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is
listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet,
prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including
related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support
agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant
impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time
interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of
prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g.,
volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a
sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively
measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold
standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction
of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk
factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive
(e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients
admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi-
level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between
objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the
degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide
plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map
onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced
longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The
candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co-
mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri
(consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient-
oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention."
10892136,"Abstract
The proposed research center for Scalable TELeheaLth Cancer CARe (STELLAR) is grounded in the Institute
of Medicine (IOM) vision that quality cancer care includes not only treatment of the disease, but also promotion
of the patient’s long-term health and quality of life. Cancer risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity,
obesity1) are associated with poor treatment response, treatment-related side effects, heightened recurrence
risk, decreased longevity, diminished quality of life (QOL), and increased treatment cost for many cancers2-8.
These risk behaviors are at least as prevalent in cancer patients as they are in healthy adults, but referral
pathways to treat them are not routinely integrated into cancer care. By integrating cancer risk behavior
assessment into the EHR and automating referral, we plan to make telehealth-enabled treatment of health risk
behaviors (a clinical service called health promotion) accessible to cancer providers and patients throughout
Northwestern’s clinical practice network in a manner that is affordable, improves care quality, and is minimally
disruptive to clinical workflow. The MPIs of this proposal have developed, and are experts at, remotely
assessing patient symptoms and delivering effective, inexpensive, telehealth treatment of cancer’s most
prevalent and potent, behavioral risk factors. physical inactivity9, obesity10, smoking11 Our preliminary data
suggest that telehealth, as compared to in-person cancer care, may make treatment more accessible to older
adults and minorities. With Cancer Moonshot and other funds, we have collectively developed patient-reported
assessment, symptom management, and shared decision-making tools that are integrated into the single EHR
(Epic) system that links the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Corporation’s (NMHC)11-hospital healthcare
delivery system. We also developed a smoking cessation program offered throughout NMHC. In response to
demand from NM’s Cancer Quality Improvement group, we now propose to implement, optimize, evaluate, and
disseminate a more comprehensive, fully integrated, patient-centered, technology-assisted telehealth risk
behavior treatment program that proactively addresses physical inactivity, obesity, and tobacco use for cancer
patients in the NMHC system. We plan a pragmatic trial to test its impact on equitable care access, health
outcomes, care quality, care utilization, provider-patient communication, patient-reported outcomes, and cost.
The STELLAR program will foster patients’ long-term health and quality of life by refining, disseminating, and
sustaining the first cancer-specific telehealth treatment program for multiple risk behaviors to be fully integrated
into quality cancer care."
10740836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for the maintenance and regeneration of the
adult hematopoietic system. These cells are responsive to systemic cues that influence their differentiation, such
as inflammation, in the form of cytokines such as interferons and interleukins. Inflammation is particularly
noteworthy for its influence not only in normal hematopoiesis, but as a driver of clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the
overrepresentation of specific mutant clones in the hematopoietic system. Mutations in Tet2 represent a common
driver of CH, and Tet2 mutant HSPCs expand preferentially in response to inflammatory stimuli. Recently,
acetate has been implicated as an inflammation-associated metabolic signal. Acetate rises systemically during
inflammation but is also elevated as a byproduct of dietary components, particularly fructose. I have found in
preliminary studies that supplementing acetate, either directly or through fructose, along with inflammatory stimuli
broadly exacerbates inflammation in the form of inflammatory serum cytokines and HSPC inflammatory gene
expression. Together, these results suggest a role for acetate as a diet-associated metabolic mediator of
inflammation, relevant to both normal and clonal hematopoiesis. Therefore, the focus of this proposal is to 1)
interrogate the hematopoietic response to changes in systemic acetate levels during inflammation and to 2)
interrogate acetate as a driver of clonal hematopoiesis during inflammation. These aims will be accomplished
through a combination of functional, gene expression, and phenotypic studies of HSPCs in response to acetate
during inflammation."
10809570,"Candidate: Dr. Melissa Beth Jones completed medical school at Drexel University College of
Medicine, psychiatry residency at University of Illinois at Chicago, clinical fellowship in
Behavioral Neurology & Neuropsychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and a research
fellowship in the South Central Mental Illness, Research, Education and Clinical Center
(MIRECC) at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC). She is currently a
faculty psychiatrist in the Mental Health Care Line at MEDVAMC and Assistant Professor of
Psychiatry at BCM. She has published 6 first-authored and 2 co-authored peer-reviewed
manuscripts and 1 first-authored book chapter. Dr. Jones aspires to become an independent
clinician-scientist designing and executing clinical trials of novel interventions for sleep, post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other neuropsychiatric conditions impacting US Veterans.
She eventually aims to use these interventions to modify the risk or emergence of
neurodegenerative disorders. Career Development and Goals: During this award period, Dr.
Jones will obtain the necessary training in clinical trial design and execution, biostatistics, and
research assessments of insomnia and PTSD required for her to achieve research
independence as an interventionalist treating these and other prevalent neuropsychiatric
disturbances. This training is accomplished through meetings with her mentorship team, formal
coursework in statistics and pharmacology, and supplemental instruction in sleep medicine.
Environment: The MEDVAMC and Center for Innovation Quality, Effectiveness and Safety
(IQuEST) provide the ideal research and training environments to complete the proposed
project. MEDVAMC provides mental health care to the largest number of unique Veterans in the
country. IQuEST is the premiere center for health services research in the southwest region.
Research: There is a critical need for effective interventions to address the prevalent and
refractory insomnia associated with PTSD. Several lines of evidence suggest that pimavanserin,
a 5-HT2A inverse agonist, may benefit PTSD-related sleep disturbances. Accordingly, Aim 1 is
to conduct a preliminary randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the efficacy of pimavanserin 34mg
administered at bedtime for 8 weeks for the treatment of insomnia in Veterans with PTSD. 48
adult male and female Veterans with chronic insomnia disorder and PTSD are randomized to
receive either pimavanserin 34mg or placebo at bedtime for 8 weeks; mean change in insomnia
severity is compared between groups pre- and post-treatment. While Aim 1 examines subjective
measures of sleep, Aim 2 characterizes objective measures of sleep with polysomnography and
actigraphy pre- and post-treatment. Aim 3 (exploratory) examines whether pimavanserin 34mg
at bedtime for 8 weeks reduces the severity of stress-related psychopathology in US Veterans
with PTSD and insomnia compared to placebo. This pilot RCT informs on the feasibility and
tolerability of our protocol and pimavanserin’s potential impact on sleep architecture. Ultimately,
this proposal provides the framework for a future grant proposal to perform a larger, adequately
powered RCT designed to detect a meaningful clinical difference in insomnia severity following
treatment with pimavanserin."

10840775,"Project Summary
 The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD)
is the first and only nationally representative and publicly available dataset on late-life cognition and dementia
in India. Our overarching goals are to develop a first rate, longitudinal study of late-life cognition and dementia
in India and to provide rich, high-quality data to the larger research community to advance our understanding
of risk factors of late-life cognitive decline and dementia. Further, we administer the Harmonized Cognitive
Assessment Protocol (HCAP), a common set of cognitive test batteries used by an international network of
researchers, enabling new and innovative comparative studies across both low- and high-income countries.
 In this application, we aim to prepare for and collect Wave 2 of LASI-DAD. We will conduct follow up
interviews at Wave 2 with all Wave 1 respondents and also recruit newly age-eligible respondents. Using Wave
2 data, we aim to estimate the dementia incidence rate at the population level and to investigate its predictors.
We also aim to study cognitive changes and their correlates over the 4-year time period and to estimate the
economic and caregiving burden of dementia. LASI-DAD provides an unprecedented opportunity to study key
modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia and late-life cognitive decline. Rich, harmonized data
on cognitive tests and informant reports, as well as venous blood assays and geriatric clinical assessments,
enable cross-country comparisons of the influence of sociodemographic and biological variables (e.g.
cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory factors) on late-life cognition and dementia.
For Wave 2,
we will further innovate by: (1) expanding our venous blood assays to include total and
phosphorylated tau protein in serum; (2) improving the measurement of personal exposure to PM2.5 using
mobile sensors and identifying the relative contributions of different air pollution emission sources; (3)
improving the hearing test protocol using an Android-based audiometry test; (4) assessing ocular health,
including the use of retinal fundus photography; and (5) assessing caregiving burden. Altogether, the findings
of the proposed investigation will yield new insights on the risk factors for dementia incidence and cognitive
decline, allowing a better understanding of potential targets for dementia prevention in India and other
countries around the world. As with Wave 1, we will prepare public use data and a codebook in a timely
manner and promote data usage through exhibits, training webinars, and a user help desk, actively building a
user base of researchers from across multiple scientific disciplines."
10894900,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is currently based on demonstration of dissemination in space (the
development of lesions in distinct anatomical locations within the central nervous system) and dissemination in
time (development or appearance of new CNS lesions over time). There is no simple laboratory test available
for a diagnosis of MS. Advances in MRI have led to more sensitive diagnostic criteria and facilitated earlier
diagnosis. Despite some improvements in diagnostic sensitivity, many patients continue to have a delay in
diagnosis. Early treatment with DMT prevents relapses and subsequent accumulation of disability — so
diagnostic delay can have severe and life-long consequences. In addition, studies that have informed revisions
and validation of the diagnostic criteria were conducted in individuals presenting with typical syndromes
(clinically isolated syndrome), diminishing specificity and making the criteria uninformative for the ~50% of
patients who are referred for a diagnosis of MS with atypical or non-classical symptoms. The problem of
misdiagnosis is significant as approximately 20% of patients referred to an MS center with a previous diagnosis
of MS have been found to be misdiagnosed. One feature that helps differentiate MS lesions is the presence of
the Central Vein Sign (CVS) on MRI. CVS criteria have been formulated using the presence of CVS in specific
lesions to grade an individual MRI study. The CVS is proposed as a diagnostic biomarker with improved
sensitivity for a diagnosis of MS, while retaining diagnostic specificity — all in an-easy-to use diagnostic test
that can be applied in patients with both typical and atypical disease presentation. A combination of T2-
weighted FLAIR and T2*-weighted segEPI imaging, the methodology we propose for this application, has been
shown to be particularly sensitive for the detection of central veins. The CentrAl Vein Sign in MS (CAVS-MS)
study seeks to answer whether the central vein sign (CVS) can be used as a sensitive and specific diagnostic
marker for a diagnosis of MS. The study will investigate the CVS in a mixed population of participants with
typical and atypical clinical presentations including radiological presentations without neurological symptoms.
The study will enroll 200 patients with typical clinical presentations and 200 participants with atypical
presentations (total 400) who present to an MS center for a diagnostic referral and will follow study participants
for up to 24 months to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the central vein sign for a diagnosis of MS
using McDonald 2017 at 2 years as the gold standard for diagnosis. The overarching goal of this multi-center
proposal is to allow incorporation of the CVS — an easy-to-measure radiological biomarker — into the
diagnostic criteria for MS, thereby facilitating earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Defining CVS criteria and
patterns in typical and atypical MS presentations, as well as determining accuracy and speed of diagnosis, will
inform public health interventions in MS."
10569595,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global health and the economy. Cost-effective, highly
efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed. Camelid VHH antibodies or nanobodies (Nbs) are small, highly
stable, easily bioengineered, and can be rapidly and economically manufactured from microbes. They are
highly robust and are flexible for administration, including possible delivery by nebulization. Together these
unique properties of Nbs make their uses against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 especially
appealing.
We recently developed a disruptive proteomic technology for large-scale identification of multi-epitope, drug-
quality Nbs (Xiang et. al, Cell Systems. 2021). Using this technology, we identified > 8,000 high-affinity Nbs for
the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) including Nbs that target highly neutralizing
epitopes with sub-pM affinities and can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at sub-ng/ml concentrations, which are
unprecedented for antiviral antibody fragments. Structural proteomics revealed multiple distinct epitopes and
potential neutralization mechanisms. Bioengineering of multi-epitope and multivalent constructs improved the
potency to below 0.1 ng/ml (Xiang, et. al, Science. 2020). Most recently, we have demonstrated the high
preclinical efficacy of an ultrapotent and stable trimeric Nb construct (PiN-21) for inhalation treatment of SARS-
CoV-2 infection in a sensitive COVID-19 model (Nambulli, et. al, Science Advances. 2021). Intranasal delivery
of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg substantially reduces viral burdens in both airways. Critically, aerosol delivery of PiN-21
at 0.2 mg/kg decreases lung viral titers by 6-logs, minimizing lung pathology post-infection and preventing viral
pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production cost, this innovative therapy may provide a
convenient and cost-effective option to mitigate the evolving pandemic and future events.
In the revision, we aim to identify and characterize highly potent Nbs that are highly resistant to the variants of
concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2, investigate the neutralization mechanisms by structural approaches, and
develop ultrapotent Nb constructs into safe and effective therapeutics. Our central hypothesis is that Nbs can
be bioengineered into multivalent and ultrapotent forms to resist the mutational escape and the variants of
concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2.
Completion of our proposed studies will lead to cost-effective and convenient COVID-19 therapeutic
candidates for translation into clinical trials. High-resolution structural studies will provide critical insights into
how Nbs uniquely target the virus for high-affinity binding and neutralization. Critically, this project will serve as
the testbed of our multidisciplinary platform to develop potent therapeutic and diagnostic reagents for future
pandemics caused by coronaviruses or other pathogens."
10771009,"Abstract
Obesity remains a major health problem in the United States and causes metabolic complications
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Similar
complications also occur in patients with familial lipodystrophies characterized by partial (familial
partial lipodystrophy, FPLD) or almost complete (congenital generalized lipodystrophy, CGL) lack
of body fat. In the last two decades, several causal genes have been discovered for lipodystrophy
syndromes including AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1 and CAVIN1 for CGL; LMNA, PPARG, ADRA2A,
AKT2, CIDEC, LIPE, MFN2, PCYT1A and PLIN1 for FPLD; LMNA and ZMPSTE24 for
mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD); PSMB8 for autoinflammatory lipodystrophy; PIK3R1 for short
stature, hyperextensibility/hernias, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and teething delay (SHORT)
syndrome; POLD1 for MDP (mandibular hypoplasia, deafness and progeroid features) syndrome;
and FBN1, CAV1, and POL3RA for Weidemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (WRS). Our laboratory
has been at the forefront of these studies and identified AGPAT2, PPARG, ZMPSTE24, and
PSMB8 genes for various types of lipodystrophies. In addition, during the last five years, we have
identified novel lipodystrophy genes, such as ADRA2A, POLR3A, PRRT3, MTX2, TOMM7,
COL3A1 and NOTCH3; and novel variants, such as heterozygous p.R571S and homozygous
p.R545H in LMNA, and heterozygous p.Q142* and p.F160* in CAV1 associated with unique
lipodystrophy syndromes. However, the genetic basis of about 210 extremely rare patients with
various subtypes of genetic lipodystrophies, including 179 pedigrees with FPLD phenotype, remains
unknown. Thus, the first aim of this proposal is to identify novel gene(s)/variants involved in
adipocyte biology, development and differentiation that cause lipodystrophies and to determine their
function in adipocyte biology by using cellular model system. We will use the state-of-the-art whole
genome sequencing combined with tissue transcriptome analysis to identify the molecular defects.
The second aim is to ascertain relationships between molecular defects in lipodystrophy genes with
metabolic derangements using well-phenotyped probands and families. We will conduct deep
phenotyping using skinfold thickness measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for regional
body fat, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for body fat distribution, and biochemical
parameters for metabolic complications. These studies will unravel molecular mechanisms involved
in causation of lipodystrophy, and insulin resistance and its associated morbidities. This new
knowledge may provide targets for developing novel drugs for treating metabolic complications of
obesity including diabetes, dyslipidemias and hepatic steatosis."

 The purpose of this NIH F31-Diversity grant application is to provide support for the PI, Keonte Graves,
for mentored research and career development activities within his Biology PhD graduate training program to
enhance his potential to become a successful research scientist in academic medicine. The goals of the project
are to build upon basic laboratory training that Keonte obtained during his Master’s in Biology research and
acquire new skillsets in performing advanced laboratory techniques (i.e., workflows for RNA-Sequencing and
qPCR, primer design, and cell transfection for gene knock-down/knock-out) as well as learning bioinformatics
and biostatistical approaches to analyze large transcriptomics datasets.
 The primary objective of this research proposal is to identify and validate candidate genes responsible
for metronidazole (MTZ) resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis. The true prevalence of this resistance in the U.S.
is not known as T. vaginalis is not currently a reportable disease, however, several studies suggest it is between
5-10% and may be rising. MTZ is a member of the only class of medications that is FDA-approved to treat
trichomoniasis in the U.S. (i.e., the 5-nitroimidazoles). It was first introduced in the early 1960s to treat T. vaginalis
infections and resistance developed rapidly by 1962. This suggests that the potential for MTZ resistance is
encoded in the genome of T. vaginalis. MTZ uses the metabolic pathways of T. vaginalis for drug activation.
Preliminary data from two experiments using a small number of isolates (n=3 and n=8) have shown that specific
genes involved with MTZ resistance are differentially expressed between MTZ-resistant and sensitive T.
vaginalis isolates. In this proposal, the PI will perform RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analyses on a larger number
of MTZ-resistant and sensitive T. vaginalis isolates to identify candidate MTZ resistance genes (Aim 1a). MTZ-
susceptibility testing and qPCR will be performed in Aim 1b to confirm and extend the RNA-Seq data. Gene
knock-down/knock-out of candidate genes in Aim 2 will subsequently test their roles in MTZ resistance
mechanisms. The long-term goal of this project is to better understand mechanisms of 5-nitroimidazole
resistance in T. vaginalis, leading to development of rapid resistance detection assays and improved treatment
options for patients with resistant infections.
 The PI’s research project mentor, Dr. Christina Muzny, and co-mentor, Dr. Jan Novak, sponsor the
proposed training plan. The training plan will address three main areas of focus: (1) Acquiring knowledge in
advanced laboratory techniques pertinent to T. vaginalis bench research; (2) Developing bioinformatic and
biostatistics skillset to analyze genomic data; and (3) Providing professional development in the form of team
communication, presentation of research results, abstract and manuscript preparation, and skills in grant writing.
The overall goal of this training plan is to provide the PI with a solid foundation to improve the likelihood that he
transitions to becoming an independently funded investigator in the field of sexual health research."
10810770,"Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are characterized by the spread and
aggregation of the protein tau. Recently, we identified a cellular receptor, LRP1 (Low-density lipoprotein
Receptor-related Protein 1), that regulates the tau spread pathway. Knockdown of LRP1 prevents tau spread
in human iPS neurons and the mouse brain, suggesting that the tau-LRP1 interaction could be an important
entry point for disease intervention. Unfortunately, a detailed understanding of the tau-LRP1 molecular complex
is still lacking. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to define the tau-LRP1 structural interface and
discern how post-translation modifications (PTMs) to tau’s structure influence tau uptake and spread. In
preliminary work, we have developed protocols to purify and measure interactions between tau and LRP1. We
have established cellular platforms to model tau propagation and have shown that this process can be influenced
by tau PTMs. To fully develop this work, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will use TR-FRET to establish in
vitro affinities between tau and LRP1 and mass spectrometry to map the protein-protein interface. In Aim 2, we
will look at how tau phosphorylation can influence the tau-LRP1 complex and what effect this has on tau spread
and aggregation. In Aim 3, we will focus on tau PTMs that alter lysine residues. We will assess if ubiquitination
or acetylation can impact the tau-LRP1 interaction, if they influence tau aggregation, and if they promote or inhibit
tau uptake and seeding in cells. The innovative experimental methods and comprehensive analyses outlined
herein will provide important mechanistic insight and develop our understanding of pathogenic tau regulation in
AD. This will be an essential first step forward for the development and evaluation of potential AD therapeutics."
10739817,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Cryptosporidiosis, the diarrheal disease caused by Cryptosporidium parasites, is amongst the most
important causes of life-threatening diarrhea in children globally and causes incurable diarrhea in AIDS patients.
The only approved treatment is just over 50% effective for children and equivalent to a placebo for AIDS patients.
Improved anticryptosporidials are in development, but there is a concern that drug resistance will emerge if they
are not used carefully. Stressing the risk of resistance, drug-resistant mutants with amino acid-coding target
mutations emerged in under a week of drug treatment in a recent dairy calf study. The Cryptosporidium drug
development field is in some ways reminiscent of that for the related malaria parasite in the 1940s when
chloroquine became available and the inevitability of drug resistance and need for strategies to prevent it were
poorly understood. Based on the hard lessons from malaria and antimicrobial resistance in general, combination
therapy is now the standard for treating malaria and many other infectious diseases where the risk of resistance
is high (e.g., AIDS, tuberculosis). This R21 grant is based on the premise that a basic understanding of
anticryptosporidial resistance and its evolution is critical to maximize the benefits of newly developed drugs. The
current goal is to develop the essential methods to study Cryptosporidium drug resistance that are needed to
facilitate drug lead prioritization and, should combination therapy be needed, to identify optimal drug-drug
combinations. The strategy exploits knowledge gleaned from the dairy calf experiment noted above regarding
numbers of parasites and time required to select for Cryptosporidium resistance, and knowledge of resistance-
conferring mutations for two positive control compounds. Aim 1 begins with optimizing a method to select drug-
resistant parasites in immunocompromised mice by directly comparing results with wildtype C. parvum and a
`mutator' C. parvum line, with or without backcrossing resistant strains against wildtype to identify relevant
mutations. The optimized method will then be used to determine the relative genetic barrier to resistance for
three promising anticryptosporidial lead series, and resistance-linked mutations will be studied using CRISPR.
In aim 2, the effect of three known resistance-conferring mutations on parasite growth and in vivo reproductive
fitness will be determined when they are introduced alone or in combinations of two, which will provide methods
to formally measure fitness and identify epistasis between different resistance-conferring mutations. This
application addresses a time-sensitive and critical issue: Along with key data for three promising
anticryptosporidial lead chemical series, these studies will yield the methods needed to incorporate drug-
resistance testing into early stages of anticryptosporidial development and will lay the groundwork for future
development of a computer simulation model to guide animal work and begin selecting the most promising drug
combinations."

Approximately “one in ten U.S. adults suffer from daily urinary incontinence; most of those affected are women”
(NIDDK). Hence 12.6 million American women are afflicted by this distressing and socially stigmatizing
problem, at a cost of $88.2 billion dollars annually. Despite the importance of this condition, cure rates in NIH-
sponsored trials for stress and urge incontinence remain at 50% or lower. Why?
The current conceptual framework on which treatments are based maintains that 1) stress incontinence is
caused by poor urethral support, and 2) urge incontinence is caused by abnormal bladder contractility.
Paradigm-shifting research by our group shows that the urethral sphincter complex, long overlooked as a
causal factor, is responsible for 50% of stress incontinence and also plays a critical role in urge incontinence.
Progress in understanding how the urethral closure mechanism works is currently hindered by two factors: 1)
current testing strategies that are based on outmoded, simplistic, and artifact-prone 1960s technology, and 2)
the lack of a detailed understanding of urethral structure-function relationships needed to guide research.
AIM 1: Develop a state-of-the-art battery of urethral sensorimotor and vascular assessment tools: We will
produce and validate novel measurement strategies using state-of-the-art sensor and advanced imaging
strategies. These tools will include: a) an ultraflexible, microscale, multisite urethral pressure catheter; b) a
physiologic urethral sensory testing apparatus; and c) a miniature wearable uroflowmeter and a daily activity
monitor.
AIM 2: Develop advanced ultrasound imaging equipment and strategies: The structure and function of the
urethra is easily accessed by ultrasound, yet strategies and equipment to evaluate it are limited. In this Aim, we
will develop: B-mode for dynamic anatomy, Doppler for vascular flow quantification, and elastography for
urethral wall mechanical properties to measure real-time urethral kinematics that can be used by AIMS 1 & 3.
AIM 3: Develop a multiscale 3D anatomical atlas and high-fidelity urethral multiphysics computer model for
simulating how changes in individual structures and the effects of age and disease processes affect urethral
function. We will a) produce the first in vitro 3D multiscale probability map and in vivo high-resolution MR scans
of the female urethra. These data, along with emerging data from AIMS 1 & 2, will be used to b) create and
validate the first finite element multiphysics urethral model that can be used by researchers to investigate how
changes in individual urethral structural and functional parameters affect urethral closure pressure.
The technical and conceptual tools provided by this work will stimulate research and launch hypothesis testing
to clarify how the continence margin is determined and how age, diabetes, childbirth, race, genetics, and other
factors affect urethral failure in women. This work will reveal currently unexplored therapeutic targets and bring
science to the urethra's critical, but long overlooked, aspect of continence function."
10677571,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major obstacle to HIV eradication is the presence of infected cells that persist despite suppressive
antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV largely resides outside of the peripheral circulation, and thus, numerous
anatomical and lymphoid compartments that have the capacity to harbor HIV are inaccessible to routine
sampling. Novel, non-invasive, in vivo methods are urgently needed to address this fundamental gap in
knowledge. We recently completed the pre-clinical development, animal testing, and first-in-human PET-
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of 89Zr-VRC01. In a pilot feasibility study of 15 participants, we
observed significantly increased 89Zr-VRC01 uptake in various lymphoid and other tissues in HIV-infected
individuals with detectable viremia and on suppressive ART compared to uninfected controls. Importantly, PET
tracer uptake in inguinal lymph nodes in viremic and ART-suppressed participants who underwent lymph node
sampling significantly and positively correlated with HIV protein expression measured directly in cells. These
exciting data suggest the PET imaging of the HIV reservoir has the potential to advance the field of HIV
curative strategies. Our goals are to determine the anatomical location and temporal dynamics of HIV infection
in viremic and ART-suppressed individuals and validate the tracer uptake with true measures of HIV infection.
We will study location and dynamics before and after ART and during a separately funded, highly monitored
treatment interruption protocol which will begin enrolling during the first year of our proposed study. Throughout
these studies, we will simultaneously measure the reservoir directly (using lymph node and gut samples) and
compare these tissue assessments of the HIV reservoir to the total 89Zr-VRC01 uptake by PET-MR imaging.
We have established close collaborations with the EXPLORER imaging program at UC Davis. This unique
PET technology has the highest sensitivity of any existing human scanner which will likely prove to be critically
important in imaging HIV reservoirs among individuals on long-term ART. We recently completed EXPLORER
imaging in two HIV-infected individuals and show dramatic increases in image resolution and signal/noise
ratios. We hypothesize that PET-MR imaging using 89Zr-VRC01 in conjunction with the EXPLORER platform
will provide a quantifiable, non-invasive measure of tissue-wide reservoirs and will identify anatomical foci of
HIV recrudescence. Our aims are to: (1a) quantify 89Zr-VRC01 PET activity in HIV-infected participants (ART-
suppressed, HIV controller, viremic) and matched uninfected controls, (1b) compare 89Zr-VRC01 uptake before
and after initiation of ART, and (1c) determine the correlation between PET signal and tissue measures of HIV
burden, (2) determine if the ultra-sensitive EXPLORER platform will increase the ability of 89Zr-VRC01 PET
imaging to detect persistent HIV in ART-suppressed individuals, and, (3) determine the anatomical foci of HIV
recrudescence during ATI using the 89Zr-VRC01 PET, PET-MR, and EXPLORER platforms."
10877842,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) is the most upregulated protein in proximal tubular epithelial cells in various
states characterized by epithelial cell dedifferentiation: ischemia, toxic renal injury, and renal cell carcinoma.
We have cloned, generated cells and animals expressing wild-type and mutant KIM-1, and created monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies to, human, mouse, rat, pig, dog, and zebrafish KIM-1. We have reported that the
KIM-1 ectodomain is cleaved into the blood and urine of subjects with acute (AKI) and chronic (CKD) kidney
injury and is a sensitive and specific kidney injury biomarker to detect kidney injury and predict progression of
CKD. KIM-1 has been qualified by the FDA for preclinical and clinical use in kidney safety studies. We have
discovered that KIM-1 transforms kidney epithelial cells into semiprofessional phagocytes making it the
first nonmyeloid phosphatidylserine receptor. We have described a novel phagocytosis pathway that links
autophagy to KIM-1-mediated phagosome maturation and MHC restricted antigen presentation in epithelial
cells. We have shown that KIM-1 expression in early AKI is adaptive, but chronic expression leads to
CKD with severe fibrosis, secondary hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy. A mouse lacking the
extracellular mucin domain, important for phagocytosis, is protected against development of fibrosis. We
have found that KIM-1 mediates uptake of palmitate-bound albumin and recently found an inhibitor of KIM-1-
mediated phagocytosis by screening a small molecule library. The inhibitor reduces cell lipotoxicity and
fibrosis in a novel mouse model of diabetic kidney disease. The current competing renewal application builds
upon and extends our prior findings. Our goal is to further characterize KIM-1-mediated uptake of fatty acid
bound albumin (FA-Albumin), and the implications of this uptake for cellular injury and maladaptive repair,
including cell senescence leading to profibrotic and proinflammatory responses that ultimately lead to
progressive CKD. KIM-1 may be a drug target to prevent and treat CKD. We hypothesize that persistent
KIM-1-mediated endocytosis of FA-Albumin and subsequent signaling leads to toxicity. FA-Albumin
uptake leads to a mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage response (DDR), G2/M arrest, mTOR
signaling, TASCC formation, and a prosecretory fibrotic phenotype. In addition KIM-1-FA-Albumin
uptake leads to chronic tissue inflammation in part due to tertiary
lymphoid tissue development through LTaβ/LTβR signaling. In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize
binding of KIM-1 to FA-Albumin and determine the architecture, structural dynamics and molecular basis for
FA-Albumin binding to KIM-1. In Specific Aim 2 we will characterize the intracellular consequences of KIM-1
mediated FA-Albumin endocytosis, particularly on mitochondrial function, DNA damage, the DDR, cell cycle
arrest and the profibrotic secretome. In Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the role of KIM-1 mediated FA-
Albumin uptake and DDR in LTaβ/LTβR signaling leading to tertiary lymphoid tissue (TLT) formation
with consequent pro-inflammatory consequences in animal models of AKI to CKD transition."
10884277,"Lung cancer is responsible for more deaths in the United States than any other form of cancer. Unfortunately,
many lung cancer patients do not respond to treatments that effectively mobilize cytotoxic T cells against
tumors in other cancers (e.g. anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4). This lack of response in lung cancer is
primarily due to an inability to initiate a robust antitumor immune response. Lung cancer cells secrete the
damage-associated molecular pattern protein, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) which has a dual function
in immunity. Although it can facilitate immune cell infiltration into tumors; its predominant function is to drive the
secretion of negative immune regulators including TGF-b and IL-10 and increase expression of programmed
death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1). My preliminary data suggest that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are
required to prevent HMGB1 secretion from lung cancer cells. Therefore, I hypothesize that lung cancer patients
with lower concentrations of tumor-associated MUFA will have higher expression of HMGB1 resulting in an
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To test this hypothesis, I propose two Specific Aims: 1)
Determine the association between MUFA, extracellular HMGB1, and lung cancer in patients; 2) Evaluate the
effects of MUFA on secretion of HMGB1 and the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in ex vivo tumor
models. I will use lipidomic and immunological assays to determine the association between MUFA and
secreted HMGB1 in lung cancer patients. Using patient tissue explants, I will measure the effects of
pharmacologic inhibition of MUFA on secretion of HMGB1. To study the effects of genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of MUFA on the TME, I will construct vascularized 3-dimensional bioprinted lung tumors constructed
using lung cancer cells and lung fibroblasts. This will allow characterization of immune modulating cytokines
secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts, a dominant cell type within lung tumors. The long-term goal of this
research is to provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumors orchestrate immune suppression, and
enable the development of new strategies to overcome this immunological barrier. This K01 proposal is
designed to build upon my training background and track record in basic molecular and cancer biology, and
expand my skills as a translational researcher. My scientific advisory committee is composed of accomplished
scientists and clinicians with expertise in oncology, lung disease, lipid biochemistry, fibroblast biology and
molecular biology. The program outlined in this K01 proposal will propel me into an independent scientific
career through rigorous career development activities tailored to my specific research goals."
10829373,"Project Summary
Infertility and subfertility are critical health problems affecting about 9 % of couples worldwide. Since the first
successful “Test-Tube” baby in 1978, over 5 million babies were born using Assisted Reproductive Technology
(ART). ART includes such techniques as in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI),
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer techniques. ART is used in humans, and in
animals of economic relevance. In humans alone, IVF and ICSI are used ~ 800,000 times per year. In all
species, the limiting factor for successful pregnancies to occur is obtaining good quality preimplantation
embryos which have a direct influence in implantation and pregnancy rates. Capacitation involves crosstalk
between metabolic and signaling pathways. In the previous period, we showed that a short incubation with the
Ca2+ ionophore A23187[7] can induce in vitro fertilizing capacity in sperm from sterile knock-out (KO) genetic
models. We hypothesized that, at least, in part, A23187's effects were due to changes in metabolism. When
sperm metabolism was changed using starvation and rescue protocols, we observed that intracellular Ca2+ was
elevated. In addition, we found that, similar to A23187, sperm incubated in the absence of nutrients become
immotile. Once nutrients are added back to the incubation media, sperm motility is rescued and those sperm
depict higher percentage of hyperactivation and enhanced in vitro fertilization (IVF) rates. Unexpectedly, eggs
fertilized with sperm incubated in metabolic enhanced conditions were more efficient in producing blastocysts
and those blastocysts generated more implantation sites and produced more pups when transferred to
pseudo-pregnant females. This proposal has basic and applied goals. The basic science objective is to
understand the molecular basis of these methods with particular emphasis on the crosstalk between calcium
and metabolic pathways. At the translational level, our goal is to use novel sperm incubation conditions to
improve ART."

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) conducts interdisciplinary training in STIs and HIV
through the Training Program in Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and HIV, which has recently completed
43 consecutive years of support from the NIH/NIAID. Of the trainees who have completed our training program
since 2005, 45 of 45 (100%) predoctoral and 33 of 38 (87%) postdoctoral trainees are now engaged in
research, further research training, teaching, or public health activities. This record demonstrates the quality of
our trainees, our training faculty, and the rich environment of UNC. In the current grant cycle, we have trained
17 predoctoral and 12 postdoctoral trainees, including five African Americans.
The training program supports six predoctoral and four postdoctoral (MD or PhD) trainees. Predoctoral trainees
are supported by three academic departments (Epidemiology, Health Behavior, and Microbiology &
Immunology); postdoctoral trainees are also supported in the Division of Infectious Diseases. The training
faculty comprises 34 members in these four academic units, with support from an additional ten clinical,
laboratory, and social science resource faculty members. The program has three primary goals: 1) Train pre-
and post-doctoral trainees to conduct outstanding STI/HIV research; 2) Foster the development of the skills
necessary to conduct productive interdisciplinary research; and 3) Facilitate professional growth and
development to ensure academic and research success. The program incorporates a research project with a
primary mentor in one of four core areas: STI/HIV Pathogenesis & Immunology; Clinical Research in STI/HIV;
Epidemiology of STI/HIV; and Behavioral Interventions for STI/HIV. The program focuses on interdisciplinary
activities to maximize the trainees’ potential for impactful research. Oral and written communication is
emphasized. All trainees participate in the STI/HIV Seminar, which incorporates not only critique of trainees’
works in progress, but also professional development. Training is individualized using individual development
plans. The training program includes a comprehensive evaluation plan, with individual review of the trainees
and short- and long-term review of the program, and an External Advisory Board of leading STI/HIV
researchers. In response to program evaluation and increasing competition of the research environment, this
renewal significantly expands professional development training and partnerships with public health to
enhance the retention and success of trainees in STI/HIV research. In addition, the Program will provide new
training opportunities through partnerships with public health entities. This training will help produce
researchers who go on to tackle major problems in the field of STIs and HIV."

10733417,"Two of most common neurological diseases among aging veterans are Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and stroke.
Unfortunately, there are limited clinical treatments for either of these diseases. Clinically, AD and stroke are
most likely to strike the same individuals of the aging population. The comorbidity of these two devastating
diseases in the same patients represents a greater challenge for pre-clinical research and clinical treatments.
Noticeably, AD and stroke share some common pathophysiological mechanisms such as NMDA receptor
(NMDAR) hyperactivation-induced excitotoxicity, inflammation, and neurovascular destructions. These two
neurological disorders, however, have been investigated mainly in separate research fields. The interplay of
AD and stroke have rarely been studied, while both are in urgent needs for effective treatments. Memantine
(MEM) is an FDA approved NMDAR antagonist, recommended as a symptomatic treatment for moderate to
severe AD patients. MEM, like other NMDAR antagonists but with unique safety record in clinical applications,
is highly neuroprotective against ischemic stroke. A significant dilemma is that a NMDAR antagonist has to
be administered before or soon (≤3 hours) after the onset of stroke, which is generally impractical in clinical
settings. In this exploratory high potential project, we propose to test the novel hypothesis that early MEM
treatment at mild and moderate AD stages can have dual efficacy of ameliorating AD progression while
priming (preconditioning) the AD brain for enhanced tolerance against ischemic attack that may occur at any
time to >50% AD patients. In a typical AD model of 5xFAD mouse of 4 months old (mild stage group) and 6
months old (moderate stage group), MEM (10 mg/kg/day) will be given in drinking water for 1 month to mimic
chronic AD treatment. Mice will then be subjected to focal ischemic stroke and the protective effect of the
MEM pre-treatment against stroke will be evaluated 3 and 28 days later in comparison to control groups. In
long-term experiments with continued MEM, the AD pathology progression, neurovascular deterioration, key
molecular signals, inflammatory factors, and psychological/cognitive functions will be monitored up to 2
months after stroke. The therapeutic strategy targeting NMDAR hyperactivity and brain preconditioning is
supported by compelling basic and clinical evidence, while the MEM dual effect therapy for AD and stroke
has not been investigated before. Being an FDA approved drug, the anti-AD and anti-stroke MEM treatment
is expected to have a high translational potential readily leading to consequent clinical trials and a game-
change approach for veterans who are susceptible to AD and stroke. It will support more cross-field
investigations for a better understanding of interactive mechanisms and identifying more therapeutic targets
in the comorbidity of these two neurological diseases."

The goal of this F31 fellowship is to prepare me to become an independent researcher who can effectively
contribute to addressing cancer disparities for Latina women with endometrial cancer (EC). EC is the third
most prevalent cancer among Latina women, representing 8% of all new cancer diagnoses among Latinas in
the United States. Higher than any other racial/ethnic group, Latinas have had a 30.2% increase in EC
incidence between 2010 and 2017. EC is the second most common cancer survivor site among women of all
race/ethnicities. While Latinas with EC have relatively high 5-year survival rates, they also are more likely to be
diagnosed with later stage and more aggressive disease, have lower quality of and barriers to equitable cancer
treatment and follow-up care, and have lower levels of income, education, and health insurance compared to
white women. Further, their interactions with the healthcare system and socio-ecological contexts in which they
live can directly shape opportunities for and barriers to optimal health impacting their survival and survivorship.
Under the guidance of my mentorship team and enhanced by the training from this fellowship, I will conduct an
explanatory sequential mixed methods study to examine how macro/systemic level contexts shape the EC
survival outcomes and survivorship experiences of Latinas. The Specific Aims of this study are to: 1) Examine
the association between treatment facility and endometrial cancer survival and to explore whether
race/ethnicity moderates this association; 2) Investigate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic
status and EC survival and to examine whether race/ethnicity moderates this association; and 3) Qualitatively
explore and characterize Latina EC survivors’ lived experiences and the impact of healthcare system and
socio-ecological contexts on survivorship. To accomplish the proposed research, I will implement a
comprehensive training and mentorship plan that will build upon my prior cancer health disparities knowledge,
research experience, and doctoral training. Specifically, my Training Goals will focus on expanding my
knowledge and skills in: 1) cancer epidemiology for gynecologic cancers and gynecologic oncology treatment
and survivorship practices; 2) cancer disparities across the cancer continuum; 3) intersections of race/ethnicity,
socioeconomic position, and gender with inequities in health, with a focus on Latino and immigrant
communities; 4) mixed-methods research approaches and interpretation; 4a) quantitative methodology
including epidemiologic methods, survival analysis, and multilevel modeling; 4b) qualitative methodology; and
5) grant writing. These goals will be accomplished through a range of coursework, seminars/workshops,
clinical exposure, conferences, journal readings, and tailored mentoring from a committed team of
interdisciplinary researchers. Complemented by support from a dedicated research and training environment at
the University of California, Irvine Program in Public Health, this fellowship will accelerate my trajectory in
becoming an independent researcher focused on reducing cancer disparities in gynecologic cancer."
10804679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Untargeted metabolomics using tandem mass spectrometry (MS) have attained substantial success in the
discovery of biomarkers and advancing our understanding of cellular metabolism. Despite this success, only a
small fraction of measured spectra can currently be annotated (assigned a chemical identity). This bottleneck
can be attributed to the limitations of current annotation tools that have not yet exploited advances in deep
learning and available data modalities (spectra, peaks, molecules, and fragments). The goal of this application
is to advance the interpretation of spectra collected through untargeted metabolomics. We focus on annotating
data collected through liquid or gas chromatology followed by MS, or MS/MS, as these three tandem
technologies have become dominant technologies. Over the next five years, the plan is to harness deep learning
to address three problems: 1) annotation, 2) translation between spectra measured under different instrument
settings, and 3) explainable models for annotation, where explainability arises from connecting peaks to their
respective molecular fragments.
 The Hassoun lab has extensive, relevant deep learning experience to effectively tackle these problems.
The Lab also has experience in dealing with the nuances of metabolomics datasets. The Lab recently developed
a novel deep learning annotation model that achieves 41% and 30% performance improvement over multi-layer
neural networks and graph neural networks, respectively. Additionally, our lab has developed an ontology-
traversal algorithm that yields correct-by-construction molecular substructures that can be assigned to peaks,
thus giving rise to datasets that can be used to train explainable annotation models.
 The Significance of this research is that it addresses fundamental barriers that hinder developing deep
learning annotation models. Our models and datasets will be released on GitHub to benefit biological and
biomedical applications and metabolomics research. Because of their expected high accuracy and explainability,
the models will expedite the interpretation of experiments, improve our understanding of cellular metabolism,
and facilitate data sharing among labs. The innovation lies in maximally learn from data modalities and in
creating models that exploit the learned representations. Further, the annotation and translation problems are
formulated as a bidirectional mapping between domains, in contrast to current annotation models that assume
unimodal mappings. These innovations are necessary to advance metabolomics research and they will open
new research horizons in the field of metabolomics."

This revised application responds to PAR-18-175: “Pilot Clinical Trials for the Spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease
and Age-related Cognitive Decline.” Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a debilitating condition of language
loss affecting many patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently lacks
effective treatments. Recent studies suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of
noninvasive neuromodulation, may show promise as an intervention for PPA. However, these research efforts
are hampered because they do not address important questions about plasticity in the language system, and
because they do not fully utilize knowledge regarding the properties of the language network in PPA to guide
treatment. This proposal aims to further advance investigation into tDCS as a potential intervention in PPA and
to establish which components of the language network in PPA are most capable of tDCS-induced behaviorally
relevant plasticity. Our proposal seeks to determine whether neuromodulation therapies in persons with PPA
should aim to strengthen connections in the most degenerated regions of the language network or bolster
compensatory changes in more intact areas. We will address this knowledge gap by pursuing a randomized,
sham-controlled crossover study of high-density tDCS (HD-tDCS) focused over the anterior regions of the left
hemisphere language network in participants with two PPA variants that are characterized by decreased word
production but which feature different sites of maximal degeneration. This will allow for comparison of
stimulation in a region that is degenerated in some subjects but relatively spared in others. Stimulation will be
paired with a behavioral language therapy aimed at augmenting tDCS effects in the language system. Our first
aim will be to determine how this intervention differentially impacts language performance in subjects with the
two PPA variants. We will then use network graph statistical analyses of neuroimaging data to characterize
language networks. We will focus on hubs as centers of critical connectivity in networks, and we propose that
measuring changes in the ability of regions in the language network to function as hubs (indexed by hub
scores) may be a way to describe how neurodegeneration impacts language network functions in PPA. Thus,
the second aim of the proposal will explore differences in hub scores across the language network at baseline
in our two PPA subtype groups. The third aim of the proposal will extend this approach by examining
behaviorally relevant changes in hub scores induced by tDCS. The final aim of the project will integrate and
extend prior findings by developing a model that employs clinical phenotypes, patterns of brain atrophy, and
hub score data to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from our stimulation approach. Taken
together, this project will advance a potential intervention for a devastating condition associated with
neurodegenerative diseases, elucidate network mechanisms of plasticity in these disorders, and develop a
potentially generalizable, network-informed approach for predicting response to therapeutic neuromodulation."
10815802,"Because germ cells are exclusively capable of passing the genetic materials to the progeny, damages to their
genome – either involving DNA mutations or only affecting epigenetic machineries – impose a unique risk of
initiating heritable disorders. Whereas toxicants that reduce viability of germ cells may diminish fertility, lesions
in the genome of survived germ cells may be persistent beyond generations to harm health of the offspring.
Because the risk of creating hereditary diseases would increase when the genome of embryonic precursors of
germ cells is impaired, and because sensitivities and genotoxic mechanisms of a toxic substance may vary
among different cell types, assessments of such a risk would be best performed using human germline
precursor cells. However, the lack of cell culture models of human germ cell precursors suitable for in vitro
assessments has been a significant obstacle to understanding the realistic risk that chemical exposure initiates
heritable diseases as well as to develop strategies for protecting the genome of human germ cells. The large
and ever-increasing number of synthetic compounds further raises the hurdle of comprehensive understanding
of such exposure-initiated heritable health threats. The Primordial germ cells (PGC) is the most upstream
precursor of all germ cells. The human PGC-like cell (hPGCLC) is a pluripotent stem cell-derived cell culture
model of human PGCs, but technical difficulties with its in vitro expansion has been preventing its practical use
for toxicological assessments. Our laboratory has recently overcome this hurdle by successfully establishing
the Long-Term Culture hPGCLC (LTC-hPGCLC), which perpetually expands in a serum/feeder layer-free cell
culture condition as a highly homogeneous, senescence-free cell population without losing their PGC-like
characteristics. Taking advantage of LTC-hPGCLCs, this project will obtain critical mechanistic insights into
how environmental chemicals affect genetic and epigenetic integrity of human PGCs through creating novel
nucleotide base mutations (Aim 1) or disrupting the epigenetic integrity (Aim 2). A genetically engineered
variant of LTC-hPGCLCs that are resistant to stress-induced cell death will be exposed to toxicants directly or
in the context of organ cultures mimicking the micro-environment of human embryonic testis. Aim 1 will
examine DNA damaging effects of cigarette smoke mutagens, drugs commonly used for cancer
chemotherapy, and nanoparticles whereas Aim 2 will examine epigenetic effects of endocrine disrupting
chemicals and the PFAS chemicals, which are used as stain repellants, polishers, paints, and coatings.
Attempts will also be made to develop high-throughput compatible assays for evaluation of these genotoxic
actions of chemicals in LTC-hPGCLCs. Outcomes of our research will directly inform not only the scientific
research community but also the industry and the governmental programs regulating chemical safety about the
risk of creating familial diseases via exposure to toxic substances. Our study will also inform the translational

environmental hazards. Recently, it has been reported that as low as 2% mutant blood cells can produce a 2-4
fold increase in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
potential (CHIP), even in the absence of other risk factors. The acquired kinase mutation JAK2V617F is one of
the common mutations associated with CHIP. Individuals with JAK2V617F mutant CHIP have 12 times the risk
of CVDs compared to individuals without any CHIP-associated mutation. JAK2V617F also plays a central role
in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which are clonal stem cell disorders characterized
by hematopoietic stem cell expansion and overproduction of mature, often dysfunctional blood cells. Patients
with MPNs suffer from many debilitating complications including both venous and arterial thrombosis, with
cardiovascular events being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Despite the
substantial progress in our understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis, remarkably little is known about the
mechanisms that contribute to the increased thrombosis risk in patients with MPNs. Vascular endothelial cells
(ECs) carrying the JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in many patients with MPNs. Our recent work with a
JAK2V617F-positive murine model of MPN, in which the mutation is expressed in both blood cells and vascular
ECs, showed that the mice developed spontaneous heart failure with a thrombosis and vasculopathy phenotype.
This model contrasts other murine models of CHIP-associated hematopoietic mutations, in which mice develop
CVDs only when challenged with risk factors such as high-fat diet. This difference suggests that mutant ECs can
accelerate cardiovascular dysfunction. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that the JAK2V617F mutation
induces endothelial dysfunction to accelerate CVDs in patients with MPNs and in people with CHIP. In particular,
we propose the following three specific aims: Aim 1) To test the hypothesis that the JAK2V617F mutation
increases endothelial thrombogenic potential by upregulating a major EC adhesion molecule E-selectin, which
in turn leads to increased adhesion of JAK2V617F mutant leukocytes. Aim 2) To test the hypothesis that
JAK2V617F induces premature endothelial senescence, which is a major risk factor for CVDs and vascular
thrombosis. Aim 3) To study how JAK2V617F mutant ECs promote the development of CVD in a murine model
of JAK2V617F-positive CHIP. The roles of thrombopoietin and its receptor MPL in JAK2V617F-induced
cardiovascular dysfunction will be explored. A better understanding of how hematopoietic mutations contribute
to cardiovascular diseases will improve our treatment of two of the most important human health threats, cancer
and heart disease."
10721349,"The overall objective of this study is to determine the therapeutic efficacy of concomitant inhibition of PLK1
and NOTCH against melanoma progression and drug resistance as well as to identify novel signaling
mechanisms associated with drug response using two human-relevant melanoma mouse models.
 The available therapeutic strategies against melanoma have either failed to achieve >25% response in
patients, or the responses are short-lived with developing resistance to therapy. For example, BRAF inhibitors
Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib were found to achieve significant improvement over chemotherapy and were
FDA-approved for melanomas with BRAF-mutations. Even with a combination of Dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor
Trametinib (also FDA approved), the patients develop acquired resistance. More recently advancements in
immunotherapy have improved melanoma treatment outcomes. Despite the success of immune checkpoint
inhibitors durable responses are not seen in all patients due to drug resistance. Therefore, novel mechanism-
based combinatorial approaches are needed for an effective management of this neoplasm. Polo-like kinase 1
(PLK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in cell proliferation. We have previously
reported that PLK1 is significantly overexpressed in melanoma and can be therapeutically targeted. Further,
the NOTCH pathway, an evolutionally conserved pathway, which plays important roles in cell fate
determination, proliferation, differentiation and survival, has been shown to regulate many aspects of
melanomagenesis. NOTCH1 is considered a primary oncogenic factor in melanoma and activation of NOTCH1
and its target genes is linked with metastatic melanoma. Moreover, inhibition of PLK1 or NOTCH has been
shown to modulate markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Interestingly, both
PLK1 and NOTCH are also linked with drug resistance. Our recently published data suggest that PLK1 and
NOTCH expressions have significant positive correlation in melanoma clinical tissues and simultaneous small
molecule inhibition of PLK1 and NOTCH by BI 6727 (specific inhibitors of PLK1) and MK-0752 (γ-secretase
inhibitor), respectively, caused a significant anti-proliferative response in multiple melanoma cell lines,
warranting further pre-clinical testing in in vivo melanoma models. This data together with other published
studies provide a strong scientific premise for our proposed hypothesis that combined inhibition of PLK1 and
NOTCH will be therapeutically superior for the management of melanoma. We will challenge this hypothesis in
two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the in vivo therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of concomitant
inhibition of PLK1 (by BI 6727 or PCM-075) and NOTCH (by MK-0752) on melanoma progression and
metastasis in genetically engineered Braf-Pten melanoma mouse model, which recapitulates human disease
progression from localized to metastatic disease. In Aim 2, we will determine therapeutic efficacy and
mechanism of concomitant inhibition of PLK1 and NOTCH against melanoma drug resistant using patient
derived xenograft (PDX) model, which conserve original tumor characteristics and offer relevant predictive
insights into clinical outcomes, for direct relevance to clinical management of melanoma. Additionally, we will
determine the novel mechanisms associated with treatment response using mutiple techniques such as
Nanostring PanCancer Progression Panel, global proteomics and RNA-seq analyses in tumor samples
followed by validation using RT-qPCR and ProteinSimple analyses. Overall, our study is expected to provide
mechanistic insights and rationale for clinical testing of the combined PLK1-NOTCH inhibition to obtain
superior anti-melanoma response and overcome resistance. Our proposed work is relevant and significant to
the Veterans because melanoma is the fifth most diagnosed malignancy among Veterans, and the fact that the
US military has been engaged, in missions all over the world, many US military personnel, who are deployed to
high ultraviolet (UV) climates in tropical and subtropical zones are potentially at a higher risk for melanoma."

 The EvolvingSTEM laboratory uses a guided research experience to increase student confidence
in their ability to act and think as scientists. Students take part in an authentic bacterial evolution
experiment that can be conducted almost anywhere with minimal equipment. High school students learn
microbiology, genetics, and biotechnology through the organizing principle of evolution, seeing obvious,
heritable changes in bacterial colonies as they adapt to produce biofilm in just a few days. The
experiment is biomedically relevant in simulating evolution during infections because related pathogenic
bacteria adapt during chronic infections by identical mutations. An accompanying bioinformatics module
has been developed that provides students experience in data science when they identify mutations from
whole-genome sequencing data generated from prior student research experiments. Students learn to
work through productive uncertainty, to engage with the material in ways that traditional life science
education cannot, and to build their capacity for critical reasoning. Investigations such as ours allow
students from all backgrounds to form a sense of agency to see themselves as scientists and motivate
their interest in related careers.
 This proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that our program can improve topical learning
and attraction to STEM in a large school district attended predominantly by underrepresented minority
(URM) and economically disadvantaged (DA) students, the urban Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS)
system. Our goals are to (1) improve high school student attitudes towards learning essential life science
topics, such as evolution, microbiology, and genetics, (2) improve understanding of how microbes evolve
and influence our lives, (3) provide practical skill development in laboratory methods and data science,
and (4) motivate their interest in pursuing careers in STEM, partly by helping them to identify as
researchers.
 We seek to assess program impacts on subject learning and STEM attraction in majority
URM/DA classes and will test the influence of near-peer mentors and an extended inquiry module on
these outcomes (Aim 1). We will also measure the persistence of changes in attitudes towards STEM
and students’ own sense of identity as researchers. In addition, we will substantially reinforce the
accessibility of our curriculum to students of diverse learning needs and deepen its relevance to
medicine, public health, and data science (Aim 2). Notably we will build a cloud-based visual workflow to
teach students principles of data science when analyzing genomic data produced by students’
experiments."

Trans women (TW) achieve suboptimal advancement through the HIV Care Continuum,1-7 including poor
HIV healthcare utilization,8,9 retention in HIV medical care,10-12 and rates of viral suppression.3,4,6,7,13,14 These
issues are exacerbated by comorbid conditions, such as substance use disorder (SUD),15-22 which is also
associated with reduced quality-of-life, and increased overdose deaths, utilization of high-cost healthcare
services, engagement in a street economy, and cycles of incarceration.23,24 Drug use among TW has been
demonstrated to be a barrier to HIV care and advancement along the HIV Care Continuum.16 Thus, it is
critical that efforts to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE) include effective interventions to link and retain TW in HIV
care through full viral suppression.25-27 This study builds on the promising findings from our two HRSA-funded
demonstration projects, The Alexis Project28 and Text Me, Girl!,29 which utilized Peer Health Navigation (PHN)
and SMS (i.e., text messaging), respectively, for advancing TW living with HIV to full viral suppression.
Though the effectiveness of both interventions has been established, their comparative-effectiveness,
required resources/costs, cost-effectiveness, and heterogeneous effects on subgroups, including those with
SUD, have not been evaluated. Given the many negative personal- and public-health consequences of
untreated/undertreated HIV, and that HIV services for TW are frequently delivered in resource-limited,
community-based settings,30-33 a comprehensive economic evaluation is critical to inform decisions of
stakeholders, such as providers, insurers, and policymakers. The “intent-to-treat” RCT will randomize
participants (N=225) into: PHN alone (n=75), SMS alone (n=75), or PHN+SMS (n=75). Using the same time
points as the HRSA projects, the repeated-measures design will assess participants at baseline, 3-, 6-, 12-,
and 18-months post-randomization. The specific aims are: 1) Conduct a comparative effectiveness research
trial to determine the relative effectiveness of PHN vs. SMS vs. PHN+SMS in terms of: Primary (a) virologic
suppression; and Secondary outcomes (b) HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale scores; (c) the
AIDS Health Belief Scale scores; (d) the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors scores; and (e) urine
drug screen results; 2) Identify the resources required to prepare for, implement, and sustain each
intervention, and estimate the associated costs; 3) Conduct a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis to
determine the relative value of each intervention from the healthcare-sector, state-policymaker, and societal
perspectives; and, a Secondary Aim to determine heterogeneous intervention effects across interventions
due to social and structural determinants of health and individual-level characteristics. TW are a high-priority
population for reaching EHE25-27 goals and Los Angeles County (the study location) is an EHE priority
County.34,35 Findings have the potential to improve individual and population health outcomes by generating
significant improvements in viral suppression among TW and guiding service provision and public policy."

PA-21-048 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship, NOT-MD-
19-001 (Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Populations):
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound negative impact on population mental
health in the United States, especially for marginalized populations such as sexual minorities (SMs). Emerging
research suggests that this disparity is driven by minority stress processes (e.g., stigma) and structural
vulnerabilities (e.g., institutional oppression) that systematically expose SMs to more pandemic-related stressors
and exacerbate their effects. However, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding the intersectional distribution
and upstream (i.e., social and structural) determinants of COVID-19-related disparities in mental health. To
address these gaps, the current project will draw on minority stress, intersectionality, and ecosocial frameworks
to examine how multiple dimensions of social identity/position and upstream pandemic-related stressors have
jointly impacted population mental health for SMs over the course of the pandemic. Leveraging unprecedented
data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Sub-Study (a population-based longitudinal cohort study embedded within
the Nurses’ Health Study 2 & 3 and the Growing Up Today Study with N>57,000) and novel analytic methods
from social, spatial, and legal epidemiology, the project aims are to: 1) estimate the time-varying prevalence of
mental health symptoms (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and eating disorder symptomology) over the first year of the
COVID-19 pandemic across groups jointly defined by sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity; 2) evaluate
whether the prevalence patterns observed in Aim 1 are related to the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics
of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (e.g., county-level mortality rate); and 3) evaluate whether the prevalence
patterns observed in Aim 1 are related to the broader pandemic policy environment (e.g., lockdowns/stay-at-
home orders, with or without concomitant economic relief efforts). These aims are consistent with the stated
priorities in the NIH FY 2021–25 Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the Health & Well-Being of Sexual &
Gender Minorities, and importantly, are of urgent relevance to public health. Ultimately, the proposed project will
provide a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of SM mental health during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, with the intent of generating knowledge that can inform the development and implementation of much-
needed mental health equity efforts. A tailored mentored training plan accompanies this proposal and outlines
the steps required to advance the Applicant’s career as an independent investigator with expertise in conducting
methodologically-rigorous and theoretically-informed SM mental health disparities research."

10720897,"During autoimmune disease, the body identifies and attacks “self” molecules. Current therapies are not curative
and require life-long compliance. Further, existing therapies – while beneficial, are broadly acting and can leave
patients immunocompromised. These challenges have sparked great interest in controlling autoimmunity with
vaccine-like specificity to preserve normal immune function. Both pre-clinical and clinical studies are testing this
idea in multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that disproportionality impacts Veterans. MS is a neurodegenerative
disease driven by mistaken attack of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, an experimental therapy
idea involves co-administration of myelin peptide and tolerizing cues to promote myelin-specific regulatory T
cells (TREG) that control MS. In some recent trials, small sets of 6-8 myelin epitopes are being tested as a route
to span the range of myelin reactivity in many - though not all - patients. Interestingly, one set of pathways newly-
associated with myelin-driven inflammation are toll-like receptors (TLRs). In healthy people, TLRs detect
pathogen-associated patterns to mobilize innate immunity. However, new work shows TLR signaling - such as
TLR9 - is elevated in MS patients and MS models (e.g., EAE, RR-EAE). In the latter, suppressing TLR9 function
reduces inflammation, while also promoting TREG and improving disease. Lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen are
key tissues that control polarization of myelin-reactive T cells toward either inflammatory T cells (e.g., TH17) or
TREG. Thus, strategies that guide T cell differentiating when myelin is presented in LNs – for example, co-delivery
of regulatory cues – could generate large populations of myelin-specific TREG that stop pathogenic immune cells
without broad suppression. Nanotechnology offers unique capabilities for this goal, including co-delivery of self-
antigen and regulatory cues, targeting, and tunable release. However, many polymer particles and other
biomaterials exhibit intrinsic features that trigger inflammatory signaling, which could exacerbate autoimmunity.
Strategies that mimic attractive features of biomaterials, while eliminating inflammatory “carrier” effects could be
transformative for new therapies for MS. This Renewal VA Merit application uses polyionic immune signals to
advance novel nanostructured capsules built entirely from regulatory immune cues and myelin antigen. These
immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (“iPEMs”) are assembled through electrostatic interactions on a template,
which is removed to leave capsules that juxtapose myelin with a regulatory TLR ligand against TLR9 (GpG).
Since there is no carrier, the density of signals in iPEMs is very high relative to polymer or lipids encapsulating
cargo (e.g., nanoparticles). During the initial award, this high density juxtaposition of self-antigen and regulatory
cue (GpG) was shown to promote differentiation of myelin-specific T cells toward TREG and away from
inflammatory T cells. Likewise, pilot studies with MS patient samples reveal myelin/GpG iPEMs restrain myelin-
driven inflammation. In relapsing-remitting (RR-EAE) and progressive (EAE) models of MS, iPEMs reverse
disease-driven paralysis. With continued VA support, this project will generate the remaining pre-clinical data
needed to motivate future clinical development of a therapy that could offer Veterans and their families a safe
and effective vaccine-like immunotherapy for MS. The broad goal is to define the role of TLR signaling in T cell
polarization and efficacy, and show these effects are durable and robust across disease models and a set of
existing, de-identified male and female Veteran MS patient samples. Our plan is supported by a multidisciplinary
team of bioengineers, immunologists, and MS clinicians with a history of effective collaboration on this and other
projects focused on antigen-specific tolerance. The specific aims are 1) Confirm iPEMs alter TLR signaling &
function in APCs and link changes to T cell polarization, 2) Define iPEM-driven structural and functional changes
associated with tolerance in LNs & spleen, 3) Ascertain the durability of efficacy and changes in CNS pathology
during EAE/RR-EAE, 4) Show iPEMs regulate TLR signaling & antigen-specific response in MS patient samples."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Among various CHDs, defects that result in
altered ventricular morphogenesis have the poorest clinical prognoses. Currently, there is a poor
understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular etiology causative of the many forms of ventricular
CHDs. The central theme of this Program Project Grant is to elucidate mechanisms that regulate growth and
morphogenesis of the ventricle during development.
 Core A provides central administration of the Program Project Grant activities, which serves to enhance
scientific interactions, resource sharing, collaborative interactions, and compliance requirements for all
participants of this Program Project grant. The ultimate goal of Core A is to enhance Project efficiency and
scientific output.
Relevance:
CHDs resulting in ventricle phenotypes have the poorest clinical outcomes. Thus, gaining an understanding of
the etiology and molecular mechanisms that cause CHDs resulting in altered ventricular morphogenesis has
the potential to benefit thousands of pediatric patients annually."
10765655,"On average, 18 Veterans die by suicide each day. In fact, from 2009 to 2018, more than 64,000 Veterans died
by suicide, which is roughly the same number of U.S. military fatalities that resulted from the wars in Vietnam,
Iraq, and Afghanistan combined. While heritability estimates for suicidal thoughts and behaviors range from 30-
55%, the genetic basis of suicide remains largely unknown. Our research team has led and participated in
many of the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of suicidal thoughts and behaviors to date,
including each of the largest conducted in Veteran and military samples. Our most recent work has involved
conducting a GWAS of suicide attempts among more than 400,000 Veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran
Program (MVP). This study identified multiple pan-ethnic and ancestry-specific genome-wide significant loci
associated with risk for attempting suicide among Veterans. Moreover, pathway analyses found evidence of
overrepresentation of many biological pathways with high clinical significance, including oxytocin signaling,
glutamatergic synapse, cortisol synthesis and secretion, dopaminergic synapse, and circadian rhythm. In
parallel, we have been studying a broad array of environmental risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors
in Veterans, such as sexual trauma, PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, borderline personality
disorder, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and sleep disturbance (among others). We are also actively
working to identify novel environmental risk factors, including geospatial factors [e.g., socioeconomic status
(SES), rurality], many of which have not been previously examined in large-scale genetic studies of suicide
risk. We believe that complete understanding of a complex phenotype requires understanding of relevant
genetic risk factors, relevant environmental risk factors, as well as the ways in which these risk factors interact.
Accordingly, during the next phase of our program of research, we propose to conduct the largest gene-by-
environment genome-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of suicidal thoughts and behaviors to date. This work will
enable us to identify new ways to improve the identification of high-risk Veterans, while also greatly increasing
our understanding of the biological basis of suicide. Our long-term goal is to develop effective screening and
intervention strategies to reduce the occurrence of suicide and suicidal behavior among Veterans. The overall
objective of this specific application is to discover novel, replicable GxE interactions that increase Veterans’
risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The rationale for this research is that identification of genetic variants,
environmental factors, and GxE interactions that are reliably associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors
could lead to improved identification of high-risk Veterans and the discovery of additional clinically-meaningful
biological pathways. Such findings could, in turn, lead to new and improved treatment and prevention
approaches. In Aim 1, we will determine the environmental risk factors most strongly associated with the
occurrence of suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and suicide deaths within the MVP cohort. In Aim 2, we will
conduct the largest GEWIS of suicidal thoughts and behaviors to date to identify novel, replicable GxE
interactions predictive of suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and suicide deaths among Veterans. In Aim 3, in
order to evaluate the clinical utility of our findings, we will work with our operational partners to determine if the
addition of our top genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors, and GxE interactions improves the predictive
utility of the Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health-Veterans Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET)
suicide risk algorithm within the MVP cohort. Findings obtained from the proposed work could fundamentally
shift understanding of the biology of suicide, lead to new and improved treatments, and improve VA’s efforts to
identify and intervene with Veterans at risk for suicide. As such, the present application has tremendous
potential to advanced VA’s mission and improve Veterans’ health, safety, and well-being."

This SPORE entitled, Genetics and Genomics of Leiomyosarcoma (LMS): Improved understanding of cancer
biology and new approaches to diagnosis and treatment, represents a collaborative initiative with strong
expertise in sarcoma investigation, epidemiology, and cancer genetics. Our primary goals include advancing
knowledge regarding the impact of somatic and germline mutation of TP53 and other DNA repair genes on the
pathogenesis of leiomyosarcoma as well as translational and clinical research studies to facilitate significant and
tangible improvements in the survival and quality of life of sarcoma patients. Although sarcomas are a diverse
group of malignant tumors, we focus on leiomyosarcoma, a common soft tissue sarcoma, that is more frequent
in women (uterine LMS), Black Americans and older adults. LMS because of its chromosomal instability, has a
clinical behavior similar to other soft tissue sarcomas including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,
dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma and MPNST. LMS is most often aggressive, and treatments are
generally lacking. Sarcomas like leukemias and lymphomas, are mesodermal malignancies and carry biological
significance disproportionate to their clinical prevalence.
The diverse histotypes of sarcoma, and its relative rarity, demand that translational and clinical sarcoma research
be conducted in the context of multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional initiatives. The projects are: (1) Genomic
Vulnerabilities in Leiomyosarcoma; (2) Understanding the role of TP53 in LMS development; and (3)
Applying liquid biopsy technologies to detect clinical response and mechanisms of resistance in the
treatment of LMS. The projects are integrated with high functioning cores and programs for career enhancement
and developmental projects.
This multi-institutional SPORE will investigate contemporary and fundamental issues in sarcoma research, with
its major focus on translational research including the development of new therapies and relevant clinical
biomarkers. Project 1 identified an important new target in DNA repair which is so potent it permits combination
with low dose doxorubicin and introduces this new therapy in advanced drug development studies and a Phase
1/2 trial. Project 3 pursues detection of LMS ultra-rare tumor fragments found in peripheral blood. Quantification
of this ctDNA permits accurate assessment of tumor burden and accelerates exploration of tumor evolution.
Project 2 is a genetic epidemiology study focusing on risk for sporadic LMS as well as secondary to Li-Fraumeni
syndrome. The emphasis will be on TP53 gene, which is somatically mutated in almost (92%) all LMS patients
and other genes affecting DNA repair. Patients with Li-Fraumeni have germline mutation of this gene."
10749906,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Despite extensive studies on relationships between diets and cancer risk, or many “balanced” nutrition therapies
with hope to keep cancer patients healthy and strong for treatment and recovery, little is known about how dietary
substances influence cancer. Our recent work supports a novel concept that acetoacetate, a diet-derived,
circulating ketone body, and chondroitin sulfate, a dietary supplement, function as signaling molecules and
selectively promote BRAF V600E-expressing tumor growth. This lays the foundation for our central question
that is: which circulating diet-derived substances - defined as “blood chemicals”, commonly containing diet-
derived nutrients including inorganics, organic metabolites, lipids, dietary supplements and proteins - potentiate
or attenuate cancer initiation, progression or responses to anti-cancer therapies, and how? We thus constructed
a “blood chemical (BC)” compound library and performed two preliminary screens to identify BCs that influence
responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We identified trans-vaccenic acid (TVA; a.k.a. (11E)-octadec-
11-enoic acid) as an “overlapping” top candidate from both screens, which not only enhances activation of T
cells but also “rescues” PD-L1/PD-1-dependent exhaustion of T cells. TVA is the predominant form of trans-
fatty acids enriched in human milk, while cis-vaccenic acid (CVA), a stereoisomer of TVA, is found in Sea
Buckthorn oil. TVA is also commonly found in dairy products including milk and butter. TVA is relatively stable,
and naturally only ~19% or 12% of dietary TVA is converted to rumenic acid in human or mice, respectively.
Using diverse immunogenic and immunodeficient mouse models, we found that TVA, but not CVA, enhances
anti-tumor immunity via CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, TVA exhibits extracellular signaling function and
enhances CD8+ T cell activation through a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB) pathway. Moreover, we identified immunosuppressive GPR43, a short chain fatty acid
(SCFA)-binding GPCR, as a target of TVA. Taken together, we hypothesize that dietary TVA functions as a
signaling molecule to potentiate activation of CD8+ T cells by attenuating GPR43, leading to enhanced anti-tumor
immunity. Thus, TVA’s effects on T cells are independent of the PD-L1/PD1 axis, providing a perfect rationale to
evaluate potentially synergistic efficacy of TVA in combination with immune checkpoint therapy for an improved
immunotherapy. Three specific aims include: (1) To test the hypothesis that dietary TVA enhances CD8+ T cell
activity and consequent anti-tumor immunity as a single agent, and has synergistic effects in combination with
ICIs; (2) To test the hypothesis that dietary TVA exhibits extracellular signaling function through a GPCR-CREB
axis for CD8+ T cell activation, and explore the underlying signaling and epigenetic mechanisms by temporal,
integrated mechanistic studies; and (3) To test the hypothesis that TVA attenuates GPR43 by competing with its
SCFA agonists, and perform structure-activity research (SAR) to design TVA-derivatives with improved efficacy
to target GPR43 and consequently activate CD8+ T cells."

Metabolism of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) to acetaldehyde within different brain regions and in different subcellular
compartments, and how that metabolism changes with chronic ethanol use, is not well-understood. The long-
term goal is to identify adaptive changes that occur in chronic ethanol abuse and to identify therapeutic
strategies to prevent or reverse neurological damage from ethanol. The objective of this proposal is to
determine subcellular regulation of ethanol metabolism in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by
CYP2E1 during acute and chronic ethanol use, and to determine the consequences of the differential targeting.
The central hypothesis is that targeting of CYP2E1 to mitochondria will be increased during chronic alcohol use
in some regions of the brain that are sensitive to ethanol-induced damage, and that high mitochondrial
targeting will drive high mitochondrial acetaldehyde production and resulting mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative stress. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that CYP2E1 expression overall is increased in
brain regions that are sensitive to ethanol, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and
these regions also develop mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress during ethanol use. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate subcellular specificity of induction of
CYP2E1 by acute and chronic ethanol in the brain; 2) Determine the role of mitochondria- and ER-targeted
CYP2E1 in mitochondrial effects of chronic ethanol use; and 3) Measure contribution of mitochondria- and ER-
localized CYP2E1 to ethanol-induced oxidative stress. We will pursue these aims using an innovative strategy
of three complementary systems: mice, C. elegans, and cultured cells. In each system we have a null
background lacking CYP2E1, a wild-type CYP2E1 gene targeted to both mitochondria and ER, an ER-targeted
CYP2E1, and a mitochondrial-targeted CYP2E1. The proposed research is significant because it will elucidate
how ethanol metabolism by CYP2E1 changes over a chronic ethanol use paradigm, and could reveal
mitochondrial CYP2E1 as a liability for ethanol toxicity. It is also significant because it generates useful
platforms for studying subcellular localization-dependent effects of CYP2E1. The work will develop
foundational resources that will be used by other researchers. The proximate expected outcome of this work is
an understanding of how CYP2E1 contributes to the effects of ethanol in the brain during chronic and acute
binge drinking. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because they will establish
better understanding of the relationship between ethanol metabolism in brain regions with toxicity, and in the
long-term because they lay the groundwork for identifying therapeutic opportunities."

In the past few decades, the fields of microbiology and immunology have undergone a renaissance, driven in
part by technological advances establishing that the human microbiome can play a role in a number of
fundamental aspects of human health and disease, in many instances through the interface with host innate
immunity. The immune system functions to restrict the potential for damage caused by the microbiota while
simultaneously minimizing destructive inflammatory responses. Disruption of the intensity, duration or physical
location of inflammation, however, can contribute to disease. Advances in our understanding of the microbiome,
and its regulation by environmental factors, along with a realization that inflammatory processes are at the core
of a number of common diseases, necessitates a cross-disciplinary perspective that accommodates the host-
microbe interaction in toto. The major goal of this Phase 2 Cobre is to continue to develop and expand our
thematic multidisciplinary research center for the study of the interface between the microbiome, inflammation
and pathogenicity within a framework to develop the careers of junior investigators. We have assembled a team
of junior investigators with complementary expertise and outstanding potential, and have partnered these project
leaders with well-qualified and dedicated mentors. An integrated set of projects will make novel connections
between inflammatory processes and bacterial pathogenicity, and establish the basis for the development of
novel therapeutics and delivery methods. We will create a multidisciplinary program in research, training,
mentoring and career development that will facilitate and accelerate the transition of junior faculty to independent
extramural funded status. Research will be support by a Functional Microbiomics Core that will provide germ
free animal facilities, anaerobic culture capability, microbiome sequencing and bioinformatics, assay of
inflammatory markers, along with whole animal imaging and intravital microscopy. An Administrative Core will
co-ordinate activities and provide additional biostatistical support, along with a Pilot Project program to ensure a

The overarching goal of the Clinical significance of INciDEntal white matter lEsions on MRI in a Diverse
population with cognitive complaints (INDEED) is to identify anatomic and biologic modulators of progressive
white matter (WM) injury that drive cognitive impairment using a precision medicine approach in a large and
diverse clinical population. To achieve this goal, three essential biological datasets will be acquired: 1)
harmonized neuroimaging data to document the degree, location, and amount of WM injury; 2) fluid biomarker
data to evaluate risk modifiers including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and co-morbid
neurodegenerative conditions; and 3) genetic data to measure intrinsic genetic susceptibility using polygenic
risk scores for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and WM hyperintensities (WMH) and known sequence variants (e.g.
APOE4 and NOTCH3). The goal of the Repository Core (RC), therefore, is to use harmonized approaches to
collect, process, store, track, analyze, and share neuroimaging, biospecimens and associated genetic data.
Centralized core services are needed to effectively support the research mission and enable the scientific
synergy necessary for a project of this scale, in which samples and data will be obtained from 2,250 diverse
subjects nationwide at three time points, for a total of up to 6,750 data/sample sets. Collecting data/samples
from multiple sites over 5 years will require standardized quality control (QC) checks, data tracking, and
coordination with research staff at participating clinic sites. The RC, with its leadership and investigators
experienced in managing similar tasks in the NINDS MarkVCID Consortium and ADRC Cores, will provide the
technical, professional, and physical infrastructure to effectively implement the core mission by executing four
specific aims. In Aim 1, the RC will work with NINDS, the Administrative Core (AC), and the collaborating clinic
sites to develop and implement standardized operating procedures for blood collection, processing, sub-
aliquoting, freezing, shipping, long-term storage, and distribution, by leveraging the existing AD Centers
Program, MarkVCID Consortium, and DISCOVERY Network protocols. In Aim 2, we will generate, store,
analyze, and distribute blood biomarker and genetic data relevant to WM injury and co-morbid
neurodegenerative pathologies. In Aim 3, we will oversee acquisition, analysis, QC, and distribution of
harmonized neuroimaging data that will directly inform the rate of progression and anatomic features of WM
injury to their role in cognitive impairment. In Aim 4, we will work with the AC and the Statistical Core to export
data and sample information, thus contributing to the sharing of data and specimens broadly with the research
community. The RC will ensure consistent integrity of data and samples that will deliver a high level of scientific
rigor and the reproducibility of results. The deposited data and biospecimens will create a rich and high-quality
resource for future analyses, novel biomarker discovery, and identification of therapeutically significant
pathways that underlie the contribution of WM injury to cognitive decline and dementia."
10929354,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Recruitment and Retention Core
The Recruitment and Retention Core (RRC) has three goals: First, to recruit and engaged an enthusiastic
participant pool of 2,250 Black, Hispanic and White participants with incidental white matter hyperintensities
(WMH) and cognitive complaints. Second, to assess the degree of cognitive impairment of the participants at
baseline and over time to characterize the development and etiology of the cognitive impairments. Third,
retain these individuals throughout the project period to enhance the power of this repeated measures design.
UC Davis is a national leader for minority recruitment and retention due to its commitment to the principles of
community-based participatory research (CBPR). Over its 28 year history, the UC Davis ADRC has developed
robust outreach and recruitment processes that reliably identifies, efficiently screens, and clearly consents a
highly diverse cohort of participants. The RRC will implement UCD ADRC's successful CBPR toolbox and
create a catalog of e-tools to facilitate precision engagement and significantly enhance site recruitment
efforts using novel digital media outreach tools. These e-tools also will promote efficient use of core
resources by maximizing community engagement by tailoring messaging to the interests of specific
subpopulations identified in market analysis conducted by experienced UCD staff and faculty. The RRC will
phase-in study resources over 3 epochs. The first epoch (months 1-9) will focus on disseminating existing UCD
ADRC core resources broadly and taking feedback from participating centers to enhance/tailor these resources
for each site. Second (months 1-12), while the existing programs are harmonizing, new digital media will be
created. Because this study tracks the cognitive trajectories of older adults moving from health into cognitive
impairment we will focus our immediate effort on creating resources to attract these participants. Third (months
13-24), after we have created the media supports for participants at study entry, we will then focus on curating
new digital materials to support our participants through cognitive aging and into early dementia to support
retention. The proposed development and dissemination of an e-toolbox with expert support and guidance
from the RRC will be the first time that digital media will be used in the outreach and engagement with
communities of color with messaging that is tailored to the interests of specific subpopulations identified in
market analysis. The major impact of this core will be the creation of a sophisticated set of technical
resources that participating sites can implement to enhance their recruitment, assessment and retention of
URGs. As a mature ADC with deep knowledge and experience for recruiting, assessing and retaining URGs,
we are well-situated to lead this multisite cooperative network. Our emphasis will be on supporting the sites to
apply culturally appropriate recruiting, consenting and assessment which will create a welcoming study
environment to enhance retention of Blacks and Hispanics who we have long failed to include."
10927234,"OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have indicated a clear commitment to diversifying the national
biomedical workforce. Yet, the recruitment, advancement, and retention of historically disadvantaged and
underrepresented minority (URM) faculty remains a significant problem within academia. The NIH Faculty
Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) initiative aims to transform institutional culture
by developing communities of biomedical researchers and supporting institutions that are committed to
increasing diversity and inclusive excellence. The University of New Mexico (UNM) is a Hispanic Serving
Institution, and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity institution. Thus, recruitment and retention of a diverse
biomedical faculty workforce at UNM will align with the NIH mission and will promote inclusive excellence in a
majority-minority state where diverse faculty representation will offer role models for female and URM trainees.
Research suggests that systemic transformation of institutional culture requires the recruitment and retention of
diverse faculty through evidence-based practices, as well as the education of all faculty and adminstrators in
diversity, equity, and inclusion. The proposed UNM FIRST program will hire nine early career faculty across six
departments in the UNM College of Arts and Sciences. The cohort will consist of two interdisciplinary clusters:
neuroscience and data science. The central hypothesis is that this faculty cohort model will successfully hire
and retain a diverse cohort of early career faculty and the changes implemented as part of the UNM FIRST
program will support the enhancement of inclusive excellence practices across UNM. The long-term goal of the
UNM FIRST program is to increase the diversity of the biomedical faculty workforce at NIH while building on
recent progress toward inclusive excellence in our institutional culture. Our specific aims are: To recruit,
promote, and retain a diverse cohort of biomedical faculty (AIM 1); and to systemically transform UNM
institutional culture towards inclusive excellence (AIM 2). The UNM FIRST Leadership Team includes five
female leaders at UNM with significant experience in NIH-funded research, faculty development, faculty hiring
and promotion, and institutional policymaking. The UNM Leadership, including a new Institutional Innovation
Implementation Board (I3 Board; the Senior Vice Provost, Vice President for Research, Associate Provost for
Faculty Success, College of Arts & Sciences Dean, and the ADVANCE Director) that will be created to support
the UNM FIRST program, will be poised to work closely with the UNM FIRST Leadership Team in its
commitment to enhance diversity and inclusive excellence at UNM. The significance of the proposed UNM
FIRST program is that a diverse cohort of NIH-funded biomedical faculty devoted to inclusive excellence will
achieve success as faculty in the UNM College of Arts and Sciences, that UNM will become an institution
where inclusive excellence is permanently established, and that UNM faculty, including UNM FIRST faculty,
will train the next generation of diverse NIH-funded scientists."
10888287,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overarching goal of the Integrative Omics Center for Accelerating Neurobiological Understanding of
Opioid Addiction (ICAN) is to identify biologically actionable drivers of opioid addiction (OA). We will (1)
conduct large-scale integrated multi-omics studies of OA in humans, (2) integrate rodent–human studies to
identify genes and gene networks implicated in OA, and (3) build a publicly available national omics resource
for studying OA. Our cohering principle is that by integrating multiple omics across human and animal model
data we will discover robust drivers of individual variation that predispose opioid users to addiction.
 The omics revolution has delivered many discoveries of such individual variation for complex diseases,
including for nicotine and alcohol phenotypes, but not for OA. We see five fundamental challenges to rapid
progress: (1) limited sample sizes and unaccounted-for phenotypic heterogeneity in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of OA; (2) very limited human brain studies of gene dysregulation by OA; (3)
poor translation between human and animal model studies; (4) lack of concurrent integration of multiple
omics; and (5) limited practical access to, and poor harmonization of, OA omics data.
To overcome these challenges, ICAN harnesses four Projects and two Cores:
 Project 1: Electronic Health Record Phenotyping and Genomics of Opioid Addiction
 Project 2: Gene Regulation in the Opioid Dependent Human Brain
 Project 3: Multi-species Approach to Opioid Addiction
 Project 4: Multi-omics Gene Network Identification
 Cores: Administrative Core and Synergy Core
 Across these Projects and Cores, we will (1) conduct the largest GWAS to date (N>100,000 cases)
leveraging Genomic Structural Equation Modeling; (2) examine differential gene regulation across key brain
regions (prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala) in the largest collection of OA informative
postmortem brains to date (N=641); (3) integrate rodent and human studies using GeneWeaver.org,
polygenic transcriptome risk scores, and variant functionalizing experiments; and (4) apply explainable
artificial intelligence, gene network mapping, and multiple lines-of-evidence integration for gene network
discovery. Each Project is rigorously designed to make novel contributions. However, by integrating the
diversity of ICAN’s science through the cross-fertilization and coordinating efforts of the Cores, we will
leverage the agnostic discovery power of omics and place it within the context of functional neurobiology to
make field-changing breakthroughs and identify actionable targets for development of OA treatments."

 In July of 2017, we launched Phase I of the COBRE Center for Translational Pediatric Research at Arkansas
Children’s Research Institute in Little Rock, Arkansas. The mission of the center is to use proteogenomic
approaches to identify epigenomic mechanisms and therapeutic targets in diseases, including cancer, impacting
or translatable to the pediatric population. The unifying theme of research among center members is utilizing
systems biology approaches and sophisticated bioinformatics for studying disease mechanism. The goal of
Phase I was to establish the foundation of the center, expand the pool of successful investigators with a Faculty
Development Plan, and support systems-level core resources. Towards this goal, the center was created with a
nucleus of 4 Research Project Leaders and 2 research cores, Proteomics Core and Genomics & Bioinformatics
Core. Through use of a mentored Faculty Development Program overseen by the Administrative Core, the junior
investigators from Phase I received 9 RPG-level grants, including an U01-award. Additionally, we were able to
“graduate” both Phase I research cores to self-sustainability. Collectively, during the past 4 years of Phase I, we
have made substantial progress towards establishing a multi-disciplinary, thematic research center through
expansion of our center members, transitioning core resources to independence, and extramural funding –
demonstrating how the center is moving in the direction of long-term sustainability beyond COBRE support.
 Building on the momentum of Phase I, our goals in Phase II are to further enhance our institutional research
infrastructure by developing our multi-disciplinary, thematic research center through strategic expansion of the
critical mass of investigators, investing into research infrastructure, and implementing a plan for long-term center
sustainability beyond COBRE support. We will provide structured mentoring and support to an initial group of 5
Research Project Leaders in Phase II. Furthermore, we will expand the pool of investigators in the center through
institutional commitments to recruit 4 Assistant and 1 Associate or Full Professor to the center. To support needs
of the expanding critical mass of investigators, we will develop a new Proteogenomics Core that is essential for
the evolving research mission of the center. This unique core will provide Research Project Leaders and other
center members access to experienced personnel for non-standard proteomic, genomic, and epigenomic
applications, and access to highly skilled bioinformaticians for cutting-edge data analysis and integration. To
support the expansion of investigators and a new research core, the Administrative Core will provide a Faculty
Development Plan, Pilot Project Program, operational oversight, and leadership as the center prepares to
transition to long-term sustainability. Upon completion of Phase II, we anticipate having a critical mass of junior,
mid-career, and senior investigators in the center who have access to world-class systems biology cores, which
will enable center members to successfully compete for individual, multi-investigator, and program-level grants
to support transition of the center to long-term sustainability beyond COBRE support."

Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that insomnia contributes to emotionally distressing
depressive mood symptoms through disruption of brain networks that regulate emotional functions. Of
particular concern, insomnia is associated with an increased risk for suicide, even when accounting for the
presence of other depressive symptoms. However, we do not yet know to what degree that the emotion
regulation brain network is modified by the restoration of sleep, or whether the degree to which a sleep
intervention engages these neural targets mediates reductions in depressive symptoms and suicidality.
Objective: This proposal investigates the impact of a proven sleep intervention on engagement of the emotion
regulation brain network as a putative mechanistic target. DESIGN/METHODS: In the R61 phase, a
mechanistic trial will demonstrate feasibility and establish whether the emotion regulation brain network is
modified (the target is engaged) when patients show improvements in insomnia symptoms following a proven
psychosocial sleep intervention. Participants will be 70 adults experiencing elevated depressive symptoms and
clinically meaningful insomnia. Depressive symptoms and insomnia will be assessed prior to, and weekly while
receiving six Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) sessions across a period of eight weeks. CBT-I
improves sleep patterns through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control, mindfulness training,
cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep hygiene education. Emotion regulation
network neural targets will be assayed prior to and following completion of CBT-I treatment. If the Go milestone
criteria are met, the R33 phase (years 3-5) will include a 2-arm randomized controlled trial. We will enroll new
participants (n=150) and randomize them in a 1:1 ratio to the CBT-I or to the credible control treatment for
insomnia group. Participants will complete a refined measurement protocol based on the R61 phase study.
Specific aims: R61 aims are to demonstrate (1) feasibility and (2) that CBT-I modifies emotion regulation
network function according to pre-specified Go milestone criteria. R33 aims are to (1) confirm target
engagement by testing the hypothesis that compared with an active control condition, CBT-I participants will
show significant change in the emotion regulation network targets that met the Go Criteria of Study 1 in the
direction of normalization, at the end of treatment, (2) examine the relationships of target engagement to
treatment outcomes by study group, and (3) test whether emotion regulation network measures at baseline
predict depressive symptom and suicidality reduction. IMPACT: Characterizing these associations may offer
the potential to gain a deeper understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression in the
presence of insomnia. Our results will advance an evidence-based mechanistic approach to treating, and
ultimately preventing, the emotionally distressing and potentially life-threatening impact of insomnia."

 Presbycusis or age-related hearing loss (ARHL) represents the most prevalent sensory deficit. It begets social
isolation and depression. We hypothesize that aging auditory neurons undergo cellular, and structural changes,
resulting in demyelination and selective neuronal subtypes loss. The ensuing plasticity produces profound neural
network re-wiring and aberrant functional plasticity along the auditory pathway. These predicted changes'
progressive nature requires systematic analyses of the ARHL mechanism at different auditory pathway hubs,
which can only be achieved through a joint collaborative effort. Motivated by this public health challenge, we
have designed a collaborative multiscale study that addresses the aging auditory system's successive
mechanisms. The clinical and translational outcomes of our findings promise to be vast. The overarching
hypotheses are tested in three Projects, using resources and tools from four Cores.
 The investigative team consists of experts from genetic to physiology and imaging and analytical chemistry.
Three projects (P1-3) are served by four Cores (A-D). Core A is for administrative oversight and organization of
the Cores and Projects. The team includes Drs. Yamoah (Project 1), Xie (Project 2), Maria-Rubio/Williamson
(Project 3), Yamoah (Core A), Yamoah/Lee (Core B), Fritzsch/Perkins (Core C), and Zhu (Core D). Together,
they will determine the mechanisms of ARHL of sensory and neural etiology. The team has worked together
synergistically and productively. The projects focus on critical centers of the auditory pathways recognized for
the coding and processing of sound information. They include the primary auditory neurons (AN; P1), cochlear
nuclei (CN; P2-3), superior olivary complex (SOC; P2-3), and auditory cortex (ACtx, P3). We use genetic,
optogenetics, and pharmacogenetic mouse models (Core B). We employ structural analyses (Core C) and
differential proteomic analyses of young-and aged-auditory neurons to uncover biomarkers (Core D).
 Integration of the program ensures outcomes that are overwhelmingly greater than the sum of the individual
components. Identification of ARHL biomarkers is likely to pave the way for effective treatment strategies."
10689792,"Background: Over 1 million Veterans have PTSD and most (80% or more) do not receive first-line treatments,
evidence-based psychotherapies, despite significant VA investment to increase access to these treatments.
Clinicians often struggle to engage Veterans in evidence-based psychotherapies because they can be
emotionally challenging treatments. Engagement could be catalyzed by mental health providers integrated into
primary care (i.e., VA’s Primary Care-Mental Health Integration, or PC-MHI) to maximize the reach of
engagement efforts beyond specialty PTSD settings. Shared decision making, a process by which the patient
and provider discuss treatment options, weigh benefits and risks, and select a treatment that meets the
patient’s needs, addresses known patient and provider barriers to evidence-based psychotherapies, including
knowledge, self-efficacy, and trust. However, no study has examined shared decision making for PTSD in
primary care. The proposal will address this knowledge gap by developing and refining a shared decision
making intervention for PTSD, Patient Readiness for Improvement through Motivation, Engagement, and
Decision-making (PRIMED), using input from Veterans with diverse perspectives, PC-MHI providers, and VA
operational partners to optimize integration of shared decision making into clinical care. We will collect
acceptability and feasibility data to support an application for a future effectiveness-implementation trial.
Significance/Impact: Dr. Chen’s proposed research addresses three HSR&D and VA priorities: 1) increase
engagement and retention of Veterans in evidence-based PTSD treatments, 2) advance health services
research methods, specifically implementation science and user-centered design, which focuses on thorough
integration of Veteran and frontline provider input, and 3) support suicide prevention efforts through effective
treatment of PTSD, a major risk factor for suicide.
Innovation: The proposed project will promote significant change in current VA clinical practice. PC-MHI
providers typically refer out patients with PTSD and defer discussions about treatment options to specialty
providers. This proposal will help PC-MHI providers use a formal engagement strategy, shared decision
making, to improve patients’ knowledge of first-line PTSD treatments and to build motivation for care.
Specific Aims: 1) Refine PRIMED using user-centered design methods and diverse Veterans’ perspectives,
2) Beta test PRIMED in one rural and one urban PC-MHI clinic to optimize integration into clinical workflow and
achieve satisfactory acceptability and feasibility across a range of settings, 3) Conduct a small, randomized
pilot trial (N=40) of PRIMED vs. usual care in two VA PC-MHI clinics to assess the feasibility of study
procedures, which will inform a future larger trial.
Methodology: In Aim 1, Dr. Chen will conduct qualitative interviews using user-centered design methods with
25 VA PC-MHI patients with PTSD, oversampling women veterans and racial/ethnic minority veterans, to refine
the PRIMED intervention protocol. In Aim 2, Dr. Chen will use rapid, iterative beta-testing with approximately
20 patients to optimize the acceptability and feasibility of delivering PRIMED in the clinical setting and its
integration into clinical workflow across varied settings (small rural clinics and large urban clinics). In Aim 3, Dr.
Chen will conduct a pilot randomized feasibility trial (N=40) to assess the feasibility of recruiting and
randomizing Veterans and measuring treatment engagement and clinical outcomes.
Next Steps/Implementation: The research and training activities will prepare the nominee to conduct a multi-
site, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to test the effectiveness of PRIMED for increasing receipt
of first-line PTSD treatments and to begin to assess implementation barriers and facilitators. Future work to
move this research into practice would involve collaborating with operational partners to improve VA SAIL
performance measures in mental health, which are weighted to encourage evidence-based psychotherapies."

The objectives of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer are to contribute significantly to progress in the
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain cancer. These goals will be accomplished through multiple and
diverse research projects involving mechanistic pre-clinical work and innovative clinical studies, with a
particular focus on developing novel strategies to overcome the problem of treatment-induced resistance.
The broad, long-term objectives and aims of our brain cancer SPORE are as follows: 1) to investigate
mechanisms of immunotherapy-induced immune evasion following active immunotherapy, and develop
rational combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of the
brain tumor microenvironment; 2) to elucidate the alterations in cellular metabolism associated with drug-
induced resistance to apoptosis, and exploit targeting apoptotic blocks to induce intrinsic tumor cell death;
and 3) to explore the concept of radiation-induced phenotype conversion of non-tumorigenic cells to
glioblastoma-initiating cells as a mechanism for radiation-induced resistance, and test new therapeutics to
block such glioma stem cell conversion. In order to achieve these translational research goals of our program,
we propose three main projects involving: 1) targeting immunotherapy-induced resistance with DC
vaccination and PD-1/CSF-1R inhibition; 2) overcoming drug-induced resistance to intrinsic apoptosis in
glioblastoma; and 3) strategies against radiation-induced cellular plasticity in glioblastoma. These
translational research projects will be supported by four shared resource cores in administration,

successful in actively incorporating researchers in our Developmental Research and Career Enhancement
Programs in order to foster new approaches for assessing and treating brain cancer. Our diverse array of
novel SPORE projects and state-of-the-art cores has already made a significant impact on brain cancer
research during the last funding cycle, and we hope to continue to make impactful contributions to the field
well into the future. Each project has been developed jointly by teams of basic and clinical researchers, with
the thoughtful advisement of our internal advisory board (IAB) and external advisory board (EAB), working
together in a trans-disciplinary manner to address the most vexing problem in brain cancer – the development
of treatment resistance. All three proposed projects are highly translational and will reach new human
endpoints within the context of our next SPORE grant period."

In this Phase 2 of the Functional Microbiomics, Inflammation and Pathogenicity COBRE, the primary goal of the
Functional Microbiomics Core (FMC) is unchanged. We will sustain and enhance the well-established integrated
service center that functions as a critical resource for the Research Project Leaders (RPLs) as a priority, and
secondarily for all investigators of the Center. Since all new COBRE projects also utilize mouse models to explore
the inter-relationships between inflammation and pathogenesis, and the contribution of microbiota to this
process, our well-established germ-free and gnotobiotic mice facility (GMF) will continue to play a central role in
services provided by the FMC. We will continue to provide anaerobic culturing of mixed and/or mono bacterial
strains to facilitate the specific colonization of the germ-free mice. 16S ribosomal DNA will be profiled with the
in-house developed Oxford nanopore sequencing as well as PacBio-long read sequencing tools, and
bioinformatic support provided. Our most extensively used resource; multiplex-based analysis of inflammatory
mediators in biological samples, will continue to function using the Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad) multiplex system. In
addition, several recent advances allow us to augment the services provided by the FMC. First, the recently
developed, highly successful rederivation service of transgenic and KO mouse models as germ-free, will greatly
expand the scope and utility of the GMF. Related to this service is the development of a new area of research
on the role of microbiota in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) supported by an administrative supplement to the FMC
from NIA/NIGMS. The GMF has already rederived several AD mouse models. For this project, the FMC also
developed a suite of mouse behavior analysis models including the Morris Water Maze and Novel Object
Recognition tests. These services will support all future ageing related research at the center including a new
project on the role of edible-plant derived exosomes in restoring the integrity of the Blood Brain Barrier. We also
now include imaging support, in particular Multiphoton Intravital Microscopy for imaging of live tissue and an In
Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) for live mouse imaging. Besides functioning as a service center, another major goal
of the FMC is to promote the education and training of researchers, primarily the RPLs. The FMC will also interact
with other Core facilities at the University of Louisville, such as the Genomics, Metabolomics and Bioinformatics
core facilities established with the support of other highly successful COBRE/INBRE programs. In particular, the
newly funded Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy COBRE-operated Functional Immunomics Core (FIC)
facility also directed by Dr. Bodduluri has several joint initiatives with the FMC including the establishment of a
histopathology service center. The FMC will work with these and other UofL resources in order to avoid
duplication of equipment, and to train individual investigators in specific protocols, foster innovative protocol
development and integrate analysis of data."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is still the most common cause of healthcare-associated infection despite
a concerted effort to reduce the incidence. Increasingly, C. difficile is found in the community among persons
with no recent healthcare contact. The long-term goal of this project is to identify novel therapeutic targets which
can be exploited to treat CDI and control the spread of C. difficile. The overall objectives in this application are
to (i) elucidate the specificity and redundancy of the sugar transporters under positive selection in C. difficile, (ii)
determine their role in disease, and iii) examine the impact of dietary sugar on asymptomatic carriage. The
central hypothesis is that C. difficile has evolved to better occupy niche space within the gastrointestinal tract
(GIT) by taking advantage of the modern sugar-rich diet. The rationale for this project is that determining the
specificity and importance of sugar transporters and downstream metabolism in C. difficile carriage and infection
sets up a robust scientific framework whereby new prophylaxis and treatment strategies can be developed. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the specificity, redundancy, and
influence on toxin production of evolving sugar transport genes, 2) Determine the effect of evolving sugar
transport genes on community invasion and disease, and 3) Investigate the role of sugars in niche establishment
and asymptomatic carriage. Under the first aim, clean deletions of sugar transporters previously shown to be
under positive selection in epidemic C. difficile will be generated and their effect on growth and toxin production
assessed. The second aim will determine the role of sugar transport in invasion using a novel in vitro bioreactor
assay and disease by utilizing a mouse model of CDI. Finally, aim three will assess the role of sugar availability
in asymptomatic C. difficile colonization by using toxin negative C. difficile strains and a novel 13 strain mouse
microbiota colonization model. The research proposed in this application is innovative, because it focuses on
the metabolic adaptation of C. difficile to carbohydrates and their role in asymptomatic carriage as well as
disease. This focus has the potential to lead to novel prophylactic strategies that can be used against C. difficile
before the emergence of the disease. The proposed research is significant as it will provide a solid scientific
justification for the continued examination of metabolism as a virulence mechanism in C. difficile and provide a
framework for the future study of novel prophylactic, intervention, and treatment options."

Increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability contributes to the speed of the aging process and the
progression of the development of age-related diseases. Microglia-mediated inflammation is a key element in
the development of BBB permeability which results in brain injury and promotes the progression of many brain
diseases. Restoring impaired BBB function by targeting microglial cells without inducing side effects would
therefore be a major advance. Compelling evidence shows that healthy edible plants have important
physiological roles for normal brain function and can prevent neuroinflammatory processes without side-effects.
Turmeric root and ginger, used in medicines for centuries, display a multitude of health benefits including
inhibiting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. We have shown that exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) from
turmeric root (TELNs) are selectively taken up by microglial cells and their constituent microRNAs inhibit the
expression of aging related inflammatory sensome genes including S100A8 and TLR4, thus enhancing BBB
function. Additionally, S100A8 is induced by metabolites isoamylamine (IAA) and crotonic acid (CA) released
from the bacterial family Ruminococcaceae which is overgrown in aged mice due to a reduction of the Myoviridae
family phages. ELNs from ginger (GELNs) can inhibit the growth of Ruminococcaceae, reduce the levels of IAA
and CA, thus decreasing sensome inflammation as well as increasing expression tight junction genes Cldn5 and
Ocln in endothelial cells. In this study, we will provide cellular and molecular insight into how ELNs modulate
brain function via the gut-brain axis by targeting microglial cells and the Ruminococcaceae to the benefit of the
brain. Our hypothesis is that impaired brain function in aged mice can be restored by TELNs and GELNs,
and gut bacterial phages through inhibition of expression of sensome proinflammatory genes and
reduction in production of IAA and CA from Ruminococcaceae. We will test our hypothesis through two
specific aims. (1) We will investigate the role of the S100A8/TLR4 pathway targeted by TELN microRNAs in
recovery from cognitive decline in aged mice; (2) We will determine whether oral administration of GELNs and
Myoviridae family phages has a beneficial effect on improving cognitive decline through reducing the production
of IAA and CA metabolites from Ruminococcaceae. The Aims will be performed in a mouse model that mimics
the human aging process. The completion of this study will lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and
potential for the development of ELN based interventions for treating BBB permeability and brain inflammation.
In addition, the findings will provide a foundation to further study whether oral administration of customized ELNs
isolated from different plants will have a synergistic/additive effect with gut beneficial phages in preventing or
treating chronic inflammatory brain related diseases."

hallmark of acute lung injury (ALI) and its serious variant ARDS. ALI is characterized by protein-rich edema and
ultimately respiratory failure. Targeted therapies remain an urgent unmet need. It is now becoming increasingly
clear that the lung endothelium is a complex monolayer, almost an organ itself, consisting of not only alveolar
endothelial cells (EC) but also specific EC populations found in pulmonary microvessels, arteries and veins.
Recently, we have shown using RNA-sequencing that the lung EC demonstrate significant upregulation of genes
involved in processes related to immune function such as leukocyte cell adhesion, leukocyte migration, and
regulation of immune system. This finding was consistent with lung EC being continuously exposed to the
external environment, unlike EC in other organs such as the brain or heart. Studying this immune regulatory
function of the lung endothelium is crucial for understanding how the EC controls immunity and the host defense
function of lungs, and also how its dysregulation or impairment of the immune response leads to pathogenesis
of ALI. This Program builds on the extraordinary success of a previous 20-year entity, evident by our
accomplishments. We have helped establish the lung endothelium as a node for understanding the lung’s
response to infection and injury and our work has led to better understanding of ways of treating endothelial
barrier breakdown in lungs. This revised application, focusing on the enigmatic innate immune function of the
lung endothelium, is built on foundations of synergy and collaborations. Our Supporting data show the central
role of the lung endothelium in driving inflammatory lung injury, and at the same time provides clues that will lead
to new lung injury targeting therapies. Project 1 will test the hypothesis that the post-translationally modified
endoplasmic reticulum-localized spinghosine-1-phosphate receptor S1PR1 in an unexpected manner
reprograms lung endothelium to activate a signaling cascade that induces inflammatory lung injury. Project 2
will test the hypothesis that a novel lung endothelial cell expressed ubiquitin E3 ligase CHFR (checkpoint with
fork-head and ring finger domain) identified by us regulates VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial barrier integrity
and lung’s innate immune function. Targeting CHFR thus holds promise for preventing inflammatory lung injury.
Project 3 will test the hypothesis that lung endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of mitophagy
regulate endothelial regeneration and serve as a key check point for restoring homeostasis and preventing
inflammatory injury. These Projects are supported by innovative scientific Cores (Epigenetics and
Transcriptomics (Core B), Cellular Imaging (Core C), and Intravital Imaging and Physiology (Core D) that
will make it possible to rigorously address the innate immune function of the lung endothelium and its role in
orchestrating restoration of homeostasis. We hope to unravel the innate immune function of the lung
endothelium, thus providing strategies to develop new targeted therapies against ALI and ARDS."

Project Summary Abstract
This program project grant application focuses on three DNA tumor viruses namely human
papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposi Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus
(KSHV), to identify the critical mechanisms by which these agents induce cancer and deregulate
cell growth. EBV, HPV and KSHV are linked to multiple cancers in the human population. This
proposal will study how these viruses promote carcinogenesis and investigate overarching
biological principles. To identify the mechanisms responsible for the oncogenic properties of
these viruses, the projects will characterize the basic molecular properties of these viruses as
well as viral genes and proteins. They will investigate how these viruses modulate cellular
processes including cell signaling pathways, epigenetic networks, and immune evasion.
Furthermore, the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting these viruses will be tested in cell
culture assays and animal models.
This application consists of four projects and three cores. Project 1 will investigate the
modulation of tumorigenesis by extracellular vesicles secreted from tumor virus-infected cells.
Project 2 will investigate the role of long non-coding RNAs and R-loops in the lifecycle of
oncogenic viruses. Project 3 will investigate how gammaherpesviruses evade host immune
signaling pathways and the impact of host factors on viral lifecycles. Project 4 will examine the
function of EBV-encoded lncRNAs and how EBV infection impacts tumorigenesis. Core A
provides administrative support for the overall program. Core B provides state-of-the-art
genomics and viral and cellular gene profiling, as well as biostatistics support for all the projects
in this application, and Core C provides electron microscopy and mass photometry for structure
studies."

Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) is manifested as a slow colonic motility and constipation, and it is the 2nd
most common complication and 4th most common reason for re-hospitalization in people with spinal cord injury
(SCI). More than 1/3 of people with SCI rate NBD as the most significant quality of life issue. To treat NBD,
43% of SCI individuals take laxatives despite the lack of clinical trials supporting their use. In addition, 65% of
people with SCI resort to using stigmatizing, undignified, burdensome, and time-consuming bowel care
procedures. Key pathophysiologies of NBD in SCI resulting from a loss of central neural control include: 1)
prolonged colonic transit, 2) rectal hyposensitivity, and 3) anorectal dyssynergia. Progress in developing
effective drug treatments for improving NBD has been slow, despite an urgent unmet need. Consequently,
non-drug therapies, including transcutaneous neuromodulation (TNM), are have been explored for NBD. In our
clinical studies, we discovered that TNM applied at the acupuncture point ST36 (below the kneecap) improves
NBD in patients with stroke, chronic constipation, and other disorders by accelerating colonic transit, improving
rectal sensitivity, and restoring colon - external anal sphincter synergy, with TNM effects mediated via the
sacral parasympathetic activation. Anatomically, the ST36 acupuncture point is located at the cutaneous
endings of the sacral nerves. Since direct stimulation of the sacral nerve and roots shown to improve NBD after
SCI in 4 clinical studies, we hypothesize that TNM at ST36 is similarly capable of improving NBD in patients
with SCI. We further hypothesize that therapeutic effects of TNM on the colonic transit would be mediated via
the sacral parasympathetic pathway and on restoring the rectal sensitivity and colon - external anal sphincter
synergy – via the sacral somatic pathway.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel noninvasive TNM therapy using a wearable device
placed on ST36 acupuncture point for treating NBD in SCI and other neurological disorders. The specific aims
of this project are to design and develop an easy-to-use leg-worn TNM device AccelBand and to evaluate its
clinical potential in treating NBD in SCI."

We are unyielding in our support of the principles driving the NIH FIRST program in proposing NURTURE: Northwestern University Recruitment to Transform Under-Representation and achieve Equity. NURTURE will employ a faculty cohort model, innovations in faculty support, and mechanisms to drive institutional transformation to substantively add to our University’s own initiatives to build a sustainable culture of faculty diversity and inclusive excellence. Centered within Northwestern University’s world class research environment, NURTURE aims to disrupt systemic barriers that impede full participation of biomedical research scientists from underrepresented groups (URG) by investing in inclusive cultural change within our institution. We acknowledge that systemic racism has persisted in biomedical science, including at Northwestern. We are committed to dismantling the structures that have allowed racism and bias to persist and impeded the scientific careers of too many URG scholars. NURTURE proposes to transform siloed fiefdom structures to transdisciplinary Scientific Neighborhoods that will foster growth and accomplishment in the research, career, and personal trajectories of URG faculty. NURTURE is supported by an Administrative Core, a Faculty Development Core, and an Evaluation Core that will work synergistically, and with NIH and the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC), to achieve program goals. NURTURE will drive success through several innovations. Our diverse MPI and senior leadership team has a longstanding commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, community building, and faculty career development. They will leverage strong institutional support to implement systemic innovations toward a more inclusive and sustained culture of excellence (Aim 1). NURTURE is centered on a spectrum of research from cells to community in each of three cross-departmental Scientific Neighborhoods aligned with NIH mission areas: cancer, cardiovascular, and brain, mind and behavior. Scientific Neighborhoods will welcome 15 new URG faculty (the NURTURE Cohort) (Aim 2), in a culture of scientific excellence and inclusion. Runways to these new faculty positions will be built from a foundation of long-standing training programs, well-established local relationships, and a new initiative on postdoctoral training. Aim 3 establishes evidence-informed innovative advancement programs that include professional coaching, a team of safe space ambassadors, and comprehensive mentoring and sponsorship for NURTURE Cohort members to empower self-efficacy and combat isolation throughout their Northwestern onboarding and promotion journey. Aim 4 is driven by an expert evaluation team that will employ state-of-the-art approaches to guide real-time improvement toward success. Finally, a robust Institutional Transformation and Accountability Committee will bolster institutional connectivity and accelerate scaled implementation of NURTURE findings by Northwestern University leaders to sustainably transform our institutional culture toward inclusive excellence."

The Ohio State University Vision Sciences Research Core Program (OSU-VSRCP) has established the
expanding vision research scientists across five academic units (i.e., College of Medicine (COM), College of
Optometry (COO), College of Engineering (COE), College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Arts and
Sciences) and newly engaged Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Program Director (PD) Dr. Moroi has
commitment from Deans and Chairs to purchase equipment (i.e., confocal microscope), support data science,
assign scarce space, and increase collaborations. The leadership and scientists are aligned with the NEI PAR-
20-051 ‘to enhance the capabilities of participating NEI-funded investigators and the institution for conducting
vision research.’ Synergy of this community has been established with monthly ViSOR (Vision Sciences OSU
Research) seminars. Synergy between Cores has been defined by the Steering Committee composed of the
PD, Core Directors and Co-directors, who represent Dept. Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (DOVS), Dept.
Neuroscience, Dept. Biomedical Informatics, Dept. Computer Science (COE), and COO. Synergy between
Cores will coincide with monthly ViSOR meetings. In addition, an Advisory Group will provide guidance twice a
year to the Steering Committee. Based on a survey of 61 scientists, three scientific cores are proposed, which
are re-organized in response to the prior review led by a Director and Co-director, with at least one of the
leaders holding an NEI R01. Core A: Structural and Functional Assessments (SFA) Core A provides
technical expertise and well-maintained state-of-the-art equipment for functional and morphological
assessment of cells and animal models used in vision research. Dr. Moroi arranged the added value of
machine shop services with an agreement with Executive Director Mr. Nate Ames (see letter) of The OSU
Center for Design and Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) to enhance funded research projects. Core B:
Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Genetic Analysis (BBGA) Core B was re-organized to consolidate
services for traditional statistics and statistical genetics. Users can obtain assistance in research design and
traditional statistics, as well as bioinformatics, pathway analysis, and large-scale genomic data mining that
require advanced computational analytics. Core C: Image Analysis and Data Science (IADS) Core C was re-
organized in response to the growing need for image processing, analysis and data science expertise including
machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and development of a Data Commons Architecture for the OSU

shared overarching goal to prevent blindness, restore vision and develop cures for eye diseases."
11110271,"LARC methods include IUDs, implants, or long acting vaginal rings.  LARC methods are more effective than daily, weekly or monthly products because they are less prone to user error.  IUDs and implants have an effectiveness rate that is in the top tier for typical use (>99% effective).  Development of new LARC methods is a high priority for the CDDB.
LARC methods, copper-containing IUDs are the only highly effective reversible methods that do not involve administration of hormones and do not cause irregular or unscheduled bleeding pattern in women.  These properties make a copper IUD and ideal method for women who do not wish to take or cannot take hormonal contraceptive methods.  Products containing the synthetic estrogen and ethinyl estradiol have been associated with a dose-dependent increase in BTE.  Copper IUDs do not increase risk of VTE, such as obese women, pregnant women and women with Leiden Factor V.  Preliminary data from some studies indicate that newer copper IUDs may be associated with a lower incidence of heavy bleeding and/or cramping and some devices may have less pain with insertion."
10649525,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents with a
prevalence of more than 10%. Left untreated, pediatric patients with anxiety disorders suffer physical, emotional,
academic, and social impairment, and these disorders increase the likelihood of secondary anxiety disorders,
major depressive disorder and other psychiatric conditions in adulthood. Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) are the first-line psychopharmacologic treatment for these conditions, but may take up to 8 weeks to
produce responses—which only occur in 50-60% of youth. Further, SSRI-related adverse effects emerge early
in the course of treatment, decrease the likelihood of success and increase the likelihood of medication
discontinuation. These significant side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms and activation—a hyperarousal
event characterized by specific symptoms including an increase in activity, impulsivity, disinhibition, restlessness,
and insomnia.
Today, there is no way to predict, based on clinical or biological characteristics which children and adolescents
will respond to an SSRI or who will develop treatment-limiting adverse effects—a significant concern of patients
and their families.
The goal of this proposal is to advance the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders by examining predictive
markers of SSRI treatment response and SSRI-related gastrointestinal symptoms and activation. This proposal
builds upon our significant finding that 5 lipid classes derived from plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) predict
SSRI response in anxious youth. This application proposes to replicate our preliminary study in a large, multi-
site, double-blind placebo-controlled trial and utilizes synchronized methods for biospecimen collection and
outcome measurement. This proposal will also evaluate a specific subpopulation of EVs—L1CAM(+) EVs—
which are enriched in cargoes of neuronal origin, providing a targeted, non-invasive assessment of the molecular
milieu of the CNS.
The line of inquiry is novel to precision medicine/child and adolescent mental health, and has the potential to
propel the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth while increasing the safety of SSRI treatment, by predicting
SSRI-related side effects."

Funds are requested to support four modules that facilitate the research of and and enhance interaction among
the investigators of at least 20 NEI-funded R01 grants. The modules will expand and enrich the activities of
individual research programs by providing technologies and services not otherwise available to the
investigators. The modules include Animal Resources, Flow Cytometry, Laboratory Computer Applications and
Morphology. The Animal Resource Module provides expertise and assistance in animal surgical techniques
and postoperative care, administration of anesthesia, drugs and medications. It includes the Animal Visual
Assessment Core, which is a unique and valuable collection of equipment necessary for measuring murine
vision as well as technical expertise for the training and/or conduct of particular assessments. It also provides
specialized barrier services for the maintenance and breeding of unique mouse lines. The Flow Cytometry
Module is a centralized service providing principal investigators and collaborators access to equipment and
technical support for flow cytometry. The module offers cell counting, sorting to obtain viable populations of
cells according to specific cellular markers, and biomarker detection. The Laboratory Computer Applications
Module provides support to individual and collaborative efforts offering guidance in the application of machine
learning, in the programming and developing software for gathering, processing, and in analyzing experimental
data by computer systems. The module will also help projects involving image processing and analysis. The
module interacts actively with the Animal, Flow Cytometry and Morphology Modules supporting analysis and
export of data. The Morphology Module provides light, scanning and electron microscopy, confocal microscopy

10766801,"ABSTRACT
Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) accounts for ~60% of all preterm births (15 million PTBs/year and 1 million
neonatal deaths around the globe). Balanced immune homeostasis by fetal and maternal compartments ensure
pregnancy maintenance and feto-placental growth. Premature disruption of immune homeostasis and
overwhelming host inflammatory response due to infectious or other non-infectious risk factors lead to majority
of PTBs. PTB rate has not declined in the past several decades, and current PTB prevention strategies do not
address fetal immune responses, a key mediator that triggers preterm labor. The proposing team has recently
used an innovative technology to engineer exosomes to be enriched with an inhibitor to NF-κB, termed as super
repressor IκBα [SR]. Pilot studies using a transgenic mouse model showed successful delay in PTB without any
side effects that was associated with reduction in inflammation at the feto-maternal interface tissues (F-M; fetal
membrane cells and maternal decidua). However, moving this to the next stage is challenging, as a very large
number of non-human primates, the animal model that most closely resemble the human F-M interface, will be
needed, which is cost prohibitive. An organ-on-chip (OOC) model that faithfully represents the structure,
functions, and responses of human F-M interface can overcome such challenges. The proposing team has
recently reported the first F-M interface OOC model, which was successfully utilized to show the interactive and
transitional properties of primary cells, resembling their biological functions in utero. In the UG3 phase, this model
will be expanded to include the full F-M interface, recreate a healthy and disease inflammatory state, and fully
validated for their cellular functions and responses predisposing to PTB. The UG3 aims are: Aim 1 To validate
the F-M interface OOC model; Aim 2 To establish disease F-M interface OOC models. The UH3 aims are:
Aim 3 To test extracellular vesicle (EV)-encoded experimental drug NF-kB repressor (SR) on normal and
disease F-M interface OOC models; Aim 4 Conduct pre-clinical trial using the OOC model to investigate
the impact of racial diversity and gender of fetus on the efficacy of the experimental drug. The success
of the proposed research will produce a personalized F-M interface OOC model that can mimic either healthy or
disease state of pregnancy, which can be used to test the effect of candidate therapeutic molecules to expedite
processes towards clinical trials and or eliminate/minimize certain steps from expensive clinical trials."

Chronic ulcers, defined as wounds that fail to heal within a three-month period, are associated with age-related
dysfunction in skin stem cells that not only has potential to blunt tissue repair, but also accounts for skin fragility,
atrophy, and the ""aging phenotype"" that itself has clinical as well as psychosocial implications. Non-healing
ulcers in aging individuals represent a multibillion dollar burden in the United States and to society globally, both
through utilization of health care resources as well as through reduction in productivity. Nonetheless, it is
recognized that ""the basic biology and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly
understood, and there are numerous research questions still to be answered"". To address this important issue,
we have 1) assembled a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary team of investigators with established track
records in skin pathology, regenerative and stem cell biology, wound healing, bioinformatics, and the
pathobiology of aging; 2) leveraged the resources of seven Harvard Institutions to develop a unified and state-
of-the-art approach to decipher the role skin stem cell deficiency in age-related defective wound healing; and 3)
generated data-based hypotheses and identified inter-project synergies that will maximize productivity and
translational focus. Our fundamental hypothesis is that identification and interrogation of three major, inter-
related, and therapeutically targetable/reprogrammable pathways relevant to age-related skin stem cell
dysfunction, a) metabolic, b) epigenetic, and c) membrane transporter/receptor, will pave the way for
combinatorial (multicomponent) therapies necessary for more robust healing and regenerative responses to skin
injury. We will pursue this goal through six strategies that have been developed by the key personnel of this
PPG: 1) discovery of biomarkers for epidermal and dermal stem cell identification and manipulation; 2)
determination of metabolic regulators required for epidermal progenitor activity and maintenance; 3) identification
of novel epigenetic pathways that govern skin stem cell function and vitality; 4) development and evaluation of
unique murine models that permit study of human wound healing in vivo; 5) deployment of lineage tracking
technologies that facilitate detection of experimentally-manipulated stem cell fate in healing wounds; and 6)
generation of new animal strains and for epigenomic induction of premature aging and methods for genomic
restoration of stem cell youth and pluripotency. Our overall aims seek to answer the following questions: 1) How
can one map the key metabolomic, epigenetic, and cell receptor stem cell pathways that drive age-related wound
healing dysfunction?; 2) What are the therapeutically-accessible nodes for stem cell-directed multicomponent
combinatorial targeting within these pathways?; and 3) What are the agents that likely will affect restoration of
robust and regenerative stem cell-driven responses to wound healing and support physiologic cutaneous
maintenance and health? Success in this endeavor could be transformative in understanding how aged stem
cells may be restored to functional vigor implicit to normal tissue integrity and regenerative potential."

This P01— Strategies for Targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in AD and ADRD (STAR-ADRD) addresses the
(patho)physiologic roles of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).
Though highly significant to many disease phenotypes, astrocyte functions are under-investigated and have yet
to benefit from large-scale programmatic support from the NIH. To fill this void we have assembled a highly
accomplished and collaborative team from the University of Kentucky Sanders-Brown Center on Aging (UK-
SBCoA). The overarching goals of this project are to: (1) Use cell-specific targeting to modulate distinct aspects
of the reactive astrocyte phenotype. (2) Use cutting-edge technologies to assess the functional impact of reactive
astrocytes in intact preclinical mouse models of AD and ADRD pathologies. (3) Leverage UK-SBCoA and UK-
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) resources to validate preclinical results in postmortem and living
human subjects. And (4) Use an integrated data pipeline approach to analyze and interpret data within and
across projects. Through these aims we will test the hypothesis that: interrelated reactive astrocyte
phenotypes drive major pathophysiologic features of dementia including cerebrovascular dysfunction,
hypometabolism, and impaired neuronal network function and fidelity. Projects are designed around a
clear understanding that dementia does not exist as a single pathological entity most of the time, but rather is
characterized by multiple brain pathologies. Project 1 (Astrocytic end-feet and VCID) will use MMP9
overexpression/knockdown in a model of cerebral small vessel disease to address astrocyte endfeet
degeneration. Project 2 (Astrocytic insulin signaling and AD) will overexpress/knockdown astrocytic insulin
receptors (IR) in an Aβ model to study the impact of impaired astrocytic IR signaling. Project 3 (Astrocytic
glutamate transport in AD and VCID) will overexpress/knockdown the astrocytic glutamate transporter SLC1A2
in a mixed Aβ-vascular model to assess the role of impaired glutamate transport in reactive astrocytes. Project
4 (Astrocytic KATP channels in LATE+HS) will overexpress/eliminate astrocytic ABCC9/SUR2 in a model of
LATE + hippocampal sclerosis to assess the role of KATP channels. Four Cores will support and further integrate
our Projects. Core B: Animal Vascular-Metabolic-Neural Network (VMN) will assess cerebrovascular, metabolic,
and neural network properties in mice using two-photon microscopy, MRI/MRS, microelectrode array neuro-
chemistry, and electrophysiology. Core C: Human Consultation-Biosamples-Biomarkers (CBB) will validate
results in mice using well characterized autopsy tissue, MRI, EEG, and fluid biomarker data from humans. And
Core D: Data Management and Biostatistics will establish a data pipeline for efficient categorization,
transformation, and statistical analysis of complex relationships between astrocyte interventions and endpoint
measures, within and between projects. Finally, an Administrative Core (Core A) will provide leadership,
coordination, integration, and administrative structure, so that the P01 goals are achieved."

first author paper in a peer-reviewed journal recognized as excellent in the field of biophysics, and will
subsequently pursue a research-related career in academia, industry, or government. Professional development
will be centered on the acquisition of ten core competences designed to enable leadership in any of these
workforce sectors. Training procedures will be informed by the latest scientific literature in the field of research
mentorship and training, and will emphasize the acquisition of self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Research
training will be enhanced in response to the latest advances in biophysics, including the rapidly growing

 Conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and malignancies such as breast cancer, negatively
affect the musculoskeletal system, leading to substantial disability and health care costs. Thus, there is an
ongoing need to better understand the causes of these conditions and to support development of more effective
and well-tolerated therapies. The Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) was established at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) during Phase 1 to meet this need. The scientific theme of
the CMDR is that identification of molecular contributors to musculoskeletal dysfunction and disease will guide
development of effective therapies. To study these conditions, we have assembled teams of junior and
established investigators and supported development of junior investigators to the point of achieving independent
R01-level funding. We also utilize state-of-the-art technologies to analyze gene expression, genetically
manipulate animals, and analyze the skeleton. These complementary approaches, together with access to
clinical investigators and patient samples, have synergized to create a unique and productive research
environment. A key to the continued success of the Center will be to increase the number of investigators whose
research is aligned with our scientific theme via development of more junior investigators and recruitment of new
and established investigators. To accomplish this, in Phase 2 we propose to support the development of 3 Project
Leaders by providing structured mentoring, financial resources, and collaboration with other CMDR investigators
(Aim 1). We will also continue to strengthen the biomedical research infrastructure at UAMS by increasing the
capabilities and utilization of 4 research cores that provide access to rapid, high-quality services and that develop
new approaches, such as CRISPR interference for in vivo loss-of-function studies (Aim 2). To continue building
a critical mass of musculoskeletal investigators and teams, the Center will utilize a Pilot Project Program, targeted
recruitment of investigators with complementary expertise, and incorporation of new and established center
investigators into synergistic and productive research teams (Aim 3). Successful implementation of this
Organization and Management Plan will, in the long-term, lead to a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical
Research Excellence that will generate novel and important results leading to more effective therapies for the
numerous conditions that involve the musculoskeletal system."
10721350,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) has substantial negative consequences on veterans' mental and physical health,
work performance, housing status, and social function. Opioid drug abuse has reached an epidemic level in
the United States. There is an increased risk of overdose death with higher daily opioid doses for increasing
analgesic effect. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) recognizes the clinical challenges to successfully
prescribing opioids safely for our veterans. Morphine withdrawal (MW) is one of determinants of opiate abuse
in OUD individuals, yet its mechanisms are poorly understood, and effective therapies are still lacking.
 MW activates astrocytes to release neuroinflammatory factors. Emerging evidence shows that
neuroinflammatory factor Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) from reactive astrocytes is associated with a variety of nervous
system injuries and neuroinflammation. Our preliminary data showed that spontaneous MW (S-MW) induced
TLR4, NF-kB (RelA/p65), and LCN2 from astrocytes. LCN2 receptor (LCN2-R) is located in the brainstem
periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons in S-MW. Epigenetic writer EZH2 silences gene expression by generating
a methylated epigenetic mark at H3K27me3. Our preliminary data showed that S-MW increased neuronal
EZH2 and pCREB, and decreased anti-oxidative mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) in the PAG. The exact
molecular mechanisms of astrocytes to neuron activity in S-MW remain poorly understood. In the proposal,
we will test the hypothesis that glial activity induces the release of astrocytes-derived LCN2, which lowers
neuronal anti-oxidative Sirt3 and finally increases pCREB in the PAG in mice with S-MW. Specific Aim 1: To
determine whether astrocytic activation induces the overexpression of LCN2 through TLR4 and NF-κB in the
vlPAG in mice with S-MW. Specific Aim 2: To define whether LCN2-R mediates the lowered Sirt3 expression
leading to pCREB increases in the vlPAG neurons in mice with S-MW. A crucial feature of our work is the
ability to causally use new genetic/epigenetic and molecular assay, cell-type specific conditional knockout
(cKO) mice, cell type-selective viral-mediated gene transfer, and molecular-pharmacological approach. The
proposal will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of opioid withdrawal, and shed light on a novel
therapeutic target for opioid withdrawal of opioid withdrawal. The study will could lead, in the future, to the
development of new drugs for both the general population and veterans, based on our identification of the

and disease prevalence expected to double by 2030. Our understanding is very limited about the first two
decades of PD progression before diagnosis, called the prodromal period, because this stage involves vague
under-recognized symptoms such as non-motor disorders of the skin. Previous studies of skin tissue pathology
are limited but have implicated pathologic features associated with prodromal-stage PD, particularly neuronal
synuclein accumulation and aggregation. The knowledge gap about early PD and lack of tissue studies is a
major obstacle toward understanding pathogenesis, identifying subtypes, and ultimately disease-modifying
therapies.
Significance: This proposal will map the early pathologic features of prodromal PD in peripheral skin tissues
and link these pathologic features to clinical and genetic “big data” available at the VHA. Understanding the
timing and diagnostic utility of early peripheral pathology in PD is of high importance for the VA healthcare
system as the VA has an older average age, males are more likely to acquire the disease, PD is recognized as a
service-connected disease, and veterans with PD are more likely to rely solely on the VA for their health care
than veterans without PD.
Innovation: This proposal is innovative by creating curating a novel dataset measuring twenty years of
prodromal disorders in nationwide PD cases and 4:1 matched controls and cataloguing the presence of archival
biopsies spanning 1-20 years before PD diagnosis. In addition, this study for the first time integrates
histopathology, clinical data, and genetic data from the VA mega-biobank, called the Million Veterans Program
(MVP). Finally, this study is novel in comparing two leading biomarker assays, immunofluorescence and real-
time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC).
Specific Aims: 1) Determine the presence of neuronal synuclein accumulation and seeded synuclein
aggregation in skin preceding a diagnosis of PD and association with clinical disorders, 2) Determine the
association of genetic variants with prodromal clinical disorders and a cluster of disorders that co-segregate
with synuclein.
Methods: All PD patients and 4:1 matched controls are identified in the VA medical database (n=1.5 million)
and skin biopsies are identified before PD diagnosis or equivalent age controls. Tissue blocks will be collected
initially from the Portland pathology service and if needed scaled to tissue collaborators at Phoenix and Palo
Alto VAMC. Using immunofluorescent microscopy, we will measure neuronal α-synuclein and using RT-QuIC
we will measure synuclein seeded aggregation. Genome association analysis will be performed between
prodromal clinical disorders and variant allele frequencies from the MVP.
Next Steps: By understanding the earliest features of PD, this project can lead to targeted study of the earliest
causes of PD, relate complementary but oft unconnected data silos, and identify meaningful subtypes."

There is an increasing incidence of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PC) presenting with locally
advanced or metastatic disease, a population that comprises >60% of the men who die from the disease. The
failure of early detection has led to the initiation of multiple clinical trials testing neoadjuvant therapies in an
attempt to cure these patients. Analysis of pre-treatment samples from neoadjuvant trials have identified genomic
alterations that associate with a treatment resistance. More recent studies indicate the tumor microenvironment
(TME) can initiate the metastatic cascade. However, it remains unclear how and when genomic alterations co-
opt different cell types in a complex 3-dimensional TME to initiate the metastatic cascade. We have recently
found that activated fibroblasts and macrophage sub-populations induce lymphovascular sprouting and
permeability. Based on these data sets, we hypothesize that somatic alterations in tumor DNA co-opt
stromal and immune cells in the TME to promote invasion and intravasation of lympho-vascular
channels. To test this hypothesis, we have three cohorts of patients with high-risk prostate cancer (surgery
alone, neoadjuvant Abiraterone, and neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy) that undergo PSMA PET/MRI scans
prior to surgery. This scan is used to develop 3D mold of the prostate to perform whole mount sectioning and
dissection of multi-focal PC for multi-plex molecular analysis. Samples from these specimens are used to create
patient-specific “TMEs on a Chip” using a humanized Micro-Physiologic System (MPS) of the prostate with
surrounding lympho-vasculature. This novel model system allows culture of patient tumor cells and stromal cells
to identify the factors that induce lymphatic permeability and culminate in tumor invasion and intravasation.
Success in these studies will identify the biologic interactions in the TME that can initiate the metastatic cascade
as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for men with high-risk, locally advanced PC. In Aim 1 we will
perform whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, across 3D whole mount sections identified by PSMA
PET/MRI, in untreated patients to evaluate heterogeneity and determine the impact of neoadjuvant ARSIs and
docetaxel across 3D multifocal PC. In Aim 2, we extend spatial mapping with PSMA PET/MRI and IHC data to
perform transcriptional Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) on whole-mount sections collected in Aim 1. This
integration will test whether distinct CAF and immune cell infiltrates associate with genomic alterations in a spatial
configuration of cells invading regional lymphovascular channels. In Aim 3, we use LumeNEXT MPS technology
to create humanized lymphatic vessels cultured in patient-specific humanized prostate TMEs, with genomically
engineered PC cells, that reflect the molecular and cellular signatures identified in Aims 1 and 2. When
completed, the outcome of this work will advance the field by helping us to understand how prostate cancer
metastasizes for both biomarker and drug development."

Despite a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among African Americans (AA) and Latino Americans
(LA) compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW), these populations remain underrepresented in AD biomedical
research, particularly in biomarker studies and clinical trials. The overarching goal of Project 3 of this U19 is to
leverage existing “trial-ready” AA and LA cohorts with longitudinal blood collections, clinical, neuroimaging and
cognitive data in order to identify centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures (CLPMS) that may serve as
novel blood biomarkers that will improve diagnosis and the development of treatments in these underserved and
understudied populations. Based on preliminary data from our group and others, we hypothesize that genetic
variation, transcriptomic and epigenetic changes predisposing to dementia risk in AA and LA will reveal novel
mechanisms associated with disease, as well as similarities with those identified in NHW. Project 3 will leverage
existing AA and LA samples and data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, 66 AA 59
LA) and five Alzheimer’s Disease research Centers (ADRCs, 564 AA, 219 LA): Mayo Clinic, Indiana, 1Florida,
Michigan and Knight ADRCs, plus an additional 300 AA and LA projected participants from these ADRC. Data
from a sixth ADRC (Emory) collected from another 300 AA participants will also be incorporated. This project
aims to: (1) identify blood multi-omic CLPMS in AA and LA that will improve AD diagnosis by effectively
discriminating, with high specificity and sensitivity, between individuals clinically diagnosed with AD and who
have amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and vascular endophenotype changes characteristic of AD based on
neuroimaging/CSF/plasma biomarker data, versus those who do not have these endophenotype changes
characteristic of AD; (2) identify blood CLPMS that can predict the development, and that track with progression
of AD, by analyzing longitudinal blood multi-omics data-matched to clinical, neuroimaging, neuropsychometric
data from cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment and AD patients; (3) identify blood CLPMS that are
specific to these populations, based on genetic variants, transcripts or epigenetic changes that may impact the
development of AD, differentially in AA and LA vs. those of NHW ancestry (by comparison to findings from Project
2); (4) to determine if these blood CLPMS exhibit similar patterns in the brain (by comparison to findings from
Project 1); (5) to determine novel pathways, genes and genetic variants involved in AD by using results from
these multi-omics signatures identified in this project. Using a 3-tiered approach to analyze our findings and
Roadmap to Translation to prioritize them, we expect to identify CLPMS in AA and LA in a comparative fashion
with NHWs and will enhance knowledge on biomarker research, thus enabling precision medicine in these
underrepresented populations. These studies will integrate information expected to also lead to better informed
designs for therapies and possibly preventive interventions that are tailored to these populations."

Our longstanding focus has been to understand the multiple myeloma (MM)-bone marrow stromal cell
interaction. We have utilized integrated genomic and epigenomic analysis and our in vitro and in vivo models of
MM cell in the bone marrow (BM) milieu to identify molecular targets and pathways supporting myeloma cell
growth, survival, and drug resistance, and implement effective molecularly-based therapies with dramatic effects
on the survival of MM patients. During the current funding period, we identified and validated
gene regulatory networks and feed-forward loops controlling gene transcription and driving disease
behavior and then evaluated targeted agents. In the process we identified the noncoding RNA
(lncRNA) networks in MM. One of the emerging areas of research has been the recent advances
highlighting the functional significance of lncRNAs) that span > 80% of the human genome. These RNA
molecules control a variety of cellular and molecular functions via mechanisms that are yet not well
described. We have previously described the aberrant lncRNA landscape in MM and reported the significant
role of aberrant lncRNAs as an independent risk predictor for clinical outcome, providing the rationale to
further investigate biological and molecular activity of lncRNAs in MM. We hypothesize that dysregulated
lncRNAs significantly impact the pathobiology of MM by their ability to control multiple genes, with the potential
to serve as therapeutic targets. In this project, our robust human MM model systems will be used to stringently
validate the role of novel lncRNAs (Sp. Aim 1) identified to be of biologic/prognostic significance; and develop
single and combination therapies directed against these clinically and biologically relevant novel lncRNAs
(Sp. Aim 2). Leveraging our genomic and transcriptomic data, the proposed studies will define the functional
landscape of lncRNAs in MM and their impact on the disease pathobiology, with the potential of developing
novel translational therapies for the treatment of MM patients."

This proposal brings together the translational medicine and research expertise of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI), Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with the clinical
research strength of Intergroupe Francophone du Myeloma (IFM) in France to develop a curative strategy for
MM. In this international collaborative renewal application, we now propose to build on our highly successful
genomic, preclinical, clinical, and administrative strengths to address the next generation of questions that will
ultimately lead to therapeutic advances for cure. Most importantly, our current study has confirmed that high
dose melphalan treatment followed autologous stem cell transplant achieves MRD negative status and leads to
significantly superior survival outcome. In this proposal, we will now undertake an a collaborative trial to address
the next most important issue of how MRD status will inform our therapeutic decision algorithm (Project 1).
Importantly, the large number of samples from uniformly treated patients will allow us to both identify genomic
and epigenomic correlates of disease behavior; role of master transcription factors and oncogenic condensates
(Project 2); identify long non coding RNA dependencies and validate novel targeted therapeutic approaches
(Project 3); and define the mechanisms and clinical implications of genomic instability in MM (Project 4). This
unique international collaborative effort requires significant co-ordination of effort, integration of strategies,
monitoring and oversight of various functions, and communication between investigators at various dispersed
sites. The key function of Core A is integration of the research efforts and communication between investigators.
Scientific and administrative integration is essential to assure successful interaction between the four Projects,
as well as between the laboratory and clinical components within and between projects in this multinational multi-
institutional program. Therefore, this central core will provide the link between various projects and successfully
co-ordinate the clinical study and the proposed correlative science. To aid in achieving these goals, Core A will:
monitor the timely conduct of the clinical study and assure progress in tissue collection, processing and usage
to co-ordinate interaction between the clinical and correlative science studies (Specific Aim 1); co-ordinate
communication, and exchange of data between investigators at various international sites (Specific Aim 2);
provide necessary resources, fiscal oversight and administrative support for projects and cores (Specific Aim
3); facilitate intra-programmatic interactions, meetings, travel and Internal and External Advisory Committees

10720884,"The ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is crucial for the enterohepatic
circulation of bile acids and plays a key role in maintaining bile acid, lipid, and cholesterol balance.
Emerging evidence suggests that ASBT is an attractive therapeutic approach to restore metabolic
functions and lower plasma cholesterol. This is particularly important in light of recent findings
indicating the need to lower cholesterol to very low levels in individuals with high risk for
developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as the veterans. Achieving such stringent target
remains challenging in many cases despite the use of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors and
blockers of cholesterol absorption. In this regard, dietary fatty acids are known to influence
metabolic functions as well as lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. A recent study showed that the
effectiveness of ASBT inhibition in restoring normal metabolic functions depends on the types of
fatty acids present in the diet. However, specific effects of different types of fatty acids on ASBT
function are not fully understood. Our recent novel data using resin-assisted capture (Acyl-RAC)
and click-chemistry based metabolic labeling approaches provided evidence that ASBT protein is
subject to s-acylation, a reversible post-translational modification where fatty acids attach to
cysteine residues of membrane proteins governing their membrane raft localization and function.
We have shown that incorporation of the unsaturated fatty acid oleate or omega-3 fatty acid
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into ASBT was associated with a significant decrease in its function.
We have previously demonstrated that ASBT is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms
including its association with membrane lipid raft microdomains. Our preliminary findings showed
that feeding a diet rich with fish oil decreased ASBT function and association with lipid rafts in
mice. Thus, identifying mechanisms that target s-acylation could be beneficial in inhibiting ASBT
function as well as restoring normal lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. ASBT activity and
association with lipid rafts were increased in a transgenic mouse model (ISR2tg) with intestine-
specific overactivation of the Sterol Response Elements Binding Protein (SREBP2). Our recent
data demonstrated that ISR2tg mice develop hypercholesterolemia and severe hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis when fed a high fat high cholesterol diet and blocking bile acid
absorption by cholestyramine reduced the diet-induced liver injury. ASBT function and association
with lipid rafts are increased in ISR2tg mice. Based on these data, our proposed studies will test
the hypothesis that acylation is critical for ASBT function and association with lipid rafts and that
intestine-specific mechanisms are involved in regulating ASBT acylation (Specific aim 1). Studies
in Specific Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms mediating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on
ASBT function and s-acylation in in vitro models including enteroids and will examine their effects
on bile acid homeostasis as well as lipid and cholesterol metabolism in wildtype and ASBT
knockout mice. To investigate the beneficial effects of blocking ASBT acylation, our studies will
further utilize ISR2tg mice fed a high fat high cholesterol diet as a unique model to examine the
effects of feeding dietary omega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids on ASBT acylation and metabolic
dysfunction (Specific Aim 2). Our findings represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the
link between fatty acids and bile acid homeostasis. The proposed studies are highly significant
and are likely to unravel novel avenues pertaining to potential beneficial effects of blocking ASBT
function and acylation in restoring metabolic functions and cholesterol homeostasis."
10732221,"This application proposes to identify molecular etiologies of heritable movement disorders and elucidate effects
of pathogenic variants as important steps towards improving diagnoses and development of targeted
therapies. The categories of disease studied in this project, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related
syndromes, ataxias, spastic paraplegias, and choreiform or dystonic disorders, are all genetically
heterogeneous. We have identified the underlying genes for multiple movement disorders, some of which are a
focus in this proposal, and initiated studies on their pathogeneses. Many more contributing genes remain to be
discovered. We propose to 1) continue to ascertain and characterize individuals and families with genetically
unattributed movement disorders; 2) use state-of-art gene mapping and next-generation sequencing
technologies to discover new genes for movement disorders; and 3) investigate pathogenic mechanisms of
variants using patient tissues, patient-derived stem cell models, and Drosophila models. The proposal builds
on established synergistic collaborations and multifaceted clinical, pathological, basic science, and
translational expertise of the Investigators and Collaborators. It also leverages the invaluable resources of two
large collections of samples ascertained, extensively characterized, and extended over 30 years
(Neurogenetics and PD repositories).
 Our approach to disease gene identification combines traditional linkage or identity-by-descent (IBD)
analysis to identify genomic regions shared by all affected family members, together with exome or genome
sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis to identify variants in the linkage/IBD region shared by
affected relatives. Advances in statistical genetics and use of denser marker panels make it possible to
perform such studies in smaller families and more powerful bioinformatics tools offer a stepwise filtering
approach to prioritize likely pathogenic variants for further study. Cosegregation of a variant with disease in
single families and identification of mutations in the same gene in other families and large publicly available
datasets of sporadic cases with the same disorder provide validation that the gene is responsible for the
disease. Disease pathogenesis can then be investigated through mechanistic studies. This approach has led
to our documented record of consistent productivity in parsing genetic neurologic disorders.
 For functional studies, we focus on the RAB39B α-synucleinopathy, the ATP6AP2 tauopathy, and SAMD9L
ataxia, pancytopenia and autoimmunity syndrome, three disorders whose causative genes we discovered, and
GBA, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for idiopathic PD. These four genes participate in
endolysosomal trafficking and autophagy, pathways frequently implicated in PD and other neurodegenerative
disorders. By analysis of gene expression in human autopsy brain samples, we will identify vulnerable cell
types and characterize region-specific changes that drive pathology. Neural and glial cells reprogrammed from
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of patients will be used to investigate effects of pathogenic variants in
each of these genes, such as a connection between deficiency in ATP6AP2/V-ATPase function, impaired
autophagy, and turnover of aggregation-prone tau protein. Autophagy will be pharmacologically induced to
explore mitigation of tau pathology and improve neuronal survival. Drosophila and iPSC models will be used to
investigate how RAB39B and ATP6AP2 proteins interact with GBA and how pathogenic variants in RAB39B,
ATP6AP2, and SAMD9L influence endolysosomal trafficking.
 Beyond the implication of gene discovery for patients who suffer from a particular disorder, each new gene
contributes to our understanding of the complex protein-protein interactions involved in neurodegeneration.
Furthermore, from their biochemical pathways and protein complexes each new gene can uncover additional
candidate genes for the disorders that can also be considered as targets for intervention."
10721828,"Myocardial infarction (MI) with resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure rank among the leading
causes of morbidity and mortality among Veterans in the United States. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, sustained
and unregulated inflammatory signaling is recognized as a driver of heart failure pathogenesis. Therefore,
understanding the crosstalk between immune cells and cardiac myocytes has the potential to inform
therapeutic strategies. Immune cells in the myocardium affect cardiac myocyte structure and function via cell
autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Cardiac macrophages are increasingly recognized as the
dominant immune cell type driving pro-inflammatory signaling under stress. On the other hand, studies also
point to critical homeostatic roles for resident cardiac macrophages in maintenance of cardiac structure and
function. Indeed, in the post-MI period, infiltrated peripheral monocytes differentiate into macrophages and are
postulated to play a dual role in concert with the resident cardiac macrophages, characterized by pro-
inflammatory signaling and phagocytic removal of dead cells in the early phase and a shift towards anti-
inflammatory signaling to promote reparative phase. In published VA MERIT-supported studies, we have
uncovered evidence for impaired lysosome function in macrophages as a driver of pro-inflammatory signaling.
Our studies further demonstrated the efficacy of stimulating the macrophage lysosome biogenesis program by
activation of TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy-lysosome pathway, in engendering a phenotypic switch in
macrophages and promoting post-MI healing. In parallel studies, we have uncovered an essential role for
TRAF2 in cardiac myocytes in executing physiologic mitophagy, a selective lysosomal degradative pathway
that removes damaged mitochondria to prevent mitochondrial DNA leak and suppress sterile inflammation in
the myocardium. In this proposal, we will examine the role of TRAF2 and mitophagy in macrophages in
shaping myocardial homeostasis; to understand how targeting mitophagy affects cellular crosstalk in the
myocardium in homeostasis and under stress. Our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that TRAF2 plays
an essential role in macrophages by facilitating macrophage mitophagy and generation of 25-
hydroxycholesterol to restrain inflammasome activation, to maintain myocardial homeostasis. Indeed, our
preliminary studies demonstrate that inducible macrophage TRAF2 ablation using genetic approaches induces
cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, and increased inflammatory
cell infiltration in the myocardium. We have acquired reagents and developed collaborations to test the
hypothesis. In specific aim, we will evaluate the consequences of loss of TRAF2 in macrophages on
inflammatory signaling. In specific aim 2, we will evaluate the consequences of loss of TRAF2 in macrophages
on cardiac myocyte mitophagy, and perform mechanistic studies to understand the role of cardiac myocyte
mitophagy in the observed phenotype. In aim 3, we will define the role of 25-hydroxycholesterol generation in
macrophage-myocyte crosstalk in the myocardium. Successful completion of these studies will define
subcellular mechanisms of macrophage-myocyte crosstalk in the myocardium. Harnessing macrophage
mitophagy and oxysterol signaling has the potential to mitigate inflammation and treat ischemic
cardiomyopathy that contributes to 2/3rds of all heart failure case burden."

10910239,"Abstract
 During development, cochlear hair cells (HCs) and neurons must be wired correctly, qualitatively, and
quantitatively. These include specific auditory afferent neurons (AN) wired to the brainstem cochlear nuclei (CN).
The activity of HCs maintains the number, size, and functions of ANs. Previous studies suggest that aging may
result in preferential loss of specific AN subtypes.
 We hypothesize that ARHL arises from a loss of ultrafast afferent responses, accompanied by remodeling of
central auditory circuits and functions—changes that result in deficiencies in phase-locked response functions
in older adults.
 We propose to examine age-related changes in distinct AN using three knockin mouse models: calretinin
(Calb2)-eGFP, calbindin (Calb1)-mCherry, Pou4f1 and (brn3a)-CFP, and optogenetic and pharmacogenetic
mouse models. The work will focus on longitudinal changes in:
 1) structural (anatomic) projections from HCs to the brainstem nuclei (CN),
 2) afferent neuron subtype distributions and functions, and
 3) Identify the age dependence of ionic conductances in AN afferents
Aim 1 will trace afferent neuron subtype-specific projections from the cochlea to the CN and determine the age-
dependent changes to identify potential anatomic plasticity. We will measure age-dependent auditory function,
auditory brainstem responses (ABR), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). We will evaluate
and perform these studies in parallel with changes in age-related auditory phenotype. For Aim 2, we will
determine regional and afferent neuron subtype variations in the response properties and the age-dependent
changes. We will evaluate the regularity of inter-spike intervals, synchronization parameters, including vector
strength (VS), winding ratio (k), and sensitivity to current injection, using experimental and physiological
stimulation. Finally, for Aim 3, we will identify the age dependence of ionic conductances in three groups of
afferent neurons. We will use patch-clamp analyses of the kinetics, voltage-dependence, pharmacology, and
conductance in young and aged neurons to determine the underlying mechanisms for the differences in response
properties of three neuronal subtypes, using computational analyses.
Thus, we will address the complexity of anatomic projections and signal processing and subsequent age-
dependent changes, which are necessary for developing a treatment for ARHL."

 Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is one of the most prevalent health conditions in the elderly. Structural
degradation and functional decline in the peripheral and central auditory systems underlie the gradual loss of
perception with age. In particular, recent findings suggest that preferential damage of selective subtypes of spiral
ganglion neurons (SGNs) precedes overt hearing loss. It remains unclear how age-related SGN changes link to
structural and physiological alterations in the central auditory system in contributing to the development of ARHL.
The cochlear nucleus (CN) is the only target for all SGNs and represents the starting site of central auditory
processing. This role emphasizes that understanding changes in structure and function of the CN during aging
is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of ARHL. Our overall hypothesis is that age-dependent changes in the
cochlea results in alterations in the CN circuit that impact the signal processing of the entire central auditory
system. This study of the CN aims to identify age-related plastic alterations in auditory nerve (AN) synapses and
their excitatory and inhibitory CN targets to determine the synaptic and cellular mechanisms of ARHL in the CN.
Aim 1 will determine the age-dependent changes in the physiology and morphology of different subtypes
of AN synapses during ARHL. We will combine electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to identify three
subtypes of AN synapses based on the expression of different SGN molecular markers and determine these
synapses' electrophysiological property and morphological features in acute CN slices from different age groups
of genetically modified mice. Aim 2 will identify the age-related changes in the physiology and cellular
morphology of CN principal neurons during ARHL. We hypothesize that CN principal bushy neurons with
different subtypes of AN synaptic input are differentially modified with age in physiology and morphology,
resulting in compromised spike output during ARHL. We will determine the age-related changes among different
bushy neurons in intrinsic properties, spike output, potassium conductances, and cellular morphology in
conjunction with specific subtypes of AN input they receive. Aim3 will elucidate the mechanisms of weakened
inhibition in the CN during ARHL. We will test the hypothesis that inhibitory D-stellate neurons are innervated
mainly by low spontaneous rate/high threshold SGNs whose selective loss with age results in reduced output
and weakened inhibition in the CN. This mechanism of inhibition will be further tested by ablating specific SGN
subtypes in pharmacogenetic mice at different ages. Our studies will identify age-related changes in the CN
circuit, and in conjunction with selective alterations of SGN subtypes (Project 1), to determine the affected AN
synapses and their impact on the output of CN principal and local inhibitory neurons."
10910249,"Abstract
Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also referred to as presbycusis, is a complex degenerative disease
characterized by hearing impairment. The condition is a significant public health problem, affecting 40% of
individuals aged between 55 and 74. ARHL is attributed to central and peripheral auditory system degeneration.
Central ARHL refers to age-associated degeneration in the auditory portion of the central nervous system, which
affects the ability to localize the temporal and spatial origins of sounds and impairs speech understanding in
noisy environments. However, studies so far have not fully elucidated the cellular mechanisms underlying deficits
to temporal precision of sound localization and speech understanding in aging. In Aim 1, we will determine the
age-dependent structural and molecular remodeling of central auditory synapses. We hypothesize that
aging alters key structural and molecular parameters at the central synapses. As a result, the endbulb and calyx
of Held synapses exhibit decreased activity. Studies in Aim 2 will determine the age-dependent structural
and molecular remodeling of central nerve axonal fibers. We hypothesize that age-related deficits in myelin
and internode distance along the auditory nerve and calyx axonal fibers will decrease conduction velocity (CV)
and degrade synaptic activity. In addition, another most notable change in ARHL is an increase in neuronal
excitability. The degradation of input at the auditory neural axis periphery shifts the balance of excitation and
inhibition throughout the auditory hierarchy, including the cochlear nucleus (CN), superior olivary complex (SOC),
and auditory cortex (ACtx). It leads to altered neuronal excitability and auditory dysfunctions, including tinnitus
and hyperacusis. Although altered neuronal excitability (“hypo-” or “hyper”-excitability) has been found in several
brain stations in the ascending auditory hierarchy, its presence in descending systems is less understood. We
hypothesize that the mechanism of altered age-related neuronal excitability in the ACtx stems from modified CN
and SOC pre- and post-synaptic properties, as well as neuronal demyelination. In Aim 3, we will identify
structural changes in pyramidal tract (PT) projection pathways in the aging brain. We hypothesize that
aging incurs structural plasticity in PT projection neurons' downstream targets. Studies in Aim 4 will determine
sensory processing deficits in PT projection pathways in the aging brain. We hypothesize that altered
excitability in the aged auditory system systematically degrades the spectrotemporal processing of sound. The
overall goal in this project (P3) is to understand the age-dependent structural and molecular remodeling of central
auditory synapses and central nerve axonal fibers, as well as providing novel insights into how aging influences
structural plasticity throughout the auditory system and how connectivity with downstream brain areas are altered
in aging."
10913425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic bone aging disease, mainly influenced by cells in the lineages of
osteoblast (for bone formation) and osteoclast (for bone resorption). It is commonly characterized by low bone mineral
density (BMD) with osteoporotic fractures (OFs) as the clinical end outcome. Both BMD and OFs have strong, but
only share ~50% of their, (epi-)genetic determinations (some being sex-/ethnic-specific). The gut microbiome has a
profound impact on human health, yet specific human genome and gut microbiome (epi-)genetic factors, and
particularly their functional mechanisms for BMD and OF risk, are largely unknown.
Our Overall Objective is to comprehensively identify/characterize in vivo, in humans (epi-)genes/gut bacterial
species/environmental factors and their functional interactions/mechanisms/mediators for sex-/ethnic-general/specific
osteoporosis risk. To do so, we will investigate the human genome and gut microbiome, for their impacts via cells and
cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in both osteoclastogenic and osteoblastogenic lineages.
Based on the solid progress made on our current U19 (AG055373) and leveraging the resources accumulated through
other support (e.g., Louisiana Osteoporosis Study; LOS), we propose to fulfill the following Specific Aims:
1) Pioneer a comprehensive and highly innovative project to identify osteoporosis risk (epi-)genes in vivo
simultaneously with human genome/gut microbiome (Proj 1), epigenome and single-cell transcriptome of
osteoblast/osteoclast lineage cells (Proj 2), and metabolome (Proj 3), while assessing age/sex/ethnicity-
specificity/generality of the identified molecular features (Proj 1-3). We will study BMD (both areal & volumetric–aBMD
& vBMD), bone strength/quality (by finite element analyses – FEA and trabecular bone score - TBS), and OF.
2) Leverage the omics profiles to be generated in this U19 renewal and those accumulated in the ongoing U19 and
LOS to impute (in Proj 2 & 3) to the full dataset all the omics features studied (in >5,600 subjects).
3) Efficiently/innovatively generate/integrate trans-omics interaction networks (Proj 1-3 & Core C), making causal
inference to re-construct functional gene regulatory networks (GRN) within and across cells (for CCIs) and across our
genome and gut microbiome. We will test these re-constructed GRNs to illuminate their functional significance and
mechanisms for osteoporosis from the aspects of osteoblasto- and osteoclasto-genic lineages in vivo in humans.
4) Pursue in-depth follow-up functional studies (Proj 1 & 3) for specific molecular mechanisms and confirmation of
the identified novel molecules, gut bacterial species, functions, and pathways.
This U19 will include three Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics) to efficiently support the
necessary synergy among projects for the above analyses that all address age/sex/ethnicity-specific/general effects.
This project promises to break new ground not only for its highly innovative approach and comprehensiveness but
also for serving as a pioneering example that will stimulate similar next-generation human omics studies of bone and
other complex diseases. The various omics data accumulated will also be an invaluable public resource."
10829795,"Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are a form of mild traumatic brain injury that can lead to severe cognitive and
behavioral symptoms and the progressive neurodegeneration of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
Trauma is also a known risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), and we hypothesize that a prolonged period of
RHI can play a causative role in the development of AD as well as CTE. In addition, cerebrovascular disease is
a well-known contributor to cognitive impairment; however, the role of vascular changes in the development of
CTE and AD pathology are not well understood. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and
perfusion of the brain. Compliance of large cerebral arteries allows these arteries to dampen the pulsatile
pressure and protect the microcirculation and blood brain barrier from damage. Thus, cerebrovascular
dysfunction can have detrimental impacts on the brain, including increased susceptibility to pulse pressure,
blood brain barrier breakdown and ineffective clearance of tau pathology, beta-amyloid, and other toxic
metabolites. The overall goal of this project is to determine whether RHI is associated with
cerebrovascular remodeling and the progression of CTE and compare to the role of cerebrovascular
remodeling in AD.
Building upon our multidisciplinary expertise in vascular mechanobiology, precision mass spectrometry,
advanced optical imaging, immunohistochemistry, vascular biology and neuropathology of CTE and AD, we
will test this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) to determine cerebrovascular remodeling (biomechanical,
structural, and compositional changes) in the frontal lobe in CTE; Aim 2) to determine the association between
cerebrovascular remodeling and CTE and AD pathological changes; and Aim 3) to examine the association
between cerebrovascular remodeling and RHI history and antemortem cognitive status. We will use no or low
atherosclerotic cerebrovascular and brain tissue from 80 age- and sex-matched brain donors from the NIH and
VA-funded BU Alzheimer Disease & CTE Research Center with 1) no RHI history and no pathology, 2) RHI
history with no CTE, 3) low CTE pathology, and 4) high CTE pathology. These brain donors have undergone
medical review and informants are given extensive structured interview/questionnaires using modified
questions from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS), including
postmortem assessments of cognitive functioning (including memory, language, attention, executive function
and visuospatial function).
This proposal is designed to leverage existing resources to make new discoveries. The matched and parallel
studies of cerebral vessels and brain tissue will provide new understandings of the temporal development of
cerebrovascular remodeling in CTE. Understanding the role of vascular remodeling in CTE may lead to the
discovery of new treatment options and directions for interventions to stave off cognitive impairment in our
military Veterans."
10899732,"PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly 6 million Americans and
is expected to increase over the next several years. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms that trigger
the emergence of AD has contributed to the lack of interventions that stop, prevent, or fully treat this disease.
We propose to establish the marmoset as the first primate-specific model to reveal the earliest cellular and
molecular events of AD processes and allow charting AD progression from its inception. To do so, we will draw
from a self-sufficient and large colony of research marmosets with dedicated veterinary and husbandry teams,
state-of-the-art in vivo neuroimaging and molecular assays, and a multidisciplinary team of experts in aging
biology, AD genetics and genomics, animal model development and characterization, behavioral and cognitive
phenotyping, and marmoset gene-editing technologies. Our proposal’s overarching goals are to develop
marmoset models of early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) to enable the investigation of the
underlying cellular and molecular root causes of the pathogenesis and progression of AD and support future
translational studies. We believe that the simultaneous assessment of genetic, molecular, functional, behavioral,
and pathological phenotypes in marmosets will provide translatable knowledge of the origins and progression of
AD in human populations. Furthermore, we posit that the comprehensive study of gene-edited marmoset models
of AD from neurodevelopment through aging will identify emerging phenotypes that precede frank
neuropathology. Our proposal consists of 3 integrated Research Projects that aim to: (1) Conduct
characterization and validation of PSEN1 mutations in marmosets as a model for the study of EOAD, and
investigate early life molecular determinants of AD disease pathogenesis associated with genetic risk for EOAD;
(2) Identify and enhance LOAD-related signatures in outbred and genetically-engineered marmosets; and (3)
Conduct a comparative multimodal phenotypic characterization of marmoset models of AD. These projects will
be supported by 5 Research Cores focused on project administration, bioinformatics, genetic engineering,
multimodal disease characterization, and veterinary and colony management. These supporting cores will
integrate marmoset and human genomic signatures and provide data dissemination and resources to the greater
research community as part of our commitment to open science, generate novel gene-edited marmoset models
of AD, develop optimized protocols for studying disease onset and trajectory in line with clinical protocols,
evaluate therapeutic strategies, and provide specialized animal care and support, respectively, allowing
complete characterization of the marmoset models. At the conclusion of this project, we will have genetically
engineered three AD risk variants into marmoset models, established a disease characterization pipeline for
comprehensive phenotyping, and shared these resources with the greater research community."

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and prevents this curative therapy from wider application in cancer
patients. This P01 consists of three projects and two cores and its goal is to significantly reduce GVHD
by: (1) elucidating its basic biology; (2) developing new laboratory strategies to predict its long term
outcomes; and (3) translating these insights into novel therapeutic strategies in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD is the target organ that is most resistant to steroid treatment and acute GVHD
in the GI tract accounts for the vast majority non-relapse mortality. The focus on mechanisms of damage
to the GI crypt during GVHD and enhancing its regeneration unifies all three projects during this cycle of
the P01. Project 1 investigates the key bioenergetic pathways in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that are
altered during GVHD. Preliminary data have identified a profound defect in the key mitochondrial enzyme
Succinate Dehydrogenase A (SDHA) that is specifically depleted by the T cell attack on intestinal epithelium
during GVHD. Project 1 will analyze the role of SDHA in ISCs and will also evaluate SDHA expression in
human GI biopsies in a collaboration study with Project 2. Project 2 also explores the regeneration of
crypts by ISCs during GVHD, focusing on the key enzyme receptor-interacting protein kinase I (RIPK1)
that controls the inflammatory cell death pathway. A collaboration with Genentech leverages their deep
expertise in this field to explore RIPK1 biology in animal models and human samples. Project 2 shares a
subaim with Project 1 to investigate the interactions of SDHA with the RIPK1 pathway in ISCs during
GVHD. Project 3 translates insights from the preclinical projects into two highly innovative clinical trials.
The first trial will test a Genentech RIPK1 inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial. The second trial uses novel real-
time monitoring with serum biomarkers to identify a group of patients with minimal GI crypt damage who
can be safely treated with much lower doses of steroids. This P01 thus represents a translational
progression of exploration of GVHD biology from basic through translational models to clinical trials that
leverage multiple synergies between projects with the goal to accelerate transformative therapeutic
strategies for GVHD patients."
10883669,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the survival for other cancers improved during the last ten years, the outlook for pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains grim. The average overall 5-year survival rate for PDAC is 10.8%. The
mission of the Center for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies in Pancreatic Cancer (CDTSPC) in Phase II is
to enhance and sustain biomedical research infrastructure at North Dakota State University (NDSU) by
developing externally-funded, independent translational research of the Junior Investigators, expanding Core
Facility services, and recruiting new investigators. The Covid pandemic-related restrictions hampered our
progress in Phase I. Still, the investigators received seven nationally competitive research grants totaling $9.6
million, published more than 50 papers, and graduated 17 Ph. D. students. Two Junior Investigators and three
pilot project leaders received tenure and promotion. NDSU hired four new Assistant Professors with research
emphasis on pancreatic cancer. Two new Core Facilities were set up – Animal Studies and Biostatistics. The
two facilities served 19 COBRE and 33 other investigators. The Animal Core Facility created comprehensive
mice models for the first time on campus, including 7 patient-derived mouse models (PDX) of pancreatic cancer.
CDTSPC is the only established Facility in North Dakota with the capacity to support foundational and
translational research on pancreatic cancer. In Phase II, we will further expand the biomedical infrastructure,
emphasizing translational research and prepare for a self-sustaining Center through the following Specific Aims.
Aim 1. Provide enhanced mentoring to develop sustainable, independent, translational research projects for
Junior Investigators. The three investigators will address three urgent challenges in pancreatic cancer: targeted
drug delivery to desmoplastic tumors, synthesis and evaluation of new therapeutic agents, and determining
epigenetic-genetic alternations in patient tissues for effective treatment. Each Junior Investigator will have two
external mentors to encompass foundational and translational aspects. In addition, a clinician-scientist will serve
as the Translational Science Liaison for the Center to bridge the foundational and translational elements.
Aim 2. Augment biomedical research infrastructure of NDSU by expanding COBRE Core Facilities. We will
expand the Animal Studies Core Facility to include tissue histology, imaging modalities, establish and maintain
additional genetically engineered models, continue developing the PDX model systems, and establish a tissue
biobank of human, PDX, and mouse pancreatic cancer tissues. In addition, the Biostatistics Core Facility will
expand services to support projects using ""big data,"" bioinformatics, and machine-learning analysis.
Aim 3. Integrate the Center into the national pancreatic cancer network. We will expand collaboration with
eminent pancreatic cancer researchers in the US. We will build human capacity by hiring two new tenure track
faculty members and recruiting four new Pilot Project investigators with expertise in translational aspects of
pancreatic cancer. The Junior Investigators will compete for grants from NIH, NSF, DoD, and private foundations."

Overall Component
The Visual Sciences Research Center (VSRC) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) requests
continuing support for a P30 Core Grant for Vision Research. The VSRC was founded in 1996 and has
undergone tremendous growth since the first P30 grant award in 1997 and subsequent grant renewals in 2002,
2007, 2011, and 2016. The CWRU P30 Core Grant has enhanced and expanded individual investigators’
programs, facilitated inter-investigator and inter-departmental collaborations, and helped bring new
investigators within CWRU to the visual sciences, both junior and established. Our VSRC is now comprised of
36 PIs in 13 clinical and basic science departments from the two CWRU Schools and the CWRU College of
Arts and Sciences. These investigators conduct innovative, impactful, and interdisciplinary research on
fundamental mechanisms in the retina, causes and treatment of common retinal diseases as well as study
normal and pathologic processes in the anterior segment of the eye. Our current NEI grant portfolio is diverse
and encompasses many funding mechanisms. These include 14 eligible NEI R01s, 1 NEI UG1, 3 NEI R21s, 1
NEI T32, and 2 NEI F30 grants. In addition, our VSRC investigators hold 20 grants from other NIH Institutes.
The VSRC is strongly supported by the CWRU School of Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Case
Medical Center, and the CWRU Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, which provide significant
funds for bringing new PIs to vision research, repair and purchase equipment, service contracts, a partial
salary support of the core managers as well as on the seminar series and annual VSRC symposiums. We
request support for the 3 resource Cores: 1) Specialized Animal Resources; 2) Molecular Biology and
Genotyping; and 3) Analytical Services. All three Cores are expected to be heavily utilized and lead to
successful accomplishment of the three unifying grant’s Specific Aims: 1) to enhance the capabilities and
productivity of the eligible NEI R01 holders as well as other VSRC investigators by providing them with
services, resources and facilities that are too costly for an individual laboratory; 2) to increase scientific
interactions among the VSRC investigators by sharing resources and expertise; 3) to bring new investigators to
vision research, both junior and established."
10795637,"Hypercapnia, elevated PCO2 in blood and tissue, commonly develops in patients with severe acute and
chronic pulmonary disease. Hypercapnia is a risk factor for mortality in COPD, community-acquired pneumonia,
cystic fibrosis and adenoviral lung infection. We have shown that hypercapnia inhibits transcription of NF-κB-
regulated innate immune and host defense genes, independent of pH, in human, mouse and Drosophila cells,
and that it increases the mortality of bacterial infections in mice and Drosophila. We have also reported that
hypercapnia inhibits type I interferon (IFN) pathway antiviral gene expression in alveolar macrophages (AM) and
increases viral replication, lung injury and mortality in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV).
 Based on previous studies in which we identified the zinc finger homeobox transcription factor zfh2 as a
mediator of CO2-induced immune suppression in Drosophila, we bred a mouse lacking Zfhx3, a mammalian
ortholog of zfh2, in the myeloid lineage. Our recent studies show that myeloid Zfhx3 deficiency protects against
hypercapnia-induced suppression of antiviral genes and increased IAV growth in macrophages, and that it
reduces the hypercapnia-induced increase in mortality of IAV infection in mice. We also show that hypercapnia
increases and Zfhx3 deficiency decreases methylation of multiple genes in AM, including host genes that are
essential for IAV replication.
 Recent studies from our laboratories have established that monocyte-derived AM (MoAM) recruited to
the alveolar space in response to diverse insults, including IAV infection, are pro-inflammatory and drive lung
injury. This is in contrast to tissue resident AM (TRAM), which are protective against IAV-induced injury. Thus,
we hypothesize that hypercapnia worsens outcomes of IAV infection by suppressing antiviral genes and
increasing expression of inflammation/injury-associated genes in TRAM and MoAM, and that this results from
hypercapnia-induced alterations in methylation of regulatory regions of these genes. We further hypothesize that
genetic deficiency of Zfhx3 in macrophages mitigates hypercapnia-induced changes in DNA methylation, and
that this preserves antiviral gene expression and reduces lung injury caused by IAV in the setting of hypercapnia.
To test these hypotheses, we will determine whether hypercapnia worsens outcomes of IAV infection by
decreasing expression of antiviral genes and increasing expression of inflammation/injury-associated genes in
TRAM and MoAM in mice; whether hypercapnia-induced changes in DNA methylation cause these changes in
antiviral and inflammation/injury-associated gene expression; and whether hypercapnia is associated with similar
changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in AM from humans with severe viral pneumonia.
 This investigation will define novel mechanisms by which elevated levels of CO2 suppress antiviral host
defense, a previously-unrecognized adverse consequence of hypercapnia, and will lay the basis for future
studies aimed at preventing hypercapnia-induced immunosuppression in patients with advanced lung disease."

The long-term goal of this SPORE renewal is to develop in the laboratory, and test in the clinic novel cellular
immunotherapies mediated by genetically modified immune effector cells to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We have assembled an integrated team of laboratory scientists and clinical
investigators with strong track records of productive translational research supported by four shared core
resources. To address the persistent challenges of suboptimal long term lymphoma control and unacceptable
rates of treatment-related toxicity in lymphoma, investigators in this program have proposed three projects, each
involving early-phase clinical trials. All projects address the following five distinct lines of research: 1) Use highly
specific T or NKT cell immunotherapies to target multiple lymphoma antigens. This objective will be pursued in
each project using either native or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or both. 2) Increase the potency of the T
or NKT cell immunotherapies for lymphoma. This theme includes targeting multiple antigens (Projects 1 and
3), manufacturing changes to increase T cell fitness (Project 2) and adding a constitutive IL7 receptor to improve
the expression and persistence of Epstein Barr Virus-specific T cells (Project 3). 3) Overcome the immune
evasion tactics of lymphoma cells and their microenvironment. Project 1 will take advantage of the ability of NKT
cells to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment to boost response rates. Project 2 will use an
alloimmune defense receptor to remove alloreactive cells from the tumor microenvironment and prolong survival
of banked CAR T cells. Project 3 investigators will exploit a constitutive IL7 receptor to enable T cells to sustain
activation and expansion in the presence of immunosuppressive molecules and will also evaluate combination
therapy with Panobinostat (4) Make T and NKT cell immunotherapy more broadly applicable by using banked
normal donor cells. To make cells immediately available, we will evaluate several sources of banked cells
including banked NKT cells as an “off-the-shelf” product (Project 1), knock down of αβ TCR (Project 2) and
banked EBV specific T cells (Project 3). 5) Ensure transferred banked immune effectors are not rejected by the
host immune system. We will enable infused immune effectors to be resistant to the host immune response by;
evaluating knock down of ß2 microglobulin (B2M) to diminish MHC Class 1 expression, and of the MHC Class II
invariant chain (Project 1); adding a novel alloimmune defense receptor (Project 2); or taking advantage of the
ability of a CD30 CAR to target alloreactive T cells (Project 3). At the conclusion of these proposed studies, we
will have evaluated the clinical activity and safety of several strategies with genetically modified immune effector
cells in NHL and HL and gained insight into immune and tumor factors that correlate with clinical outcome.
Successful completion of these studies should increase the potency and improve accessibility of these cellular
immunotherapies for lymphoma."
10867257,"The goal of this renewal application is to further elucidate the mechanisms by which testosterone action on the
androgen receptor (AR) in male insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells enhances insulin secretion by amplifying
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) actions. The role of testosterone deficiency as a cause of pancreatic β–cell
dysfunction predisposing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in men is poorly studied. While it is established that
testosterone action is mediated via the AR, a ligand-activated transcription factor, the role of the AR in β-cell
function is still poorly understood. Funded by this Merit Award I01BX003725, the new and recently published
far-reaching preliminary data from our laboratory investigating the role of the AR in β-cell function provides the
following information: 1) male mice with conditional deletion of the AR in β-cells (βARKO) exhibit decreased
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and develop β-cell failure to produce enough insulin, leading to
T2D; 2) the insulinotropic function of AR is recapitulated in islets from male human donors that have the
enzymatic machinery to convert circulating testosterone to the potent AR agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT);
3) DHT activates an extranuclear AR in mouse and human β-cells that enhances GSIS by amplifying the
actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on the GLP-1 receptor, increasing cAMP production at the plasma
membrane and endosomes; 4) DHT selectively enhances GLP-1-mediated cAMP production and GSIS but not
that of glucose-insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) or glucagon (GCN); 5) DHT amplification of GSIS from islets
requires the tyrosine kinase SRC, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), and the activities
of transmembrane (tmAC) and soluble (sAC) adenylate cyclases. Based on this extensive preliminary data and
the scientific rigor of previous research presented in the application, our overarching hypothesis is that in male
β-cells, DHT action on AR in the vicinity of the plasma membrane binds SRC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), thus recruiting mTORC2 and increasing the activities of tmAC and sAC at the plasma membrane and
endosomes. This enhances GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) production of cAMP and GSIS. DHT-activated AR is
selectively biased toward the GLP-1R, because AR and GLP-1R uniquely converge on mTORC2 signaling to
activate tmAC and sAC to produce cAMP in similar microdomains. The proposed work uses genetic,
physiological and pharmacological tools in genetically modified mice, as well as in human islets and β-cells.
This work is particularly relevant against to the aging and androgen-deficient male Veterans and the T2D
epidemic, because the AR is a well-characterized drug target. The goal of the work proposed in this application
is to elucidate the molecular bases by which DHT-activated AR stimulates cAMP production and enhances
GLP-1 signaling at the plasma membrane and endosomes to increase insulin secretion in males. Accordingly,
the specific aims of this application are to 1) Test the hypothesis that AR activation in human β cells enhances
GLP-1 insulinotropic action following docking to SRC, recruitment of mTORC2, and activation of tmAC and
sAC, which increases cAMP production at the plasma membrane and endosomes; 2) Unmask novel androgen
actions on insulin secretion by mapping the AR interactome and functional signaling network in human β cells;
3) Translate the findings of androgen stimulation of insulin secretion in vivo in mice using an androgen
dendrimer conjugate that selectively activates AR membrane/extranuclear actions. The proposed work will fill
key gaps in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of b-cell function and will have a lasting
scientific impact and open clinically relevant avenues for androgen-deficient male Veterans with diabetes."

The Cardiac Physiology and Imaging Core (Core C) will provide service to all 4 projects with the goals of
generating functional and structural analyses of human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-
CMs; Aim 1) and the adult mouse heart (Aim 2). Specifically, assays utilized in Aim 1 will provide high quality
unbiased assessment of hESC-CM structure and function. Core C’s services enhance the efficiency of the
Projects by providing consistent expertise in the functional and structural evaluation of hESC-CMs using a
variety of complementary techniques. These include confocal fluorescence microscopy for structural evaluation
as well as cytosolic [Ca2+] and membrane voltage imaging, an electrode array system for multicellular
electrophysiological and contractile assessment, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for ultrastructural
analyses, the patch-clamp technique for single hESC-CM electrophysiological measurements, and in situ
hybridization (RNAscope) for evaluation of spatial gene expression patterns. Project 1 benefits from Core C in
the analyses of gene expression at the single cell level. Projects 2 and 3 benefit from Core C in the quantitative
assessment of electrical and contractile properties of hESC-CMs. All Projects benefit from the quantitative
analysis of sarcomeric organization, polarity and shape of hESC-CMs. Techniques to be used in Aim 2 will
provide high quality unbiased functional and structural assessment of the adult mouse heart. Core C’s services
include ultra-high frequency ultrasound of mice, surface ECG in anesthetized mice, telemetric ECG monitoring
of conscious mice, optical voltage / calcium mapping of isolated mouse hearts, and quantitation of
cardiomyocyte S-phase activity using a custom-built imaging system. The Core will generate high-resolution
ultrasound images in Projects 3 in order to provide quantitative data of structure, function, and flow relative to
genetic alterations in cardiac development. ECG and voltage / calcium mapping will provide quantitation of
cardiac electrical function in Projects 2 and 3. Quantitation of cardiomyocyte S-phase activity will aid in
assessing effects of proposed genetic alterations on cardiomyocyte proliferation in all Projects."

Despite an increasingly sophisticated understanding of cardiac development, the mechanisms underlying the
causes, penetrance, and phenotypic diversity of congenital heart defects (CHDs), the most common birth defect,
are not well understood. This represents a barrier to risk stratification, improved therapeutics, and prevention of
CHD. We have studied the genetic and developmental basis of heterotaxy syndrome, a multisystem disorder
with a spectrum of CHDs that are attributable, at least in part, to abnormal cardiac looping morphogenesis.
Although it has been proven that abnormalities in left-right (LR) axis formation during early embryonic
development lead to CHDs in heterotaxy, the ventricular chamber morphogenic defects encountered are more
diverse than would be expected from simple disruption of the LR axis. We hypothesize that severe heterotaxy
CHDs result from abnormal cell fate of cardiac progenitors and that this is a distinct CHD causing mechanism
from later LR patterning-mediated CHDs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from a mouse model of X-
linked heterotaxy, Zic3 null mice, supports this hypothesis. The data demonstrate an abnormal mesoderm versus
neuroectoderm allocation prior to cardiogenesis that results in abnormal cardiomyocyte cell fate. Combined with
our data on abnormal primitive streak formation in Zic3 null mice, these studies reveal an essential need to
investigate the ZIC3 gene regulatory networks (GRNs) during the transition from cell pluripotency through LR
patterning to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of a diverse set CHDs. We will pair this investigation
with our expertise in genomic analyses and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in our well-phenotyped
cohort of heterotaxy CHD patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased rare variant burden in CHD
candidate genes, suggesting that complex CHD can result from combinatorial interactions of multiple
susceptibility alleles. This approach will be used to test candidate genes for monogenic and oligogenic disease
association. The aims of this study are to: 1) test the hypothesis that integrating ZIC3 DNA-occupancy data with
transcriptional and epigenetic changes caused by ZIC3 loss-of-function will identify novel GRNs for cardiac
morphogenesis; and 2) test the hypothesis that genetic variation within the ZIC3 GRN is associated with CHD.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that ZIC3 regulatory network genes are risk factors for ventricular
morphogenesis defects that result in CHD. By identifying ZIC3 pathways during transition states from gastrulation
to cardiogenesis, we will discover distinct ZIC3 GRNs required for heart formation. The integration of this
multiomics data will provide novel insight into cardiac progenitor cell specification. Investigating the importance
of these ZIC3 GRNs and developmental-stage specific pathways to human CHD susceptibility will provide critical
translational information. Collectively, we will have identified novel ZIC3 GRNs important for chamber
morphogenesis and provided essential information on monogenic and oligogenic contributions of pathways
regulating cardiac cell fate to the development of human heterotaxy CHDs."
10755286,"ABSTRACT
 Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Among various CHDs, single ventricle
phenotypes resulting from altered ventricular morphogenesis have the poorest clinical prognoses. CHDs that
present with defective ventricular morphogenesis allow for the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
via ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and/or impaired contractile function both of which put limits on vitality.
Currently, there is a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular etiology causative of the many
forms of ventricular CHDs.
 Hand1 is expressed within the developing left ventricle (LV) myocardium and the myocardial cuff (MC)
between embryonic day (E) E8.5 and E13.5. HAND1 is established as required for normal LV and cardiac
conduction system morphogenesis. Cardiomyocyte deletion of Hand1 results in surviving mice that present with
CHDs effecting LV morphology and cardiac function. HAND1 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been
identified in patients diagnosed with QRS conduction defects. These HAND1 polymorphisms reside within an
evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer, and act by disrupting GATA factor DNA binding. Hand1 gene
expression is downregulated by the loss-of function of chromatin organizing protein CTCF within cardiomyocytes.
Our preliminary data show that HAND1 is organized into a single topologically active domain (TAD) that isolates
Hand1 from other genes within the TAD loop concurrent with its expression. Further examination of the epigenic
regulation of the HAND1 locus is needed to elucidate how chromatin organization modulates the expression of
critical morphogenetic transcription networks within LV cardiomyocytes. In other studies, we will determine
HAND1 DNA occupancy within the genome, evaluate the changes in cardiomyocyte expression within occupied
genes, and identify key transcriptional partners that interact with HAND1 to facilitate its role in ventricular
morphogenesis.
RELEVANCE
 CHDs resulting in ventricle phenotypes have the poorest clinical outcomes. Thus, gaining a better
understanding of the etiology and molecular mechanisms that cause CHDs resulting in altered ventricular
morphogenesis has the potential to benefit thousands of pediatric patients annually. As HAND1 plays a key role
in cardiomyocyte patterning, gaining insight into the cellular and molecular mechanism of this understudied
developmental process is critical for informing the development of non-surgical treatments for CHD patients."
10486403,"Project Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United
States. Prostate cancer treatment options fare historically based on clinical stage, prostate specific antigen
(PSA) blood test, and tumor grade. Recent advances in molecular research have shown that a common finding
in high-risk cancers prostate cancers that are surgically removed is loss of the phosphatase and tensin
homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene, which leads to increased activity of the AKT signaling pathway.
PTEN loss is associated with higher rates of prostate cancer recurrence, metastasis, and cancer mortality. Pre-
clinical laboratory research has shown a reciprocal feedback regulation between the PTEN/AKT signaling axis
and the Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling axis. Manipulation of androgens and AR have been the focus of
prostate cancer systemic therapy for decades; however, PTEN loss is a lead mechanism for prostate cancer
resistance to AR directed therapy and development of castrate resistant prostate cancer.
Project Objectives: This study will change standard localized treatment (radical prostatectomy alone) by
conducting a single arm Phase II trial combining intensified androgen deprivation (abiraterone and leuprolide)
with an AKT inhibitor (capivasertib) prior to radical prostatectomy among high risk localized prostate cancers
with PTEN loss. The goal is that early precision treatment of aggressive disease will result minimal residual
cancer at the time of prostatectomy, and subsequently improved cancer outcomes. The response will be
compared to a historical control of neoadjuvant intensified androgen deprivation alone.
Project Methods This is an integral biomarker (biomarker required) treatment trial with integrated biomarker
discovery for mechanisms of resistance and response to therapy. Specific Aim1: Conduct a single arm phase
II study to determine efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant capivasertib combined with androgen receptor
pathway therapy (leuprolide + abiraterone) prior to radical prostatectomy among high risk localized PCa with
PTEN loss. The protocol will include an ADT+ abiraterone run-in (4 weeks) and addition of AKT inhibitor
therapy (16 weeks) prior to radical prostatectomy. Specific Aim 2: To investigate molecular signatures of
response and adaptive mechanisms of resistance to combined AKT and AR pathway therapies. Aim 2.1 We
will interrogate novel mechanisms of resistance and response using `omics profiles and molecular imaging
through integrated approaches. On treatment biopsy after abiraterone run-in and prostatectomy tissue will be
used to identify tumor adaptation and targetable mechanisms of resistance to therapies. Aim 2.2 Determine
the impact of ERG activation on resistance to therapy. We hypothesize that ERG activation will be associated
with lower response rates, and persistent activation of AR target genes. The results of the study will have
immediate implications for the feasibility of precision oncology trials in non-metastatic PCa, and pending safety
and efficacy results we plan to development a phase III trial. Furthermore, knowledge of adaptive mechanisms
of resistance will lead to improved development and implementation of targeted therapies in PCa."
10721824,"Project Summary/Abstract
Regardless of family history, site of onset, and sequence of symptoms and progression, all Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) patients lose muscle mass as the motor neurons that connect to muscle in limbs to control
movement stop working and eventually die. However, there appears to be an extensive delay between initial
neuronal dysfunction and physical degeneration. The complex nervous system is maintained, in part, due to cell
resiliency to stress in order to maintain function and resist activating cell death processes. Experiments in this
proposal will investigate a novel hypothesis: neurons in ALS enter cellular senescence as part of a complicated
stress response to avoid active degeneration and cell death. Nonetheless, while this protective mechanism may
preserve the physical presence of the cell, senescent cell dysfunction and potentially toxic secretome promotes
chronic tissue degeneration over time that facilitates disease progression. Senescence is activated by protein
accumulation in other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we will determine whether TDP43 deposition
differentially affects the cellular senescence stress response by evaluating postmortem human brain and spinal
cord from veteran donors, accessed through the VA ALS Biorepository Brain Bank, with either TDP43 positive
or negative neuropathology. To comprehensively investigate neurons and their environment we will utilize
GeoMx digital spatial profiling technology. This high resolution, high-content non-destructive analytical method
enables the investigation of 100s of proteins at the single cell level while maintaining spatial resolution. This
affords the ability to map the data back to the tissue to correlate protein expression differences with cell
morphology, location in the tissue, extracellular environment and proximity to vascular and / or other pathologies.
The data generated by our research proposal will provided an unprecedented rigor for depth of information on
cellular stress in ALS spinal cord and brain. The rich dataset generated through these experiments will open
many novel avenues of investigation in ALS and potentially unveil cellular senescence as a new therapeutic
target. This is an area desperately in need of development as the majority of ALS patients die, on average, 2-4
years after diagnosis."
10910238,"Abstract
Complex biological processes like auditory neural aging are composed of dynamic changes in individual neurons'
biochemistry, with various aging process susceptibilities. Direct measures of a single auditory neuron (spiral
ganglion neuron (SGN) and cochlear nuclei (CN) neuron subtypes) and their age-related alterations are needed
to characterize cellular transitions, regulatory mechanisms, and the microenvironment's contribution to age-
related hearing loss (ARHL). A critical unmet need is determining the biochemical makeup of healthy and aged
SGNs with single-cell resolution and a depth of coverage extending to thousands of biomolecules. Proteins
mediate the bulk of cellular function, and the correlation between RNA and protein abundance is often lacking,
and the proteome largely determines cellular structure and function. We hypothesize that the aging SGN
undergoes a profound proteomic dynamic that is neuron subtype-specific.
The aims of Core D are:
1. To refine liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics platform for sensitive and
 high-throughput SGN proteomics.
2. To apply the improved platform to study aging-related proteome regulations for SGN and CN subtypes and
 at single-cell resolution.
The proposed effort will result in a processing and analysis platform capable of direct and unbiased profiling of
SGNs and CN neurons with a depth of coverage of >3000 proteins/cell, thus providing a capability for direct
protein measurement analogous to single-cell RNA-seq. Core D serves as a resource to identify ARHL
biomarkers for Projects 1-3 to test and perform functional analyses. Outcomes will produce unbiased and in-
depth single-cell protein profiles of SGNs and CN to provide a complete picture and identify protein biomarkers
associated with ARHL."
10721826,"The long-term goal of our research program is to develop safe and effective therapies for traumatic brain
injury (TBI), which is a major health issue with our military personnel in combat. The prevalence of TBI
from all causes is estimated at ~2.5 to 3.7 million cases in the USA alone. Currently, there are no FDA-
approved drugs available to treat TBI. While TBI illness ranges from mild to severe, moderate TBI is
clinically most relevant, and If not treated immediately the secondary injury in these patients could spread
quickly and may lead to long-term consequences including cognitive and memory loss. Mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has emerged as one of the major approaches to treat TBI. However,
the viability of sole MSC therapy is being debated due to the uncertainty of variable engraftment in
inflammatory state. Hence, there is a genuine unmet need to discover and develop new therapeutic
agents for all forms of TBI, especially moderate TBI.
 It has been reported that adding an anti-inflammatory agent prior to MSC treatment increased the
latter’s efficacy. During the last funding period, we have established an experimental mouse model to
enable characterization of the consequences of repeated TBI (rTBI) in closed head injury, which shows
extensive neuropathologic changes associated with the cognitive deficit, consistent with human TBI. We
made the striking discovery that the expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) (MIP3α)
is pivotal to inflammation in TBI, implicating CCL20 as a potential TBI drug target. We have
demonstrated that CCL20 inhibitor, pioglitazone (PG), played a key role in reducing astrogliosis,
microglial activation and inflammasome activation in TBI. A combination of PG and hMSC treatment
not only reduced inflammation but also improved behavioral outcomes by increasing the expression
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Because PG is not a specific CCL20 inhibitor and may
have off-target effects, we have established and validated a nanoformulation of short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) plasmids encoding CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 using dendrimer. A combination treatment
involving shCCL20/shCCR6 (shCombo) and human MSC (hMSC) showed a significant reduction in
inflammation, a concomitant increase in BDNF and neurogenesis in rTBI mouse model.
 Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the shCombo dendriplex (DPX) or/and
hMSC combination regimen will attenuate both acute brain- and systemic-inflammation by
decreasing activation of glial cells and astrocytes in the brain, and secreting trophic factors over a
prolonged period, which in turn promotes neuronal remodeling in the damaged brain and provides
sustained relief from TBI-induced pathology. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. In
Aim #1, we will determine the optimal dose of pshCombo-DPX and the therapeutic window of treatment
in rTBI mice. In Aim #2 we will examine the short-term and long-term effects of shCombo-DPX or/and
hMSC therapy on pathophysiology and behavioral deficits in rTBI mice. In Aim #3, we will determine
the mechanism of action of CCL20 in rTBI-induced pathogenesis and behavioral deficits.
 This highly innovative proposal aims to investigate whether shCombo-DPX as a single agent or
in combination with hMSC will reduce acute brain- and systemic-inflammation and behavioral deficits,
and plans to address the mechanism of action and surrogate markers of efficacy based on genes induced
during acute inflammation. The proposed translational research based on a rationally designed better
anti-inflammatory therapy is expected to increase our understanding of the long-term outcome of the
therapy for mild to moderate TBI and pave the way for future clinical translation."
10726489,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Each year approximately 12,000 Veterans develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and initiate dialysis
treatment. These patients comprise >10% of the US incident ESRD population. Dialysis is costly and
associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and high mortality risk, particularly in the first
dialysis year. The current paradigm is to start treatment with full-dose thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD)
irrespective of patients' residual kidney function (RKF), and this abrupt transition increases patients' and care-
partners' burden and suffering and may limit their preferences. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that
Veterans who receive dialysis in a VA center have greater survival compared to those treated in non-VA units.
 Although not currently the standard of care, evidence suggests that a gradual or incremental dialysis
transition using an initial twice-weekly HD schedule may confer substantial benefits including more dialysis-
free time, longer RKF preservation, vascular access longevity, less intradialytic hypotension and end-organ
damage, reduced post-dialysis fatigue, and less patient suffering. Hence, an incremental dialysis transition
may result in improved HRQOL through improved physical function, less fatigue, greater energy, and
improved patient satisfaction and life participation by mitigating the burden of excessive dialysis in daily life.
Pragmatic studies with immediate clinical impact are urgently needed to shift the focus of dialysis from an
abrupt thrice-weekly HD start to a safe and effective personalized dialysis regimen. Moreover, implementing a
twice-weekly HD schedule would allow 20% more Veterans to receive care within a VA-based dialysis unit.
 In the spirit of RFA CX-21-006 for clinical trials, in this multiple-PI, multi-site, pragmatic, 1:1 randomized
controlled trial (RCT), parallel with Veterans' routine dialysis therapy, we will test the safety and efficacy of an
incremental twice-weekly HD protocol, compared to standard-of-care thrice-weekly HD, in Veterans who meet
predefined eligibility criteria. We plan to compare twice-weekly (incremental) with thrice-weekly (conventional)
HD initiation in 252 Veterans with incident ESRD, who will transition to maintenance HD therapy in six VA
centers. Using quarterly assessments for up to 12 months, we will examine the Short Form 36 (SF36) HRQOL
physical component score as the primary outcome, as well as Dialysis Symptom Index and SF36 energy/
fatigue score as secondary endpoints. Additional secondary outcomes will include preservation of RKF,
dialysis adequacy, nutritional status, and protein-energy wasting markers to be measured quarterly. Safety
assessments will include mortality, dialysis withdrawals, emergency room visits, hospitalizations,
hyperkalemia, and major adverse cardiovascular events. In a substudy examining exploratory outcomes in
112 Veterans from three VA centers in the parent trial, we will also examine of cardiac measures including left
ventricular mass, as well as nutritional/physical function indices of muscle mass and physical performance.
 Our proposed pragmatic RCT addresses a major unmet need in Veterans with incident ESRD initiating
dialysis by focusing on improving HRQOL and preserving RKF, the two strongest predictors of survival and
patient satisfaction. The results of this study may enable more Veterans to receive therapy in a VA based
dialysis center. Our study may lead to a paradigm shift with immediate impact on kidney care in Veterans and
in the broader ESRD population. The pragmatic design will permit a rapid scaling-up of the interventions in
larger settings since the RCT takes advantage of resources and personnel that are readily available in VA
centers under experienced investigators and clinicians across multiple VA sites nationwide. This proposed
study challenges the current standard of care of outright thrice weekly HD in the first year of dialysis therapy,
during which patients' suffering and mortality are the highest, and is less likely to be supported by for-profit
dialysis providers given the perceived reduction in revenue if twice-weekly HD is to be implemented broadly."

10917015,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Administrative Core)
The Administrative Core of the Center (directed by Dr. Deisseroth) shoulders the complex burden of coordination
and communication across projects, cores, collaborators, and visiting scientists; manages financial,
administrative, approval, and safety issues; and oversees and implements data sharing and dissemination. For
a Center breaking technological barriers, while also teaching and training in existing technologies, and using all
of these technologies to discover new principles regarding drug action on the brain, a robust and well-integrated
Administrative Core is fundamental to rigorous, safe, stable, and effective implementation. Monthly full meetings
and weekly subgroup meetings require steady and experienced staff to coordinate. The Center by necessity also
includes substantial complexity in terms of personnel, finances, and safety. The diverse network of staff
scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, collaborators, and training activity is essential to the Center
and requires an able Administrative Core to implement, track, manage, and report. These efforts include
managing compliance and approval on human subjects research, animal protocols, safety inspections, DEA and
drug use regulations, progress reports, publication management; financial projections, reimbursements, auditing,
and accounting; and interactions with University resources that are leveraged. Finally, the greatest opportunity
of the Center—sharing of data and technology-- is also its greatest challenge. The Center web pages, wikis, and
online forum (next-generation implementations of our existing small efforts in this direction) are another high-
impact and challenging administrative element. As with the other Cores and the Projects, this Core stands in
part upon well-established human and other resources, but expands and diversifies in fundamentally new
directions under the auspices of the P50 and of NIDA. Success of the Center ultimately is measured in terms of
both the science and the outreach; the Administrative Core is absolutely crucial for both. To achieve its stated
goals in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, the Center requires an Administrative Core that provides
administrative support to all Center investigators and assists in the dissemination of reagents and findings
generated by the Center."
10917016,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Technology Core)
In the Technology Core, we develop, validate, and implement (in the real-world drug abuse-relevant setting of
the Center Projects and collaborations), next-generation technologies for studying neural circuit structure-
function relationships. We pay particular attention to integrative methods for crossing spatial scales for
observation and manipulation, from single neuron-resolution during behavior, to brainwide analysis during
behavior. The central goal is synergistic with the Training core but necessarily inverted in structure; the
technologies developed and applied here, though demonstrated in the lab and standing on firm ground, are in
earlier and unpublished stages, are equipment-intensive, and cannot at present be disseminated in the short-
course Training Core model. Instead, the Technology Core staff will guide the direct local implementation of
these new technologies for Center Aims across all research projects. In Aim 1 the Technology Core staff develop
and support next-generation hydrogel-tissue chemistry including STARmap. In Aim 2 the Technology Core staff
develop and support next-generation frame-projected independent-fiber photometry (FIP); among other
applications in the Center, FIP will be used for simultaneous recording of multiple independent axonal activity
signals representing diverse projections of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, tracking previously
inaccessible activity relationships among these circuit elements at high speed during distinct salient sensory
experiences. In Aim 3 the Technology Core staff develop and support next-generation optoencephalography
(OEG) for truly simultaneous high-speed multi-site observation of genetically-specified neural activity traffic
across the adult mammalian brain, suitable for quantifying abused-drug experience-triggered joint activity
relationships among multiple brainwide projections and cell populations. Finally in Aim 4 the Technology Core
staff develop and support next-generation ensemble optogenetics, for true cellular-resolution imaging and control
of hundreds of individual neurons within brain volumes during behavior. These tools enable investigation of
interactions between subpopulations within and across brain regions, unbiased identification of behaviorally
relevant circuit dynamics and processing hierarchies, and (in combination with optogenetic stimulation)
systematic causal analysis in abused-drug altered states."
10917019,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)
Here we implement a technology-driven approach to identify and control circuit dynamics underlying drug-
modulated behaviors, in contexts carrying reward and risk. We apply technology representing a major alignment
of opportunity for drug abuse research (optoencephalography or OEG, frame-projected independent-fiber
photometry or FIP, and hydrogel-tissue chemistry including STARmap) which allow not only observation and
control of genetically-defined circuitry, but multiple circuit elements simultaneously and independently-- before,
during and after behaviors in the drug-altered state. In Aim 1, we begin at the broadest (brainwide) scale in
awake rodents, to identify key players and principles in unbiased fashion, while maintaining circuit element-
specificity for observation and control of activity. Technologically, Aim 1 experiments will include optogenetically-
driven precise pulse patterns targeted to specific circuits and projections, as well as rapid and quantitative
assessment of brainwide activity patterns. These initial unbiased global assessments will powerfully inform and
focus more spatially-restricted investigations in Aims 2 and 3 that resolve essential features of acutely altered
states. In Aim 2 we operate at much higher spatial and temporal resolution, the next step toward detailed
elucidation of causal circuit dynamics in the acutely drug-altered state. For the same drug and behavioral
conditions in Aim 1, now quantitatively guided at the individual-animal level in terms of neuronal activity levels to
be targeted using our population and projection-specific recording and intervention capability, we play-in patterns
of population and projection activity to test causal impact on behavior. And in Aim 3, we leverage the highest-
resolution of our new methods, that achieve single-cell resolution while maintaining map-like broad perspective,
during behavior and during exposure to drugs of abuse. Interventional tests for causality will be directly guided
by these observations, and will build upon both single-cell-resolution ensemble control and deep transcriptomic
analysis of those individual cells. This precise observation and control of distinct neural circuit pathways is tightly
intertwined with the research programs described in Projects 2-4, and the Technology and Training Cores.
Together, these experiments in Project 1 will test versatile, powerful new circuit-dynamics tools for use in the
NIDA Center and for the drug abuse community more broadly, and will also apply these tools to deepen our
understanding of acute or chronically-altered drug altered states, and of the brain itself as a dynamical system."
10929376,"OVERALL PROGRAM SUMMARY
For optimal cancer therapy, combination approaches that are mechanistically complementary and directed
at non-overlapping molecular targets are needed. Strategically, combinations should be selected such that
the first treatment primes the tumor for the second treatment. Building upon our own findings and work on
photodynamic therapy (PDT) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC),
along with recent advances in immunotherapy, we hypothesize that the damage-related processes triggered
by PDT can form the basis for Photodynamic Priming (PDP) to promote an immune-based combination
therapy. PDP induces immunogenic cell death, enhances influx of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and
sensitizes the tumor microenvironment to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We will capture the PDP effect
to design a non-empiric approach for PDT-ICI combination therapy. We will be helped in this effort by our
recent innovation of hyperspectral confocal imaging that can monitor 6 biomarkers simultaneously in live
tumor bearing animals, and allow quantification of TIL subsets along with PD1/PD-L1 expression changes.
We posit that ICI will be most beneficial when immunologically “cold” tumors can first be converted to “hot”
tumors via PDP treatment, thereby minimizing the ICI dose required and reducing toxicity. Our Program has 3
Research Projects and 2 scientific Cores, plus an Administrative Core. Projects 1 and 2 are largely clinical
while Project 3 is exclusively pre-clinical, driving fundamental findings that form the basis of the hypothesis.
Project 1 introduces a double-priming strategy for the treatment of NMSC; the tumor is first treated pharmaco-
logically with 5-fluorouracil or Vitamin D to enhance PDT priming, which in turn increases the efficacy of ICI.
Project 2 focuses on PDP in pancreatic cancer patients who are unresponsive to chemotherapy. PDT is
delivered under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance, and timing of ICI delivery is informed by findings from
Project 3 and by examining subpopulations of TILs in metastatic lymph nodes in some patients. Project 3
looks in-depth at PDP induction of TILs in a PDAC murine model, and in patient-derived immune organoids
(PDIO’s). Cores are critical. Core B will assist Projects 1 and 3 with high resolution imaging in preclinical
models and PDIOs, and Core C will support all projects with dosimetry techniques to monitor tumor treatment
response, including radiomics to garner new information from CT scans in PDAC patients. We
propose t h a t new combinations o f PDT with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), if done in a rational way
that is informed by optical imaging to monitor molecular responses at the cellular level and in real time, will
reduce a major barrier to ICI therapy (the lack of effective immune cell infiltration into the tumor). Impact and
Relevance: This program positively impacts the treatment of two cancers, PDAC and NMSC, at opposite
ends of the spectrum of high mortality/morbidity and high incidence. Both cancers inflict a heavy societal
burden of cost and suffering. Findings from this work could also be translatable to other types of cancer."
10917014,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)
We describe here the vision and plan for the second five-year period of support for a NIDA Center of
Excellence, Neural circuit dynamics of drug action. This Center is dedicated to the development,
application, and dissemination of brainwide and cellular-resolution analyses of altered states elicited by
drugs of abuse. Our science will focus on identifying the causal circuit-level actions of drugs of abuse in
modulating behavior relevant to assessment of context, risk and reward. In a manner that brings together
the collaborating groups of the Center, we focus on clinically significant drugs with different molecular
profiles but shared significance for understanding behaviors and perceptions relevant to social and
nonsocial risk and reward. Specific agents employed include methamphetamine, MDMA, and ketamine,
in the setting of validated human and rodent social and nonsocial behaviors. We will develop the
brainwide technologies and engage in extensive outreach, training, and education to broaden impact,
with the NIDA IRP and beyond. The Center includes four Research Projects (1: led by Dr. Karl
Deisseroth, focusing on methamphetamine, MDMA and ketamine action in the cortex and across the
brains of mice; 2: led by Dr. Lisa Giocomo, focusing on methamphetamine and ketamine action in
entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation of mice; 3: led by Dr. Robert Malenka and Dr. Boris Heifets,
focusing on methamphetamine and MDMA action across the brain of mice; and 4: led by Dr. Leanne
Williams and Dr. Brian Knutson, focusing on human structural and functional imaging relevant to
methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and risk/reward relationships. Broad and diverse interactions
amongthese groups and external collaborators will be further enriched by the Center’s vital Training
Core for disseminating these techniques to advance drug abuse research, a Technology Core for
developing the next- generation technologies suitable for application to drug abuse research, and an
Administrative Core for orchestrating these important interactions. This approach to the NIDA Center
will allow us to capitalize on the unique strengths of our team, crossing scales from molecules and
synapses, to circuits and behavior, reaching the scope of the intact human brain as we identify relevant

In the Training Core, our central goal is education, outreach, and active support for rigorous and effective
implementation of state-of-the-art circuit analysis tools, specifically in the setting of drug of abuse research. Here
we expand upon the team’s existing training infrastructure, but move in new directions essential for the field--
specifically seeking to enable and advance the study of drug abuse and related phenomena with these methods,
and assisting others seeking to learn and apply modern circuit analysis tools to further this mission. In Aim 1 we
specifically leverage our infrastructure for advancing the application of modern optogenetic methods to drug
abuse research, including in the setting of multiunit electrophysiology and behavioral readouts in awake rodents.
Trainees directly benefiting from the Core (with no charged cost or obligation) will include (across all categories
and career stages) 1) P50 Center personnel; 2) all labs from the NIDA intramural research program (including
but not limited to collaborative groups) and leading human brain banks; and 3) researchers across the nation
and world with drug-abuse relevant basic or applied missions. Second, hydrogel-tissue chemistry (HTC) is a
technology for creating composites of biological molecules in tissue covalently linked to polymer hydrogels,
allowing removal of unlinked tissue elements to create transparency and accessibility to macromolecular labels;
the resulting new structure allows high-resolution optical access to structural and molecular detail within intact
tissues without disassembly. In Aim 2 we specifically leverage our infrastructure for advancing the application of
modern HTC including STARmap to drug abuse research, targeting the participant categories above. And third,
fiber photometry is a versatile method for collecting activity information from anatomically and/or genetically-
defined cells and projections across the brain during free behavior, in a manner designed to be exactly aligned
with optogenetic intervention via the same device and positioning in the same experimental subject. In Aim 3,
we specifically leverage our infrastructure for advancing the application of fiber photometry methods to drug
abuse research, targeting the same participant categories with drug-abuse relevant vision. The Training Core,
by disseminating versatile, powerful new circuit-dynamics tools for use in the NIDA Center and for the drug abuse
community more broadly, will advance the understanding of drug altered states, of drug abuse and recovery,
and of the brain itself as a dynamical system. This Core is tightly intertwined with the work in all projects, but we
will be alert to new opportunities for cross-fertilization certain to arise in the Center."
10914131,"Summary
Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is the major cause of late morbidity, mortality and compromised organ function
after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). It can affect essentially all organs and tissues,
including the lungs, where the disease is termed Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS). BOS is a
progressive, irreversible, and often fatal lung disease that occurs following HCT. BOS occurs in approximately
5-10% of HCT survivors and is considered the pulmonary manifestation of cGVHD. Approximately 10-15% of
cGVHD patients will develop BOS, and less than 15% of BOS patients survive 5 years. The primary site of
inflammation in BOS is the small airway, eventually leading to fibrosis. cGVHD results from a failure to achieve
immune tolerance after transplant. The mechanisms responsible for the failure of tolerance are complex
and involve multiple cell types, but T cells are central to this process. Resting T cells preferentially use
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as basal energy. In acute GVHD, donor T cells exposed to host
alloantigen in an inflammatory environment rapidly differentiate and proliferate, with bioenergetic and
biosynthetic needs fulfilled by reprogramming metabolism and using multiple energy sources. In cGVHD,
metabolism demands are less well understood, but with the high energy demands of proliferating immune cells
in cGVHD, strategies to specifically block critical metabolic pathways may prove to be a novel treatment strategy.
In this Program, we focus on the critical questions that plague the field of cGVHD. We address shortcomings in
our understanding of the pathogenesis of human cGVHD and our ability to prioritize the next generation of
therapeutic strategies by defining the immune networks that characterize patients who develop cGVHD and
interrogate the mechanisms of both success and failure of cGVHD treatment regimens. We explore the unique
metabolic demands in cGVHD pathogenesis and lung injury repair and focus therapeutics on the most severe
manifestation of cGVHD, BOS. We employ novel organoid cultures and immunogenomics to pinpoint the cellular
and antigenic targets of BOS. We have assembled a collaborative, multidisciplinary team, uniquely poised to
make significant impact in the field."
10795640,"Diseases affecting podocytes and the glomerulus, such as diabetes, are the leading cause of end stage kidney
disease (ESKD). Eleven percent of Veterans meet the established criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD),
which leads to ESKD and premature death from cardiovascular disease. The vast majority of research in the
field of CKD has focused on the initiating events and causes of CKD; unfortunately, this approach does not
represent what is seen clinically where CKD is identified after the injury occurs. Because therapeutic options
for recovery from CKD are either severely limited or non-existent, there is a critical need for novel targets and
therapeutics. The goal here is to validate a novel therapeutic target, the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR),
that we recently showed accelerates recovery of glomerular function following injury. Glomerular function is
highly dependent on specialized cells known as podocytes, which are critical components of glomeruli. While
podocyte injury is a common denominator in many glomerular diseases, there are no specific drugs that restore
injury-induced loss of podocyte structure and function. Bioinformatics analysis following injury revealed
induction of genes related to mitochondrial function. Mutations in mitochondrial genes are known to result in
mitochondrial dysfunction and have been implicated in the loss of podocyte function. Since mitochondria are
known to play a critical role in maintaining podocyte energy homeostasis, we hypothesized that podocytes
could recover from injury by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, and therapeutics that increase mitochondrial
biogenesis would promote recovery from glomerular injury. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether
stimulation of the β2-AR by an agonist would induce mitochondrial biogenesis and restore glomerular filtration
function in injured mice. Our recently published studies and preliminary data show a potent induction of
mitochondrial biogenesis in podocytes by the long-acting β2-AR agonist formoterol. Importantly, using mouse
models of podocyte injury, we demonstrated that oral and intraperitoneal administration of formoterol six hours
following injury, when glomerular dysfunction is already established, restored glomerular structures,
significantly reduced proteinuria, and accelerated recovery of glomerular function. We also show preliminary
data indicating that Veterans with CKD and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who use β2-AR
agonists, have a significantly slower decline of renal function. Since diabetes is the leading cause of CKD and
ESKD, these clinical findings are most likely due to the effect of β2-AR agonists on diabetic nephropathy.
Indeed, we have new data showing that formoterol use results in recovery from diabetic nephropathy in a
mouse model of type II diabetes. Thus, we further hypothesize that treatment with formoterol accelerates
the recovery of glomerular function following injury through the induction of podocyte mitochondrial
biogenesis. To test this, we will investigate β2-AR-dependent mechanisms that participate in podocyte
recovery by utilizing β2-AR knockout mice (β2-ARfl/fl;podocin-CreTg/+) and β2-AR-deficient podocytes derived
from these mice. This will allow us to determine the mechanism of action of formoterol and possibly identify
even more efficacious treatments (Aim 1). We will then assess the clinical value of using formoterol to
molecularly target β2-AR-induced mitochondrial biogenesis to prevent or slow podocytopathy and CKD in a
wide range of glomerular diseases, including Alport syndrome, loss of the podocyte slit diaphragm protein
CD2AP, lupus nephritis, and diabetic nephropathy, the single most common cause of CKD and ESKD (Aim
2). Finally, we will perform a large retrospective cohort study to further evaluate the association between long-
term β2-AR agonist use and decreased loss of renal function that we have identified in Veterans (Aim 3).
Successful completion of this proposal, using a multifaceted approach that includes cell culture, animal
experiments and human studies, will provide justification for a prospective randomized clinical trial to establish
β2-AR agonists, which are both safe and inexpensive, as an efficacious treatment for CKD."
10888259,"Advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders requires a robust
clinical research infrastructure and improved classification of the various disorders. The
overarching goal of the Indiana Core Center for Clinical Research (ICCCR) – the Indiana Center
for Musculoskeletal Health Clinical Research Center (ICMH-CRC) is to provide the needed
training and resources to enhance clinical research in musculoskeletal disorders to improve
musculoskeletal health across a broad range of diseases and populations. In Aim 1 we will deploy
the Administrative Core to facilitate cross disciplinary clinical research by connecting MSK
researchers with investigators studying chronic disease, enhance work with the community to
educate, inform, recruit and assess disadvantaged and minoritized populations, provide pilot
funding, and train the next generation of musculoskeletal researchers. We will innovate through
increased community engagement with racial and ethnically diverse populations to encourage
participation in MSK research. In Aim 2, we will integrate and harmonize big data from multiple
data sources in the Musculoskeletal Informatics Methodology (MIM) Core. We will develop a
facile, secure and innovative MSK Data Mart that integrates and harmonizes 1) The state-wide
“traditional” electronic health record (EHR), 2) Measures of social and structural determinants of
health based on geocoding, 3) The prospective collection of data from the FIT Core, and 4)
genomics and sample availability from the MSK Biobank. The Data Mart will expand our core
linkage and maximize MSK assessment based on the computable (computer data derived)
phenotypes developed and refined during our first P30. In Aim 3, we will foster growth of the
Musculoskeletal Function, Imaging, and Tissue (FIT) Resource Core to provide standardized
assessments of musculoskeletal health and expand the availability of biospecimens to facilitate
exploration of musculoskeletal health and disease. We will innovate our resource Core (FIT Core)
by taking the Core “on the road’ to the community health centers and organizations, diversifying
our tested population to develop race and ethnicity specific Z scores. We will also perform whole
exome sequencing on DNA collected from the participants to expand the utility of the MSK
functional (physical function), morphologic (imaging), and computable (electronic health record)
phenotypes by linking with genomic data. These goals will serve to promote and advance clinical
research in MSK disorders leading to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure for ALL
individuals."
10721821,"The impact of obesity has been well described in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with diabetes,
hypertension and even IgA nephropathy, however the basis for how obesity contributes to progressive kidney
disease is unclear. Obesity is often associated with elevated insulin levels and the state of insulin resistance at
the level of muscle and adipose tissue is accepted. The impact of elevated insulin on the kidney is less well
established. Although insulin resistance is a key contributor to podocyte injury, the role of insulin and the insulin
receptor in the proximal tubular cell has not been well studied. In our recent published study we demonstrate
that lack of the insulin receptor in proximal tubular cells of the mouse kidney was renoprotective upon challenge
with a high fat diet. We further demonstrated that insulin down-regulates the cystathione y lyase (CSE) in the
mouse kidney with concomitant inhibition of hydrogen sulfide generation and reduction of AMPK activity. The
reduced hydrogen sulfide may be a key step as addition of hydrogen sulfide restores AMPK activation despite
exposure to insulin in proximal tubular cells. In this new VA Merit proposal, in aim 1 we will examine the role of
AMPK as the major pathway that is downstream of insulin in tubular cells by examining mice that are deficient
in the insulin receptor and AMPK a1 or AMPK a2 catalytic subunits at the tubular level. With our new method of
spatial metabolomics we will determine whether key metabolites are regulated at the tubular level in the kidney
specific proximal tubular insulin receptor knockout (KPTIRKO) mouse. Identification of metabolites in the kidney,
blood and urine will indicate if a circulating biomarker could indicate engagement of the tubular IR and indicate
the status of tubular AMPK activity. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that insulin rapidly stimulates
proteasomal degradation of CSE via regulation of Nox4 activity."

10782457,"Project Summary
Human exposure to toxic heavy metals existing in drinking water, food, and the environment is an area of
increasing national and international concern. Heavy metals are significant environmental pollutants because
they tend to persist, bioaccumulate and can result in serious adverse acute or chronic health effects after
ingested or inhaled. Traditionally, trace metals are measured from human tissues or fluids (blood or urine) in
centralized laboratories using complex analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). However, in view of the intensive labor,
analytical costs and long turnaround times associated with centralized laboratory analyses, there is an immediate
need for a portable and inexpensive system for on-site monitoring of human exposure to heavy metals. These
rapid, field measurements of human exposure in the population would greatly help epidemiology researchers to
conduct their studies and also help the regulatory institutions with better determination of safety limits and
prevention of diseases caused by heavy metal exposures.
An important goal of this Direct to Phase II proposal is to develop a technology that meet the technical and
practical needs of environmental researchers, clinicians, and epidemiologists. The ultimate goal is to deliver a
reliable field prototype of a sensing instrument for the current unmet needs for rapid testing of trace amounts of
metals in urine samples, and to accelerate the commercialization of this product. In this Phase IIB study, Giner
will develop and demonstrate the heavy metals monitor prototype from bench-top assay platform to a field-ready
instrument with a portable size, with integrated components for assay operation, electronic units and software
packages for data processing and user interface. Meanwhile Giner will develop and fabricate a series of
disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip cartridge for convenient measurements of multiple metal(s) and metal
combinations from large numbers of human subjects. The various cartridge designs will allow the monitor
instrument to determine the presence and concentrations of multiple metals. The overall performances of the
prototype will then be evaluated thoroughly through a large scale of field testing with four renowned epidemiology
collaborators, as well as a team of user experience specialists, which would improve the sensing capabilities,
tool reliability and usability towards commercialization.
This proposed project will achieve a critical step towards the commercial release of a heavy metal field monitor,
which has the potential to become a critical tool to support environmental and public health community for
developing strategies to prevent toxic metals-related diseases. Giner is teaming up with leading commercial
partners which specialize in the development and commercialization of screening and diagnostic technologies."
10686905,"This RR&D CDA2 will support training for Emily M. Johnson, PhD, as a RR&D research psychologist and
develop and evaluate a new package of services, Whole Health STEPS (Structured Tiered Engagement with
Peer Support). The training goals for this project are to develop skills in (1) designing and evaluating adaptive
stepped care interventions, (2) frameworks for enhancing and evaluating implementation in patient-centered
interventions, (3) qualitative methods for enhancing stakeholder engagement and evaluating Veteran
engagement in healthcare, and (4) clinical trials design for brief psychosocial interventions. These trainings will
support my career focused on patient centered intervention and increasing Veteran engagement in healthcare
using methods prioritizing stakeholder engagement.] Whole Health STEPS is an 8-week stepped-care package
of four levels of Whole Health services facilitated by a peer support specialist. The four levels include
supported self-management (an individual Whole Health STEPS orientation session and use of a self-directed
Whole Health tool), brief telephone coaching (weekly 15-minute telephone-based coaching using focused
prompts), Whole Health Coaching (weekly hour-long sessions incorporating the full coaching framework), and
referral to a higher level of care. Across all levels, Veterans will have brief weekly telephone assessments
using the Whole Health Goal Attainment Scale to evaluate progress and inform step-up decisions. Veterans
who are not making progress at any of the given levels will be stepped-up to a higher level of care. [The
research will involve qualitative stakeholder engagement interviews with primary care peer support staff
(n=12), an open trial of Whole Health STEPS (n=10), and a pilot randomized clinical trial (n=44)] with a waitlist
control to evaluate the preliminary impact of Whole Health STEPS on reducing functional impairment. [The
design also supports further revision of the Whole Health STEPS manual] and evaluates research and
intervention feasibility. Specifically, this trial will evaluate feasibility of several aspects of Whole Health STEPS
including Veteran satisfaction, peer relationship, intervention retention, fidelity, and appropriateness of the new
elements (i.e., the step-up decision points). Further, the design will evaluate research feasibility for a
subsequent larger trial including assessment retention and participant willingness to be randomized. The
primary patient outcome will be functional impairment evaluated by the Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning.
[Stakeholders participating in the interviews will be asked to complete one research interview. Veterans in the
open trial will be asked to complete assessments at baseline, after each session, and at the end of Whole
Health STEPS.] All Veterans in the pilot RCT will be asked to complete research assessments at baseline, 2
months, and 4 months. Veterans randomized to receive Whole Health STEPS immediately will complete
Whole Health STEPS in the first two months. Veterans randomized to the waitlist control will receive Whole
Health STEPS between 2 and 4 months. Veterans will be randomized using a stratified permuted block design
based on baseline functional impairment. The primary outcome will be evaluated by calculating Cohen’s d
effect size at the 2-month assessment point and comparing with a pre-established one-sided confidence
interval using a non-central t distribution method. Other quantitative outcome measures will be evaluated with
descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals. Retention rates will be
evaluated using percent of Veterans who withdraw or drop out over time. Qualitative feedback will be
evaluated using the Rapid Assessment Process, a qualitative approach designed to provide a rapid but
comprehensive qualitative evaluation to interpret and implement changes in a short time frame using
triangulation, iterative data analysis, and additional data collection."
10706574,"ABSTRACT:
The critical role of lung endothelial cells (ECs) and the ARDS vascular endotype in ARDS pathobiology is
being dramatically highlighted in the current global COVID-19 pandemic. This highly translational PPG renewal
will address the contribution of unchecked EC permeability to the devastating multi-organ failure and mortality of
ARDS by providing a comprehensive understanding at the molecular and genomic level of vascular barrier reg-
ulation and repair. This renewal maintains its focus on the critical role of the EC cytoskeleton in the pathobiology
of ARDS and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and seeks to directly address the unmet need for FDA-
approved ARDS pharmacotherapies that attenuate lung vascular permeability and inflammation. We propose
4 highly clinically-relevant, tightly-woven PPG Projects centered on specific lung EC target proteins/genes that
are involved in: i) the unchecked vascular permeability and injury in ARDS; ii) vascular responses to exces-
sive mechanical stress in VILI; iii) contributing to the genetic basis for ARDS health disparities in African
descent subjects; and, iv) providing novel ARDS therapeutic opportunities. Thematic integration across all
projects includes functional characterization of ARDS-associated SNPs and CpG sites in PPG target genes and
the role of ROS in transcriptional and biochemical regulation of peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling, formation of
cytoskeletal-driven lamellipodia and focal adhesion (FA) reorganization that promotes EC gap closure. Project
#1 will utilize system biology approaches to define novel cytoskeletal regulation of EC barrier responses by the
multi-functional non-muscle myosin light chain kinase isoform (nmMLCK) and its cytoskeletal-binding partner,
cortactin. Project #2 (a new PPG addition) extends our recent report that EC secretion of the damage-associated
molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, eNAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), is critical to ARDS in-
flammatory permeability and injury via eNAMPT ligation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Project #3 will inter-
rogate the novel regulation by integrin β4 (ITGB4) and kindlin2, of the bidirectional signaling between the cyto-
skeleton and focal adhesion (FA) dynamics which promotes lamellipodial-mediated closure of inflammation-in-
duced EC gaps. Project #4 (a new PPG Project) will elucidate interactions between key barrier-regulatory re-
ceptors: sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1), S1PR3, and P-selectin which regulate leukocyte
recruitment and lung vascular leak via ligation by P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1). Supported by four
highly interactive cores woven into each PPG Project (Administrative, Genome/Proteome, Preclinical Animal
Model, Biophysical Imaging), this PPG will continue to leverage the outstanding scientific environments at the
University of Arizona and University of Illinois, and the outstanding PPG translational team of interactive basic
and physician-scientist investigators. In addition to informing the genetic basis for ARDS health disparities, our
work directly addresses the urgent unmet needs for greater mechanistic understanding of lung EC barrier regu-
lation and novel therapeutics that restore the integrity of the injured lung circulation to reduce ARDS mortality."

10721825,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dentures are one of the most widely used appliances by our aging veterans. Unfortunately, veterans wearing
dentures often develop Candida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS), a common recurring disease that affects
up to 67% of denture wearers due to microbial colonization and biofilm formation of the denture surface. Further,
other dental diseases, oral mucosal and systemic infections, and even death often result from this disease.
The establishment of a small animal (i.e. rodent) model for studying CADS has been slowed by a number of
challenges which include: (1) the design and fabrication of custom dentures in sufficient numbers for in vivo
studies, and (2) the relative natural resistance of rodents to Candida infection. Previously described models have
often used severely immunocompromised animals which do not adequately replicate the condition of patients in
the clinic and fail to reproducibly form biofilms on oral tissues, a major aspect of CADS. Moreover, none of the
prior models have been able to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of anticandidal medications over extended
periods of time.
Our lab recently developed a new approach for manufacturing rat dentures that uses Computer-Aided Design
(CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) methods, so that large quantities of dentures with uniform
properties/characteristics can be produced. After fabrication, a small hole is drilled into the denture so that
reagents and/or microorganisms can be injected/inoculated into the space between the denture and palate. The
denture is subsequently fitted and secured to the rat maxilla with dental cement. To initiate the development of
CADS, rats are repeatedly injected with Candida (every 2-3 days; PBS was used as a control) through the hole
in the denture and fed a liquid diet. Two Candida strains, SC5314 and tetO-UME6 have been used in pilot studies
to create the infection. After 4 weeks, the palatal mucosa of animals infected with SC5314 display a slight red
color, while animals infected with tetO-UME6 are densely colonized with fungus. In Candida inoculated rats,
large amounts of Candida are recovered from the dentures and palatal tissues with lower amounts from tongue
and buccal mucosa. No Candida has been recovered from the oral cavity of control groups and/or major organs
in both the locally inoculated and control groups. Histological studies revealed the presence of hyphae in palatal
mucosa, confirming that our model is able to replicate the palatal manifestations of Candida invasion, as seen
in denture wearers with CADS. We have also demonstrated the feasibility of a new cell-binding anticandidal drug
delivery system in vitro. This novel system will be used to validate the utility of the optimized rat CADS model.
The proposed studies will build upon these preliminary data and further optimize and validate this novel rat CADS
model. The specific aims are to: (1) optimize the rat CADS model, and (2) validate the optimized rat CADS
model by testing antifungal treatment modalities. If successful, the new in vivo model will help increase our
understanding of the pathogenesis of CADS and other oral fungal infections as well as our ability to test new
antifungal drugs/devices for treating oral fungal infections, thereby enhancing the management of both oral and
overall health of our veterans."
10917023,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 2)
Dissociative and non-dissociative drugs, such as ketamine, PCP, methamphetamine and morphine, exert
powerful psychological effects by inducing profoundly altered brain states. The popularity of these drugs, their
psychologically and physiologically addictive nature and the rising prevalence of a subclass of dissociative drugs
as potential therapeutic agents indicate an urgent need to understand the acute and long-term effects of these
drugs on brain-states. A large gap exists however, in our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying
drug-altered states themselves. To bridge this gap, we seek to elucidate the molecular, circuit and network
mechanisms of drug induced cognitive states by taking advantage of a set of highly tractable response properties
of neurons across the multiple brain regions that support spatial cognition. Our focus on spatial cognition is
motivated by the shared capability of dissociative and non-dissociative drugs to alter neural representations of
space. Dissociative drugs are well documented to induce out-of-body experiences and can impair spatial
memory. Non-dissociative drugs of abuse can leverage the spatial memory system to encode drug-context
associations, leading to drug-associated contexts serving as a potent trigger for relapse to drug use. However,
the brain-wide circuit mechanisms underlying these alterations in spatial cognition, as well as how this impacts
behavior, remain incompletely understood. Here, we use cutting-edge large scale in vivo electrophysiology
combine with behavioral techniques to examine the link between drug-induced spatial cognitive effects and the
microcircuits of spatial and memory coding. First, we perform wide-scale electrophysiology to measure the
neural correlates of spatial estimates in multiple cortical and sub-cortical brain regions during navigation to
investigate how dissociative and non-dissociative drugs induce changes in spatial cognition. Next, we hone in
on particular brain regions of interest in freely moving animals to examine how dissociative and non-dissociative
drugs drive changes in the neural correlates of behavior in spatial tasks. Finally, in vivo electrophysiology is
combined with genetic and behavioral approaches to parse out the molecular basis of ketamine’s potentially
therapeutic versus negative effects on spatial cognition. Together, this work will provide new insight regarding
the brain wide-circuit mechanisms for cognitive states associated with drugs of addiction and the behavioral
impacts of these drug-induced cognitive states on spatial memory and navigational behavior.

SUMMARY
 This proposal is to continue funding in Phase 2 to advance and sustain the Mississippi Center of
Excellence in Perinatal Research (MS CEPR) COBRE at the University of Mississippi Medical Center
(UMMC). Perinatal research encompasses the study of disease states that have their etiology during
gestation and early post-natal development that result in long term consequences in the mother and offspring
across their lifespans. Studies during Phase 1 focused on the integrative relationships and health disparities
among adverse pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and developmental programming of diseases in human and
animal studies by 12 investigators (2 clinicians, 8 women, and 5 under-represented minorities), who secured
> $4.6 million in federal funding (>$12 million total) and contributed 115 publications. The Center grew from
17 investigators to 51 in 5 basic science and 3 clinical departments. Development and support for the MS
CEPR cores also allowed 160 additional local and extramural investigators to obtain 75 PHS/non-PHS grants.
 Our longterm goal is to develop an internationally recognized MS CEPR dedicated to improving the lives of
women and their offspring, especially in Mississippi, through discovery, innovation, and translation to prevent
and reduce death and disability from perinatally-induced diseases. The major goal of Phase 2 of this COBRE is
to further advance the MS CEPR to provide infrastructure and capacity for a multidisciplinary, diverse group of
basic, clinical and population scientists working on the common synergistic theme of perinatal diseases and
health disparities and to facilitate their collaborations. Continuing to support the MS CEPR will provide a
diverse group of Research Project and Pilot Project investigators with outstanding mentors and the necessary
research core services to accelerate acquisition of extramural funding and provide career development
programs to develop the junior investigators into highly productive, independent investigators, and the senior
investigators who are changing research direction to conduct synergistic research on the common theme of
perinatal research and developmental programming of disease that is so important for our population in
Mississippi. The goals of the Center are achieved by providing a stimulating mentoring environment,
strengthening research capacity and capabilities, increasing diversity of our researchers and study populations,
and enhancing the research infrastructure at UMMC."

diverse group of Research Project and Pilot Project investigators with outstanding mentors and the necessary
research core services to accelerate acquisition of extramural funding and provide career development
programs to develop the junior investigators into highly productive, independent investigators, and the senior
investigators who are changing research direction to conduct synergistic research on the common theme of
perinatal research and developmental programming of disease that is so important for our population in
Mississippi. The goals of the Center are achieved by providing a stimulating mentoring environment,
strengthening research capacity and capabilities, increasing diversity of our researchers and study populations,
and enhancing the research infrastructure at UMMC."
10914111,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The objective of the T32 funded “Integrated Fellowship on the Epidemiology and Prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease"" is to rigorously train physicians and behavioral scientists in epidemiologic and
behavioral research methods focused on preventing cardiovascular diseases by a) providing trainees with an
integrated, comprehensive, and intensive 2-year research training experience in CVD prevention and/or
behavioral medicine, b) linking trainees with highly experienced and dedicated mentors who will supervise the
research experience and evaluate their progress, and c) providing instruction to these trainees on multiple
related components of the research process, including relevant didactic coursework, protection of human
subjects in research, confidentiality requirements, elements of appropriate and unbiased analysis of data, and
finding post-training employment. The program began in 2007 focused on epidemiology and prevention.
During that first funding period (2007 – 2012), we learned that, while all trainees are focused on prevention,
some had an epidemiologic focus while others were more interested in behavioral medicine. In order to
accommodate these different interests, and for the funding period from 2012 – 2017, we changed the structure
of the program by expanding the leadership to two Co-Directors; one with experience in cardiovascular
epidemiology (Criqui) and the other with experience in behavioral medicine (Marcus), while retaining an
Associate Director (Allison). During that funding period, the number of positions was expanded from four to
five (2 predocs and 3 postdocs). During the next [current] cycle (2017 – 2022), the number of trainees
increased to six (2 predocs and 4 postdocs) and the leadership was changed such that Dr. Allison became the
Program Director and Dr. Marcus remained the Co-Director, while Dr. Criqui became the Senior Associate
Program Director. Two years into this funding cycle, Dr. Marcus left the University of California at San Diego
(UCSD) to become the Dean of Public Health at Brown University. To address this change, Dr. Criqui became
the Co-Director. For the proposed funding period (2022 – 2027), and since Dr. Criqui will be retiring, Dr.
Allison will remain the Program Director and we propose Dr. David Strong, who has specific expertise in
behavioral medicine, to be the program Co-Director. To develop the potential future leadership of the program,
we also propose to add two junior faculty: Jan Hughes-Austin as Associate Program Director and Isac
Thomas as Assistant Program Director. Both have completed our T32 program, have active research
programs and are dedicated to mentorship of junior trainees. To achieve the program objectives, faculty for
the proposed program have been recruited from Divisions across the Schools of Medicine and Public Health.
Faculty have also been recruited from the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University
(SDSU), which has teaching programs in both epidemiology and health behavior. Notably, UCSD and SDSU
co-sponsor two joint doctoral programs closely linked to this proposal: Public Health and Clinical Psychology."
10927262,"SUMMARY - OVERALL
 The Stanford vision research community is comprised of an impressive array of faculty bridging all levels
of vision research, from molecular to cellular to circuits to systems, from development to adult to disease. The
Stanford Vision Research Core grant will bring 4 modules to this community: (1) Advanced
Computing/Computational Core, (2) Device Design and Development, (3) Neurogenetics of Vision, and (4)
Imaging Structure and Function. These cores will be positioned to amplify the considerable resources Stanford
University is devoting to the growth of vision research, including new faculty recruiting in the Department of
Ophthalmology and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute and new space allocation to wet- and dry-lab vision
research, as well as commitments from the Department of Ophthalmology for additional administrative
capacities. Bringing these 4 cores to this community will help us achieve a number of specific outcomes. 1) We
will extend the reach of vision research among the NEI-funded investigators at Stanford: by providing core
resources and services to investigators, this grant will centralize specialty capacity, allowing faculty to benefit
from the ready availability of such expertise. 2) We will accelerate discoveries in these laboratories: the
availability of new resources that specifically target areas of need across the vision research community at
Stanford will allow research to move more quickly into new, cutting edge areas of innovation. 3) We will promote
inter-disciplinary collaboration that bridges molecular through systems level vision research: The selection of
these 4 cores also carries a specific intention to bring vision research at Stanford into a “next-generation” position
bridging across disciplines. Offering these tools, with cell- and species-compatible vectors, device development,
advanced imaging, and the computational power to extract relevant data from these, will facilitate this bridging.
Finally, 4) We will attract new faculty at junior through senior levels into vision research: by providing tools specific
to vision research, and making these tools available broadly to the Stanford research community, we will facilitate
entry into vision research by both seasoned investigators in other fields, and newly recruited junior investigators
poised to become the next generation of leaders in vision research."
10927241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diversity enhances creativity and innovation in research, but biomedical research institutions have generally
failed to effectively incorporate minoritized groups, such as individuals who identify as people of color, women,
and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning (LGBTQ) persons. Earlier diversity efforts
focused exclusively on intensified recruitment of minoritized faculty, mentoring, and training, but many
institutions did not sustain their success because of insufficient change in institutional environments, systems,
and culture. Over the past two years, the leadership of the University of South Carolina (UofSC) has been
intentional about transforming the institutional culture to one that embraces and expects a climate of diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI). UofSC’s Strategic Plan, released in 2020, includes eight priorities which were
developed, vetted, and revised with intense participation of the campus community. The priorities include
Strategic Priority #2 “Assemble and cultivate a world class faculty and staff” and #4 “Cultivate a more diverse,
equitable and inclusive campus culture.” UofSC has demonstrated increased commitment to diversity in
multiple ways, including hiring UofSC’s first Black/African American Provost and elevating the Chief Diversity
Officer to the level of a Vice President. These efforts reflect UofSC’s campaign to identify and remove factors
supporting systemic racism and gender-bias across all campus endeavors. In response to RFA-RM-21-025,
we have developed the Faculty Initiative for Improved Recruitment, Retention & Experience (FIIRRE) using a
systems science informed multi-level approach. FIIRRE aims to: (1) Develop, cultivate, and implement
institutional programs and practices that become self-reinforcing in promoting inclusive excellence; (2) Achieve
significant and sustainable institutional culture change that supports inclusive excellence; (3) Recruit, nurture,
and retain a cohort of ten new tenure-track Assistant Professors who are committed to inclusive excellence;
and (4) Collaborate with other FIRST awardees and the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center in this
multi-center initiative. The 10 tenure-track faculty will constitute the FIRST cohort at UofSC and will be
recruited as a cluster hire within the area of health disparities and equity research. The FIIRRE Administrative
Core, Faculty Development Core, and the Evaluation Core serve complementary purposes in support of these
overarching aims. Initiated by two of UofSC’s leading health science units, the Arnold School of Public Health
and the College of Nursing, FIIRRE will serve as an incubator and facilitator of institutional change. FIIRRE
leadership is varied in race/ethnicity, academic rank, nationality, and institutional history, with over a decade of
experience working together in research and administrative capacities, helping to ensure FIIRRE’s success.
Strong existing connections with established diversity initiatives on campus will help complement and bolster
FIIRRE goals, as will the unwavering institutional commitment to inclusive excellence by UofSC’s leadership."

The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is a matrix consortium cancer center that includes: The
University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), the University of Kansas in Lawrence (KU-L) and via consortium
agreement, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research (Stowers) and Children’s Mercy (CM) Kansas City. In
2020, 171 members of KUCC accounted for $9.7M of NCI funding and a total of $57M in overall cancer-related
funding, an increase of $8M since the last CCSG submission. Supported by an experienced, nationally
recognized leadership team, Roy A. Jensen, MD, has led KUCC on a strong upward trajectory that has been
catalyzed by over $467M philanthropic support since 2004. Over the last four years, substantial progress has
been made broadening partnerships with communities throughout the KUCC catchment area, recruiting highly
innovative physician-scientists, and expanding clinical research and early phase clinical trials. We have also
been advancing education for the next generation of scientists and healthcare providers and heightening the
influence of KUCC researchers in the national scientific community. KUCC has established five aims to ensure
KUCC leads in the fight against cancer:
1. Leverage unique regional assets to transform research discoveries from the laboratory and the clinic to
 drive new anticancer therapeutic development.
2. Provide the optimal environment to focus the power of precision medicine, basic science inquiry, drug
 discovery and development, and behavioral interventions to decrease cancer incidence, morbidity, and
mortality.
3. Lead and implement a comprehensive strategy to educate both the current and next generation of cancer
 researchers and clinicians in cancer research, treatment, prevention, and control.
4. Partner with key stakeholders, community advocates and regional leaders to develop, promote, and foster
 research-based cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, control, and survivorship strategies to enhance
 our national impact, improve cancer outcomes and ensure health equity.
5. Advance team science by fostering innovative partnerships and collaborations.
To accomplish these aims KUCC has three research programs: 1) Cancer Biology, 2) Cancer Prevention and
Control, and 3) Drug Discovery, Delivery and Experimental Therapeutics. In addition, KUCC supports the
Clinical Trials Office, seven established shared resources – Biospecimen, Biostatistics and Informatics, Clinical
Pharmacology, Flow Cytometry, Lead Development and Optimization, Nutrition, and Transgenic and Gene-
Targeting – and one developing shared resource – Microscopy & Analytical Imaging."
10720901,"This revised BLRD and CSRD Collaborative Merit Award (BCCMA) application is being submitted as part of a
group of 5-linked CMAs from nationwide VA investigators in gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases, who formed
a national steering committee after participating in a successful field-based meeting in San Diego in May 2019
(funded by VAORD). The roadmap developed at this meeting was published in the journal “Gastroenterology”
(PMC7249241). This cluster of CMAs is aimed at in depth understanding of the emerging role of gut microbiome
in the pathophysiology of Veterans deployment related GI and liver diseases including the Gulf War Illness (GWI),
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), and to develop potential
biotherapeutics to alleviate the disease symptoms. This specific proposal CMA1, is driven by the facts that
while diarrheal disorders are highly prevalent in Veterans with GWI and are a major cause of high morbidity,
the pathophysiology of GWI is not well-defined, and the treatment options are inadequate. Therefore, in
view of the emerging role of the gut microbiome in GWI, there is a critical need to better understand the
role of microbial dysbiosis and the mechanisms involved in higher incidence of diarrheal disorders and IBS
in these Veterans. Recent studies have further highlighted the crucial role of gut microbiome in
susceptibility to diarrheal pathogens. For example, gut microbiome has been shown to be the key determinant
in susceptibility to infection and diarrhea by C. rodentium (CR, murine counterpart of the human
enteropathogenic E. coli). Additionally, fecal microbial transplant (FMT) based treatment strategies for C. difficile
infection further support the critical role of gut microbiome in diarrheal diseases. However, direct causal
relationship of microbial dysbiosis observed in GWI Veterans and diarrheal illnesses remains uninvestigated. In
this regard, in preliminary studies we established a humanized GWI mouse model where FMT from GWI
Veterans in mice for 14 days almost recapitulated some features of the functional bowel disorders associated
with GWI, including a) significant dysregulation in intestinal barrier integrity; and b) mild inflammation as
assessed by neutrophil infiltration. Another novel and striking finding in the humanized GWI mice was a marked
decrease in colonic expression of the key chloride transporter (DRA, Down Regulated in Adenoma). Of note,
decreased DRA expression is a key event in infectious or IBD associated diarrhea and is also linked to
compromised barrier integrity. Also, in preliminary studies, we observed that DRA KO mice were much more
susceptible to CR infection. Based on these data, we hypothesize that “Dysbiosis in GWI Veterans is
associated with compromised barrier integrity and decreased DRA expression which contributes to
increased predisposition of veterans to pathogen infections and diarrhea. We propose to utilize state-of-
the-art animal models e.g., the humanized and conventional GWI mice (exposure to gulf war chemicals), and
approaches using apical-out enteroids/colonoids, inducible DRA overexpressing transgenic mice, and in vivo
optical imaging system (IVIS) for in depth mechanistic understanding of the role of dysbiosis in GWI. We also
propose to investigate the role of biotherapeutics e.g., FMT from healthy Veterans, probiotics, and a bacterial
metabolite butyrate in alleviating gut dysbiosis, susceptibility to CR infection and gut barrier integrity. Two
Specific Aims are proposed: 1). Determine the susceptibility of humanized (FMT) and conventional
(chemical induced) GWI mice to C. rodentium induced diarrhea and elucidate the underlying
mechanisms; 2). Develop effective strategies aimed at correcting dysbiosis and diarrheal
phenotype in C. rodentium infected GWI mouse models. A successful outcome of the proposed studies
is likely to increase our understanding of the role of GWI microbiome in susceptibility to diarrheal diseases,
higher incidence of IBS (as repeated bouts of infectious diarrhea increase the risk of IBS) and has potential
of developing novel biotherapeutics for alleviation of dysbiosis and associated GWI symptoms."

The Pre-Clinical models of acute lung injury Core (Core C) is designed to provide PPG investigators with
rigorously defined and reproducible rat and porcine models of combined acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic with high mortality
rates of COVID-19-induced ARDS has dramatically raised the demand for a deeper understanding of the critical
role of the EC cytoskeleton in the pathobiology of ARDS and VILI and deepened the unmet need for FDA-
approved ARDS pharmacotherapies. Core C will comprehensively generate, manage, and provide all animal-
related experiments, resources, and expertise to all four projects by accomplishing five specific aims. Specific
Aim #1 provides a complete range of expertise, training, equipment, and data analysis tools to extensively study
and characterize the role of the cytoskeleton in preclinical models of lung injury. Core C will employ the state-of-
the-art techniques to a) characterize the role of the cytoskeleton in regulating lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier
function, b) determine the effects of specific interventions to provide insight into the efficacy and mechanisms of
novel therapeutic strategies, and c) facilitate the translation of basic research to clinical interventions. Specific
Aim #2 is to house and maintain rats and pigs utilized in this PPG. Specific Aim #3 examines selective
pharmacological agonists, antagonists, or monoclonal antibodies for PPG-targeted effectors, cytoskeletal, and
focal adhesion proteins as potential therapeutic strategies and approaches for ARDS/VILI models. Specific Aim
#4 provides rigorously performed, protocol-driven performance of specific experimental strategies involving
preclinical models of ARDS/VILI. Specific Aim #5 is to perform highly detailed studies and provide high quality
genomic, biochemical phenotyping (BAL protein, BAL cell count/cellularity, lung tissue albumin levels,
assessment of lung capillary leakage by Evans Blue dye (EBD), quantitative lung histology, and
immunohistochemistry). Also, Core C provides physiologic measurements (static and dynamic compliance of
the respiratory system, oxygenation index), radiographic and ultrasound images to support these studies. The
magnitude of ARDS and recovery responses will be determined by generating the acute lung injury severity
score (ALISS). Core C will perform lung injury assessment, provide plasma, and tissue samples to individual
projects for specific assays (including immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis). Our work in Core C will
provide full preclinical support to all four projects and provide the tools they need to get a greater mechanistic
understanding of lung EC barrier regulation while driving therapeutic developments directed toward restoring the
integrity of the injured pulmonary circulation, thereby reducing ARDS mortality."

The principal objective of the Biophysical Imaging Core is to provide PPG investigators with a complete range
of expertise, training, equipment, and data analysis tools to obtain nano-to-micro scale biophysical information
pertaining to the cellular and molecular basis of endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeletal rearrangements and barrier
regulation. Core D personnel and equipment will allow PPG scientists to image 3D structures, evaluate physi-
cal and chemical properties and define perturbant-induced real-time changes in the structures and activity of
cells and subcellular constituents, including membranes, cytoskeletal networks, cell-matrix and cell-cell junc-
tions. This Biophysical Imaging Core supports the PPG's four research projects with quantitative microscopy
related to atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal and deconvolution fluorescence microscopy, total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, dynamic (live) fluorescence imaging, mechanical measurements of
cells (traction force microscopy), super-resolution microscopy and automated high-throughput quantitative mi-
croscopy to allow observation of cellular organelles (e.g., cortical cytoskeleton, junctional complexes, focal ad-
hesions and lamellipodia) in great detail (3D). Core D will also interact with each Project and with Core B (Ge-
nomic/Genetic and Proteome Core) to culture endothelial cells engineered to express different nmMLCK1/2,
cortactin, NAMPT, TLR4, DOCK1, lamellipodin, integrin β4, kindlin-2, PSGL1, P-Selectin and S1PR1/3 recep-
tors transgenes with specific SNP or post-translational modification mutations and measure various biophysical
forces (TFM and AFM). The Core also offers access to experienced use of the complete resources of the Uni-
versity of Arizona Imaging Core Facilities that includes state-of-the-art high-resolution fluorescence microscopy
systems. This Core will also make use of the common resources available at Arizona Research Laboratories.
The Biophysical Imaging Core, led by Carol C. Gregorio, PhD, includes personnel and laboratory facilities for a
wide range dynamic fluorescence imaging, fabrication, and mechanobiophysics. Core D personnel have pro-
fessional experience spanning the fields of high-resolution imaging and examining physical and chemical
properties, including mechanobiophysics, and various scanning probe microscopies. All Core D experiments
will be conducted at the University of Arizona in Tucson."
10706584,"ABSTRACT:
Project #1 system biology studies have highlighted 2 critical lung cytoskeletal effector proteins/genes as central
to addressing vascular inflammation, endothelial cell (EC) permeability and the multi-organ failure critical to
ARDS mortality and the ARDS vascular endotype. We have convincingly demonstrated the multi-functional
non-muscle myosin light chain kinase isoform (MYLK) and its cytoskeletal-binding partner, cortactin (CTTN),
are primary regulators of inflammation-induced vascular permeability, leukocyte trafficking, and vascular
responses to ventilator-derived mechanical stress. Furthermore, the genes encoding nmMLCK (MYLK) and
cortactin (CTTN) harbor genetic variants that confer increased risk of sepsis/trauma-induced ARDS and ARDS
mortality in Blacks. In sync with PPG thematic goals, Project #1 is designed to translate mechanistic insights
into nmMLCK and cortactin structure and function into novel, effective therapeutic opportunities to reduce ARDS
mortality. SA #1 will explore genetic/epigenetic regulation of the non-muscle MYLK and CTTN promoters by: i)
ROS–regulated (or sensing) transcription factors (hypoxia-induced factors HIF-1a/HIF-2a, and NRF2), ii)
MYLK/CTTN promoter SNPs, and by iii) MYLK/CTTN promoter DNA methylation (Core B). SA #2 will detail EC
barrier-responses elicited by S1PR1 and TLR4 receptor activation that are influenced by tyrosine
phosphorylation of nmMLCK1, nmMLCK2 (the pro-inflammatory MYLK splice variant) and cortactin; and by
MYLK/CTTN coding SNPs (over-represented in Blacks). SA #3 will functionally characterize the involvement of
novel nmMLCK-binding proteins (pyruvate kinase M2, kindlin-2) and cortactin-binding proteins (DOCK1/ELMO1)
in S1PR1/TLR4-mediated EC cytoskeletal dynamics and barrier regulation. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a
central regulator of glycolysis and inflammation, selectively binds the nmMLCK1 IgGCAM3 domain to potentially
influence EC cytoskeletal-driven barrier restoration. The focal adhesion (FA) regulatory protein, kindlin2, is a
Project #3 target gene, and was recently identified as a nmMLCK binding partner likely crucial for linking the
cytoskeleton to integrin-mediated cell-ECM focal adhesion and signaling. DOCK1 and ELMO1 are key Rac
GTPase and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins and novel cortactin-binding proteins. SA #2 and SA #3 studies
utilize Core C/D proteomic and biophysical imaging modalities (super resolution, AFM) to define protein
interactions in S1PR1/TLR4-mediated EC spatially-specific cytoskeletal remodeling, gap formation/closure and
lamellipodia formation and barrier regulation. SA #4 utilize established Core C rat and porcine ARDS/VILI
models to assess a novel barrier-promoting liposome bearing the S1PR1 agonist, Tysiponate, on its outer
surface, encargoed with simvastatin (nmMLCK antagonist), bixin (NRF2 agonist, MYLK antagonist), or PIK
(nmMLCK peptide inhibitor). Thus, by leveraging the integrated interactions with each PPG Project and Core,
Project #1's system biology approaches will clarify the contributions of nmMLCK and cortactin to ARDS and VILI
pathobiology. These studies will enhance therapeutic targeting to restore EC barrier integrity and increase
genetic insights into ARDS health disparities."
10706586,"ABSTRACT:
The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the critical role of lung vascular inflammation and
multi-organ endothelial cell (EC) permeability in ARDS mortality and the unprecedented COVID-19-ARDS vas-
cular endotype (1). This A1 Project #2 application remains focused on the critical role of eNAMPT (extracellular
nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) in driving lung vascular inflammation and multi-organ endothelial
cell (EC) permeability, events that are central to increasing ARDS mortality. We initially identified eNAMPT as a
novel ARDS and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) therapeutic target utilizing genomic–intensive approaches
and cellular and preclinical studies of excessive mechanical stress/VILI. We showed eNAMPT is a novel ARDS
biomarker with plasma eNAMPT levels increasing in response to viral/bacterial infection and exposure to me-
chanical ventilation. Importantly, utilizing conditional EC–specific Nampt KO mice, we have recently shown that
EC contributions to ARDS pathobiology via eNAMPT secretion into the circulation, thereby driving pre-
clinical ARDS inflammatory lung injury and severity. eNAMPT produces these injurious effects by functioning as
a damage-associated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) and master regulator of evolutionarily-conserved inflam-
matory cascades via novel ligation of the Toll–like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our exciting data in mouse, rat and porcine
ARDS/VILI models have validated the efficacy of the eNAMPT-neutralizing humanized mAb (ALT-100) in re-
ducing eNAMPT- and LPS-induced TLR4 activation, NFκB-driven cytokine production, lung permeability and
inflammatory lung injury. To further interrogate eNAMPT as an ARDS therapeutic target, SA #1 will extend prior
studies which showed ROS-generating ARDS stimuli (hypoxia, hyperoxia, mechanical stress, cytokines) to in-
duce NAMPT expression and characterize the role of three key transcription factors (hypoxia-inducible factors
HIF1a/2a, NRF2), NAMPT/TLR4 promoter SNPs, and DNA methylation in genetic/epigenetic regulation of
NAMPT/TLR4 promoter activities. SA #2 will mechanistically explore novel regulation of TLR4- and mechanical
stress-stimulated eNAMPT secretion, a key event to initiation of inflammatory cascade activation, via extracellu-
lar vesicle formation, inflammasome activation, and ABC transporters. Utilizing Core B's CRISPR/Cas9- gener-
ated EC lines, SA #3 will dissect the structure/function mechanisms involved in eNAMPT-TLR4 binding and
increases in EC permeability with specific focus on MAP kinase effector p90rsk, Akt1 nitration, and UCHL1
activity in EC cytoskeletal-driven barrier dysfunction. Finally, utilizing Core C expertise, SA #4 will optimize eN-
AMPT ALT-100 mAb dosing, define the therapeutic window for ALT-100 delivery, and define potential ALT-100
mAb synergy with other PPG therapeutic modalities utilizing preclinical rat and porcine ARDS/VILI models. This
high integration of Project #2 with each PPG Project will elucidate EC secretion of eNAMPT and eNAMPT/TLR4
participation in ARDS/VILI pathobiology, and will accelerate ALT-100 mAb as an actionable strategy to attenuate
inflammatory EC permeability and reduce ARDS/VILI mortality."
10706588,"ABSTRACT:
The elevated ARDS mortality observed in the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the contribution of excessive
mechanical stress produced by mechanical ventilation in promoting lethal increases in lung vascular permea-
bility. Integrin β4 (ITGB4 gene) and kindlin-2 (FERMT2 gene) are essential adhesion molecules in endothelial
cell (EC) focal adhesions (FAs), structures critical for mechano-sensing, for bidirectional signaling between
the EC cytoskeleton and the cell-matrix interface, and for EC barrier regulation. The mechanistic basis for dy-
namic FA coordination during inflammatory EC barrier dysfunction and subsequent barrier restoration is a fun-
damental question that remains unresolved. We speculate that coordinate control of FA structures requires
the dynamic interactions of integrin β4 (ITGB4) and kindlin-2 with key PPG cytoskeletal effectors (nmMLCK,
cortactin, Dock1, lamellipodin, paxillin) to efficiently assemble functional FAs during EC barrier responses (pe-
ripheral cytoskeletal remodeling, lamellipodial formation, gap closure). ITGB4 is a unique mechano-sensing,
laminin-binding integrin, and kindlin-2 is a multi-domain mechano-sensing adapter FA protein that recruits struc-
tural and signaling molecules to FAs in concert with cytoskeletal rearrangement. We speculate that these EC
responses are highly influenced by ITGB4 and kindlin-2 post-translational modifications (PTMs) and coding pol-
ymorphisms (SNPs). As reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important stimulus for FA dynamics and loss of
EC barrier integrity, with Core B, SA #1 will characterize the role of three ROS-sensing transcription factors
(NRF2, HIF1α/HIF2α), ITGB4/FERMT2 SNPs and DNA methylation in genetic/epigenetic regulation of
ITGB4/FERMT2 expression and the influence on generation of the unique ITGB4 alternatively-spliced, barrier-
regulatory variant, Integrin β4E (ITGB4E), that we identified as involved in mechano-sensing and EC barrier
regulation. With Core D, SA #2 will conduct in depth structure/function studies including 3D live cell imaging of
mutant ITGB4 and kindlin-2 fusion proteins (SNPs, PTMs) to characterize ITGB4/kindlin-2 function in spatially-
specific EC cytoskeletal rearrangements driving EC barrier-disruption and barrier-restoration. SA #3 will examine
the functionality of ITGB4/kindlin-2 interactions within lamellipodia with known and novel FA-binding cytoskeletal
partners, including cortactin, Dock1, lamellipodin and highly novel interactions with nmMLCK (Project #1).
Finally, utilizing elegant rat and porcine models of LPS/VILI (Core C), SA #4 will assess the therapeutic utility of
the SMURF inhibitor A01, or SRI-38832 to augment kindlin-2 expression as cargo in TySIPonate-conjugated
liposomes (TySIPosomes, Project #4). Project #3 studies will determine the structure/function and molecular
basis for the dynamic FA control by ITGB4 and kindlin-2 and yield important insights into functional relevance of
this unique FA signaling axis in restoration of EC barrier function. Our highly translational approaches will also
provide actionable EC barrier-regulatory strategies that restore the integrity of the injured pulmonary circulation
while yielding insights into ITGB4/FERMT2 variant participation in ARDS health disparities."
10706589,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted a distinct vascular endotype of ARDS, characterized by
profound endothelial cell (EC) permeability, thrombosis and microangiopathy (1; 2), and important unmet needs
such as the critical absence of any effective FDA-approved therapies to halt or reverse lethal vascular leak in
ARDS/VILI. Loss of lung EC barrier integrity results in vascular leakage, alveolar flooding, and is a critical feature
of ARDS multi-organ failure and mortality. Project #4 investigators have demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phos-
phate (S1P), a multifunctional lipid mediator, and its analog, Tysiponate (TySIP), effectively reduce vascular
leakage and inflammatory lung injury via ligation of S1PR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in
lung ECs. S1PR1 ligation rapidly initiates a signaling cascade that reorganizes the EC cytoskeleton via Rac
GTPase signaling, enhances junctional integrity, and decreases vascular permeability. In contrast, ligation of the
S1PR3 receptor induces Rho GTPase signaling to the cytoskeleton to increase lung permeability. Furthermore,
S1PR3 is released into circulating microvesicles in VILI- or LPS-exposed mice serving as a novel ARDS bi-
omarker that predicts survival. Both S1PR1 and S1PR3 promoter activity, expression and downstream signaling
are influenced by pathophysiologic levels of mechanical stress with selective promoter demethylation, and by
promoter SNPs associated with ARDS risk. We identified SELPLG as a novel ARDS susceptibility gene in
Blacks, which encodes P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) that via P-selectin (Selp) binding is critically
involved in PMN trafficking. Our exciting data suggest interconnected signaling of S1PR/S1PR and
PSGL1/SELPLG in regulation of EC vascular leak. Given the major role of ROS in pulmonary vascular leak and
PMN trafficking, Specific Aim #1 (SA #1), with strong Core B assistance, will characterize the role of ROS-
sensing transcription factors (HIF-1α/2α, NRF2), promoter SNPs (predominant in Blacks) and DNA methylation
sites in genetic/epigenetic regulation of S1PR1/S1PR3 and SELPLG/SELP. Leveraging compelling preliminary
data and critical Core D support, SA #2 will examine the novel barrier-regulatory roles for AKT nitration, protein
deubiquitination (UCHL1), the Rac GTPase activator DOCK1, and the actin-binding FA protein, lamellipodin, in
S1PR1 and S1PR3 signaling. SA #3 will characterize the dual influences of S1PR1/S1PR3 on PSGL1 secretion
and P-selectin membrane mobilization from EC Weibel-Palade bodies, on signaling to the EC cytoskeleton, and
altered EC barrier responses. Leveraging unparalleled Core C expertise in preclinical rat and porcine LPS/VILI
models, SA #4 will evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of the TySIPosome encargoed with either S1PR3
siRNAs or an UCHL1 activator, (CD19H28N205S), and directly assess the efficacy of a competitive inhibitor of
P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding, the TSGL-Ig biologic (Tandem P-Selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-Immunoglobulin).
Thus, Project #4 studies will address the unmet need for novel insights into ARDS-associated increases in EC
permeability and for novel ARDS therapies that target S1P1/3/PSGL1 to restore integrity of the lung circulation."
10721358,"One of the major challenges for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is to extend the health-span of
the veterans and their families as their physical and/or cognitive performance capabilities decline with
age. Human neurodegenerative protein misfolding disorders or proteinopathies, are associated with
abnormal protein depositions in brain neurons. They include polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders such as
Huntington's disease and α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. Disclosing the basic
molecular and metabolic alterations that occur during aging of post-mitotic cells such as neurons, under
proteotoxic stress is crucial for understanding the etiology of neuro-proteinopathies.
 Metabolic and mitochondrial alterations are hallmarks of aging and neurodegeneration. Over the
last decade, we and others have shown that enhancement of mitogenesis or overexpression of
NMNAT/NMA1, an enzyme in the Nicotinic acid/Nicotinamide Salvage NAD+ biosynthetic pathway, act
as powerful suppressor of proteotoxicities in yeast, fly and mouse models. Through screens in yeast
models we identified three additional enzymes of the NAD+ biosynthetic salvage pathway with a role in
proteostasis: NADS/Qns1, NaPTRase/Npt1 and NDase/Pnc1. Our observations suggest the existence
of an evolutionarily conserved strategy of `repurposing' (or `moonlighting') housekeeping enzymes
under stress conditions. Under proteotoxic stress, the four proteins are recruited as molecular
chaperones with holdase and foldase activities. In yeast cells, the NAD+ salvage proteins act by
preventing misfolding and, together with the Hsp90 chaperone, promoting the refolding of extended
polyQ domains or α-synuclein. Their catalytic function is not required for their chaperone role.
Preliminary studies in human neuronal models of HD have shown that the human proteins conserve
similar “moonlighting” functions and the capacity to protect against proteotoxic stress.
 We now propose to address the fundamental problem of the intricate interaction between
metabolic and cellular protein homeostasis pathways in human neurons. Some of our studies will
continue exploiting the yeast model to perform structure-function relationship studies to disclose the
domains involved in the chaperone function of the four yeast proteins. We will also continue using yeast
models of HD to screen for suppressors among the Nicotinamide Riboside Salvage NAD+ biosynthetic
pathway enzymes. An essential component of our studies is the translation of the results previously
obtained in yeast to HD patient-derived neurons and HD mouse models. Two neuronal culture systems
will be used to test different aspects of disease progression: HD patient-derived induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neurons and HD patient-derived neurons through direct
conversion of fibroblasts. A mouse model expressing full-length huntingtin will be used for pre-clinical
efficacy studies in vivo. We hypothesize that mitochondrial biogenesis- and NAD+ -biosynthetic-protein
pathways act additively to promote energetic stability and maintain proteostasis, respectively, and in
this way, protect HD neurons against death.
 Identifying and characterizing independent yet synergistic pathways of neuroprotection will
reveal the complex network for neuroprotection and the intricate relationship between metabolism and
neurodegeneration. The proposed research may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to modulate
these pathways to counteract cellular toxicities and extend health-span. Finally, the ability to control
stress-resistance mechanisms such as those against proteotoxic stress may provide molecular targets
and tools to treat the Veterans and the general population to enhance their physical and cognitive
performance and postpone their progressive deterioration with age."

We wish to renew our Core Center for Clinical Research at the Medical University of South Carolina entitled
Improving Minority Health in Rheumatic Diseases (IMHeaRD or IMHRD, pronounced I aM HeaRD). Its mission
is to advance knowledge in clinical care and health outcomes of minority patients who have, or who are at risk
of developing, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and other debilitating rheumatic diseases. The center
builds on a solid framework of strong leadership in rheumatology, biostatistics, public health sciences and health
disparities research coupled with trust and a proven track record of recruitment of Black patients for clinical
research, particularly during the past four years, building on the success of our NIAMS P60 MCRC on Rheumatic
Diseases in African Americans. IMHeaRD will retain and enhance the leadership and unique resources, including
three cores: Administrative, Methodologic, and Clinical and Community Resource. We seek to impact minority
health in rheumatic diseases by: a) providing well phenotyped research samples from minority lupus and
scleroderma patients to an increasing pool of investigators at MUSC and elsewhere to define specific
mechanisms of rheumatic disease pathogenesis and progression; b) enhancing use of the electronic health
record (EHR) to identify and recruit minority participants in clinical research projects; c) developing novel
methods for clinical and translational studies and studies of gene x gene and gene x environment interactions;
and d) strengthening community engagement to enhance awareness of rheumatic diseases and health
promotion and increase minority participation in clinical research. Our Center will offer unique resources and
methods to other investigators and CCCRs. Specific aims are to: 1. Foster translational, clinical and outcomes
research centered on Black patients with lupus and scleroderma; 2. Develop novel tools for using the EHR to
expand enrollment and simplify recruitment of participants in clinical research; 3. Serve as a specialized resource
for providing information and education about these disorders to Black patients and families, their healthcare
providers, the general public, investigators and other health professionals, other CCCRs and government
agencies; 4. Provide well-characterized chronologic samples and associated clinical data to help investigators
identify and understand underlying biologic reasons for differences in risk profiles; 5. Deliver quantitative
guidance to the CCCR Research Community while developing novel biostatistical methods and providing
methodologic educational development of trainees and junior investigators ; and 6. Offer a robust pilot project
program with methodologic support and mentoring for recipients. Special strengths of our center include
outstanding institutional commitment, strong partnership with MUSC’s CTSA, a singular culture of trust with the
community, and robust collaboration with the Lupus Foundation of America and DHHS Office of Minority Health."
10795636,"1 Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Disease development in
 2 Veterans occurs at significantly younger ages and at higher numbers than the population in
 3 general. Currently there are no disease modifying anti-osteoarthritis drugs (DMOAD) due in part
 4 to a historical focus on identification and tracking of radiographic OA outcomes rather than
 5 cellular and molecular disease pathways in pre-radiographic OA. The TOPP Collaborative Merit
 6 Review will test the central hypothesis that heterogeneity in OA pain and structural progression
 7 is related to the “immune pathotype” of OA, which arises from the variability in the cellular and
 8 molecular responses of bone, cartilage, and synovium to inflammation and joint mechanical
 9 environment. The overarching Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To improve understanding of
10 osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis to enable development of targeted early treatment
11 approaches; and Aim 2: To establish preclinical and clinical data for new therapeutic targets to
12 reduce pain and prevent OA progression. Achieving these Aims requires the complementary
13 and synergistic expertise of our Collaborative Merit to employ early and late OA clinical cohorts
14 prevalent in the VAHCS and joint injury animal models to define the immune pathotypes of OA
15 and to test novel therapeutic approaches. This particular project will establish a cohort of
16 patients without significant signs of radiographic OA who suffer from symptomatic degenerative
17 meniscus tears (DMT) to identify predictors of pain and progression after arthroscopic partial
18 meniscectomy (APM). Degenerative meniscus tears (DMT) are prevalent starting in middle age
19 and can occur in the absence of significant radiographic knee OA. Growing evidence also
20 suggests that the DMT may signal transition of the knee to an OA phenotype. Similar to OA
21 treatment, clinical outcomes for DMT patients have been reported to be highly variable
22 irrespective of whether treatment is with physical therapy, APM, or sham surgery. We
23 hypothesize that the variable results following APM treatment of DMT are related to whether
24 joint biology has switched to an OA phenotype. This project aims to test this hypothesis by
25 identifying biological predictors of knee pain and structural progression in Veterans 2 years after
26 treatment of symptomatic DMT with APM. Aim 1 of this study will test if preoperative synovial
27 fluid levels of OA biomarkers supported by our preliminary data and prior work (C2C, C1,2C,
28 COMP and CS846) predict knee pain and structural progression in DMT patients 2 years
29 following APM. Aim 2 will test if preoperative serum biological markers implicated in OA pain by
30 our preliminary data (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-17E) predict knee pain and structural progression 2
31 years after APM. Aim 3 will test if preoperative levels of urine uCTXII and uCTXIIa predict knee
32 pain and structural progression in our DMT cohort 2 years after APM. Achieving the Aims of this
33 proposal will contribute new information important to defining immune pathotypes and
34 biomarkers of early human OA. Completing this project will also help determine whether DMT
35 patients with biological signatures of OA comprise a novel early OA cohort prevalent within the
36 VAHCS suitable for clinical trials evaluating new treatment strategies to prevent or delay the
37 onset of disabling OA. These outcomes support the overarching hypothesis and Aims of the
38 TOPP Collaborative Merit Review and have high potential to improve the care of the large
39 number of Veterans and members of the general public who suffer from knee OA."
10891513,"This Core Center of Excellence application (P30) for the renewal of the Brandeis/Harvard Center to Improve
System Performance of Substance Use Disorder Treatment proposes to enhance the effectiveness and
impact of existing research on delivery and payment of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services, and
offer a national resource for those researching and designing SUD treatment systems and policy in the context
of ongoing, dramatic changes in the US health care system. The Center’s goal is to conduct and extend
research on service delivery and payment to synergistically expand the research base, informing policy and
practice decisions that will profoundly affect the cost, quality, and availability of SUD services. The intertwined
nature of delivery and payment systems requires attention to both in order to achieve sustainability of high
value systems innovations. While continuing to emphasize innovations in delivery and payment systems
broadly defined, the proposed renewal will also bring intentional focus to low-barrier settings for treatment (i.e.,
wholly outside of or extensions of specialty SUD settings such as emergency departments, pharmacies, and
telehealth), as well as quality improvement, inequities in the provision and financing of services, and factors
that influence sustainability of innovation. The renewal also will expand the science around Medicaid managed
care, given the importance of Medicaid as a payer of SUD services, and the dominant role of private Medicaid
health plans. The Center will build on three Component research projects, as well as related research at
Brandeis, Harvard and elsewhere, and support the development of new research to provide crucial and timely
evidence that can inform the design and implementation of effective policy and practice. The Administrative,
Research, Policy/Dissemination, and Pilot/Mentoring Cores provide the organizational engine to promote
cross-fertilization of findings across projects to support the Center’s aims: 1) advance the science by
conducting and stimulating research and knowledge development about payment and delivery system
innovation for SUD treatment; 2) drive the next generation of research by mentoring and training a
racially/ethnically diverse pool of early career investigators and creating networks of early career and senior
researchers; and, 3) engage with key stakeholders in a bidirectional exchange to produce timely and relevant
research that informs and influences policy and practice. The Center will achieve these aims by extending the
research base to include critical analyses of timely and emerging topics identified in close collaboration with
key stakeholders. We will do this through activities that include empirical and conceptual papers; short- and
longer-term analyses targeted at pressing issues for policy and practice; and multiple mentoring programs and
activities to support early career investigators. Further, we will translate and disseminate findings to an
expansive audience of policy makers, payers, providers, persons with lived experience of SUD, and
researchers to inform the changing environment of delivery and payment of SUD treatment services."

The overarching goal of the University of Maryland FIRST program is to create a comprehensive model that is dedicated to ensuring a diverse, scholarly environment and encouraging outstanding individuals to enter the academic profession through a commitment to inclusive excellence. This proposal represents a Partnership between the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). As defined by the FIRST RFA, the UMSOM is a Highly Resourced Institution (HRI) with an average of $140 million in NIH funding over the last three years and UMBC is a Limited-Resourced Institution (LRI) with an average of $7.5 million in NIH funding over the last three years. The UMSOM is one of six professional schools on the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) campus located in downtown Baltimore. UMBC is located in the Baltimore suburbs, just 8 miles away from UMB. UMB and UMBC have been closely linked ever since the 1966 founding of UMBC through a variety of interactions and relationships as described in the proposal. We will “build” upon UMBC’s rich reputation as a public research university for producing highly capable and competitive undergraduate and graduate scholars in a diverse setting. We will combine our experience in hiring a diverse faculty through effective post-doctoral and pre-professoriate programs with the stellar reputation of UMB-SOM in producing highly successful biomedical researchers. This new model will seek to hire three cohorts of underrepresented scholars, who are committed to diversity in the academy and to prepare those scholars for successful possible tenure track appointments at UMBC. In addition, the program will serve to encourage and support departments and programs in their efforts to enrich their intellectual communities through the increased representation of diverse perspectives in research, teaching, and service. Cohorts will be recruited into broadly themed areas of cancer biology, neuroscience, and microbiology/infectious diseases, which are all areas of significant strength at both institutions. Ten new faculty members from underrepresented groups will be recruited, with six recruits being primarily affiliated with the UMSOM and four recruits primarily affiliated with UMBC. All recruits will have secondary appointments in the other institution and will undergo faculty development and other program activities as a cohort. 

The general approach proposed in this initiative is to combine the experiences and strengths of our two institutions through leveraging existing programs and new initiatives to infuse the unbiased hiring and mentoring of faculty, especially underrepresented minorities, into the fabric of departmental culture and thereby affect institutional change. Of primary importance are institutional policies and procedures that codify the importance of a diverse professoriate and provide a sustainable infrastructure for it to establish and grow."

The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated
Cancer Center headquartered in the state of Arizona. UACC was established over 45 years ago and has
served as the driver of cancer research at the University of Arizona, within the Catchment Area, and in the
state of Arizona. UACC’s vision is to be a national leader for overcoming cancer risks, improving treatments,
training talented scientists and providers, and engaging communities though a shared determination to
discover, innovate, and remove social inequities. This vision is realized through UACC’s mission, which is to
alleviate the burden of cancer on patients and families within a five-county Catchment Area and beyond
through: (1) a quest for scientific discovery through interdisciplinary collaboration and team science; (2)
increasing access to the latest approaches throughout a patient’s cancer journey; (3) preparing generations of
researchers and health professionals to fight each day against cancer and the inequities affecting vulnerable
populations; and (4) providing national leadership in engaging populations with respect, consistency, and
shared conviction. Joann Sweasy, PhD, was appointed UACC Director in 2020 and has promoted engagement
of cancer center leaders and members around this mission and vision. Sweasy initiated a robust strategic
planning process that led to development of the 2020–2025 Strategic Plan, “Bear Down on Cancer”,
emphasizing transdisciplinary collaboration around three Center-wide scientific themes that are highly relevant
to UACC’s Catchment Area: Cancer and the Environment; Cancer Imaging and Bioengineering; and Novel
Therapeutics and Preventive Interventions. UACC draws its 151 members from 11 colleges and 36
departments. Total funding is $33.8M (DC), which includes $26.1M in peer-reviewed funding of which $11.6M
(44%) is from NCI and $13M (50%) from other National Institutes of Health agencies. This represents a nearly
20% increase in peer-reviewed funding compared to the prior project period. Of note, UACC has received
$2.7M in NCI supplements during this period. In 2020, 2,835 patients were accrued to interventional trials, a
more than 300% or 3-fold increase in accruals compared to 2016. During the project period, the Office of
Community Outreach & Engagement was launched, and a population health assessment was initiated to
profile the Catchment Area more deeply; an Office of Cancer Research Training & Education Coordination was
also established to integrate and expand cancer pipeline programs and junior investigator mentorship. Under
Sweasy’s direction, Research Programs and Shared Resources were also reviewed and reorganized for
greater impact; internal funding opportunities and Innovative Working Groups were expanded to promote
transdisciplinary collaboration and coordination; a multi-year recruitment effort was initiated based on the new
Strategic Plan; rigorous methods were implemented to ensure cancer relevance of metrics; and an
unprecedented collaboration was formed with Banner Health – Tucson to foster clinical research and care."
10778571,"This project will test the ability of T follicular helper (Tfh) cell-targeting “genetic adjuvants” to improve
immunogenicity of an advanced HIV envelope (Env) trimer. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against
HIV will likely be required to create effective therapeutic vaccines that attenuate HIV disease progression,
reduce HIV infectiousness, or even effect sustained remission in the absence of daily antiretroviral drug
therapy. However, eliciting such antibodies is a challenge that can be frustrated at multiple steps in B-cell
development, particularly in HIV-infected people. Of greatest relevance to this application, low-affinity germline
B cells reactive to neutralizing epitopes may not successfully compete with cells binding non-neutralizing
epitopes for antigen, or the amount of antigen acquired may be insufficient to stimulate Tfh cells to provide the
required help.
Tendel Therapies Inc. developed B-cell adjuvant technology that augments Tfh cells and is designed for use
with vectored vaccines. Our preliminary data show that the adjuvant acts on both Tfh and B cells to promote
uniquely intense and durable antibody responses. We propose to use these adjuvants in combination with two
promising B-cell immunogens to reliably elicit tier-2 neutralizing antibodies in macaques: (i) an advanced
BG505 SOSIP-like trimer designed to promote focused responses to nAb targets and minimize reactivity of
non-neutralizing Env epitopes such as the V3 loop or non-neutralizing CD4 binding site sub-regions, and (ii)
bacteriophage VLPs displaying the HIV fusion peptide (FP) in highly multimeric form.
We hypothesize that novel Tfh-targeting adjuvants promote broader nAb responses to an advanced HIV Env
immunogen via mechanisms including democratic naïve B-cell recruitment and stimulation of Tfh responses.
Aim 1. Assess the intensity and durability of nAb, Tfh, and germinal center B-cell responses to an
advanced HIV envelope trimer, delivered with or without Tendel adjuvants, as mRNA in lipid
nanoparticles. The goals are (i) to test if Tendel adjuvants have similar potency for augmentation of antibody
responses to mRNA-vectored vaccination against native-like HIV Env trimers, as previously shown for
augmentation of responses against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain; and (ii) to select one regimen
for evaluation in Aim 2 subsequent to fusion-peptide priming.
Aim 2. Evaluate the effect of priming immunization with the HIV Env fusion peptide, FP8, on
neutralization breadth achieved by Tendel adjuvants and HIV Env native-like trimers. This priming
regimen is intended to provide an additional epitopic focus for nAb responses. Due to the combination of anti-
FP nAbs with other nAbs provided by trimer immunization, the FP8-primed regimen should result in nAb
responses of increased breadth and perhaps higher titer."
10755292,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Members of SET and MYND domain-containing protein (SMYDs) family are unique lysine methyltransferases
that play important roles during embryogenesis via the regulation of histone H3 lysine residues that impart both
transcriptional activation and repression functions. SMYD1 is known for its function in regulating cardiomyocyte
differentiation and maturation. Our previous study on the role of SMYD4 in Zebrafish suggesting that smyd4 is
critical to early embryonic development and cardiogenesis. Our recent transcriptomic analysis of smyd4-ablated
zebrafish blastula and early gastrula embryos has revealed significant changes in gene regulatory networks
involved in the specification of mesendoderm and the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). These
data suggest that smyd4 may be involved in cardiogenic-lineage specification and differentiation prior to overt
heart formation. Importantly, we demonstrate that de novo SMYD4 genetic variants are associated with
congenital heart defects (CHDs). To establish the mechanistic basis for the genetic association of SMYD4 to
CHDs, we have analyzed the temporal expression pattern of SMYD4 within human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) and their induced differentiation into cardiomyocytes. We find that SMYD4 is expressed throughout the
differentiation process from hESCs to cardiomyocytes. Genetic ablation of SMYD4 in hESCs (hESC-SMYD4KO)
resulted in dramatically compromised mesodermal specification and CPC differentiation, thus phenocopying the
early developmental and cardiac defects observed in smyd4 mutant zebrafish. Additional transcriptomic analysis
further supports that induced cardiomyogenic differentiation of hESCs-SMYD4KO is severely altered, where
hESCs-SMYD4KO adopt a more neuroectodermal lineage fate. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis reveals
that BACH1, a critical transcriptional regulator of stem cell pluripotency and lineage specification, as a strong
SMYD4 binding partner. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that SMYD4 functions as a critical
epigenetic regulator for mesendoderm specification and cardiac development via its interaction with BACH1. In
this project, we propose 3 specific aims to define the biological and molecular function of SMYD4 in
mesendoderm specification and cardiac development. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that SMYD4 is critical to
mesoderm specification and cardiogenic differentiation by performing genetic rescue experiment and a series of
genome-wide integrated analyses, including the single-cell RNA-seq and DNA occupancy analyses, to define
the potentially altered histone epigenetic landscape during cardiomyocyte differentiation in mutant hESCs. Aim
2 tests the hypothesis that BACH1-SMYD4 complexes are critical to the epigenetic regulation of mesoderm
specification and cardiogenic differentiation by determining the protein-protein interaction domains and BACH1-
SMYD4 specific targeted genes using CUT&RUN analysis. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that SMYD4 is essential
to mammalian cardiac development by the generation and characterization of SMYD4 mutant mouse lines."
10755296,"ABSTRACT
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, yet most etiologies remain unknown.
SHROOM3 is a novel CHD candidate gene that functions through interactions with F-ACTIN, Rho Associated
Coiled-Coil Containing Protein Kinase (ROCK) and Disheveled2 (DVL2) and thus participates in the
noncanonical WNT/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Disruption of PCP signaling leads to cardiac
defects, including left-right patterning defects, left ventricle noncompaction (LVNC), ventricular septal defects
(VSDs) and outflow tract (OFT) defects. However, SHROOM3’s precise role in the PCP signaling cascade, and
in cardiac development, is only partially understood. For example, the Ware laboratory recently identified that
SHROOM3 variants are associated with the left-right patterning defect heterotaxy and CHD in patients. This
finding prompted me to study the impact of the loss of SHROOM3 expression on cardiac development. Utilizing
a gene trap mouse model (Shroom3gt/gt), I demonstrated that SHROOM3 loss-of-function results in CHDs in
embryonic hearts, including VSDs, LVNC and OFT defects in homozygous mutant animals. We also showed
evidence there may be genetic interaction between Shroom3 and Dvl2 during cardiac development. Moreover,
molecular studies have established a protein-protein interaction (either direct or through a common binding
partner) between SHROOM3 and DVL2, though the binding site is poorly defined. Interestingly, a recent study
revealed that canonical WNT/PCP signaling is controlled in part through the deubiquination of DVL2 via USPX9,
a highly conserved deubiquitylase. Utilizing immunoprecipitation (IP)/mass spectrometry (MS) of SHROOM3-
transfected Cos7 cells, I have shown protein-protein interaction between SHROOM3 and USPX9. These
observations have collectively led to the hypothesis that signaling between SHROOM3, DVL2 and USP9X is
necessary for normal cardiac development and that disruption of this signaling can contribute to CHD. There is
evidence SHROOM3 interacts with USP9x and DVL2 however the interactions are at best poorly defined.
Genetic interactions between Shroom3 and Dvl2 during cardiac development have not been not fully delineated
and genetic interaction between Shroom3 and Usp9x are unexplored. Aim 1 will assay genetic interaction
between Shroom3, Dvl2 and Usp9x, analyzing cardiac defects and disrupted PCP endpoints. Although data
demonstrate SHROOM3 binds DVL2, and USP9X, the binding site for DVL2 is only roughly localized to a 490
amino acid region within SHROOM3 and SHROOM3’s USP9X binding site is completely unknown. Aim 2 will
assay protein-protein interactions between SHROOM3, USP9X and DVL2. Defining SHROOM3’s interaction
partners will help determine its role in PCP, cardiac development and CHD pathogenesis. The plan will also build
skills, under close mentorship as an Early Career Investigator, in molecular biology, mouse disease models and
genomics analysis, providing a skillset to investigate CHD pathogenesis as an independent scientist."

10765654,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogenous disease. Although there have been several novel agents
and combinations available for treatment, the genomic adaptability of the tumor cells lead to their
continued growth and and adverse survival outcome. Therefore there is need for identification of novel
target sand directed therapies. One of the emrging areas of research in this direction has been the
recent advances highlighting the functional significance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that span
> 80% of human genome. These RNA molecules control variety of cellular and molecular functions via
mechanisms that are as yet not well described. In our preliminary investigation we utilized our RNA-
seq data from CD138+ MM cells from 308 newly diagnosed and uniformly treated patients, and 16
normal plasma cells and described the aberrant lncRNA landscape in MM. We identified 869
differentially expressed lncRNAs in MM compared to normal plasma cells. We identified 14 lncRNAs
associated with PFS and calculated a risk score that stratified patients and report their significant role
as an independent risk predictor for clinical outcome1. These results provided the rationale to further
investigate biological and molecular activity of lncRNA in MM. We evaluated 913 expressed lncRNAs
for impact on MM cell viability in a preliminary CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based screen. A primary
screen in 3 MM cell lines identified 20 lncRNAs impacting MM cell viability. Evaluation using RNA-seq
data showed a significant upregulation of these 20 lncRNAs. Of note, specific lncRNAs were found
selectively upregulated in genetically-defined patient subsets, including high-risk MM carrying t(4;14).
A secondary screen (of the most enriched or depleted sgRNAs) identified MIR17HG (RNA Regulator
of Lipogenesis; RROL), as one of the top hits as a novel lncRNA in MM. In subsequent experiments,
suppression of RROL significantly impaired MM cell growth and survival in vitro and in vivo. We also
observed that Acetyl Co-A Carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo lipogenesis
(DNL) pathway, is one of the primary targets of RROL. This metabolic pathway converts nutrients
(glucose, glutamine, etc.) into fatty acids serving for energy storage or biosynthesis of membranes and
signaling molecules. We have also begun to investigate inhibitors of both lncRNA RROL as well as
ACC1 and observed anti-MM activity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that dysregulated
lncRNAs significantly impact the pathobiology of MM by their ability to control multiple genes, with
potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To further understand the role of lncRNAs in MM and identify
those associated with progression, and to evaluate their therapeutic potential, we will identify functional
lncRNA dependencies in myeloma (Aim 1), validate the role of functional lncRNAs in MM (Aim 2) and
evaluate inhibitors of MIR17HG (RROL) and its downstream target using small molecule and transgenic
manipulations in MM (Aim 3). These studies will define the unique functional landscape of lncRNA in
MM and allow development of translational applications."
10847430,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are significant contributors to age-related
dementia and a major economic burden. Current strategies to alleviate AD and CAA pathology and associated
cognitive decline are largely ineffective, necessitating the need for additional therapeutic avenues to be explored,
particularly with a multi-disciplinary team able to achieve a holistic understanding of vascular, neuronal, and
immune events that underlie disease progression. One promising strategy is the augmentation of clearance
pathways – including microglia/macrophage phagocytosis of Ab and meningeal lymphatic drainage of cerebral
spinal fluid (CSF) - that facilitate the removal of toxic, misfolded protein aggregates that represent pathological
hallmarks of AD brains. While the vast majority of prior research has focused on parenchymal Ab pathology and
microglial functions, many patients also display CAA, contributing to vascular dysfunction, and implicating a role
for parenchymal border macrophages (PBMs; perivascular and leptomeningeal, collectively). Thus, we will
explore the complex interactions between the meningeal lymphatic system, CSF flow, PBMs, and parenchymal
microglia in AD and CAA. The overall hypothesis of this PPG is that neuroimmune events, particularly aspects
of the innate immune system and meningeal lymphatics, underlie AD and CAA pathology. We further
hypothesize that devising new therapeutic approaches, harnessing the functions of microglia, PBMs, and the
meningeal lymphatics may represent novel targets to alleviate AD-related cognitive decline. In particular, we will
explore how dysfunction in cholesterol metabolism, apoE, and downstream TREM2 signaling contribute to
homeostatic functions or promote pathological roles of microglia, PBMs, and the meningeal lymphatics,
precipitating Ab pathology. Working as a highly collaborative multidisciplinary team, we will utilize newly
developed innovative tools to explore these hypotheses, including intra-vital imaging approaches, in-vivo
microanalysis, new transgenic mouse lines and unique surgical approaches. The specific projects and cores are
as follows: Project 1: Kipnis, PI: Parenchymal border macrophages in AD and CAA. Project 2: Holtzman, PI:
CAA: Role of ApoE, innate immunity, and meningeal lymphatics. Project 3: Randolph, PI: Interplay between
meningeal lymphatics, high-density lipoproteins and border macrophages in CAA and AD. Project 4: Colonna,
PI: The protein tyrosine kinase Syk drives innate immune responses against AD. Core A: Administration (Kipnis,
PI); Core B: Imaging and surgery core (Randolph, PI)."
10831090,"CRP Technical assistance is intended to accomplish the following for Tracer-QC product under development.
It will establish industrial production methods (specifically high-precision injection molding) necessary to ensure consistent
and controlled scale-up manufacturing of Tracer-QC analysis plates that are currently manufactured by non-salable, variable
and costly machining process.
 CRP Problem. Trace-Ability is focusing a lot of current effort on scaling up Tracer-QC kit production to the levels
that can supply the entire PET industry with high-quality kits. However, there is one aspect where the current manufacturing
technology is not scalable and carries quality risks. It needs to be replaced by a completely new technology in order to
support the PET industry. Specifically, it is the manufacturing of the core Tracer-QC analysis plate in which all QC
assessments take place. Current plates are made by cutting standard 384-well plates. Such process is not scalable. It has
inherent plate-to-plate variability and a high risk of debris contaminating the wells required for precise optical analysis.
 CRP Solution. Trace-Ability has developed a proposal together with Agilent Technologies, Inc. to manufacture
analysis plates by injection molding. This project is designed to establish scalable production of analysis plates and re-
validate all existing Tracer-QC assays in these plates.
 Specific Aim 1: Scalable injection molding process for manufacturing high-quality analysis plates. The “high-quality”
acceptance criteria are (a) well absorbance <0.065 AU in the range of 400-700 nm with a standard deviation (b) <0.003 AU
in empty wells and (c) <1% in filled wells at 500 nm. Development will be performed by Agilent. Milestones: (a) Molded
plates meet all acceptance criteria. (b) Finalized molding process is suitable for over 200,000 plates per year.
 Specific Aim 2: Tracer-QC tests validated successfully in molded plates. Before the new plates can be included in
Tracer-QC kits that can be used for release testing of FDG and other PET drugs, 8 assays that rely on the wells of the plate
will require testing and validation: color, clarity, pH, Endotoxin, Kryptofix, acetonitrile, ethanol and radioactivity
concentration. Proposed work will be carried out at Trace-Ability. Milestone: Validation results meet all ICH Q2 (R1)
acceptance criteria for all assays.
 This proposal is for technical assistance associated with manufacturing, including industrial production equipment and
methods necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing according to recognized quality standards.
Achievement of the above aims will put Trace-Ability in position to support all manufacturers of cancer PET drugs in their
full capacity with a fully-automated QC solution. This will maximize the commercial potential of the Tracer-QC business
that relies on recurring kit revenues from the growing install base. The impact in the field of Oncology will be manifested
in increased availability of FDG and other cancer PET scans and facilitation of new tracer development. Such availability
is currently limited by throughput and compliance issues in PET drug QC, which Tracer-QC has proven to address
successfully, but needs scalable kit production to offer the enabling benefits to the entire industry."

unique ability to foster feelings of social connection and trust. However, MDMA‘s well-known abuse potential,
and associated cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric toxicity, present a major public health risk. The
psychological and behavioral effects of MDMA in human subjects contrast strongly with the closely related
psychostimulant, methamphetamine (MA). While MDMA and MA share chemical and pharmacological
similarities, MA has an even higher abuse liability and, accordingly, a more devastating societal impact. We
hypothesize that the unique prosocial properties of MDMA are mechanistically linked to its comparatively lower
abuse potential. A deeper understanding of how MDMA’s unique prosocial effect mitigates abuse of
amphetamine-class compounds may lead to entirely new therapeutic strategies for amphetamine use
disorders.
 We exploit the contrasting behavioral effects of MDMA and MA to probe brain-wide patterns of neural
activity corresponding to these drugs’ differential regulation of natural reward sensitivity as well as their shared
abuse potential. We propose a rigorous, systematic screening process to identify and test novel neural circuits
that differentiate these behavioral properties of MA and MDMA. Using simple, reproducible behavior assays
that parallel human imaging experiments in Project 4, we identify, validate and characterize these novel circuits
in three broad steps. First, we use a whole-brain imaging and mapping process to identify candidate brain
regions where neural activity is differentially regulated by MDMA, MA, or a drug-by-behavioral context
interaction. Second, we perform loss-of-function experiments to define the contribution of these identified
regional ensembles to specific MA and MDMA-induced behaviors using a transgenic mouse line that allows for
capture-and-control of drug-activated ensembles. Third, we focus on the drug-induced temporal structure of
ensemble activity within those identified brain regions, collaborating across Projects to perform detailed
recordings of cellular activity in vivo. Developing effective, scalable therapies for existing and emerging
amphetamine-derivative abuse disorders requires approaches that build upon, and transcend, simple
preclinical models of ligand-receptor interference. To our knowledge, no other research group has proposed or
executed a circuit-based approach that leverages parallel mouse-human behavior and imaging modalities so
directly."
10917031,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 4)
MDMA (Ecstasy) and ketamine are drugs of abuse steadily gaining in popularity. Compared to more
traditional stimulants, however, less is known about their mode of action, their subjective effects, and how
these effects promote continued use. Our objective is to integrate self-report, behavior and neural measures to
develop a detailed characterization of the real-time effects of MDMA and ketamine. In doing so we will advance
our understanding of how drug altered brain states give rise to acute drug experiences and drug use outcomes.
We will first use neuroimaging to map both acute influence of these drugs on human experience, focusing on
dissociative, affective, and reward-related responses. Second, we will probe drug-induced effects on behavioral
targets that directly translate to targets used in rodent models. Third, we use functional neuroimaging at rest and
during affective as well as reward-related tasks to quantify neural circuit dynamics that underlie experiences and
behaviors induced by ketamine and MDMA. We will extend our approach to characterizing individual variability
in drug-induced brain-behavior-experience profiles and anchor our interpretation of these profiles by accounting
for potential confounding factors that include baseline inter-subject variability and drug-induced biochemical
stress. We use precisely controlled designs to address our aims and the important question of how brain-
behavior mechanisms produce the subjective effects of these drugs, helping to understand who seeks to use
them and why. The findings will advance our scientific understanding of what motivates people to use these
drugs and promise to provide a foundation for investigating tailored intervention strategies. Armed with
this knowledge, our field will ultimately be better positioned to suggest more effective strategies prevention of
the harmful use of these drugs."

Particularly prevalent in Texas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is lethal when metastatic. To address this unmet
medical need, the UTSW Kidney Cancer SPORE has developed a comprehensive therapeutic program in proven
(targeted therapies and immunotherapy) and innovative (metabolism-directed) areas. Arguably, the most
important driver of RCC is HIF2α. Discovered at UTSW, and regarded as undruggable, structural studies
revealed a vulnerability that was exploited through a chemical screen leading to the founding of Peloton
Therapeutics in the UTSW BioCenter and the development of PT2385 and PT2977. During the previous funding
period, Project 1 investigators validated HIF2α as a target, identified putative biomarkers of dependency,
executed a phase 1 trial, identified resistance mutations, and established HIF2α as a core dependency.
Culminating the vertical collaboration and program success, Peloton was acquired by Merck, and PT2977 (also
called belzutifan) gained FDA approval. During the next period, an innovative siRNA-based, second-generation
inhibitor targeting both wild-type and resistant mutant HIF2α will be co-developed together with a ground-
breaking imaging radiotracer enabling HIF2α evaluation in patients. Project 2 investigators exploit a profound
link between RCC and metabolism. Using pioneering isotope-labeled nutrient infusions, Project 3 investigators
established during years 1-5 that glutamine is a key nutrient fueling RCC growth in patients. In years 7-12, they
will deploy the authenticated In Vivo Metabolism Lab to target glutamine bypass pathways, likely explaining
the recent failure of glutaminase inhibitors. Finally, by leveraging Breakthrough Prize-recognized research at
UTSW leading to a new innate immune system-activating drug, Project 3 investigators propose a paradigm shift
in immunotherapy development involving the coordinated activation of the adaptive and innate arms (as it occurs
physiologically). Together with previously commended development and career-enhancing programs, SPORE
investigators are supported by four Cores. A forward-looking Administrative Core (Core A) serves as a hub. A
Pathology Core (Core B) brings to bear one of the largest and most sophisticated RCC tumor banks and
expertise supporting national efforts. A Data Analytics Core (Core C) assists with statistical support,
bioinformatics, and data management with an avant-garde tool that automatically extracts information from the
electronic medical record, self-updates, and links this information to experimental genomics and the tumor bank.
An Imaging Core (Core D) delivers enabling technologies, including IND-holding innovative tracers, and
unqualified expertise. Building upon the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center Kidney Cancer Program and
its history of collaborative, interdisciplinary cancer research, SPORE Projects and Cores provide an engine of
discovery, innovation, and translation supporting national and international efforts to advance patient care,
research, and education."
10747922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rising dramatically on a global basis and has now
reached epidemic proportions. Current anti-diabetic therapeutics are available, but are inadequate to fully
control T2DM in most patients, resulting in a great deal of morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance is a
major etiologic cause underlying T2DM. However, there are no clinical options to directly improve insulin
sensitivity, except for thiazolidinediones, which are infrequently used due to unwanted side effects.
Obesity is the most common cause of insulin resistance, and accumulating evidence indicates that
obesity-induced inflammation (or metaflammation) is an important cause of insulin resistance and obesity-
associated metabolic complications. Therefore, there are huge unmet medical needs for the prevention
and treatment of metaflammation. However, it is not known how chronic metaflammation is initiated and
propagates during the development of obesity, and why it is not resolved. Macrophages are the major
immune cell type mediating metaflammation, and evidence suggest that changes in macrophage
mitochondria activity can promote pro-inflammatory activation and M1-like polarization of macrophages.
However, how mitochondrial activity is regulated during the course of M1- or M2-like macrophage
polarization, especially in the obese/energy-excess adipose tissue microenvironment is not clearly
understood. We will tackle the question of obesity-induced metaflammation from a new angle, focusing on
mitochondrial biology with a novel target and hypothesis. Our preliminary suggest that ANT2 is a
mitochondrial sensor of FFAs in macrophages to induces mitochondria remodeling favoring pro-
inflammatory activation. Since the major source of increased plasma FFAs in obesity is adipocytes, FFA-
induced ANT2 activation can provide an adipose tissue-specific pro-inflammatory macrophage activation
mechanism in obesity. Interestingly, the effect of macrophage ANT2 KO includes the changes in
mitochondrial number, mass, and capacity, whereas adipocyte or myocyte ANT2 KO does not cause
these changes. This suggest that macrophage ANT2 mediates mitochondria remodeling through a cell
type-specific mechanism that is distinct from ANT2 effects in adipocytes and myocytes. We will explore
whether macrophage ANT2 mediates the initiation and/or maintenance of metaflammation in obese
adipose tissue. We will then assess how ANT2 regulates mitochondrial capacity, dynamics, and
metabolism to support the pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages, and how macrophage ANT2
activation induces insulin resistance. If successful, our studies will provide a novel mechanism for how
obesity induces tissue-selective metaflammation and insulin resistance. Successful completion of the
proposed study will identify ANT2 as a potential target for novel therapeutics to prevent metaflammation,
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance."
10749950,"Infections and inflammatory diseases during childhood cause growth failure. Chronic and simultaneous infection with multiple enteropathogens such as Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli is a regular aspect of childhood in many parts of the world. Children suffering from these infections, even when they are asymptomatic for diarrhea, exhibit reduced linear growth. Similarly, children with inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Crohn's disease are smaller than healthy children. Reduced childhood growth is linked to impaired cognitive function, a complication seen in children with chronic enteropathogen infections and in patients with loss-of-function mutations in the insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) gene. Childhood infections and  inflammatory diseases that lead to growth failure are associated with low IGF-1 and elevated growth hormone (GH) levels, indicating GH resistance. However, the signaling events that lead to GH
resistance in response to infection and inflammation are not understood. The principal investigator's
laboratory recently made the discovery that activation of the innate immune Toll signaling pathway in the larval stage of the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster leads to growth failure. Reduced growth caused by active Toll signaling stems from a potent reduction in circulating levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 6 (Dilp6), the fly homolog of IGF-1. In this application, genomic and genetic approaches in the mouse and the fruit fly will be used to investigate the negative regulation of animal growth by innate immune and inflammatory signaling. In Aim 1, the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced Dilp6 mRNA levels will be investigated. The principal investigator's lab will determine whether Dif, a homolog of NF-kB, binds directly to the Dilp6 promoter to inhibit its expression and will use a forward genetics approach to find additional transcriptional regulators that contribute to the negative regulation of whole-animal growth and/or Dilp6 downstream of Toll signaling. In Aim 2, molecular mechanisms underlying GH resistance during infection will be 
 investigated. The principal investigator's lab will identify transcriptional mechanisms linking endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling to reduced expression of components of the GH signaling pathway in primary mouse hepatocytes and will use a tissue-specific genetic approach to determine whether MyD88, a common component of the TLR4 and IL-1ß signaling pathways is required in liver to inhibit GH signaling, IGF-1 production and growth in response to Campylobacter infection. Successful completion of the Specific Aims will identify signaling mechanisms underlying a widespread but poorly understood consequence of infection and inflammation: endocrine dysfunction leading to growth failure. The work proposed here will contribute to our understanding of hormone regulation and the control of non-immune functions by innate immune and inflammatory signaling. Furthermore, this work may lead to new therapies for treatment of growth failure and prevention of cognitive impairment in children suffering from chronic infections or inflammatory diseases."

This P30 application seeks support for the Cores of Vision Research within the University of California
Irvine (UCI) that will strengthen and enhance NEI R01-funded research. The project also aims to support
the major expansion of vision research currently under way at UCI. It will broaden and optimize research
capabilities, support and expand existing research projects, and help establish new studies, ultimately
boosting productivity and strengthening vision research at UCI. Three research Core modules have been
identified that would provide substantial benefit to current and future NEI R01-funded projects at UCI: (i).
Ocular Microanatomy; (ii) Visual Function and Non-invasive Ocular Imaging; and (iii) Ocular Mass
Spectrometry, Lipidomics, and Proteomics. In addition, an Administrative Group will be established to
facilitate and support the function of these research Cores. The three research Cores were selected by
majority votes of all current NEI R01-funded investigators, and other investigators who are directly or
indirectly involved in ophthalmic research at UCI. The most requested services were developed into the
Cores described in this P30 application. The vision research community at UCI has grown significantly over the
past several years with the recruitment of 4 senior and 2 junior investigators and the formation of the Center for
Translational Vision Research (CTVR), with at least two more mid-career faculty recruitments in the works.
This expansion has been made possible by the exceptional institutional support from the Department of
Ophthalmology and the School of Medicine, who have committed significant financial and infrastructure
resources to bolster the vision research community at UCI. The services provided by the Cores for Vision
Research will meet the scientific needs of the NEI R01-funded researchers as well as of early-stage
investigators, and will increase efficiency, accelerate progress, and encourage new research directions
and scientific collaborations at UCI. The Cores will also provide training and access to state-of-the-art
experimental tools for students and postdoctoral scholars and will help prepare them for successful careers
in ocular research."
10741769,"Viral infections including Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have placed a substantial
strain on human health and the health care system. These infections have specifically had broad
impacts on veteran health in the US. Host factors influence how humans respond to infectious
agents and develop adverse health outcomes after infection. Although previous genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with susceptibility and progression for
several infections, understanding the role of host genetic and epigenetic factors on chronic
disease comorbidities, aging, and long-term outcomes in the setting of viral infections has been
hampered by sample size, heterogeneous populations, and discordant measurements/definitions
of key phenotypes. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have uncovered DNA
methylation markers associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs, such as coronary heart
disease, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease), as well as HIV infection. However, the
epigenetic predictors for incident NCDs and mortality are largely unknown among people with
viral infections. Viral infections (e.g., HIV) can have a substantial impact on epigenetics, which
may affect long-term health outcomes. Additionally, acceleration of the epigenetic clock or age
has emerged as a novel biomarker of biological aging and can predict disease outcomes and
mortality. Therefore, we will systematically investigate genetic and epigenetic predictors of NCDs
and mortality in the following Aims. 1) To identify genetic and epigenetic predictors of age-related
morbidity and mortality as well as modification effect of HIV infection among multi-ethnic veterans;
2) To identify genetic and epigenetic factors associated with morbidity and mortality among multi-
ethnic veterans with HCV infection; 3) To identify genetic and epigenetic factors of long-term
comorbidities, accelerated aging and mortality, as well as mediation effect of COVID-19 among
multi-ethnic veterans.
 Impact: Viral infections including HIV, HCV and SARS-CoV-2 broadly affects veteran’s
health and reduces the quality of life (healthspan) and life expectancy (lifespan) through a range
of comorbidities. The molecular mechanisms underlying the morbidity and mortality after viral
infections of HIV, HCV and SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. The proposed genetic and
epigenetic study can reveal the genetic and epigenetic factors linking viral infection (acute,
chronic, and resolved) and major NCD outcomes and mortality among multi-ethnic veterans, shed
lights on potential targets for new prevention and intervention, provide insights into the
comorbidity and aging process for all people, and develop systematic and precision medicine
strategies to improve veteran’s health."

The mucus clearance system constitutes the primary airway host defense system against inhaled infectious
agents and toxins. However, despite more than two centuries of research into the nature of the mucus clearance
system, surprising gaps in our knowledge of fundamental aspects of this system persist. Filling in these gaps is
important for improving public health strategies to combat respiratory infectious diseases. Filling in these gaps
is also important for elucidating the pathogenesis of and developing therapies for chronic pulmonary diseases,
including COPD, asthma, NCFB, and rare genetic diseases (CF, PCD), which are by definition characterized by
mucus accumulation in the lung. This PPG proposes to investigate fundamental, but poorly understood, aspects
of the mucus clearance system that must be quantitated to understand mucus function in health and dysfunction
in disease. Each PPG project has two specific aims focused on basic mucin function and one focused on
translational aspects of mucin pathobiology. Project 1 (“Mucin Structure and Associations in Respiratory Mucus”,
Michael Rubinstein, PhD, PI) will investigate fundamental aspects of the organization of mucins in solution and
within the mucus layer. These studies will be complemented by studies of the addition of “abnormal polymers”,
e.g., DNA, to mucus solutions. Project 2 (“Why are mucins so gigantic and is it safe/effective to sever them
therapeutically?”, Richard C. Boucher, MD, PI) will focus on the fundamental question as to why human airway
mucin polymers are of such enormous size (300 MDa, Rg 250 nm) and characterize the ratio of efficacy (chain
length reduction) vs risk (off-target chain unwinding) required for the development of mucolytics for lung disease.
Project 3 (“Membrane-bound mucins on the airway surface ensure efficient mucus clearance and lung health”,
Brian Button, PhD, PI) will study the relationships between cilia, PCL, and the mucus layer required for transport,
focusing on a novel hydraulic “pushing” vs classic “clawing” mechanisms. In addition, barrier functions of PCL
and regulation thereof will be studied. Project 4 (“Biophysical and structural characterization of airway
submucosal gland mucus in health and cystic fibrosis”, Ronit Freeman, PhD, PI) will focus on a novel attribute
of submucosal gland (SMG) mucus, a strand/bundle insoluble component, and how strands/bundles contribute
to SMG mucus function in health and disease. Three cores support the PPG: 1) Core A, the
Administrative/Biostatistical Core, Multi-PIs Richard C. Boucher, MD, and Michael Rubinstein, PhD, supplies
project management and statistical support for the PPG; 2) Core B, the Mucus/Mucin Analytics Core, PI Mehmet
Kesimer, PhD, provides quality control of all mucin reagents for the PPG and novel biochemical/biophysical
measurements; and 3) Core C, the Imaging Core, PI Camille Ehre, PhD, provides electron microscopic,
molecular, and morphologic analyses to the projects. The overall goals of the PPG are to elucidate the structure

10887396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic pathogens are the causative agents of some of the most devastating and intractable diseases of
humans, including malaria, amebic dysentery, African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, trichomoniasis,
aspergillosis, cryptococcal fungal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).
The global impact of these diseases is immense. It is noteworthy that many of these pathogens are the causative
agents of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), neglected diseases of poverty (NDPs) and/or are classified as
bioterrorism agents. Importantly, infections caused by eukaryotic pathogens are increasing in the US due to
globalization. The primary goal of this COBRE proposal is to increase the number of NIH-funded scientists in the
state of South Carolina by supporting a world-class research center, the Eukaryotic Pathogens Innovation Center
(EPIC), at Clemson University (CU). The scientific focus of EPIC is a multidisciplinary study of important global
eukaryotic pathogens. EPIC is the first-and-only in the state with a focus on infectious diseases, and the first-
and-only in the country with a focus on eukaryotic pathogens. Four projects from target junior investigators will
be supported. Their projects are 1) Regulation mechanisms of Trypanosome brucei axonemal dynein, 2)
Functional roles of ncRNA, afu-182, in azole response and pathobiology of Aspergillus fumigatus, 3)
Investigating the function of macrophages in the efficacy of anti-fungal drugs in larval zebrafish, and 4) Evaluating
anti-parasitic diazacyclobutenes. These investigators will be matched with external and internal mentors who are
established NIH-funded researchers. The projects will be supported by a well-organized Administrative Core and
two state-of-the-art Scientific Cores in Genomics, and Imaging/Cell Sorting. The center also has a substantial
infrastructure base and significant institutional support. For example, CU will recruit two additional faculty
members and two post-doctoral fellows to expand activities of this center over the course of the project period.
Pledges of graduate assistantships, equipment, and space further exemplify the institutional commitment. The
continuation of this COBRE-funded center will significantly expand research in South Carolina and will facilitate
recruitment, training, and retention of a critical mass of investigators with cross-disciplinary skills in this important
research area."

The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) leverages approaches and expertise in behavioral
neuroscience, computational science, genome biology, mouse and human genetics, and genetic engineering to
identify, contextualize and model shared and distinct biological mechanisms of biobehavioral risk for cocaine
self-administration. Drug addiction is a devastating and complex disorder influenced by multiple etiological
factors. Extensive evidence demonstrates the role of genetic variation on a range of addiction behaviors, from
experimentation and initiation of drug use to compulsive drug-taking behavior. Yet discovery of predisposing
genes and variants in human populations is limited by high sample size requirements, phenotyping capacity, and
variability in drug exposure and other environmental factors. Advanced mouse genetic populations exhibit
variation in addiction-relevant behaviors and offer an experimental platform to discover the neurobiological
mechanisms by which predisposing traits predict the tendency to self-administer cocaine. The CSNA employs
the Collaborative Cross genetic reference population and Diversity Outbred mapping population across three
integrated research projects focused on three interrelated aspects of addiction susceptibility: impulsivity, cocaine
sensitization and self-administration. These traits are evaluated using a multidimensional phenotyping platform
in a mouse population exhibiting extreme genetic and phenotypic variation, enabling a replicable and extensible
assessment of the shared and distinct biological mechanisms of addiction vulnerability. These complementary
populations are derived from the same founder strains, allowing for extensive data integration across studies
within and outside the CSNA. The CSNA develops data integration methods and produces multiple functional
genomics and phenomics datasets, deposited in widely accessed and highly functional informatics resources for
the global research community. The Center also extends its results into basic neurobiological and preclinical
therapeutic research by integrating findings with human genetic and genomic studies, generating novel, validated
mouse mutants and identifying vulnerable and resistant strains for mechanistic studies. Three research support
cores provide state-of-the-art approaches to the CSNA research projects and the larger research community,
including a sophisticated, large-capacity Behavioral Phenotyping Core, an Integrative Genetics and Genomics
Core for statistical genetics, molecular profiling, biobanking, data integration and data dissemination, and a
Mouse Resource and Validation Core for creating and delivering novel mouse resources for systems genetics,
validation, and disease modeling. The Administrative Core coordinates, integrates, and disseminates research,
education and outreach activities. Finally, a Pilot Core enables collaborative work to promote innovation and
diversity in addiction science. Through its combined efforts, the CSNA will have a lasting impact on the study of
addiction genetics through the holistic examination of biobehavioral risk, the generation of community data
resources that we and others will expand and exploit in future studies, and through education and training."

Core C will assist the overall goal of the Projects to test the unifying hypothesis that aging auditory neurons and
their subcellular components develop defined structural alterations, leading to profound neural circuit re-wiring
and aberrant structure/function plasticity along the auditory pathway. Core C will leverage the National Center
for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR; Dr. Perkins) resources and Dr. Fritzsch's confocal microscopy
and deep neuroanatomy expertise. Core C will use computer resources to integrate large-volume, micro- and
nano-scale structural investigations through serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) and
confocal microscope z-series of fluorescent-tagged proteins (biomarkers), into each Project in deciphering the
structural correlates of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Core C will provide structural support for: Project 1:
Studies of structural (anatomic) projections of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) from inner hair cells (HCs) to the
brainstem cochlear nucleus (CN), which show age-dependent demyelination and synaptopathy using SBEM;
SGN subtype-specific projection tracing from cochlear HCs to the CN, and determination of the age-dependent
re-wiring using fluorescent-tags of SGN-subtype biomarkers. Core C will analyze axonal nodes and internodes
along the peripheral auditory neurons (AN) using Nav or Kv3.1 and CASPR immunofluorescence labeling. Other
sub-cellular changes in the aging SGN will be examined. Project 2: Studies of aging on the cochlear nucleus
(CN) using SBEM; investigation of synaptic vesicle densities and mitochondrial structure, with profound age-
dependent synaptic plasticity in ARHL models. Project 3: Connectomic analysis of nerve fibers, synapses,
dendrites, and mitochondrial networks that are altered in aging in the CN and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid

of myelinated axons (central portion of the AN and axons of bushy cells to the MNTB). For all projects, the
typically large confocal and SBEM volumes will be placed in the NCMIR Cell Image Library (CIL), allowing Core
and Project researchers to annotate features in the volumes and share the annotations across sites to view in
the CIL web application interactively, and with approved researchers elsewhere. Core C will support the overall
goal in providing new insights into the current knowledge gaps in synaptic and neural overtures in aging auditory

The Genome and Proteome Core (PPG Core B) will provide essential, cutting-edge genomics, proteomics, and
bioinformatics expertise to facilitate the translational impact of this highly integrated PPG. Core B will be respon-
sible for providing the research investigators with: (i) expert interrogation of publicly available DNA and RNA
sequencing datasets and genome-wide DNA methylome datasets to generate interpretable data from these plat-
forms; (ii) genetic expertise needed to test for associations between PPG target gene DNA variants and sus-
ceptibility and severity of ARDS; (iii) generation of human endothelial cell (EC) lines and genome-edited cell line
models with selected single nucleotide knock in or deletion-based knock out mutations for functional genetic
analyses; (iv) execution of traditional proteomic mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated PPG target
proteins for protein translational modification (PTM) identification, including phosphorylation, nitration, and ubiq-
uitination; (v) in silico computational protein-structure modeling to identify the impact of functional non-synony-
mous coding variants on protein structure and function (protein-protein interaction, catalytic activity, post-trans-
lational modification), with protein-protein interactions validated by surface plasmon resonance; and, (vi) exper-
tise to oversee production of recombinant proteins with mutations at sites of PTMs or SNPs. As a centralized
core for all genome and proteome analyses, Core B (located in Tucson AZ) will perform all relevant analysis
of experimental samples for all four projects as each PPG Project will require the services provided by
Core B."
10914004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gastrulation is a pivotal process for the formation of human body plan and its disruptions can lead to miscarriage or birth
defects such as caudal dysgenesis. During this process, pluripotent cells differentiate into the primary germ layers or the
endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm lineages that later create all of the body’s cell types. Such differentiation events
involve extensive three-dimensional (3D) reorganizations of the genome that are specific to each lineage. However, the
functional effects and the underlying mechanisms of these reorganization as well as consequences of their disruption are
poorly understood.
Our objective is to determine the dynamics of lineage-specific genome 3D reorganization during gastrulation and how
they respond to disruptions in the epigenetic landscape. Our hypothesis is that genome 3D changes in each lineage help
establish the cell fates it generates later in development by poising it to assume those cells’ transcriptional programs. We
further hypothesize that such important 3D reorganizations should be more faithfully inherited through mitosis and and
that chromatin epigenetic marks, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are important for their
establishment. Members of this team have developed tools that create new opportunities for understanding the role of
genome 3D organization in embryonic development. Among them are proximity ligation assays that allow for global
determination of genome 3D organization in cell populations and single cells. We have also developed a cutting-edge and
powerful in vivo combinatorial barcoding system in mice that enables us to decipher the lineal relationship between cells.
Here we propose using these tools to identify lineage-specific higher-order features in gastrulating mouse embryos, assess
their association with gene expression later in development, evaluate how faithfully they re-establish after mitotic
divisions, and examine how they are affected by disease-related epigenetic perturbations.
Our long-term goal is to understand the role of genome structure dynamics in fate determination during embryogenesis
when cells undergo a succession of lineage commitments in highly programmed fashion. Our proposed research will
broadly impact the field by characterizing lineage-specific genome 3D organization during embryogenesis, as well as its
functional dynamics and connection with chromatin epigenetic marks."
10744259,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Deficits in cognitive control are core features of late-life depression, contributing both
to emotion dysregulation and problems with inhibiting irrelevant information, conflict detection, and working
memory. Clinically characterized as executive dysfunction, these deficits are associated with poor response to
antidepressants and higher levels of disability. Improvement of cognitive control network (CCN) dysfunction
may benefit both mood and cognitive performance, however no current pharmacotherapy improves CCN
deficits in LLD. Supported by our pilot data, we propose that nicotine acetylcholine receptor agonists enhance
CCN function and resultantly improve mood and cognitive performance in late-life depression. The objective
of this R61 / R33 proposal is to first determine whether transdermal nicotine enhances CCN neural activity in
an exposure-dependent fashion during an emotional response inhibition task (the emotional Stroop task). If we
meet our Go Criteria by demonstrating exposure-dependent CCN target engagement, we will then conduct the
R33 pilot randomized controlled trial to: 1) determine the relationship between target engagement and clinical
improvement; 2) examine the specificity of transdermal nicotine’s effects on the CCN; and 3) obtain preliminary
evidence of TDN’s clinical effects. The long-term goal of this line of research is to determine whether nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor agonists enhance CCN function and provide clinical benefit to individuals with late-life
depression. Supported by our pilot data, this project’s rationale is that it will elucidate whether broad nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor agonists enhance CCN activity and if so, does that mechanism positively influence
clinical symptoms. A negative finding will improve our understanding of the neural effects of broadly active
nicotinic receptor agonists and whether targeting the CCN has therapeutic benefit. Our approach for the R61
phase is to examine in 36 older adults with Major Depressive Disorder whether transdermal nicotine patches
enhance CCN activity over 12 weeks as measured during fMRI with the emotional Stroop task while measuring
nicotine and nicotine metabolite levels. If we meet Go Criteria by demonstrating exposure-dependent target
engagement, we will proceed to the R33 pilot clinical augmentation trial. Seventy-two depressed elders on
stable SSRI or SNRI monotherapy will be randomized to 13 weeks of active transdermal nicotine or placebo
patches, completing MRI and cognitive testing at baseline and at the trial’s end. Dosing will be guided by
nicotine blood levels and based on the relationship between exposure and target engagement as observed in
the R61 phase. This proposal is significant and innovative as no current pharmacotherapy improves CCN
function or improves cognitive deficits in late-life depression. Transdermal nicotine has a mechanism of action
that is distinct from current antidepressants, potentially making it an important augmentation agent. If our
hypotheses are correct, as patches are commercially available, this approach could be rapidly moved into
definitive studies and may have applicability to other psychiatric disorders characterized by CCN dysfunction."

Development and utilization of aged and genetically engineered mouse models are crucial to understanding
the roles of specific genes in age-related hearing loss (ARHL). We will require strain-specific aged (senescent)
mice that are not available commercially or are produced at the NIA-supported facility at the NIH,
http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook. All projects, Core C and Core D within
the proposed PPG makes extensive use of these aged mice, and utilize a variety of genetic approaches to
study the structural and functional remodeling in the auditory neural pathways. The proposed PPG will require
the use of gene-targeted mouse models to study the mechanistic underpinning in the aging auditory system.
The purpose of the mouse core is to provide services for the establishment of a strain-specific aged mouse
colony and the generation and management of gene-targeted and transgenic mice. Founder mice will be
identified, bred, and maintained in an animal facility at UNR. Additionally, several mouse lines will be bred and
aged and supplied for experiments proposed in all three projects, Core C and Core D. The Core will also be
responsible for maintaining and distributing mouse lines to each individual project. This will provide the most
cost effective sharing and utilization of the mouse models. In addition, the Core will also cryopreserve critical
lines in case of an inadvertent loss. Finally, the Core will be a resource for other laboratories interested in
mouse models of ARHL."
10919853,"Program Summary/Abstract
This third renewal application of the Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE is being submitted with the vision
that the burden of breast cancer (BC) can be reduced through the performance of innovative translational
research addressing issues of high significance for women. The science of the SPORE includes three
translational research projects. Project 1: “The influence of variants in ER-positive BC predisposition genes on
BC risk and response to therapy”. This project builds upon the work from the prior funding period, where the
principal investigators (PIs) identified that certain BC predisposition genes (ATM, CHEK2 and PALB2) were
associated mainly with the risk of ER+ BC. The Pis will assess pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2,
PALB2 and determine a) age-related risks, the risks of contralateral BC and second cancers (ovarian,
colorectal, pancreatic etc.), b) the prognostic effects of these PV and c) the clinical relevance of variants of
uncertain significance in ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2. Project 2: “Improving the endocrine management of
premenopausal ER+/HER2- BC” brings forward a new ER-targeting drug, Z-endoxifen (ENDX), for
premenopausal ER+ BC based on new data that ENDX dually targets both ERα and PKCβ1, with potent
protein downregulation of ERα, Cyclin D1, and E2F1. This dual targeting is not only unique to ENDX, but at
the dosing proposed in the clinical trial, ENDX is able to completely block the stimulatory effects of
premenopausal levels of estrogen. Project 3: “Development of a novel multi-antigen BC prevention vaccine
for women with premalignant disease” is based on pioneering work of Mayo investigators to develop a novel
vaccine that targets six antigens collectively expressed by all BC subtypes. The work in this project will provide
critical information that will allow the investigators to a) understand the expression of target antigens during
progression from normal breast tissue to BC; and, b) in the phase I study, evaluate blood and breast tissue
biomarkers of immune response. Successful completion of this project will establish the parameters for a phase III
clinical trial of the vaccine for BC prevention in women with benign breast disease (BBD), with the enormous
potential to drive significant reductions in overall BC incidence and mortality. These research projects are
supported by three highly interactive cores: Core A: Administrative Core, Core B: Biospecimen and Pathology
Core, and Core C: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Patient Registry Core. A Developmental Research
Program will continue to identify and develop research projects that hold the greatest promise to advance to
full SPORE projects, and a Career Enhancement Program will continue to identify and support faculty
investigators in BC translational research that have the greatest potential to become future SPORE leaders.
The investigators, cores, and the research programs in the SPORE are all integrated in the Mayo Clinic Cancer
Center. Collectively, our SPORE will make discoveries and translate them into the clinic for the benefit of
women with, or at risk of BC."

Project Summary / Abstract Bats are reservoirs, or suspected reservoirs, of many zoonotic viruses, including SARS, SARS2 and MERS coronaviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, and Ebola and Marburg viruses. Little is known about how these viruses circulate in their bat reservoirs, principally because of a lack of bat colonies that can be used for the development of experimental infection models. To address this deficiency, we will capture horseshoe bats and Indian flying foxes, respective reservoir hosts of Nipah virus and SARS-related coronaviruses, in Bangladesh where they will be quarantined and provided veterinary care as they adapt to captivity. Bats will be shipped to CSU to establish the breeding colonies as a resource for investigators who study these viruses. We will generate primary cell cultures and immortalized cell lines from various tissues and freeze live bone marrow that will be useful for studying how these viruses infect bat cells, and how the viruses may modulate the innate immune responses. Recombinant cytokines will also be produced for the research community, including those for generating macrophages and dendritic cells (GM-CSF, Flt3L), T cells (IL-2) and for in vivo modulation of the adaptive immune response (IFNγ, IL-4). Moreover, we will generate monoclonal antibodies for use in cytokine detection assays and flow cytometry of immune cell subsets and in vivo neutralization. Finally, we will perform experimental infection studies of Nipah virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-related coronaviruses, BANAL-52 and BANAL-236, to study the infection kinetics, virus distribution and transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles of bats during infection, and escalation and resolution of the immune response. Tissues, cells and sera from naïve and infected bats will be archived in a biobank that will be made available to the research community. The establishment of this resource will lead to a better understanding of how bats host highly pathogenic viruses without disease and may shed light on events that increase spillover risks to humans. In turn, this information could lead to development of mitigation strategies to prevent future virus spillover and uncover new strategies for therapeutic treatment of coronavirus and Nipah virus diseases."

10922687,"The Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center (the AIM center) of Biomedical Research Excellence
(CoBRE) at the University of New Mexico Health Science Center (UNM HSC) is a nationally unique center and
a local and international interdisciplinary hub for fundamental and translational research in the areas of
autophagy, inflammation and metabolism. These areas impact an array of health and disease states including
obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, infection, autoimmune disorders, neurodegeneration, and
aging. Inflammation and metabolism are at the core of national and global health issues and are central to
health problems in our state such as obesity, driven by disparities as well as by environmental factors and an
aging population. There are few diseases that do not have inflammatory or metabolic components, whereas
autophagy overlaps these areas and provides a unique and novel aspect.
The main accomplishments in Phase I were: (i) the establishment of the center as an entity and as an
internationally recognized intellectual hub; (ii) successful support of mentored PIs (mPIs) evidenced by the
entire initial cohort of mPIs graduating with their independent R01s; (iii) assembly of a significant critical mass
of investigators in the interdisciplinary thematic areas of the center; and (iv) development of a scientific core
with instrumentation enabling rigor and reproducibility. AIM interactive seminars and world-class symposia
drew on the strengths of the local, national, and international scientific community. Based on experiences in
Phase I, the important next step in Phase II is to strengthen the AIM center and build and expand upon these
successes. For Phase II, our long-term goals are to increase the impact and develop a self-sustaining locally,
nationally, and internationally known interdisciplinary center, dedicated to fundamental and translational
research in the areas of autophagy, inflammation and metabolism. Based on experiences from Phase I, we will
strengthen the center in Phase II and ensure its long-term sustainability past phases II and III by implementing
innovative and rigorous strategies. Phase II objectives will be achieved by pursuing the following specific aims:
1. Strengthen the AIM center through further development of its critical mass of investigators in the
interdisciplinary scientific areas of autophagy, inflammation, metabolism, and their intersections.
2. Strengthen the AIM center as a hub for advanced resources complementing other institutional
capabilities and contributing to the center’s long-term sustainability.
3. Strengthen scientific impact and diversity, while paving the path to sustainability of the AIM center at
local, regional, national and international levels and fostering connections with other IDeA programs."

Project Summary
The overall objective of the Yale Vision Research Core Program is to provide fundamental and innovative
technologies to support and enhance vision research at Yale University. With three key resource/service
Core modules, this Program will aid the ongoing research projects of vision investigators by providing
facilities and expertise that cannot be readily supported by individual research grants. The Core grant will
facilitate a collaborative environment that increases the scientific interactions between vision researchers
and extends interactions to researchers in other fields. The Core grant will facilitate the development of
vision research programs for new investigators at Yale and for established investigators interested in
entering the field of vision research.
Three Core modules are proposed to maximize impact on vision research at Yale. A Neurotechnology &
Fabrication Core will assist in the design, development and construction of a wide range of custom
experimental apparatus for vision research (e.g., microscopes, recording chambers, behavioral rigs). These
custom technologies will be used in studies that employ a range of model systems (e.g., fly, fish, mouse,
non-human primate, human, cell culture) and levels of analysis (e.g., single cell recording, functional
imaging, behavior). This module also supports the development of computer-machine interfaces and minor
programming applications. A Virus Production & Molecular Biology Core will produce high quality, high-titer
adeno-associated virus (AAV) as well as custom design of DNA constructs for a wide range of applications
at multiple levels of the visual system (e.g., retina, thalamus, superior colliculus, visual cortex). This module
will also offer consulting services for basic molecular biology and histology techniques, including genotyping
and immunostaining. An Imaging Core will provide physical facilities and intellectual resources for state-of-
the-art static and dynamic imaging of cells and tissues of the visual system. This module will provide
practical and didactic training on microscopes to maintain a high level of proficiency and expertise among
vision researchers. These three Core modules comprise a comprehensive Core Program that serves the
fundamental needs of vision researchers at Yale University."
10765603,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic, debilitating illness suffered by Veterans of the first Gulf War. Patients
suffering from GWI are often subject to years of medical uncertainty as they make their way through multiple
clinics to try to diagnose and ultimately treat their chronic symptoms, if possible. Complicating this medical
journey is the absence of biomarkers that can be used to diagnose the conditions and that might provide clues
as to treatments and etiology. A recent review of the evidence for biomarkers in GWI concluded that there
were no validated biomarkers for GWI. The lack of biomarkers is accompanied by a lack of treatments
demonstrated to work in a large number of Veterans. Epidemiologic studies have been successful in identifying
associations with exposures common to serving in the Gulf War through development of large cohorts of Gulf
War Veterans. Biomarker studies in small numbers of Gulf War Veterans have identified biomarkers for testing.
Among the most fruitful of these are studies of metabolomics, the analysis of all small molecules in blood or
tissue measured by specialized instruments capable of detecting very small quantities of metabolites and then
comparing them to known compounds. We will test a comprehensive set of metabolites assayed by the
Metabolon metabolomics platform covering over 60 metabolic pathways in over 1000 Veterans in the Gulf War
Era Cohort and Biorepository (GWECB), collected and made available to researchers by the VA Office of
Research and Development Gulf War Program. The metabolomics dataset will join data from other assays in
GWECB designed to interrogate other biological systems. Genome-wide genotyping tests how up to 1 million
genetic variants across the genome contribute to differences in Veterans with Gulf War Illness versus those
without. Likewise, genome-wide epigenetic assays test how up to 800,000 DNA modifications contribute
different levels of activity of genes across the genome. Putting these three modern biomedical technologies
together provides a comprehensive view of physiological differences in individuals. In combining these data
we hope to identify biological pathways that distinguish GWI Veterans and suggest treatments and biomarkers.
We also will analyze these combined datasets to test whether smaller clusters of symptoms that make up GWI
can identify specific subtypes of GWI related to the pathways we find. These data will be returned to the
GWECB data repository so that it can be made available to the Gulf War research community for additional
research."
10687168,"Invasive cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in women
worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience almost 90% of the global cervical-cancer
burden, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiencing the highest rates of cervical cancer. Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which also disproportionately affects SSA, greatly increases the risk of
cervical cancer. The World Health Organization now has a call-to-action for the elimination of cervical cancer,
which includes vaccination young adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV), the obligate viral cause of
cervical cancer, and screening mid-adult women for the early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities
before becoming cancerous. However, both the best strategy for treating cervical abnormalities in women living with
HIV (WLWH) from SSA and how to mitigate treatment failures are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we
propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the treatment effectiveness of two ablative methods of treatment,
gas-based cryotherapy and thermocoagulation, for treatment of CIN2/3 and high-risk HPV in WLWH women.
Eligible, confirmed WLWH women (n=5,014), ages 25-49 years, and living in Maputo, Mozambique, in
conjunction with the local PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) program, will be recruited to
participate in this trial when attending their routine HIV-care visit. Consenting WLWH will be screened by rapid,
point-of-care hrHPV DNA testing, unaided visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA), and “deep learning”-derived,
automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithm applied to a digital image captured on a cell phone, thereby
ensuring that most CIN2/3 in the population is identified and treated. Screen-positive (HPV, VIA, 6-mo AVE
positive) women will be 1) randomly assigned to either the GBC or thermocoagulation, 2) undergo a rigorous
colposcopic evaluation and biopsies to determine the (post-hoc) diagnosis of the cervical abnormality, and 3)
undergo their assigned treatment if ablation eligibility or LEEP if ineligible based on WHO guidelines8. Adverse
events and pain data will be collected systematically during the treatment visit and during an at-home, one month
post-treatment visit by community health workers. Six- and 18-month follow-up visits will be used to assess
effectiveness of these treatments against CIN2/3 and hrHPV. Nested studies will evaluate whether 1) specific
HPV genotypes, CD4 and HIV viral load, and/or lesion size, location, and severity (i.e. imperfect adherence to
WHO guidelines), are risk factors for treatment failures by each method and 2) deep-learning algorithms applied
to digital images can predict ablative treatment failures and thereby used in the future to triage screen-positive
women to LEEP instead of ablation and thereby potentially be avoided those treatment failures. Secondary
analyses will assess the effectiveness of 12 different S&T strategies based on different combinations of 6
screening methods (hrHPV with no triage, hrHPV with triage using HPV genotype groups, hrHPV with VIA triage,
hrHPV with AVE triage, VIA alone, or AVE alone) and two ablative methods."
10721347,"Antibiotic resistant infections disproportionately affect veterans and their families. Antibiotic resistant
Gram-negative bacterial infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality around the
globe, including the men and women actively serving in the armed forces, veterans, and patients in VA
hospitals. Options for antibiotic usage are in dangerous decline. Despite this health crisis, only 24 new
antibiotics have been approved since 1987. Most newer antibiotics are modifications or reformulations of
existing drugs. None of the recently approved antibiotics have novel mechanisms of action, severely
limiting mechanistic diversity among available drugs. The transcription factor DksA, an essential
component of the stringent response that regulates the pathogenesis of diverse Gram-negative bacteria,
is highly conserved among Gram-negative pathogens but is absent from humans. Informed by
bioinformatic modeling and structure-activity relationship (SAR), we have generated new chemical entities
(NCE) that bind to DksA and have antimicrobial activity against nontyphoidal Salmonella and several other
Gram-negative pathogens. Our preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluations indicate that one of our DksA
inhibitors is absorbed and distributed in rats, and exhibits excellent antibiotic activity in an acute murine
model of Salmonella infection. The ultimate goal of the proposed investigations is to develop soluble
compounds against the DksA transcriptional regulator that are endowed with potent antimicrobial activity
against Gram-negative pathogens. Specifically, we propose to 1) synthesize new DksA inhibitors with
improved antimicrobial activity, and 2) characterize ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion) properties and therapeutic potential of DksA inhibitors in animals. Synthesis of DksA inhibitors
will contribute to the rational development of novel antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria that affect
veterans and the general population."
10811570,"In addition to their metabolic and cardiovascular protective effects, statins reproducibly engage multiple
pathophysiological factors implicated in suicidal behavior - neuroinflammation, increased oxidative
stress, excitotoxicity, and endothelial dysfunction. Add-on statins have been also reported to improve
therapeutic control in physical and mental health. The Veterans’ persistent higher rates of suicide have
remained unabated challenges and, and thus, demanding new ways of understanding and engaging in
preventative efforts. The long-term objective of our group is to uncovering new modifiable targets, novel
and repurposed treatments in suicide prevention, and identifying individuals at risk who are likely to most
benefit from specific interventions. Macro-epidemiological approaches using electronic medical records
in suicide research are irreplaceable for their capability to account for multiple interactive risk factors,
moderators and confounders, and potential for immediate impact. The primary aims of the proposed
research project are to: 1) Estimate potentiating interactions between traumatic brain injury (TBI), a very
common condition in US Veterans, and inflammation-mediated medical conditions (IMCs: allergies,
infection, and autoimmune conditions), in predicting suicide in US Veterans. Our preliminary data
support hypothesizing synergistic interactions. 2) Estimate the suicide protective effect of sustained vs.
unsustained statin treatment 3) Identify demographic and clinical Veteran characteristics and
pharmacological statin features (dose, lipophilia, potency, duration) conducive to stronger attenuating
effects of statins on suicidal behavior. We will test these hypotheses on a Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) retrospective cohort (individuals with clinical encounters in VA Medical Centers nationwide
beginning in 2004 and followed for 13 years) including 5,446,318 Veterans with 28,749 suicides. The
Cox proportional hazard model will be applied to evaluate the interactions between TBI immune
mediated conditions , with Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI), the Attributable Proportion
(AP) due to interaction, and the Synergy Index (SI) to test synergism on an additive scale (Aim 1). A Cox
proportional hazard model will also be applied to testing risk attenuation with statins, with propensity
scoring for time-independent confounding and marginal structural Cox proportional hazards (Aim 2).
Finally, we will identify the demographic, clinical (diagnostic codes, medications, laboratory markers of
inflammation (e.g., white blood count) and pharmacological characteristic of Veterans expected to benefit
the most from sustained statin treatment using an aggregate machine learning approach (the
SuperLearner integrative methodology). Considering the high prevalence of TBI history and its ongoing
sequelae,( “a silent epidemic”) , especially in the VA, and confirming their synergistic interaction with
IMCs may contribute to developing suicide risk-attenuating interventions specifically for those
subpopulations. The PI’s preliminary data nested in Danish registers, our team’s piloting confirming
preliminarily a reduction in rates of psychiatric hospitalization (considered a proxy measure of suicide
risk) with statins in US Veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and treated with
psychotropic medication (Appendix 4C), and our successful evaluation of potential heterogenous effects
of an alternative modifiable suicide risk using the specific machine learning algorithms proposed in this
project (Appendix 4B) support our hypotheses, integration, and purpose, and overall, project completion
capability. Using tailored repurposed medications, such as statins, targeting specifically molecular,
cellular and histological mechanisms directly implicated in suicidal behavior, to individuals at risk who
are identified by machine learning to potentially derive the greatest benefit from treatment , may provide
a much-needed breakthrough in suicide risk management and prevention."
10814742,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CORE A
 Phase 1 of COBRE support established the Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The scientific theme of the CMDR is that identification of
molecular contributors to musculoskeletal dysfunction and disease will guide development of effective therapies.
The Center achieved key milestones during Phase 1, including mentoring and support of junior investigators to
the point of achieving independence, as defined by obtaining R01-level funding. These efforts, combined with
recruitment of established investigators, have significantly expanded the number of successful musculoskeletal
investigators in our Center. The three CMDR research cores established during Phase 1 also contributed to the
success of our junior investigators and other center members and significantly strengthened the biomedical
research infrastructure of our institution. An essential component of the effective operation of the CMDR was
establishment of the Administrative Core (Core A), which manages the infrastructure, oversight, and day-to-day
functioning of the Center. During Phase 2, the Administrative Core will continue to oversee all organizational and
budgetary aspects of the CMDR, supported by internal and external advisory committees (Aim 1). In addition,
the core will support CMDR growth via mentoring and a structured faculty development plan that will support
Project Leaders to point of R01-level funding (Aim 2). The Administrative Core will also recruit and promote the
development of new investigators via a Pilot Project Program, targeted recruitment of new investigators, and
evaluation of Center progress by the advisory committees (Aim 3). These goals will be accomplished under the
leadership of the Center Director and Associate Director who, with the support of experienced mentors and
advisory committees, will enable Project Leaders focused on musculoskeletal research to compete effectively
for R01-level funding. The Administrative Core will also oversee the operation of four Research Cores providing
state-of-the-art services to create new genetic models (Core B), perform specialized skeletal histology and bank
human bone tissue (Core C), provide bone imaging and quantification (Core D), and perform bioinformatic
analyses of large molecular datasets (Core E). The overall success of this strategy will be gauged by achieving
the following milestones within the five years of Phase 2 support: 1) three or more Project Leaders will obtain
R01-level research grant support; 2) three or more new Project Leaders will be selected and join the Center; 3)
Project Leaders and other Center members will publish between 25 and 50 peer-reviewed publications; and 4)
graduated Project Leaders and other members of the Center will develop productive collaborations and submit
a center-level grant application, such as a P01 or P30."
10720886,"It is now accepted that levels and diversity of bacteria present in tissues influence disease
progression, and numerous studies have characterized the microbiome in a variety of
neurological diseases and conditions and identified differences between patients and
healthy controls; specific species that produce metabolites that influence disease; and
shown that modifying the microbiome can alter the course of disease. The majority of
these studies, including in MS patients, examined the gut microbiome using fecal samples
as a surrogate for intestinal flora. However, the microbiome of the oral cavity has a similar
high degree of bacterial diversity, and is beginning to be used more often as an easier
source of samples. In preliminary studies we analyzed saliva DNA from a pair of
monozygotic twins discordant for MS (RRMS versus CIS), and found differences at all
taxonomic levels, with species differences greater than 30-fold. In new studies with
collaborators in France, we compared the oral biome of 12 MS patients to 24 healthy
controls, and found differences at the phylum and genus levels. We now propose to
replicate those studies in larger cohorts of MS patients using samples obtained from
African American and White Veterans with MS; and compare their oral biome to that of
race, gender and age matched controls. The biome will be determined by standard 16S
rRNA amplicon sequencing, and comparisons made using available software. We will test
if differences in relative abundance can distinguish between MS and controls, and if
differences are present in both AA and White MS patients. We will stratify the data to
determine if relative abundances are associated with age, gender, or ethnicity. We will
also measure levels of bacteria that produce butyrate, a powerful anti-inflammatory
molecule, which has been shown to be reduced in MS gut studies. Overall, a knowledge
of the oral microbiome will help guide therapeutic approaches designed to increase levels
of beneficial species, while reducing levels of potentially detrimental bacteria; and can
potentially be used to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy; and could
provide clues as to the contributing causes"
10748355,"Abstract
Treating substance use disorder (SUD) remains an unmet medical need, in part, due to its high relapse rate. During drug abstinence, re-exposure to cues previously associated with drug use triggers robust drug craving and seeking, leading to drug relapse. Rodent studies reveal that the glutamatergic projection from the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is targeted by cocaine experience to regulate cue-associated reward seeking. IL projections form monosynaptic connections on both of the two subtypes of principal, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the NAcSh, one predominantly expressing D1 dopamine receptors and the other expressing D2 receptors. Increasing evidence suggests that the IL-to-D1 vs. IL-to-D2 sub-projections undergo different adaptive changes after cocaine self-administration and differentially contribute to cocaine-associated behaviors. However, it remains poorly understood whether these IL sub-projections are changed through modification of existing synapses without changing the basic circuit connectivity, or through synapse formation or elimination that results in profound rewiring of circuit connectivity. The currently proposed work will address this knowledge gap by focusing on cocaine-generated AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-silent synapses, a type of glutamatergic synapses that contains NMDA receptors without functionally stable AMPARs. Silent synapses can be generated de novo via synaptogenesis and, upon AMPAR insertion and maturation, create and stabilize new network connections. Conversely, silent synapses can also stem from pre-existing synapses through AMPAR internalization, and this initial synaptic weakening may lead to the eventual synapse elimination to reduce network connections. Preliminary studies reveal that cocaine self-administration generated silent synapses in both the IL-to-D1 and IL-to-D2 sub-projections, which anatomically and functionally correlated with synaptogenesis vs. synaptic weakening, respectively. These and other results lead to the central hypothesis that silent synapse-mediated strengthening vs. weakening are simultaneously induced within the IL-to-D1 and IL-to-D2 sub-projections, respectively, after cocaine withdrawal, and the resulting circuit remodeling differentially contributes to cue-induced cocaine seeking. To test this hypothesis, the proposed experiments will (1) characterize the anatomical and electrophysiological consequences of silent synapse-mediated remodeling of IL-to-D1 and IL-to-D2 sub-projections, (2) determine the role of each of the remodeled IL-to-NAcSh sub-projections in formation of neuronal ensembles that potentially encode cue-induced cocaine seeking, and (3) determine how each of the remodeled IL-to-NAcSh sub-projections influences cue-induced cocaine seeking and motivation to obtain cocaine after withdrawal from cocaine. These objectives are highly relevant to the mission of the NIDA, NIH, as the resulting findings will provide novel, circuit-based mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce drug seeking and relapse."
10916327,"HABS-HD OVERALL ABSTRACT
The 2018 AT(N) framework provided the field with the first biological conceptualization of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) for the explicit purpose of advancing clinical trials. In fact, the first amyloid-lowering drug (aducanumab)
has now received FDA clearance. However, nearly all data supporting the framework itself, as well as clinical
trials, comes from research among non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals. By 2060 the U.S. will become
largely “non-white” with 15% of the population being African American (AA) and 27.5% being Hispanic (65% of
which are Mexican American [MA]). Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the relevance of the
AT(N) framework, and associated biomarker-based therapeutics, for 43% of the U.S. population. AAs currently
have the highest burden of AD and AD related dementias (ADRD) while Hispanics will experience the greatest
increase in AD/ADRDs by 2060. Moreover, Milestone 1 of the NIA AD+ADRD Implementation Milestones
explicitly call for examination of “early mechanistic pathways of multiple etiologies” (1.I), sociocultural (1.I) and
exposome (1.B) factors among community-based cohorts that include cutting edge imaging, fluid, genetic and
other biomarkers in diverse populations to understand health disparities in AD. The Health & Aging Brain
Study – Health Disparities (HABS-HD) is the first large-scale, community-based project to simultaneously study
each of the AT(N) defined biomarkers, in alignment with the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework,
across the three most prevalent racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., AA, MA, and NHW. The Aims of the HABS-HD
U19 are as follows: Aim 1: To collect imaging, clinical, biological and genetic data which will result in the
largest longitudinal cohort of diverse populations that examines AT(N) biomarkers across adulthood. Aim 2: To
collect life-course exposome (via the Area Deprivation Index), as well as sociocultural data and examine how
these factors affect the timing, sequence and trajectories of AT(N) biomarkers among diverse populations. Aim
3: To disseminate HABS-HD data and samples to the global scientific community. HABS-HD data will be made
available via LONI while biofluid samples will be made available through the HABS-HD Omics Core. Genomics
data will be made available per NIH/NIA guidelines. The long-term goal of HABS-HD is to establish population-
specific informed precision medicine for novel treatment and prevention strategies for AD. To advance this
goal, we will conduct the following Projects: Project 1) Examine the timing, sequence and trajectories of AT(N)
biomarkers across diverse populations; Project 2) Examine the impact of vascular, metabolic and inflammatory
factors on the timing, sequence and trajectories of AT(N) biomarkers across diverse populations; and Project
3) Examine the impact of the exposome (via neighborhood disadvantage) and sociocultural factors on the
timing, sequence and trajectories of AT(N) biomarkers across diverse populations."

Over the past 20 years, the SPORE in Prostate Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has made
significant advances in prostate cancer research and treatment, using the evolving mechanistic understanding
of the drivers of tumor growth to improve patient management across the clinical spectrum of the disease.
Applying a biomarker- based, risk-adapted approach, our work has led to the development of new diagnostic
blood tests and prognostic models to distinguish indolent from clinically significant cancers, the discovery of
new therapeutic targets, their validation in preclinical models, and the successful development of drugs
directed to them in trials designed according to the recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3.
Our efforts have impacted clinical practice worldwide.
The overall objectives of our SPORE are: 1) to interrogate the genomics and molecular pathways relevant to
prostate cancer progression, 2) to identify and validate clinically relevant biomarkers, and 3) to develop novel
agents and therapeutic strategies. In the next 5 years, we propose 3 research projects to address new clinical
challenges that have emerged in the context of the evolving landscape of prostate cancer. For localized
disease, the challenges are to identify patients at high risk for metastasis and death and to determine optimal
upfront treatment to improve cure. To address this, RP-1 will determine germline and somatic genomic
features associated with disease progression in high-risk localized disease and RP-2 will determine the role of
signaling from the prostate microenvironment in resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy and determine the
efficacy of targeting these signals. For patients with metastatic disease, the widespread adoption of potent
next-generation androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors has changed the landscape of prostate cancer,
highlighting the need for therapeutic strategies for cancers that develop AR independence. Previously our
SPORE characterized the AR-independent “lineage plasticity” disease state as driven by TP53 and RB1 loss.
RP-3 now seeks to better define the genomic heterogeneity inherent in this disease state and evaluate novel
therapeutic strategies. PARP inhibitors were recently approved for metastatic cancers with DNA damage repair
mutations, but the response rate is only ~50%. RP-1 will define the genomic context that predicts for PARP
inhibitor response."
11159270,"Project Summary (Abstract)
We propose to build a novel gamma imaging device based on the combination of Compton and proximity
reconstructions in order to achieve unprecedented sensitivities that will enable in vivo imaging of biodistributions
of 225Ac, a promising Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) isotope. TAT has demonstrated a remarkable efficacy and
specificity for cancer radiotherapy. This is due to the high linear energy transfer and the short free path of alpha
particles that result in a higher and more localized energy deposition than that of beta particles. 225Ac is a very
promising alpha-emitter that has successfully shown excellent results on the treatment of a number of
malignancies, namely, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid
leukemia. A key aspect of TAT is the targeting radiopharmaceutical that transports the 225Ac to the carcinogenic
cells, preventing free isotopes from delivering a highly toxic radioactive dose to healthy tissue. However,
development of novel radiopharmaceuticals is currently limited by the inability of commercial imaging systems
to detect 225Ac in vivo. As a result, their pharmacokinetics cannot be fully understood in clinical applications,
delaying their FDA approval and hindering the wide adoption of TAT. 225Ac and its daughters can be imaged
through the detection of the gamma rays emitted in their decay chain, but the main challenge of this technique
(and the reason why current gamma ray imaging systems are not suitable for this task) is that the gamma ray
emission activity is extremely low due to the very small doses injected in human patients (0.1MBq/kg) and in
preclinical studies (1MBq/kg in mice) to prevent a morbid toxicity. In this scenario, an apparatus with a high
gamma ray detection sensitivity is necessary in order to provide images with exposures no longer than a few
minutes. We plan to achieve this unprecedented sensitivity by designing a dedicated gamma camera that
integrates Compton and proximity imaging in a multi-modality system. These techniques have been successfully
in medical imaging applications, but they have never been combined in the same device in order to improve
sensitivity and image quality at the same time. To achieve this goal, we propose to quantitatively image Ac-225
in vivo the first time with a Cadmium Zinc Telluride dual-head camera that enables both Compton and proximity
imaging. To reach this goal we plan to 1) assemble Compton and proximity gamma camera; 2) develop a multi-
modality reconstruction algorithm for Compton and proximity imaging; 3) demonstrate in vivo imaging of 225Ac
with the final prototype and perform first in vivo pharmacokinetics study of two 225Ac radiopharmaceuticals,
providing a proof of principle in pre-clinical conditions using phantoms and mice. The outcome from this project
will be a prototype gamma camera able to image distributions of 225Ac TAT radiopharmaceuticals in-vivo (and
potentially other TAT isotopes), and thus, enabling the complete study of their pharmacokinetics to accelerate
their development. With our system, we expect to increase the understanding and confidence in TAT."
10830242,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol withdrawal is a critical component of development and persistence of addiction to alcohol and a cause
for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Introduction of
benzodiazepines resulted in reduced severity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), and decreased mortality
and frequency of complications. While research suggests involvement of certain neurotransmitter systems in
the neurobiology of AWS, genetic markers associated with predisposition to AWS and its treatment response
remain unknown. We therefore propose to perform comprehensive genetic analyses, including genome-wide
association studies (GWASs), to identify genetic markers of AWS risk and response to benzodiazepine
treatment of AWS. The proposed analyses will constitute the largest GWAS of AWS to date, with a sample
size of AUD subjects 10 times larger than the only previously published AWS GWAS, and the first GWAS of
benzodiazepine response. We will also investigate sex differences in genetic effects on AWS and
response to its treatment. Our study will involve advanced analyses, including assessment of SNP-based
heritability of AWS along with gene and pathway-level analyses (including drug-target enrichment) and
fine-mapping to detect relevant genetic effects. We will also use polygenic risk scores to determine if
genetic load for AUD-related traits is associated with AWS. The proposed study is aligned with NIAAA policy,
which states that GWAS is “the preferred approach for the identification of and the confirmation of genes that
harbor variants that contribute to AUD and related phenotypes, since results from these studies will likely
provide potential insights into translational studies and new therapeutic targets”. The proposed research also
supports NIH efforts to increase awareness and attention to sex and gender in research. Our preliminary data
and power calculations demonstrate that analysis of available data is expected to identify common genetic
variants associated with AWS. Discovery of genetic variants that impact the risk of AWS will generate
knowledge on its neurobiology and ultimately contribute to the development of tools for the
identification of patients at risk and selection of treatment options based on an understanding of inter-
individual differences in sensitivity to this central component of AUD. This line of research may also
contribute to development of new AUD treatment approaches aimed to restore physiological
dysfunction associated with those genetic variants."
10782969,"Veterinary students are particularly qualified in comparative medicine, a training that is an invaluable
resource in animal model research. However, most students do not pursue research careers because
of a lack of exposure to biomedical research. This competing renewal proposal for our Summer
Veterinary Student Research Program (SVSRP) at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary
Medicine (VMCVM) will train veterinary medicine students in research skills and encourage them to
pursue research careers. We will recruit from all 30 accredited veterinary medical schools in the nation,
particularly from Tuskegee and Mississippi Universities, to recruit underrepresented minorities. A total
of six new DVM-seeking scholars will be recruited each year during the next five-year funding period of
the program. SVSRP will provide students with experience in research areas that couple student
interests with infectious disease, immunology and inflammation, neuroscience, and oncology/clinical
research. The Advisory and Selection Committee will assign mentors to applicants based on applicant
interests. Students will receive training in writing research proposals and scientific papers, experimental
design, biostatistics, reports, presentations, and visual display of quantitative information. Their training
will also include the humane use of animal models, human subjects research, responsible conduct of
research led by speakers with expertise in human experimentation, the Belmont Report, the Animal
Welfare Act, scientific integrity, and rigor and reproducibility. A unique feature of this program will be
visiting the NIH, USDA, FDA, and other agencies in Washington, DC, and Bethesda, MD, to see first-
hand the role of veterinarians at these institutions and learn how public policy is influenced by research.
After completing orientation and writing a research proposal, students will spend nine weeks conducting
hands-on research in the mentor's laboratory. To sustain interest in biomedical research, we will
organize a weekly meeting with successful DVM researchers from academia, government, or
biotech/biopharma industries. VMCVM, since 1995 has successfully administered summer research
training programs, culminating in training 189 DVM students in biomedical research. Since
administering this T35 SVSRP in 2006, we have completed essentially all that we originally proposed
during the last 14 years. Renewing this SVSRP will enable the VMCVM to continue providing
opportunities and training to DVM students in biomedical research and encourage pursuing a research-
based career."
10720898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently diagnosed type of dementia within the Veterans Affairs (VA)
Medical System. Currently no treatment is available to slow down or stop neurodegenerative processes of AD.
My research program has an ongoing interest of developing IND-enabling novel therapeutic strategies for AD.
We focus on studying a novel target to improve cognitive function, called synaptojanin 1 (synj1) and several lines
of data from my research group as well as others suggest beneficial effects of synj1 reduction in AD. Synj1 is
the main phosphoinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) degrading enzyme in the brain and synapses. Increased synj1
expression and activities have been associated with cognitive decline and pathological processes of AD, such
as enlargement of early endosomes and ApoE4-induced cognitive deficits. The synj1 polymorphisms identified
in early- and late-onset familial AD subjects are associated with age of onset, and increased synj1 expression
correlates with cognitive deficits and place cell dysfunction. In addition, insoluble synj1 is increased and
accumulated around plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles in AD human brains,
particularly in APOE4+ AD brains. Genetic knockdown of synj1 attenuates AD-related pathological changes and
behavioral deficits. Specifically, down-regulation of synj1 with elevated PIP2 levels protect against oligomer Ab-
induced toxic effects on synaptic integrity and promotes Aβ clearance through the endo-lysosomal pathway.
Partial knockdown of synj1 reverses ApoE4-induced lysosomal defects and improves behavior deficits in ApoE4
knock-in mouse models, as well as multiple animal models of familial AD (FAD) and Down syndrome. Down-
regulation of synj1 also rescues mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced PIP2 dysregulation and prevents
development of tau hyper-phosphorylation. Recently, we have gathered data suggesting a role of synj1 reduction
in modulating microglial function and neuro-inflammation in AD. Together, these studies support beneficial
effects of synj1 reduction in AD. We have been developing scaffolds of novel small molecules with synj1-lowering
capabilities and identified an FDA-approved drug (nimodipine) that reduces synj1 protein and Aβ levels both in
vitro and in vivo. It also improved cognitive function in AD mouse models in short-term treatment. However,
chronic administration of nimodipine failed to reduce brain Aβ42 levels (particularly insoluble fractions), or to
improve cognitive function. We then developed nimodipine structural analogs using medicinal chemistry
approaches to potentiate its synj1-lowering effects (on-target effects) and reduce its calcium channel activity (off-
target side effects). Two nimodipine derivatives: SynaptoCpd #9 and Cpd #6 were selected from hit-to-lead
screening and lead optimization, exhibiting improved oral bioavailability and increased long-term in vivo efficacy
when compared to their parent compound nimodipine using both familial and sporadic AD mouse models
(PCT/US2018/062020 filed by the VA Tech Transfer). These findings establish the foundation at the level of
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to treat AD with synj1-lowering agents. The objectives of the project are to perform the
IND-enabling studies of two lead compounds in preparation of the IND application and phase I clinical trial
studies. We will: 1) perform in vitro ADME and in vivo DMPK studies of SynaptoCpd #9 and Cpd #6 (Aim 1);
followed by 2) pharmacodynamic studies (acute dosing range finding and chronic efficacy studies) as well as
exploratory toxicity studies (Aim 2); 3) develop target engagement and surrogate biomarkers for SynaptoCpd
#9 and Cpd #6 (Aim 3) using previously stored plasma samples from mice treated with SynaptoCpd #9 and Cpd
#6 (preventive and therapeutic treatment paradigms), as well as new samples collected from DMPK studies
(Aim 1) and PD/toxicity studies (Aim 2). The goals of this application aim to facilitate next step IND application
with ultimate goals of transitioning into clinical studies and the commercialization of our novel AD therapies."
10825625,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunosuppressed transplant patients have heightened susceptibility to environmental pathogens as well as
adventitious agents traveling with donor tissues or resident in the recipient. Traditional therapies target the virus
and are thereby limited in effectiveness to the specific virus targeted. Evrys Bio is developing orally administered,
broad-spectrum antivirals that target the host-cell sirtuin-2 protein (SIRT2). In vitro feasibility was
demonstrated in SBIR Phase I for an early lead, FLS-359, showing broad effectiveness against four families of
viruses posing problems for immunosuppressed transplant patients: herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, hepatitis
viruses, and respiratory viruses. Additionally, SIRT2-targeting with FLS-359 blocked acquisition of viral drug
resistance in an influenza model and was additive in antiviral activity with traditional direct-acting antivirals. A
prototype was developed in SBIR Phase II, allowing selection of a Drug Candidate (DC) for Investigational New
Drug (IND)-enablement that satisfied the in vitro Target Compound Profile with respect to antiviral potency and
ADME, and in vivo oral bioavailability, target engagement, and tolerability. The DC is designated EV-100. In this
SBIR Phase IIB application, we request funding to advance EV-100 toward an IND filing. The clinical trial will
be designed to test the utility of EV-100 for prophylaxis of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and disease
in adult HCMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. To advance to the
IND filing, we will establish relationships between EV-100 dose, pharmacokinetic parameters, efficacy, and
toxicity. We will conduct non-GLP dose range finding safety studies in rats and dogs, and efficacy studies in
murine HCMV viral challenge models to provide guidance and minimize risk with dosing regimen selection for
costly GLP and clinical studies. In addition, we will perform studies to address published FDA in vitro virology
study recommendations that will support an IND filing. These studies will include the assessment of EV-100
antiviral activity versus multiple laboratory and clinical HCMV isolates, including the analysis of EV-100
inhibitory activity toward HCMV variants that are resistant to currently approved drugs; testing for the evolution
of viral drug resistance during serial passage of HCMV in increasing concentrations of EV-100 in cell culture;
evaluation of EV-100 efficiency in combination with currently approved anti-HCMV drugs; delineation of EV-
100 as a function of HCMV dose; and additional parameters that help to predict the efficacy of EV-100 in
transplant recipients. Finally, although HCMV prophylaxis is the intended initial indication, the broad-spectrum
antiviral profile against human viruses is a potential breakthrough feature of EV-100. The drug has already been
shown to inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses in addition to HCMV that can threaten both the organ and the
survival of the patient following a transplant. In vitro studies in human cells and in vivo studies in humanized
in mice will be performed to further evaluate this potentially unique broad-spectrum utility of EV-100."
10814743,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CORE B
 Project Leaders supported by the Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) and other members
of the Center will require the generation of new genetically modified mice to accomplish the goals of their
proposed studies. The Genetic Models Core established at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS)
during Phase 1 of this COBRE will serve these needs. This core was an outgrowth of an existing transgenic
mouse core with a strong record of producing transgenic mice. Expansion of this facility during Phase 1, made
possible by COBRE support, allowed the core to effectively serve Project Leaders, other members of the CMDR,
and investigators at affiliated institutions and across Arkansas. For Phase 2, we propose to build on this success
by maintaining the high-quality services provided by the Core and working to develop new services based on
cutting-edge technologies. In Aim 1, we propose to maintain the Genetic Models Core for Project Leaders and
other CMDR members by implementing a successful business plan to operate a facility dedicated to the
generation, use, and maintenance of genetically modified mice. In Aim 2, we will provide genetic-model services
to Project Leaders and other CMDR members. Generation services will include the design and creation of
transgenic or gene-edited mice by pronuclear injection. Maintenance services will include sperm
cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and strain rederivation. New approaches will be developed and existing
approaches will be optimized in collaboration with Project Leaders and other CMDR members. Core personnel
will continuously update gene-editing tools for mouse modification via evaluation of current literature and
attendance at workshops and meetings. In Aim 3, we propose to continue to provide training and education
related to the use of genetic models. Project Leaders and other users will be trained to efficiently and accurately
produce experimental cohorts of genetically modified mice, and we will educate users on potential problems that
are often encountered with the use of such models. Core personnel will also educate the research communities
at UAMS and other campuses in Arkansas about the services and technologies available through the Genetic
Models Core. The scientific theme of the CMDR is that identification of molecular contributors to musculoskeletal
dysfunction and disease will guide development of effective therapies. The Genetic Models Core is consistent
with this theme in that it will allow Project Leaders to rapidly and efficiently test the roles of specific molecular
changes in pathological processes that affect the skeleton or in which the skeleton plays a major role."

 The scientific theme of the Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is that identification of molecular contributors to musculoskeletal
dysfunction and disease will guide development of effective therapies. Three research projects will investigate
different conditions involving the musculoskeletal system. Each of these projects will generate large datasets for
genome-wide characterization of experimental samples. These datasets will contribute to deep molecular
characterization and enable comprehensive monitoring of cellular processes. However, the amount of data
generated is vast, its dimensionality is high, and it is typically difficult to handle and analyze. Therefore, effective
extraction of meaningful information from these datasets will require personnel with the appropriate expertise,
as well as access to the necessary computational facilities. To address these needs, we will maintain the
established CMDR Bioinformatics Core (Core E), which assembles the experienced personnel, equipment (high-
performance computing server and large-scale data storage facility), and computational algorithms to provide
comprehensive computational analysis of large datasets to meet the needs of the Project Leaders and other
CMDR members (Aim 1). We will provide comprehensive bioinformatics services to these investigators and
develop new services tailored to their evolving specific research project needs via custom bioinformatics analysis
pipelines derived from up-to-date computational algorithms and biological knowledge databases (Aim 2). We will
also provide training and education related to the use of bioinformatics so that Project Leaders and other users
will be better able to understand and use the principles and concepts of bioinformatics methods related to their
research (Aim 3). Core E will consist of personnel who have strong bioinformatics skills, appropriate biological
knowledge, and experience working with investigators in musculoskeletal biology. The team will provide
advanced bioinformatics guidance, systems biology guidance, and in-depth analyses at all stages of genome-
wide experiments. Through interaction with Core E personnel, Project Leaders and other CMDR members will
acquire bioinformatics skills and expertise that will have long-term benefits for them individually and for the
Center as a whole. Core E will enable Project Leaders as well as other CMDR members to rapidly and efficiently
integrate the results obtained from the other CMDR cores — the Genetic Models Core; the Histology,
Biomechanics, and Human Tissue Core; and the Bone Imaging Core. In turn, bioinformatics analyses will prompt
the creation of new genetic models and guide the interpretation of imaging, histological, and biomechanical
analyses. Overall, access to the cutting-edge resources of Core E, and the critical mass of investigators that it
supports, will greatly strengthen the musculoskeletal research communities at UAMS and in Arkansas."
10814753,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
 Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells that produce large amounts of collagen and must maintain protein
homeostasis to prevent cell dysfunction and death. Altered protein homeostasis in osteoblasts may contribute to
the pathology of skeletal diseases such as Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Autophagy recycles cellular
components by delivering them to lysosomes for degradation. In macroautophagy, cargo, such as aggregated
protein, is sequestered in double-membrane vesicles and delivered to lysosomes, while in chaperone-mediated
autophagy (CMA), individual proteins are delivered by chaperones. We have shown that deletion of Atg7, a gene
essential for macroautophagy, from osteoblasts causes low bone mass and fractures. This was associated with
low osteoblast number and disruption of the osteocyte network. Osteocytes, which differentiate from osteoblasts,
are buried in the bone matrix and sense changes in biomechanical load to orchestrate bone formation and
resorption. The mechanisms by which loss of macroautophagy in osteoblasts and osteocytes cause low bone
mass remain unclear. To examine the role of CMA in osteoblasts and osteocytes, we created mice lacking
Lamp2a, which is essential for CMA, and this also caused low bone mass, but to a milder degree than loss of
macroautophagy. Studies in other cell types suggest that CMA may be important mainly under conditions of
cellular stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress. In line with this, we found that osteoblasts lacking CMA
are more vulnerable to apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and produce more RANKL, a cytokine
that stimulates formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Based on this, we hypothesize that macroautophagy
and CMA promote the differentiation, survival, and function of osteoblast lineage cells by maintaining
proteostasis and we propose the following aims. Aim 1 will identify mechanisms by which deletion of Atg7
reduces osteoblast number by measuring proliferation and apoptosis, and by using single cell RNA sequencing
to examine differentiation. We will also determine if loss of Atg7 alters the response of the tibia to mechanical
loading. Aim 2 will determine if loss of CMA worsens the skeletal phenotype of a murine model of OI to reveal if
CMA protects osteoblasts and osteocytes from endoplasmic reticulum stress. Aim 3 will determine whether
genetic stimulation of macroautophagy improves osteoblast function and reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress
in a murine model of OI. Successful completion of these studies will clarify the role of macroautophagy and CMA
in osteoblast lineage cells may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in conditions such as OI."
10782438,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-TBI neurological sequelae are a major medical concern for US military
veterans. There is no effective therapy to battle the catastrophic neurological disabilities after TBI, in part
because most neuroprotective therapies against TBI target gray matter but neglect the importance of white
matter (WM) injury, the degree of which dictates the severity of long-term neurological deficits. A persistent
proinflammatory microenvironment after TBI is considered one underlying mechanism that exacerbates WM
injury and hinders WM repair. Microglia and macrophages (Mi/MΦ) are important mediators of post-TBI immune
and inflammatory responses and can assume diverse functional states in response to specific
microenvironmental signals. Accumulating evidence suggests that the different functional phenotypes of Mi/MΦ
contribute considerably to the regulation of inflammatory status of injured WM and ultimately impact WM integrity.
Specifically, an inflammation-resolving and protective/reparative phenotype of Mi/MΦ is essential for mitigating
WM injury and facilitating WM repair because they resolve local inflammation, clear broken myelin sheath or
cellular debris, and supply trophic factors for brain remodeling. The key molecular switches and networks that
determine the overall functional state of Mi/MΦ after TBI are poorly understood.
 To fill this critical scientific gap, we propose to investigate salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) as novel regulators
of Mi/MΦ functions after experimental TBI. SIKs potently control gene expression by directly acting on several
specific transcriptional regulators. Thus, SIK activation lies at the apex of a decision tree for arbitrating between
polymorphic, often-opposing immune responses in Mi/MΦ. The scientific premise underlying the engagement of
SIK as a candidate biological target for TBI is its ability to titrate immune balance toward inflammation-resolving
and protective/reparative phenotypes, while avoiding indiscriminate suppression of immune function.
 The scientific premise of this proposal is also strengthened by our new preliminary discoveries: 1) TBI
elevates SIK1 expression and activity (phosphorylation) in Mi/MΦ but not in other brain cells in mice; 2)
Tamoxifen-induced selective knockout of SIK1 in Mi/MΦ (mKO) improves long-term sensorimotor functions and
spatial memory after TBI, confirming a crucial role of Mi/MΦ SIK1 in TBI neurological outcomes; 3)
Mechanistically, SIK1 mKO drives Mi/MΦ toward an inflammation-resolving and protective/reparative phenotype
after TBI, thus restricting axonal injury and promoting WM repair; 4) Intraperitoneal delivery of YKL-05-099 (YKL),
a novel selective SIK inhibitor, attenuates neuroinflammation and neurological deficits after TBI. Accordingly, the
proposed studies will test the core hypothesis that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SIK1
improves white matter restoration and long-term TBI outcomes by dual mechanisms: 1) protecting
against early axonal injury by promoting inflammation-resolving Mi/MΦ responses; and 2) enhancing
chronic-stage white matter restoration by promoting a reparative Mi/MΦ phenotype.
 If funded, we will tackle three Specific Aims in a timely and efficient manner. Aim 1: Test if administration
of a selective SIK inhibitor improves long-term TBI outcomes for up to 20 weeks. We will assess the therapeutic
effects of the SIK inhibitor YKL, delivered i.p. after controlled cortical impact (CCI) to adult C57BL/6 mice of both
sexes. Aim 2: Test if YKL attenuates axonal injury at acute/subacute stages via inhibition of SIK1-dependent
neurotoxic Mi/MΦ responses. This mechanistic aim will study the role of Mi/MΦ SIK1 using tamoxifen-induced
Mi/MΦ-specific SIK1 knockout (SIK1 mKO) and wild-type control mice of both sexes. Aim 3: Test if YKL or SIK1
mKO promotes WM restoration and long-term recovery after TBI for up to 20 weeks by fostering a neurotrophic/
pro-repair Mi/MΦ phenotype.
 A rigorously confirmed beneficial effect of YKL would facilitate its clinical translation into a novel potential
therapeutic for TBI to enhance brain rehabilitation and improve the quality of life for veterans suffering TBI."

of the center by supporting research in three new cross-cutting thematic areas: The Neurobiology of Learning
and Memory, Neuromodulation and Assessment, and Advanced Computational Modeling. The cross-cutting
themes bridge across animal models and human translational research, and across disciplines. The cross-
cutting themes reflect the planned enhancements of the research cores, knit together the current projects, will
guide priorities for faculty recruitment and future pilot grant and replacement project grant selection, and will
inform future program development initiatives. Further development of the CNAP center and its associated
programs will propel us toward achieving our goal of improving cognitive and neural functioning in both healthy
populations and in individuals with specific diseases or disorders. CNAP center development will be advanced
through the achievement of four specific aims: (1) To promote R01 award success for CNAP project and pilot
grant leaders. In Phase 2, we will support three new research project leaders who have strong potential to
transition to R01-level support. In addition, following the success of our active pilot grant program in Phase 1,
we will continue to fund pilot grants annually in Years 2-5, providing further opportunities for graduation of
junior investigators to R01-level research support. (2) To continue to develop a critical mass of researchers in
cognitive/neural plasticity through recruitment of new CNAP members. We will recruit three new tenure-track
faculty in research areas relevant to the CNAP cross-cutting themes. We will further expand CNAP
membership by funding new pilot grants and expanding the research cores. (3) To further improve research
infrastructure by expanding three multi-user core laboratory facilities. We will expand the Behavioral
Neuroscience Core, Cognitive Neuroscience Core, and Neuroinformatics Core by adding significant new
capabilities to promote access to modern neuroscience and computational modeling techniques. (4) To
enhance the research capabilities of CNAP center members through strengthening the Scientific Exchange
Network (SEN). The SEN will provide CNAP researchers access to additional core facilities and training to
increase their capability to secure extramural funding. Achieving these aims will further advance a thriving
thematic research center that will increase the understanding of cognitive and neural mechanisms of plasticity.
CNAP will attract extramural funding through individual investigator and partnership grants, will promote a rich
research climate for fostering investigator development, will continue to enhance research infrastructure, and
will provide a pathway to long-term center sustainability by the end of Phase 3."

Overall
The Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation seeks to push the technological frontier of
optical coherence tomography instrumentation and methods in response to challenges in biology and
medicine. Fundamental to our approach, CBORT thrives on an intimate, push-pull relationship between
physicists/engineers and biological, pre-clinical and clinical scientists. The most direct impact of the
NCBIB will be to develop and provide broad access to powerful new tools for biological and clinical
research. Facilitating rapid, high-resolution, high-contrast imaging through tailored, application-specific
instruments will accelerate and open new avenues of biomedical research. Results of this effort may
include, for example, the identification of new methods for diagnosis, new insights into disease or
disease progression, or the formulation of new therapeutic strategies or drug targets. Further, the
resulting biological and clinical research will identify new opportunities for commercialization of
technology. By developing and making innovative and effective OCT technology available, we
anticipate that there will be rapid progress and significant advances in each of these areas.
Training and dissemination of OCT instruments and methods is another priority of CBORT. Regular
symposia and workshops foster a broader communication within the field, provide access to results of
research, and offer a hand-on experience with the construction, operation, and interpretation of data
from state-of-the-art imaging systems. External users additionally have access to imaging systems
within the Center to conduct focused experiments or to generate preliminary data. CBORT can also
place imaging systems off-site for clinical or pre-clinical pilot studies.
The Specific Aims of the TRD projects include the development of three-dimensional, high resolution
retinal polarimetry and angiography, the development of a novel surgical guidance imaging system
based on circular ranging OCT, and the development of polarimetry with optic axis mapping through
narrow gauge needle probes.
Our proposed research is significant to medicine in that it will provide new tools for the diagnosis of
vascular and retinal diseases, new methods for precise, guided surgery, and a unique capability for
quantitative polarimetry.
Individual TRD projects contribute to the overall theme and goals of the program by pursuing the
fundamental building blocks of OCT instrumentation, technology and methods. The TRD projects are
highly synergistic in their cross-pollination of ideas and approaches and their mutual dependence on
advances in fiberoptics, novel lasers, and unique signal and image processing techniques. Additionally,
there is a strong component of artificial intelligence and machine learning underpinning each TRD."
10910027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite recognition of the broad consequences of inflammation in cancer biology, the mechanistic impact on the
tumor landscape remains incompletely understood. Indeed, innate and adaptive immune functions in cancer can
be beneficial or detrimental and the opposing roles highlight the gap of knowledge in our understanding of how
inflammation sculpts the tumor microenvironment (TME). This Program Project will address this gap of
knowledge by defining and delineating how cytokines modulate the functions of the multiple cell types composing
the tumor microenvironment. Our previous work has revealed the potential for these inflammatory cytokines to
regulate a spectrum of cancer cell phenotypes, including their self-renewal and cellular hierarchy or stemness,
that are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, these phenotypes are
commonly associated with cancer progression through modulation of differentiation potential, cell-cell
interactions and mobility, fibrosis, and sensitivity to multiple therapeutic modalities. The program is now centered
on two major themes. The first is to define the signaling mechanisms that govern how cytokines (type I IFNs, IL-
17,TGFβ) modulate (both positively and negatively) the EMT process. The cellular targets include stem-like
tumor cells as well as the non-tumor derived populations, including fibroblasts and immune cells. The second
theme relates these cell-specific EMT responses to specific effects on metastasis, fibrosis, and resistance to
multiple therapeutic strategies. Our major goal is to parlay our improved understanding of cytokine effects in the
TME into specific improvements in cancer therapy. Collectively the three projects in the application will test the
following overarching hypothesis: Cytokine signals have distinct and sometimes conflicting mechanistic roles in
cancer progression though alterations in EMT and cancer stem cell development. Such mechanisms lead to
critical phenotypic properties responsible for continuous metastatic spread and resistance to multiple therapeutic
modalities (chemotherapy, immune therapy). This hypothesis will be tested by (1) defining the signaling events
initiated by TGFβ, IL-17, and/or Type I IFNs and the endpoint changes in specific gene expression that are
causally linked with control of TME and cancer cell phenotypes, (2) determination of how these specific signaling
pathways and gene expression events are mechanistically responsible for acquisition of therapeutic resistance
and (3) evaluation of the distinct cell type contributions to tumor phenotypes and therapeutic resistance, with
emphasis on tumor cell intrinsic mechanisms, immune cell infiltrates and activities, and stromal cell control of
tumor access."
10904783,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Wisconsin Head and Neck SPORE is designed to promote translational laboratory and clinical research to
improve overall outcome for patients with Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). This highly collaborative research links
basic scientists with HNC clinicians to advance novel treatment strategies for this complex cancer population.
These patients bear a disproportionate burden from their cancers based on the critical anatomic location of the
disease for which treatment can compromise speech, swallow, and breathing function, in addition to creating
significant alterations in physical appearance and capacity for social interaction. Efforts to improve cure rates
must be carefully balanced with efforts to reduce treatment toxicity to enable enhanced overall quality of life for
patients. The broad objectives of this SPORE are to: 1) Promote multidisciplinary translational research in HNC,
2) Improve overall survival and quality of life for patients with HNC, 3) Incorporate new predictive models to test
novel HNC treatment strategies, 4) Improve understanding of how immune modulation can augment
conventional and experimental treatment responses in HNC, 5) Translate promising new molecules developed
at the University of Wisconsin and from Industry through preclinical testing and into HNC clinical trials. The
Wisconsin HN SPORE has designed three primary research projects. Project 1 will combine targeted
radionuclide therapies (TRT) with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) to stimulate enhanced HNC response
profiles culminating in a Phase I clinical trial. Project 2 builds a powerful patient-specific bioengineered HNC
model system from patient cells that incorporates components of the tumor microenvironment to more accurately
predict HNC patient treatment response. The feasibility of using treatment response data from the model to
inform postoperative radiation therapy will be tested in a clinical pilot study. Project 3 examines dual targeting of
critical receptor tyrosine kinases Axl and MerTK to mediate changes in the immune microenvironment and
thereby augment tumor response in HNC patients. The Wisconsin SPORE will support this research with three
Cores (Administrative, Pathology and Biostatistics), a Career Enhancement Program and a Developmental
Research Program."
10862724,"ABSTRACT
Variation in performance between surgeons leads to differences in patient outcomes, but
surgeons cannot improve if they are not aware of the technical considerations for a surgical
procedure that will allow them to improve outcomes. As a prime example, robot-assisted
radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer can lead to highly variable rates of patient
erectile function (EF) recovery (10-50%). Yet reliable means of objectively assessing surgeon
performance, that strongly associate with patient outcomes, are generally lacking.
In this project, as a test case for quantifying surgeon performance to improve a patient
outcome, we will focus on assessing a surgeon’s nerve-sparing (NS) dissection quality during
RARP through the evaluation of surgical video and patient outcomes. The nuanced NS step is a
good test case because it is the primary determinant of the quantifiable EF outcome, RARP is a
common procedure (~145,000 cases/year), and surgical video is readily available for analysis.
We will accomplish our objective with three independent, yet complementary aims. Aim 1: We
seek to determine through expert consensus the common technical considerations
necessary to optimally perform the NS step for EF recovery. Aim 2: We will develop an
automated performance assessment pipeline through computer vision analysis of surgical
video. Aim 3: We will develop and validate a skills feedback assessment tool for a proof-of-
concept NS-specific VR simulation.
The primary differentiator of the proposed work is we will quantify the most relevant technical
considerations for tissue dissection driving a patient reported outcome. Surgeons
participating in this study will not only provide data through surgical videos of them performing
the NS step, but they will also contribute real patient EF outcome data from the RARP to
establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and EF outcome.
Statistical modeling will delineate the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient factors to EF
outcome. Further, we will harness deep learning-based computer vision to holistically capture all
the numerous facets of NS technique and skill to help determine how they contribute to the
ultimate EF outcome.
The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback, empowering surgeons with
valuable knowledge to maximize surgical outcome. The NS step and EF recovery after RARP
will serve as our test case for future automated assessments to improve outcomes in any
surgical procedure."
10720891,"Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation in both the central nervous system and periphery
contributes to pathophysiology and disease progression of ALS. In addition, both preclinical and clinical studies
implicate a role for the complement system in the neuroinflammatory response observed in ALS, although
mechanistic details are lacking. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of complement in the
progression and pathophysiology of disease in ALS mouse models using a novel approach of complement
inhibition. Complement inhibition will be evaluated for therapeutic potential, while at the same time used as an
investigative tool to better understand the role of complement in ALS. Although clinical trials using complement
inhibitors to treat ALS have recently been announced, the approach we will investigate offers significant potential
advantages over the inhibitors entering clinical trials. The specific aims are to examine the role of complement
and the effect of targeted C3 inhibition on disease progression and survival, and to determine complement-
dependent pathophysiology and inflammatory/immune profiles during disease progression. It is expected that
data generated will provide the foundation on which to build more detailed mechanistic investigations, as well
develop novel complement-inhibitory therapeutic approaches that could be addressed in a Merit application.
There is no effective treatment for ALS, and our therapeutic strategy has the potential to be beneficial at multiple
levels by directly protecting motor neurons from complement activation in the CNS, by protecting motor end-
plates, and by potentially modifying glia-motor neuron interactions."

Mechanisms that govern cardiomyocyte proliferation and remuscularization following ventricular injury
Program Overall
The overall goal for the treatment of myocardial infarction is to replace the scar tissue caused by ischemic injury
with functional cardiac muscle. Since adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CMs) are non-proliferative, and the
engraftment rate for cardiac cell therapy is extremely low, most of the remuscularizing initiatives following
infarction have been unsuccessful. However, recent preliminary studies from our laboratories using neonatal
pigs have shown that when myocardial infarction (MI) is induced on postnatal day 1 (P1), CMs re-enter the cell
cycle, proliferate, and completely restore cardiac function with little scarring. Furthermore, we have found that
these neonatal hearts with the P1 injury, have a very active and prolonged CM proliferative machinery, and
consequently a second LAD ligation injury at P28, which resulted in a large infarct (TTC) at Day 2-7 post LAD
ligation, produced no visible infarct 4 weeks following injury. This was a remarkable result as it demonstrated,
for the first time, that a heart of large mammal could remuscularize infarcted heart tissue by CM proliferation.
The studies comprising this Program Project Grant (PPG) application will examine mechanisms whereby CMs
reenter the cell cycle and new strategies to remuscularize injured hearts. Project 1 will identify the CM cell-cycle
regulators that are activated by MI in one-day-old pigs and construct human cardiac muscle patches (hCMP) of
unprecedented clinically relevant dimensions from layers of proliferating hiPSC-CMs with activated cell cycle
regulators, and other cardiac cells; subsequent experiments will determine whether the identified factors and
hCMPs can remuscularize the hearts of adult pigs after MI. Project 2 will use genetic strategies, viral vectors,
and modified RNAs to investigate whether members of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway including Gli1
and Sox4, which have already been shown to induce proliferation in cultured CMs, will promote CM proliferation
in the injured hearts of adult mice and pigs. In addition, studies will examine the capacity of the master regulator,
Etv2, to promote neovascularization and promote repair of the injured hearts of adult mice and pigs. Project 3
will be an extension of previousobservations that mammalian cell-cycle arrest is at least partially induced by the
increase in oxygen metabolismthat occurs after birth, and that severe systemic hypoxia upregulates proline
metabolism and induces CM proliferation in adult mice; the proposed studies will examine whether proline
metabolism regulates CM survivaland proliferation during chronic hypoxia. Collectively, these three projects, the
associated cores and the expertise of the investigators will accelerate and amplify the studiesto address the
central objective of this P01 proposal: To remuscularize the injured ventricle from “within,” by promoting
endogenous CM proliferation, and from “outside,” bytransplanting functionally mature hCMPs that are primed for
in-vivo CM proliferation."

 The goal of the Histology, Biomechanics, and Human Tissue Core (Core C) is to provide state-of-the-art
services for the characterization of tissue and cellular changes that underlie the pathological mechanisms of
skeletal diseases in both mice and humans. The core will provide 3 services: 1) high quality and reliable hard-
tissue histology services that will help investigators identify the cellular basis of musculoskeletal changes and
formulate new mechanistic hypotheses for disease processes; 2) comprehensive in vivo and ex vivo
biomechanical testing to quantify the mechano-responsiveness, quality, and strength of the skeleton under
physiological and pathological conditions; and 3) banking and access to human tissue samples from hip
replacement surgeries and bone marrow cells with their associated clinical data from patients with various
conditions. This is a novel component that will expand the translational research opportunities in the Center for
Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) for Project Leaders, CMDR faculty, and eventually additional
researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and affiliated institutions. The core will
be essential to accomplish the goals of each Phase 2 research project. Core C will extensively interact with the
other cores of the CMDR by providing histological and biomechanical analysis for new mouse models created
by the Genetic Mouse Model Core (Core B), working with the Bone Imaging Core (Core D) for biomechanical
analysis and providing samples for histomorphometric analysis, and collaborating with the Bioinformatics Core
(Core E) for developing spatial transcriptomics. Overall, the Histology, Biomechanics, and Human Tissue Core
provides unique and essential services and thereby significantly expands the musculoskeletal research
infrastructure at UAMS and its affiliates."
10814745,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CORE D
 The COBRE Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (UAMS) focuses on identifying the cellular and molecular causes underlying diseases and conditions
that negatively impact the musculoskeletal system. Bone imaging and analytical technologies at the tissue and
cellular level will be required to accomplish the goals of each Phase 2 research project. To fulfill this need, we
will split the former Bone Histology and Imaging Core, established during Phase 1, into 2 independent but highly
integrated new cores: the Bone Imaging Core (Core D) and the Histology, Biomechanics, and Human Tissue
Core (Core C). Core D will operate as a centralized and shared core facility to assist Project Leaders and other
CMDR members with the musculoskeletal imaging needed for their research efforts. The core will provide state-
of-the-art imaging resources for quantitative characterization of tissue and cellular changes underlying the
pathogenesis of the musculoskeletal disorders being studied. Thus, Core D will be critical for Project Leaders
and the long-term success of the CMDR. This new core will consolidate existing and new equipment into a large,
modern research space within the Department of Physiology and Cell Biology and will be staffed by well-trained
technical personnel who will be supervised by the Core Director. Core D will pursue the following specific aims:
1) Establish the Bone Imaging Core; 2) Deliver state-of-the-art musculoskeletal imaging and introduce new
analytical technologies to generate, analyze, and interpret bone-imaging data; and 3) Provide training in bone
imaging and support educational activities. The success of Core D, together with the other CMDR cores, will
benefit the work proposed in all research projects (Projects 1, 2, and 3) and expand the repertoire of analytical
tools to meet the growing needs of CMDR members, as well as the other investigators at UAMS."
10744214,"Since 2001 nearly 2 million US troops have served in the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. Common to these
hostile environments, exposure to a traumatic stress can lead to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a
result, up to 31% of soldiers suffer from PTSD at some point in their lives. In addition to the debilitating
consequences on mental health, PTSD also increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A cardinal
feature of PTSD is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity (ie., increased norepinephrine, NE) that is
thought to contribute to both the psychiatric symptoms of PTSD and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In
the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) is the major source of NE, a brain region capable of promoting the behavioral
and cardiovascular abnormalities that define PTSD. Therefore, therapies that reduce LC activity, and thus
suppress NE release are attractive targets to treat PTSD with comorbid cardiovascular disease. IL-1b
accumulates in specific brain regions in stress susceptible individuals and serves to promote LC-NE
hyperactivity. We have identified that when rats are confined in a protected region of an aggressive resident’s
cage, forced to witness a social trauma in the form of social defeat between two males, it generates long lasting
indices of behavioral and autonomic hypervigilance. By conducting this study in males and females, this allows
for a parallel understanding of how the LC regulates hypervigilance in both sexes and fulfills a critical gap in
knowledge in PTSD pathology. The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to use this animal model
of combat-related trauma to identify druggable targets that can suppress neural regulation of hyperarousal. We
propose that stress-induced adaptations of IL-1b in the LC initiate the cascade that promotes LC-NE hyperactivity
and resulting susceptibly in two ways. 1) IL-1b is chronically upregulated in the LC of witness stress-exposed
rats, which directly functions to stimulate LC-NE neurons. 2) IL-1b promotes accumulation of ROS (i.e.,
superoxide) which, in the LC disengages a major inhibitory input via downregulation of µ-opioid receptors (MOR).
Thus, this stress-sensitive LC-NE response is poised to promote the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
LC-NE hyperarousal. The following specific aims will utilize integrative, translational and cutting-edge techniques
to test the hypothesis that a combined effect of IL-1b and ROS regulate LC-NE hyperactivity that is central
to promoting trauma-induced behavioral and autonomic dysfunction in males and females To achieve
these goals, rats will be treated with intra-LC vehicle, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), n-acetylcysteine (NAC,
an antioxidant) or a combination of the two. The specific role of these treatments to block behavioral and
autonomic indices of hyperarousal will be determined (Aim 1) and the molecular mechanisms modified by these
treatments will be identified in unstressed controls and stressed male and female rats in addition, postmortem
LC tissue from the VA Brain Bank will also be evaluated (Aim 2). Furthermore, Aim 3 tests the therapeutic
capability of intracerebroventricular IL-1ra and NAC administration to reverse the hypervigilant phenotype in
order to achieve two major goals: 1) To confirm that the locus of efficacy for the therapeutic effects of anti-
inflammatory and anti-oxidant therapy is the LC and 2) to measure cardiovascular telemetry with simultaneous
LC electrophysiology in awake behaving animals, demonstrating for the first time the covariance between LC
neuronal firing and sympathovagal balance in males and females with a hypervigilant phenotype. The proposed
studies are significant because understanding neural mechanisms of susceptibility to hypervigilance will lead to
preventative and therapeutic treatments capable of directly enhancing the lives of our veterans. Moreover, this
work has the immense potential to help identify preclinical screening of FDA-approved interventions that could
be repurposed to treat PTSD hyperarousal in humans and rapidly translated into our veteran population."

The primary mission of the Sensory Biology COBRE (SBC) is to foster and conduct high-quality scientific
research that advances our understanding of human sensory systems and disorders related to them. A major
role of the Center is to support and mentor the development of junior investigators to pursue research in
sensory system function and dysfunction. During Phase I, the SBC spearheaded transformative changes in the
landscape of Sensory Biology Research. In addition to basic research related to the fundamental mechanisms
of sensory processing and the role of the sensory system in social and cognitive behaviors, SBC labs also
focused on translational research in mental health and psychiatric disorders. For the Phase II period, the SBC
will continue to tackle the most critical public health issues relevant to the State of Wyoming for the 21st
century, including aging and chronic diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (AD/RD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), developmental disorders that affect communication
and behavior in children (autism spectrum disorders, ASD), and recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI). The
Phase II Center will support four initial project leaders who will study the key roles of novel circuits in
neurological disorders: the role of the lateral parabrachial nucleus in sundowning associated with AD/RD; the
role of the medial prefrontal cortex in ALS and AD/RD; the role of oxytocin neurons in the parvocellular nucleus
in pro-social behavior and disruptions of social behavior in ASD; and the role of electrical signaling that drives
inflammation and glia bridging in the recovery from SCI. SBC will enhance the research quality and output of
the junior investigators by providing mentoring, collaboration, and training and by sharing resources and animal
models. The successful execution of SBC’s Phase II goal will help propel the SBC into Phase III where SBC
will become an independent, thriving, and sustainable Center of Excellence, comprised of over fifteen
independently funded labs and a multi-disciplinary biomedical research program. To achieve this goal, we
propose the following four specific aims for the Phase II period: Aim 1. Expand the research scope to tackle
important health issues relevant to the State of Wyoming. Aim 2. Advance the Phase II center by providing
more effective administrative oversight of the research, finance, mentoring, and evaluation activities. Aim 3.
Enhance the operational efficiency and the long-term self-sustainability of the Core. Aim 4. Bolster the growth
achieved during Phase I by leveraging Phase II financial resources to recruit new junior investigators and
increase their integration into thematic programs. Support of Phase II is crucial to our efforts in building a
sustainable research center in the State of Wyoming. The support of Phase II will garner the institutional
support needed for the long-term self-sustainability of the Center post-IDeA funding."

This application is a resubmission of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Lung Cancer
originating from the Lung Cancer Program of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). The DF/HCC
SPORE in Lung Cancer includes researchers from multiple Harvard-affiliated hospitals including the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
(BIDMC), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), and Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), as well as Harvard
Medical School (HMS) and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Previously, the DF/HCC Lung
Cancer Program was funded by a Lung Cancer SPORE in 2002. This was followed by a successful renewal
application in 2007 and a no-cost extension from 2013-2015. That period of time was accompanied by
remarkable productivity by our investigators, including the initial description of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations by investigators at both MGH and DFCI, identification and development of 3rd generation
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which are now in widespread clinical use, and rapid translation of effective
ALK/ROS targeted therapies, among other accomplishments. However, despite the immense positive impact of
targeted therapies, they have failed to cure advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Over the past 6 years since our
prior SPORE ended, the DF/HCC lung program has evolved and grown ever more collaborative. We have
maintained a developmental research program to support a new cadre of investigators, who have built strong
additional arenas of expertise that add to our longstanding tradition of targeted therapy research in lung cancer,
including innate and adaptive immunity, SCLC biology, circulating tumor DNA, and lung cancer screening. The
DF/HCC Lung Cancer Program thus seeks SPORE funding to enable integrated teams that capitalize on the
strengths of these new and established investigators to achieve our common goal of eliminating lung cancer
deaths. The overarching goals of this SPORE are to: A) Design immunologic therapies that harness both the
innate and adaptive immune systems to overcome ALK inhibitor resistance and enhance efficacy of PD-1
immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Projects 1 and 2); B) Develop innovative
approaches to EGFR and ALK-driven lung cancer with potential to improve long term survival via cancer vaccines
or elimination of drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells or cancer vaccines (Projects 1 and 3); C) Co-opt
vulnerabilities such as replication stress in SMARCA4 mutant NSCLC or a senescence program in EGFR TKI
DTPs (Projects 2 and 3); D) Foster inter-institutional collaboration, including exchange of lung cancer models
and patient samples (all Projects); and E) Continue to support and develop the next generation of lung cancer
translational scientists from our talented group of fellows and early career investigators, with an emphasis on
increasing diversity and equity."

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most commonly encountered birth defect. Despite its prevalence, the
underlying molecular etiology of most CHDs is not yet known. The central theme of this Program Project Grant
application is to elucidate mechanisms that regulate growth and morphogenesis of the ventricle during
development. Our objectives are to better understand how epigenetic, transcriptional, and cell signaling
regulation within cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and embryonic cardiomyocytes impact cardiac specification,
differentiation, and ventricular morphogenesis. Four highly interactive and complementary Projects are
proposed. Project 1 will study the molecular mechanisms contributing to the genesis of CHDs in early CPCs.
These studies build on work from Dr. Stephanie Ware’s laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis that severe
CHDs encountered in patients with ZIC3 X-linked heterotaxy result from abnormalities in cardiac progenitor cell
fate. Such mechanisms would explain why the spectrum of CHDs encountered in these patients is more severe
than what would be anticipated as a result of altered sidedness. Project 2 will study the epigenetic mechanisms
regulating the bHLH transcription factor HAND1, which is critical for left ventricular, papillary muscle, and cardiac
conduction system (CCS) morphogenesis. These studies build on work from Dr. Anthony Firulli’s laboratory and
will test the overall hypothesis that epigenetic regulation of HAND1 transcription directs normal cardiomyocyte
patterning. Other studies will identify HAND1 DNA occupancy and interacting transcriptional partners, and thus
establish the gene regulatory networks regulating left ventricle, papillary muscle, and CCS morphogenesis.
Project 3 will study epigenetic mechanisms critical to mesendoderm specification and cardiogenic differentiation.
These studies build on work from Dr. Weinian Shou’s laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis that the
lysine methyltransferase SMYD4 regulates Histone modifications essential for establishing correct numbers of
CPCs. Project 4 will study the role of a novel planar cell polarity effector protein, SHROOM3, in the pathogenesis
of CHDs. These studies build on work from Dr. Matthew Durbin’s laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis
that SHROOM3 interacts at a number of key points within the PCP pathway, and that identified rare CHD patient-
specific SHROOM3 variants disrupt PCP within cardiomyocytes. The proposed work will be facilitated by the
participation of three cores (Core A – Administration; Core B - Embryonic stem cell growth and genetically
modified models; and Core C - Cardiac physiology and imaging). Ultimately, the studies proposed in this Program
Project Grant application will illustrate how epigenetic, transcriptional, and signaling mechanisms occurring within
both cardiac progenitors and embryonic cardiomyocytes establish the gene regulatory networks necessary for
cardiac morphogenesis. Importantly, defining the molecular mechanisms of these events will inform interventions
aiming to mitigate deleterious impacts of CHD."

 The symptoms of Essential Tremor (ET), the most common movement disorder in adults, are seriously
disabling and are only marginally improved by medication alone. Tremor control has improved greatly with the
use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the ventrointermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus, a node along a
circuit of abnormal rhythmic output in ET that travels from the cerebellar dentate nucleus to the contralateral red
nucleus and cortex via the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRTt). Recent advances in diffusion imaging have led
to the development of tractography techniques where the structural connectivity of fiber tracts such as the DRTt
can be illustrated and then, as we have shown, directly targeted during DBS surgery for excellent clinical effect.
Despite such novel targeting methodology and initial tremor improvement, however, the development of side
effects such as progressive gait ataxia and waning efficacy after years of chronic stimulation points to the fact
that the pathology of essential tremor is poorly understood. Such incomplete knowledge of the network
effects of chronic stimulation in ET is a major barrier that needs to be overcome through understanding the
dysfunction and modulation of the connectivity of the cerebellar-thalamic-cortical (CTC) network over time.
 Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool to explore the functional connectivity
between different brain regions and has improved the idea of ET as a network-based disease not confined to
the motor circuit, including parietal visuomotor processing cortices; however, comparisons pre- and post- DBS
have not been performed. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) has correlated ataxic side effect with
cerebellar metabolic changes after chronic DBS; however, associated changes seen with rsfMRI are unknown.
Our long-term goal is to understand how stimulation of the DRTt causes network-level effects over time. Our
central hypothesis is that structural and functional connectivity of the DRTt correlates with clinical
response to DBS in a time-dependent fashion. In pursuit of this hypothesis, we will recruit new ET patients
already undergoing DBS and additionally perform imaging analysis to elucidate the effects of stimulation
and define DRTt connectivity. In Aim 1, we seek to define the structural connectivity of the DRTt by using
tractography methods and compare over time diffusivity changes correlated with clinical response and/or ataxic
side effect. In Aim 2, we seek to detect functional network changes due to DBS by using rsfMRI obtained serially
in ON/OFF states, where we will track the evolution of altered connectivity changes over time. In Aim 3, we seek
to confirm the cortical mediators of tremor identified in Aims 1 and 2 by use of intraoperative electrocorticography
during DBS. This innovative combination of using a novel targeting technique and serial imaging across DBS
states will advance our understanding of the larger network response to DBS, which is essential to develop more
specific stimulation of fibers to improve response and avoid side effects in ET."
10904807,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this Phase 2 CoBRE application is to expand on the accomplishments of Phase 1 in establishing
an interdisciplinary and translational Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Adversity (CIRCA) at
Oklahoma State University (OSU). Two decades of epidemiological data document that Adverse Childhood
Experiences (ACEs) are prevalent and cumulative, have enduring negative consequences for physical and
mental health, and cost north America more than $758B in preventable health care. In order to reduce the
costly effects of ACEs, research is increasingly focused on identifying mechanisms and processes by which
ACEs impact developing nervous, endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems, and intergenerational
biobehavioral pathways of transmission, as well as potential pathways for prevention, recovery, and healing.
This research is interdisciplinary by design and reliant on a team science approach, requiring researchers with
the capacity to collaborate in transdisciplinary teams.14, 15 The goals of CIRCA during Phase 1 were to
increase institutional research infrastructure to support a cadre of collaborative investigators achieve
independent funding on adversity and resilience. OSU invested approximately $10M in facilities, equipment,
faculty, and staff, significantly increasing capacity for biobehavioral research on adversity. The 5 research
project leaders (RPLs) and 8 pilot project leaders in Phase 1 obtained $16.3M in external grant support, with
an $8.2M increase in NIH funding. Phase 2 will expand and strengthen this interdisciplinary and collaborative
center of biomedical research excellence by a) building institutional and center infrastructure using a team
science approach; b) supporting and mentoring early-career investigators in their programs of research; c)
developing vibrant, sustainable research cores; and d) generating innovative transdisciplinary approaches
focused on the synergistic impacts of genetic, biological, environmental, and developmental influences on risk
and resilience over the life course. Phase 2 projects will investigate neurobiological mechanisms and
developmental processes linking childhood adversity with subsequent health problems using a theoretical
framework developed by CIRCA investigators during Phase 1. The proposed research projects and planned
pilot projects will be supported by an Administrative Core, a Recruitment, Engagement, Collection, and
Assessment (RECA) Core and a Biological Systems Core. Each project will contribute to a common set of
biological and behavioral measures, establishing a sustainable CIRCA Databank for current and future
research. This proposed Phase 2 CoBRE is highly innovative in that it addresses the need to prepare a new
generation of scientists with the capacity to identify and target the biobehavioral and developmental processes
linking early life adversity with negative health outcomes. It is significant in that it will create a sustainable
center providing opportunities for collaboration and a biobehavioral databank for current and future
investigators in a region characterized by high rates of ACEs and historical trauma."
10929335,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core (AC) is responsible for the overall governance and leadership of the project to assure
that the goals of the study are achieved within the budget and funding period as well as manage and mitigate
any risks to success. The science underlying this project is multidisciplinary, requiring a structured approach
that is also sufficiently flexible to allow for new scientific discovery and accommodate evolving research
findings that will advance scientific knowledge as specified in the RFA as well as being grounded in the overall

National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI). As such, the
AC will emphasize project management through both 1) study start-up and 2) study implementation that
directly supports the needs of the scientific study leadership as well as identify barriers, make timely responses
and optimize the allocation of resources to meet the defined study objectives. As a consequence, we believe
that this project leadership is well suited to implement the specific aims of this core that are to:
1) Develop and maintain a transparent and effective governance and leadership structure to design and
 implement all aspects of the proposed research.
2) Provide an integrated infrastructure and efficient logistics to seamlessly drive the project across the
 network of participating sites and project cores, including collaborating resource sites such as NACC and
 LONI. This includes developing an appropriate study start-up phase and an implementation phase for the
 project, along with a plan and timeline for transitioning to the implementation phase with high likelihood of
success.
3) Establish timely communications, coordination, and collaboration with major stakeholders to facilitate
 dissemination and application of new knowledge deriving from the project.

A diverse biomedical workforce is critical for scientific innovation and health equity. Yet, underrepresented racial/ethnic (UR) scientists and women remain disproportionately low, particularly as faculty at academic research institutions. Multiple evidence-based strategies need to be implemented to enhance faculty diversity, inclusion and to create cultures of inclusive excellence. However, a knowledge gap exists regarding integrated strategies to address diversity and inclusion, the impact of faculty cluster hiring, and institutional change models on fostering inclusive excellence. The overall goal of the University of California San Diego (UCSD) NIH Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program is to: 1) foster sustainable institutional culture change, 2) promote institutional excellence by hiring a diverse cohort of faculty and 3) support faculty development, mentoring, sponsorship and promotion. The objectives are to: 1) demonstrate institutional support,
develop or modify a strategic plan with elements that will be implemented to achieve systemic and sustainable institutional culture changes towards inclusive excellence, 2) develop an evaluation plan to assess impact on the institution towards achieving FIRST program goals, 3) conduct recruitment of new faculty, outline institutional commitments, and develop recruitment committees based on commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, 4) establish a retention plan to secure institutional commitment and a supportive environment for new faculty hires,
5) establish individual research and career development plans, mentorship plans and 6) develop strategies to reduce isolation, increase community building and foster career development for all new faculty hires. The primary hypothesis is that a cohort model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentorship and support for professional development, embedded within an institution implementing evidenced-based practices to create academic cultures of inclusive excellence will achieve significant improvements in metrics of institutional culture and scientific workforce diversity. We propose the following Specific Aims. Aim 1. The aim of the Administrative
Core is to provide strategic leadership, management, and administrative oversight to support the recruitment and retention UCSD FIRST faculty and oversee implementation professional development and institutional transformation for inclusive excellence. Aim 2. The aim of the Faculty Development Core is to use evidence based strategies to enhance FIRST faculty academic advancement, research success, and inclusive institutional excellence. Aim 3. The aim of the Evaluation Core is to develop and implement an evaluation plan to assess the
institutional impact of the FIRST Program and to assist the Coordination and Evaluation Center evaluation of the combined FIRST Cohort Programs. Together, these aims will promote institutional culture change at UC San Diego towards inclusive excellence by using evidence-based strategies to enhance UR faculty recruitment, academic advancement, research and career development, integration and implementation of system-wide structured faculty development programs to enhance inclusivity."
10889147,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
Age-related inflammation and accumulation of ectopic lipid in multiple organs in elderly is associated with
emergence of chronic diseases. The integration of neural and immunometabolic inputs that control organismal
aging are largely unknown. The current program project grant (PPG) seeks to assemble a diverse group of
investigators at UTSW and Yale University with the goal to deploy their unique research models and expertise
in a coordinated fashion to develop a novel course of gerontological research. We have demonstrated that
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) acts through an obligate co-receptor βKlotho (KLB) to control hallmarks of
aging process such as inflammation, immune-senescence and impaired energy metabolism. This PPG is based
on our new findings that adipose and thymus specific overexpression of FGF21 controls organ aging, and that
FGF21 via AGRP-neuron mediated integration of hypothalamic and autonomic circuits, regulates organismal
aging. Therefore, we will test the central hypothesis that FGF21 is a central gero-checkpoint that initiates a
prolongevity molecular program by integrating neural- metabolic and immune axes. The corollary is that
pharmacological means to elevate FGF21 signaling by new agonist FGF21 variants may serve as therapy to
extend the healthspan and lifespan. To take next steps towards pre-clinical translation of FGF21 as a
pharmacological gero-protector, we will test the impact of ligating KLB with FGF-21superagonist on healthspan
and lifespan. The project 1 (Dixit) will test the impact of FGF21 on immune-senescence. Project 2 (Scherer) will
define the role of adipose tissue derived FGF21 on aging and metabolic dysfunction. Project 3
(Horvath/Schelssinger) will investigate the FGF21 hypothalamic AGRP neuron-driven signal transduction to
organismal aging. The PPG will be managed by and Administrative and mouse-aging analysis core, which will
support the healthspan and lifespan studies. We predict that successful implementation of the proposed goals,
will lead to generation of new knowledge that will allow development of new strategies to harness gero-protective
effects of FGF-21 against aging and chronic diseases."
10878686,"Project 2 Summary for Overall
The overarching goal of Project 2 is to enhance clinical trial readiness for ASAC. Successful identification of
effective treatment and prevention for AD will require inclusion of all populations in clinical trials, with all
individuals having accurate diagnosis of disease. Molecular measures of AD pathology have gained increasing
traction to support clinical diagnosis of AD. Peripheral biomarkers, specifically plasma proteins that reflect AD
neuropathology, have shown increasing utility and represent an accessible opportunity to diagnose and treat AD
sooner. While no plasma biomarker has yet been approved for diagnostic use, blood biomarkers of AD
neuropathology (Aβ42/40, Tau-181), axonal injury (neurofilament light [NfL]), and astrogliosis (glial fibrillary
acidic protein [GFAP]) have shown promising utility in AD diagnosis given their strong associations with cognitive
decline, gray matter loss, and AD conversion. However, most biomarker development has been performed in
homogenous, European ancestry populations. There is an urgent need for the field to test whether AD biomarker
thresholds generalize across diverse populations, including Asians. Meanwhile, it has been reported that 40-
50% of all dementia cases can be prevented by modifiable risk factors. Again, such findings are mainly based
on studies focused mainly on European Americans and may not be generalized to ASAC. Prior studies have
shown that effect sizes, and the relative contributions, of non-genetic risk factors on AD often differ between
racial/ethnic groups. In addition, ASAC, being an ethnic minority living in North America, has unique risk profiles
for AD compared to Asians living in Asia. Numerous non-genetic factors may contribute to such differences,
including education, immigration history and acculturation level, leisure and physical activities, diet, and
psychosocial stress. Better characterizing the risk profiles has critical implications for the design of future
interventional trials for individuals with diverse ancestry, particularly for understudied groups like ASAC. To
accurately identify those at highest risk for AD and to design an effective preventive trial, we require a better
understanding of the impact of non-genetic factors on AD risk. Overall, Project 2 will address these gaps in
knowledge by leveraging the unique resources of the multi-center ACAD to determine ASAC-specific diagnostic
cut-offs for promising AD plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/40, Tau-181, NfL, and GFAP), and to investigate non-genetic
factors in conferring AD risk and in moderating the association between genetic factors and AD in ASAC. Project
2 will test the overarching hypothesis that there are ASAC-specific AD biomarker thresholds and unique non-
genetic factors that interact with genetic risk for AD. Together, through biomarkers and non-genetic factors (and
integration with genetic factors in Project 1), Project 2 will generate a significant, sustained impact on the field
by enhancing our ability to accurately profile AD risk in the ASAC community, which will be extremely valuable
information when designing new interventions to prevent AD development and progression in all populations."
10808852,"Summary Abstract (30 lines):
Existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging measures of amyloid ß, tau and neurodegeneration
(A,T,N) serve as useful diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however there remains an urgent,
unmet need for blood based biomarkers in AD. First, multi-omic studies discovered many perturbed biological
pathways in AD, however, systematic studies for biomarkers that capture these diverse biological facets of AD
are limited. Second, AD is a heterogeneous disorder but biomarkers that can distinguish the biological
subtypes of AD are lacking. Third, core AD neuropathology often co-exists with other neuropathologies such as
vascular disease (V). These co-morbidities and co-pathologies need to be considered in biomarker discovery.
Fourth, existing biomarker studies are heavily focused on non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Similar studies in
underrepresented populations (URP) are needed. This U19, bringing together >40 experts across 13
institutions, aims to bridge these knowledge gaps for discovery and validation of Centrally-linked Longitudinal
pEripheral biomARkers of AD (CLEAR-AD) in multi-ethnic populations. CLEAR-AD U19 is based on the
premise that AD is a complex disorder in which many biological pathways are disrupted due to multi-omic
perturbations, which can be detected in brain and reflected in blood, i.e. centrally-linked peripheral molecular
signatures (CLPMS). The specific aims of CLEAR-AD U19 are: 1) To discover CLPMS of the complex and
heterogeneous AD pathophysiology and its co-pathologies. 2) To identify longitudinal CLPMS that detect and
predict dynamic neuroimaging, fluid biomarker, and clinical changes across AD spectrum. 3) To characterize
differences and similarities in CLPMS profiles across NHW, African American (AA) and Latino American (LA)
participants to uncover biomarker patterns in multi-ethnic groups. 4) To make these vast resources available to
the scientific community to amplify and accelerate its impact. In this U19 managed by the Administrative Core,
we will leverage NIH-funded ADNI, MCSA and ADRC cohorts of >3,700 multi-ethnic participants to generate
>20,000 multi-omics measures (Omics Core) that will be processed and integrated with >48,000 harmonized
AD cognitive, neuroimaging and fluid endophenotypes (Analytic Core). Using these data, we will identify brain
region and cell-type specific CLPMS, which reflect biological subtypes of AD and disease stage (Project 1). We
will discover longitudinal changes in CLPMS that predict cognitive and A/T/N/V progression (Project 2). We will
define longitudinal cognitive and A/T/N/V changes and CLPMS in URP that are either conserved with NHW or
population-specific (Project 3). This U19 will a) Identify the next generation of AD biomarkers with mechanistic
insights; b) Establish a precision medicine approach for rigorous multi-omics biomarker discovery and
validation in AD; c) Discover molecules that can serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets; d) Enhance
biomarker research in trial-ready multi-ethnic populations; and e) Generate and share a vast and harmonized
resource of endophenotype and multi-omics data in NIH-funded cohorts."

blood multi-omics biomarker candidates that represent molecular perturbation signatures in the brain which are
reflected in antemortem neuroimaging/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem neuropathology phenotypes
of this complex disease. We aim to discover centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures (CLPMS) that can
serve as future centrally-linked peripheral biomarkers (CLPBM) through transcriptome, epigenome, proteome,
metabolome/lipidome data generation, integration with existing other -omics data and analysis in matched
postmortem brain:antemortem blood samples (Project 1=P1); and to characterize their longitudinal dynamic
profiles in non-Hispanic white (NHW) and diverse, underrepresented populations (URP) of African American

therapeutic AD biomarkers with mechanistic insights; to enhance biomarker research in trial-ready multi-ethnic
populations and to provide the research community with a vast resource of rigorously generated, replicated and
validated multi-omics biomarkers. To achieve these aims, we will utilize and integrate existing and future data
and biospecimens from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA)
and 6 AD Research Centers (ADRCs). The Administrative Core (Core 1: C1) will provide direction and oversight
to the projects and cores of this program (C2. Omics and C3. Analytic Cores) and facilitate their execution. The
Administrative Core will achieve the program goals through 1) integration of the participating institutions and

URPs; 4) enabling communication, outreach and knowledge sharing within the U19, with related programs, the
whole research community and public stakeholders; and 5) ensuring rigor, reproducibility and transparency by
making all data, algorithms, and outcomes available to the research community. The Specific Aims for the

and knowledge in an open-science fashion on NIH approved repositories to promote transparency,
reproducibility and reuse of all CLEAR-AD program assets."

The Omics core (Core 2) will support the overall U19 proposal by generating multiple layers of omics data from
biospecimens collected as part of the well characterized cohorts of ADNI, MCSA and 5 ADRCs (Mayo Clinic,
Indiana University, 1Florida, University of Michigan and Washington University). Multiple biospecimens have
been, or will be, collected for each of the proposal projects. These include matched post-mortem brain tissue
and ante-mortem blood (P1), or multiple blood tubes collected longitudinally (P2, P3), to identify molecular
changes related to the rich phenotypic (pathology, imaging, clinical, biomarker) data on the same individuals.
Data will be collected on diverse cohorts representing non-Hispanic white, Latino American and African American
(NHW, LA and AA) populations. Omics measures proposed to be collected include bulk total RNA sequencing,
from brain tissues and PAXgene blood, single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNASeq) from brain tissues,
proteome from brain tissues and plasma, metabolome and lipidome from brain tissues and serum, DNA
methylation from brain tissues and blood and genotype arrays from brain tissue. These measures will provide
the molecular profiles on which the project hypotheses will be tested. The Omics core will support the project
aims, and provide harmonized omics data by providing centralized coordination of biospecimen management,
innovative study design and harmonized generation of multi-omics data. Furthermore, comprehensive
documentation related to biospecimen collection, handling, and omics data generation approaches, which will
contribute to the open science goals of the overall U19 program, will be provided to the Administrative core (C1).
Batch effects related to sample collection, processing, storage and transfer will be accounted for and minimized
to enable the integrative analysis goals of the projects and the Analytic core (C3). The Omics core will address
the unique challenges of integrating large scale omics data collection by providing centralized study design for
these key processes in consultation with each of the projects and the Analytic core. Protocols have been and
will continue to be harmonized in collaboration with study coordinators from each of the relevant participating
sites. The Omics core has 3 specific aims to address the needs of the proposal: (1) Coordinate the collection,
storage and distribution of biospecimens for omics studies; (2) Generate high-quality omics data harmonized
across study sites, tissues and cohorts; (3) Provide comprehensive biospecimen and omics documentation to
facilitate data sharing within and outside the U19 program. Through these efforts, we expect to generate the
proposed harmonized omics measures (RNAseq, snRNAseq, Proteome, Metabolome, Lipidome, DNA
methylation array and genotype array), with appropriate detailed documentation. These data will be provided to
the U19 investigators and the broader research community to enable analysis and identification of centrally-

10763792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CD4+FOXP3+lymphocytes are expanded within the intestinal inflammatory lesion of Crohn’s disease (CD);
however, ongoing inflammation belies presumed anti-inflammatory function of this cell. FOXP3 is required for
differentiation and function of T regulatory (TREG) cells. FOXP3-mediated gene repression is lost in intestinal
T cells of CD patients. Indeed, “FOXP3+ Crohn’s cell (FOXP3+CD)” bears a transcriptional signal more
closely related to the pro-inflammatory TH17 cell. Derivation, function, and therapeutic implications of the
FOXP3+CD cell remain poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to dissect epigenetic mechanisms regulating
TREG cellular differentiation and function in the setting of GI inflammation. Consequently, the objective is to
identify mechanisms responsible for activation of the TH17 phenotypic transcriptional network within intestinal
FOXP3+CD cells and test therapeutic opportunities to restore their regulatory function in vivo. Our central
hypothesis is that a shared chromatin configuration between TREG and TH17 cells allows for rapid activation
of a TH17-like pro-inflammatory gene program in intestinal FOXP3+TREG cells. A set of TH17-relevant genes
are accessible, yet not active in human TREG cells. A defining feature of the TH17 program was significant
enrichment of CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) motifs. CTCF, a well-known topologically-associated domain
(TAD) insulator protein, also mediates intra-TAD chromosomal looping and enhancer-promoter interaction
regulating gene transcription. Bioinformatic analysis of this TH17 program indicates an inhibitory role for
Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1). Deletion of PRC1 in murine FOXP3+ cells led to secretion of
prototypic TH17-like cytokines in FOXP3+ cells, and spontaneous colitis. The rationale is that with mechanistic
insight into the biology of intestinal TREG cell in inflammation, one can apply targeted FOXP3+ CD cell-directed
therapy including engineering of human TREG cells for adoptive cell therapy trials. To test the central
hypothesis and obtain the overall objective we will address the following three questions: Aim1: Why are CTCF
motifs associated with the TH17 program? Aim2: Why are TH17-associated genes accessible yet not active in
TREG cells? Aim3: Why do FOXP3+CD cells express prototypic TH17 cytokines? Upon conclusion, we will
understand the epigenetic pathways and 3D chromatin architecture spawning the FOXP3+CD cell and
mechanisms shaping their development and function. This contribution is significant as the FOXP3+CD cell is
expanded in the Crohn’s lesion, phenocopies TH17 cell which is implicated in Crohn’s disease (and other
inflammatory diseases), and represents an important epigenetic drug target for systemic or re-engineered
cellular therapy. There is general acknowledgement of risk of FOXP3+ TREG cells converting to pathogenic
FOXP3+TH17-like cells upon adoptive transfer in Crohn’s trials; yet, this project is the first to articulate both
signature and precise epigenetic events that regulate activation of the TH17 program in TREG cells."

There have been substantial advances in our understanding of the transcriptional control of cell states and how
they are dysregulated in tumor cells. While investigating the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of multiple
myeloma (MM) cells in the previous funding period, our studies led to a new model for transcriptional control of
cell state, one where the transcriptional and epigenetic apparatus becomes compartmentalized in biomolecular
condensates and is regulated by biomolecules in a manner not anticipated by the canonical models of gene
regulation (Figure 1). We discovered that the super-enhancers that drive oncogenes form large condensates
that compartmentalize master transcription factors (TFs), epigenetic apparatus, regulatory RNA molecules and
large numbers of RNA polymerase molecules to enable high rates of oncogene transcription. Furthermore, we
found that newly transcribed RNA molecules make a profound contribution to local gene regulation both by
directly binding to TFs and by altering the lifetime of the super-enhancer condensates. Importantly, we also
discovered that these transcriptional condensates have chemical properties that concentrate the tested
antineoplastic drugs over a hundred-fold, such that the pharmacological properties of the drug are altered in the
vicinity of the drug’s target. Further insights into condensate physicochemistry should enable development of
therapeutic molecules with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. Based on these studies we propose to
advance our understanding, in MM cells, of the regulation of transcriptional condensates and the biochemical
environment in these condensates that influences drug behavior. To achieve these goals, the following Aims will
be pursued: 1) To investigate the role of RNA binding by master transcription factors in MM cell state, 2) To
investigate the role of RNA in regulation of oncogenic transcriptional condensates and DNA damage repair
condensates in MM, and 3) To investigate the features of condensate chemistry that provide a specific chemical
environment for enhancer-associated apparatus and that concentrate antineoplastic drugs. These proposed
studies will advance our understanding of the regulation of transcriptional condensates and the biochemical
environment in these condensates, and may thus enable development of novel therapeutic molecules with
improved efficacy and reduced toxicity."
10898579,"Program abstract: This proposal aims to identify the neural circuit mechanisms that control periarterial
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pumping and glymphatic clearance of fluid and solutes. We have developed a
collaboration to quantify CSF transport dynamics in both humans and mice across several scales, spanning
molecular transport, neuronal and glial activity, vascular and brain-wide fluid dynamics. We propose that
coordinated neural activity during sleep drives global and local changes in blood volume, which in turn are the
primary drivers of CSF transport. Our model establishes a novel conceptual framework, namely that neuronal
circuits control clearance via their effects on astrocytes and the vasculature, opening an array of testable
hypotheses across spatial scales and species.
 Project 1 will build quantitative fluid-dynamical models to establish how arterial dilation, mediated by
neural activity, drives periarterial CSF pumping and glymphatic efflux across length scales. Models for both mice
and humans, informed by experiments in Projects 2-4, will drive hypotheses to be tested in those Projects.
Project 2 will dissect how neural activity transmits Ca2+/cAMP signaling to the neurovascular unit, thereby
altering the physical dimensions and functional properties of the perivascular spaces. Viral tagging combined
with optogenetic stimulation of individual cell populations will reveal neural effects on CSF flow, measured by
particle tracking. The Project will also provide the first systematic analysis linking periarterial CSF inflow with
glymphatic solute clearance. Project 3 will dissect the local neural and global neuromodulatory drivers of
vasodynamics during NREM sleep using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. Additionally, local and
global arterial dynamics during sleep will be imaged, providing key information on the vascular pumping of CSF
movement. Project 4 will use novel MRI-based techniques to establish how neural activity and large-scale fluid
flow are linked in the human brain. By driving local neural activity with sensory stimulation, and imaging
spontaneous neurovascular and CSF dynamics across arousal states, it will test how specific spatiotemporal
patterns of neural activity affect hemodynamics and CSF flow in wakefulness and NREM sleep. The Projects
will be supported by Cores focused on Viral Tools, Data Science, and Administration, all overseen by
Internal and External Advisory committees.
 Together, the Projects will provide a quantitative, circuit-based understanding of the neural mechanisms
governing brain fluid flow and solute clearance during sleep."

This proposal aims to identify enhancer elements capable of regulating temporally dynamic gene expression
associated with successful CNS nerve regeneration. Although gene therapy has emerged as a promising
approach to treat CNS disorders and injuries, the current generation of gene therapy vectors carry a risk of
toxicity linked to regulatory sequences that promote strong, but unregulated expression of therapeutic genes.
Furthermore, because regeneration-associated genes are temporally regulated, the treatment of nerve injuries
is predicted to require more nuanced control of gene expression than current treatments designed to replace
faulty genes in monogenic diseases. Thus, there is a need for regulatory elements that drive therapeutic gene
expression in a context-specific manner. However, there is a critical gap in our understanding of DNA sequences
regulating temporally dynamic gene expression in neurons undergoing axon regeneration. We propose to identify
and functionally validate regeneration-active gene regulatory sequences associated with successful CNS axon
in zebrafish. Zebrafish models provide a distinct advantage over mammalian models because, unlike mammals,
CNS nerve injury induces changes in gene expression that support axon regeneration and recovery of function.
Enhancer elements discovered in zebrafish that show analogous activity in mammals has been previously
established. Thus, zebrafish provide an excellent in vivo model for functionally evaluating regeneration-specific
enhancers. Our long-term goal research goal is to develop a program of gene therapy designed to promote
successful optic nerve regeneration in human patients. The objective of the proposed R03 project is to identify
and functionally validate gene regulatory sequences sufficient for promoting temporally dynamic gene expression
during optic nerve regeneration. Our central hypothesis is that distal sequences forming long range physical
interactions with the promoter regions of regeneration-associated genes regulate temporal specificity of gene
expression. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1 is to identify enhancers
targeting key regeneration-associated transcription factors, using a chromatin conformation capture approach.
Aim 2 is to isolate enhancer elements capable of regulating regeneration-associated gene expression, and
validate putative enhancer sequences using in vivo transgenic reporter assays in zebrafish. Successful
completion of the proposed work is expected to reveal gene enhancers that accurately regulate temporal gene
expression during CNS nerve regeneration and thus contribute to the reprogramming of adult neurons for
regenerative axon growth. These outcomes are significant and innovative because they will elucidate enhancer

10725133,"Veterans with schizophrenia are among the most ill of those treated at VA facilities, which presents a great
burden on care and VA resources. The inadequacy of treatment response and myriad side effects of current
medications makes long-term care and medication adherence difficult. Hence, better treatment of Veterans
with psychotic disorders will greatly improve their overall quality of life and long-term care. Recent evidence
suggests that social isolation or withdrawal may contribute to the emergence of psychiatric illness, or be a
precipitating factor. For example, social withdrawal in schizophrenia occurs prior to symptoms of psychosis and
continued social decline predicts conversion to psychosis. Individuals with schizophrenia show disruptions in
frontal cortex and hippocampal circuitry, which contribute to negative symptoms and cognitive deficits.
Cognitive deficits are particularly debilitating and remain undertreated with current antipsychotic medications.
Based on the course of illness it is likely that the severity of social withdrawal/isolation contributes to the
neuropathology in schizophrenia; however, the mechanism through which this progression occurs is not
known. Because of ongoing deterioration in symptoms and better prognosis with early therapeutic
interventions, there is a need to identifying potential risk factors, prodromal symptoms, and biomarkers to help
screen military personnel at risk for serious mental illness and provide opportunities for early intervention. The
goals of the proposed studies are (1) to determine the impact of social isolation (SI) in rodents on frontal cortex
and hippocampal circuitry and behaviors relevant to schizophrenia (e.g. deficits in cognitive flexibility and
sensorimotor gating) and (2) identifying biomarkers predictive of susceptibility, and (3) develop more
efficacious early interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Aim 1 studies assess
the contribution of glutamate and GABA function in cortex and hippocampus to the development of cognitive
deficits in socially isolated rats. Studies examine the progression of both cognitive deficits and alterations in
markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons via immunohistochemistry and glutamatergic neuronal activity via
in vivo fiber photometry. Aim 2 studies use optogenetics to determine whether neuromodulation of orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) glutamate projections can remediate cognitive deficits in socially
isolated rats. Aim 3 studies examine whether early interventions with a metabotropic glutamate receptor
agonist, LY379268, to decrease glutamate signaling can prevent the development of cognitive dysfunction
associated with social isolation. These preclinical studies will provide a better understanding of the impact of
social isolation on neural circuitry and cognitive behavior and identify potential therapeutic targets for future
studies in Veterans."
10725160,"This Collaborative VA Merit Application (CMA) leverages expertise of accomplished researchers who formed a
VA Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Cell-Genomics Consortium (VA4C) in May 2017. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are
critical mediators of carcinogenesis and induce cancer relapse resulting in poor outcomes.
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), linear polysaccharides, that play a critical role in regulation of several hallmarks
of cancer, engage various cell surface receptor targets, especially on CSCs. Yet, their biological potential in
cancer has not been realized. Based on our highly intriguing recent observations that G2.2, a non-saccharide
glycosaminoglycan mimetic (NSGM) of a natural GAG, selectively inhibits CSCs through an oppositely-directed
mechanism involving growth factors, we propose that G2.2 is a novel, selective inhibitor of human CSCs. We
hypothesize that unique NSGMs can selectively and potently inhibit colorectal CSC growth through a novel
mechanism of antipodal pleiotropicity with respect to activation of growth factors. We propose three aims. We
will test the efficacy of G2.2 in 50 well characterized CSCs enriched primary human colorectal
spheroids/tumoroids as well as normal intestinal organoids, examine comprehensive CSC phenotype (self-
renewal, migration, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance), and determine pharmacokinetic profile of the
most promising NSGMs (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine molecular mechanism of G2.2 (and analogs). We
will determine how antipodal pleiotropic effects arise, e.g., activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFRs) and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and alter pp38/pERK signaling ratio,
which contributes to the CSC phenotype. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine therapeutic utility of NSGMs in
vivo by examining efficacy (specifically on CSCs) and toxicity (effect on normal stem cells) in advanced in vivo
models of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) or HT29 orthotopic xenografts either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil & oxaliplatin). The proposed studies will be greatly enhanced by collaborative
merit process. Specifically, our collaboration with Drs. Mohapatra (Subhra)(Tampa), Raufman (Baltimore)
Pisegna (Greater LA) within our cluster of Cancer Stem Cells in Pathology and Treatment of CRCs (CSCPT),
as well as other VA4C collaborators including Mohapatra/Kelly (Tampa/Durham), and Dr. Bouvet (San Diego)
will allow – a) testing of NSGMs in novel tumoroid models for independent validation (Aim 1); b) decipher
predictive biomarkers for NSGM effect through correlation of effect with muti-omics studies; and c) testing of
NSGMs in novel animal models such as PDXs and distal colon orthotopic xenografts in Aim 3. Similarly, our
expertise and knowledge gained through the proposal will be shared with Drs. Mohapatra and Raufman (CSC
assays e.g. comprehensive analyses of CSC markers. CSC selectivity etc.), We will also assist other VA4C
investigators in collecting blood, serum and tissue samples. The proposed studies are expected to help
decipher novel CSCs signaling and develop unique GAG mimetics as prototypic agents for clinical use."
10722345,"Despite the opioid overdose crisis, cocaine remains a widely abused illicit drug by the public and
by veterans. While opioid overdose primarily causes respiratory failure, cocaine abuse is mainly
associated with cardiovascular (CV) toxicities, which include hypertension (HTN), aortic stiffness,
and atherosclerosis. Indeed, cocaine abuse represents a significant CV risk for the general
population and for veterans. It is known that cocaine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) by inhibiting norepinephrine (NE) reuptake at nerve terminals; however, recent evidence
suggests that inhibition of NE reuptake may not be the major driver of cocaine-induced HTN. As
such, the mechanisms mediating the effects of cocaine on the CV system remain largely unknown.
To that end, we recently performed small RNA and RNA sequencing in the aortas from mice
treated with cocaine, cocaine methiodide (CM, which does not enter the central nervous system),
or saline to identify potential microRNA (miR)—mRNA pathways that mediate the CV effects of
cocaine. Nine miR—mRNA pathways were implicated. We prioritized and identified two miR-
mRNA axes based on their levels of expression changes and relevance to CV physiology. They
are: 1) the ↑miR-30c—↓Malic Enzyme 1 (ME1)—↑reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, which
is crucial in HTN and vascular aging (aortic stiffness); and 2) the ↓miR-423—↑Cacna2d2
(encoding the α2δ-2 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels) —↑calcium influx resulting
in increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which is critical in controlling vascular
smooth muscle cell (SMC) contractility and blood pressure (BP). We thoroughly investigated the
miR-30c pathway and recently published our findings in the journal Hypertension. In preliminary
studies, we showed that cocaine- and CM-induced silencing of miR-423-5p expression and
subsequent upregulation of Cacna2d2 led to increased [Ca2+]i, which augmented contractility in
cultured SMCs. Furthermore, miR-423-5p overexpression ameliorated cocaine-induced BP
elevation in vivo. Interestingly, miR-423-5p has been associated with heart failure and coronary
artery disease. Its role in the pathogenesis of HTN remains unknown. Based on our published
work and preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the miR-423—Cacna2d2 axis plays an
important role in cocaine-induced HTN by regulating calcium influx and intracellular
calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in vascular cells. In addition, recent studies support a strong
crosstalk between these two biological processes—Ca2+ signaling and ROS. We have pilot data
showing that modification of both miR axes largely abrogated cocaine-induced SMC contraction.
Therefore, we further hypothesize that these two pathways work synergistically to mediate
cocaine-induced CV consequences. We will thoroughly characterize the ↓miR-423-5p—
↑Cacna2d2—↑ [Ca2+]i axis and its interaction with the ↑miR-30c—↓ME1—↑ROS pathway in
mediating the effects of cocaine on the CV system by using complimentary and vertically
integrated in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models. In addition, we will measure NE and its metabolite
levels, as well as use Prazosin (an -blocker) to block the effects of NE in the in vivo experiments,
aiming to characterize the potential interplay between the miR-mRNA axes and SNS in mediating
the CV effects of cocaine."
10725161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem that affects more than 26 million Americans.
The prevalence of CKD in the veteran population is 34% higher than in the general US population. A key
pathologic feature of CKD is renal inflammation resulting in initiation and progression of chronic kidney disease
to end-stage kidney disease. The current therapeutic options for this progressive condition are limited and often
ineffective. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying renal inflammation is
essential for developing effective strategies for the treatment of CKD.
 We have studied the factors initiating and controlling renal inflammation and have discovered a critical
role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the regulation of renal inflammation during the development of CKD.
Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that the activation of macrophages and the production of
proinflammatory cytokines are dependent upon induction of HDAC3 in the kidney. Genetic deletion or
pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 prevents macrophage activation and proinflammatory molecule production.
Furthermore, the proinflammatory effect of HDAC3 appears to be mediated by regulating nuclear factor kappa
B (NF-kB) signaling pathway. In this application, we plan to examine and characterize the role of HDAC3 in
macrophage activation and proinflammatory molecule production to further understand the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of renal inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that HDAC3 deacetylates histones resulting in
chromatin remodeling, which allows NF-kB to access its DNA response elements to induce proinflammatory
molecule expression. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 is to
determine the role of HDAC3 in the macrophage activation and proinflammatory molecule production; Specific
Aim 2 is to explore the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC3 promotes macrophage activation and
proinflammatory molecule production; and Specific Aim 3 is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a selective
HDAC3 inhibitor for CKD.
 In summary, we plan to utilize molecular, cellular, pharmacological, and genetic approaches to study the
role of HDAC3 in macrophage activation and development of renal injury. Results from our studies will provide
a new understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of renal inflammation and could lead to the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CKD."

Suicidal ideation and behavior are growing public health problems in the United States. Unfortunately, our current
ability to predict suicide is only slightly above chance, which may be attributable to an overreliance on
distal/cross-sectional risk factors that are weak proximal predictors of suicide risk. Modeling the complex process
by which atypical sleep impacts daily functioning in conjunction with established proximal risk factors can aid in
identifying contexts and time periods of greatest suicidal risk, modeled at the individual level. The proposed study
builds upon our team’s extensive expertise in sleep/wake cycles, psychophysiology, deep phenotyping, and
multi-method, multivariate, ecologically valid models of suicide vulnerability in high-risk psychiatric populations.
We will examine how a holistic model of atypical sleep relates to known trait (baseline neurocognitive
performance; e.g., greater impulsive tendencies, higher loss sensitivity, reduced ability to regulate emotions) and
state (time-varying, occurring hours to days before SI/SB; e.g., momentary fluctuations in emotional reactivity,
impulsivity; greater emotional lability; greater isolative tendencies), risk factors for suicide, and examine how
these factors together proximally influence suicidal ideation and confer risk for future suicidal behavior. We will
recruit 200 psychiatric inpatients at high risk for suicide and conduct a baseline assessment of sleep/wake
functioning and trait risk factors and use laboratory-based tasks coupled with psychophysiology (i.e., event-
related potentials, heart rate variability, and electrodermal activity) to phenotype risk processes linked to arousal
and cognitive systems. This baseline assessment will be followed by four weeks of EMA and digital phenotyping
coupled with SAFTE-derived actigraphy to characterize key state risk factors. We will conduct follow-up
assessments at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post hospital discharge to determine how our proximal model of risk
prospectively predicts SI and SB. The proposed study aims to characterize proximal risk for suicide using
intensive longitudinal methods and to identify “windows” of greatest risk for suicide, which may vary from person
to person, that serve as markers for intensive intervention. Finally, we will leverage this extensive dataset to
develop a model of the sleep-suicide relationship emphasizing the contribution of trait and state factors. The
results of this study have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the phenomenology of suicide
risk as it exists in the real world, with the potential to improve our ability to predict, prevent, and intervene using
both traditional and technology-enhanced psychotherapies."
10732224,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Somatic mutations accumulate daily in every cell of the human body. These mutations originate from mutational
processes due to environmental exposures, lifestyle choices, defective cellular machineries, and even normal
cellular activities. Each mutational process imprints a characteristic pattern of mutations on the genome of
somatic cells, termed “mutational signature”. Since somatic mutations are retained in the genomes of cells and
their progenies, the presence of mutational signatures in a somatic genome serves as an “archaeological imprint”
of the activities of the mutational processes that were operative during a person’s lifetime. Recent developments
of computational tools have allowed identifying mutational signatures from the DNA sequences of cancer
samples and quantifying the activities of different mutational processes in individual cancer patients. Analysis of
many thousands of cancer patients across the world has now revealed almost 80 distinct mutational signatures.
Importantly, for each of these patients, we now know the mutational processes that have caused their cancers
and, for many of these patients, we could identify potential strategies to reduce environmental exposures and
prevent their cancers. However, an effective and timely cancer prevention requires knowing the mutational
processes operating in a healthy individual and eliminating or reducing the activities of these processes before
that individual develops cancer. Unfortunately, currently, there are no approaches that allow quantifying
mutational signatures of environmental exposures in a healthy individual and, thus, many opportunities for
personalize cancer prevention are missed. Here, we propose to develop a novel computational approach that
will allow noninvasive monitoring of mutational signatures in easily accessible normal somatic tissues of healthy
individuals. Our approach will perform a direct detection of somatic mutational signatures from low coverage
single-cell DNA sequencing data without relying on prior identification of somatic mutations. The approach will
be optimized and validated using single-cell DNA sequencing data from: (i) in vitro cell lines exposed to
environmental mutagens; (ii) an in vivo mouse model consuming water contaminated with a strong chemical
mutagen; (iii) healthy individuals with established exposures to known environmental mutagens. Overall, this
project will transform our ability to monitor the activities of the mutational processes in normal tissues of healthy
individuals and it will open a plethora of opportunities for personalized cancer prevention through possible
targeted interventions that reduce mutagenic exposures from environment agents and lifestyle choices."
10771981,"Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial minority group in the U.S and yet there is a dearth of research
on their cognitive aging and risks for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). This is especially
true for Vietnamese Americans, the largest Southeast Asian group in the U.S. Vietnamese Americans suffer
disproportionately from early life adversity and trauma, depression, and low socioeconomic status (SES), all of
which may increase risk for cognitive impairment and development of dementia. The specific sociocultural
context of this group (i.e., high exposure to trauma, post-traumatic stress, diverse acculturation and
immigration patterns) provides a unique opportunity to examine how early life factors and sociocultural diversity
impact cognitive outcomes. In this R01 application, Vietnamese Insights into Cognitive Aging Program (VIP),
we will develop an unprecedented longitudinal study of older Vietnamese Americans to begin addressing the
dearth of cognitive aging research in this population. The overall goal is to obtain preliminary estimates of mild
cognitive impairment and dementia in the community and identify ADRD risk and resilience factors in this
understudied group. Using the NIA health disparities research framework as a model, we propose the
following: Aim 1: Characterize longitudinal cognitive function and ADRD risk in a community-based cohort of
540 older Vietnamese aged 65+ living in Northern California. Aim 2a: Examine the role of adversity and trauma
on ADRD risk in older Vietnamese. Aim 2b: Evaluate the influence of current sociocontextual factors on ADRD
risk in older Vietnamese. Aim 3: Determine the role of cardiovascular disease and health risk factors on
cognition in older Vietnamese. In the process of studying these important risk and protective factors, we will
engage a population that is severely missing from aging research and contribute to theory on the role of
adversity, trauma, and sociocultural diversity on dementia risk. This study will leverage an older Vietnamese
population with which we already have strong community partnerships to create an unmatched longitudinal
study. Findings will lead to a better understanding of cognitive aging and mechanisms of disease in this
understudied group but also have broader implications for advancing our knowledge of the sociocultural and
early life contributions to cognitive aging in other populations."
10767174,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death in the United States with high
morbidity, including poor quality of life and respiratory exacerbations leading to hospitalization and increased
mortality. There are no disease modifying drugs for COPD. Low-income individuals are disproportionately
affected by COPD and have significantly worse health outcomes compared to those with higher income. Our
team, and others, found that increased exposure to social environmental stressors is associated with worse
COPD respiratory symptoms and quality of life, independent of chronologic age, education, BMI, and smoking
history. However, strategies to reduce social/behavioral risk factors have, to date, been inefficient. Thus,
complementary strategies to reduce the burden of disease are needed; biologic mechanisms, e.g. epigenetics,
that could be intervened upon, could provide a promising alternative strategy.
 Strong parallel lines of evidence support epigenetic involvement in the biologic response to social stress
exposures and for COPD pathogenesis. Both individual loci and the epigenetic aging pathway are implicated.
Our preliminary results further support DNA methylation (DNAm; a type of epigenetic data) is related to both
worse COPD outcomes and increased social stress exposure, in a low-income population. Despite this
evidence, no studies have rigorously examined DNAm in the context of both social stressors and COPD
outcomes. Therefore, this ESI-led proposal tests the hypothesis that social environment stressors contribute
to worsened COPD respiratory and quality of life outcomes through epigenetic mechanisms, including in the
epigenetic aging pathway and at individual (non-aging) loci. We leverage two existing COPD studies that
collected unified measures of social stressors, from across the lifespan, COPD health outcomes, as well as
blood and induced sputum biosamples with suitable prevalence and variability in exposures and outcomes.
 In Aim 1, we test for accelerated epigenetic aging mechanisms in social stress effects on COPD health
outcomes. In Aim 2, we test for DNA methylation mechanisms at a targeted set of loci (previously associated
with COPD, socioeconomic position, or social stressors). For each aim, blood and induced sputum DNAm will
be tested in parallel, and results compared across specimen types to further inform mechanism/biomarker
utility. Social stress exposures to be tested include past adverse childhood experience and recent violence,
discrimination, and perceived stress as well as a composite index of stress. COPD outcomes to be tested
include impact of COPD on health and life quality (via SGRQ and CAT score) and respiratory symptom
severity (via mMRC and exacerbation frequency). Aim 3 will relate DNAm findings from Aims 1-2 to induced
sputum gene expression levels to identify downstream functional gene expression changes. Our results can
provide new DNA and/or RNA biologic targets that could be intervened upon to improve COPD
outcomes, particularly in low-income groups."
10764261,"Abstract
Heterotrimeric G proteins () are well known for their function in linking G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) to a variety of intracellular responses, and thereby playing essential roles in transmitting a wide
variety of extracellular signals into regulation of countless physiological processes. However, it has also
become increasingly recognized that G proteins can function independently of GPCRs. Highlighting the
physiological relevance of GPCR-independent G protein function, constitutively activating somatic mutations
in several G subunits have been identified and shown to contribute to human disease, most prominently in
cancer. This research project focuses on constitutively active mutants of the highly similar q and 11
subunits, collectively termed q/11. Mutations at one of two hotspot residues, that result in inhibition of the
GTP hydrolysis turn-off mechanism, can convert q/11 into an oncogenic driver of uveal melanoma, and
such constitutively activating q/11 mutations have also been associated with vascular tumors, capillary
malformation, congenital hemangioma and Sturge Weber syndrome. This research project will focus on
uncovering basic cellular mechanisms regulating signaling by mutationally activated q/11. G subunits are
typically thought as exceptionally difficult proteins for which to develop pharmacological or molecular
inhibitors. However, numerous recent studies have demonstrated that the highly similar natural products
YM-254890 and FR900359 are effective inhibitors of wild type and mutationally activated q/11. Our work
has uncovered an unexpected mechanism of action of these inhibitors leading to the hypothesis that YM-
254890 and FR900359 inhibit q/11, at least in part, by regulating subcellular localization of q/11.
Understanding the novel mechanisms of inhibition and cellular regulation of mutationally activated q/11 may
suggest novel therapeutic targets or approaches for disrupting dysregulated signaling. The objectives in this
research project will be pursued by a variety of experimental approaches, including using cultured cells,
immunofluorescence microscopy, fluorescence microscopy of live cells, constitutive targeting to specific
subcellular locations, biosensors, pharmacological inhibitors, mutational analysis, and biochemical assays."
10731746,"Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is the most potent and abundant cyanotoxin produced by freshwater blue-green algae.
MCLR exposure is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). NAFLD has quickly risen to become the most common chronic liver disease in many countries, and HCC
is the most common type of primary liver cancer. My K99/R00 data indicate MCLR drives progression of
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced form of NAFLD, to a more severe burnt out phenotype
(increased fibrosis and reduced steatosis). The burnt out stage is an important pathogenic step towards
irreversible cirrhosis and HCC. Preliminary data in Sprague Dawley rats indicate that MCLR-elicited burnt out
NASH persists 4 weeks after MCLR exposure, in contrast to the control diet group that returned to a baseline
phenotype. In addition, MCLR persistently dysregulated matrisome genes (related to fibrosis) and
carcinogenesis genes (de-differentiation/stem cell markers) in NASH. Based on these data we hypothesize
MCLR-mediated fibrotic and carcinogenic reprogramming of the liver is enhanced in NASH and promotes the
development of cirrhosis and HCC. This hypothesis will be tested in two aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of
the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-associated pathways in MCLR-mediated stellate cell activation and
hepatocyte de-differentiation. Considering the liver is the primary target for MCLR, there is surprising paucity of
research investigating these pathways and none have examined the cell type specific effects of PP2A. STUDY
1.1 will define the contribution of specific PP2A-associated pathways responsible for MCLR-elicited hepatocyte
and stellate effects using MCLR and PP2 modulators in human HepaRG hepatocytes and human LX2 stellate
cells co-cultured as 3D spheroids in static culture or microfluidics. STUDY 1.2 will test the hypothesis that
hepatocytes are the primary MCLR target and stellate cells are activated by hepatocyte damage using HepaRG
and LX2 cells cultured individually or in combination in transwell plates. STUDY 1.3 will define the effects of PP2A-
pathway modulators on MCLR- and NASH diet-elicited liver pathology in rats fed either a control or a NASH diet.
Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms and long-term effects of MCLR-elicited fibrotic and carcinogenic
reprogramming on cirrhosis and HCC development in healthy versus NASH. STUDY 2.1 will mimic important
aspects of the original MCLR tolerable daily intake study including the dose (40 µg/kg), interval (daily), and
duration (3 months) in the context of a tumor initiator (diethylnitrosamine) and a NASH diet. These mechanistic
studies will be complemented with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei transcriptomics analyses, potentially
providing druggable targets. This research will have sustained impact because it will be the first to
comprehensively assess MCLR-elicited cirrhosis and HCC in pre-existing liver disease. By mimicking the TDI
study, this research may indicate a lower TDI is required for people with pre-existing liver disease."
10725134,"Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs or concussions) caused by blast overpressure from exploding
ordnance are the “signature injuries” of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Postconcussive symptoms are
common and often persist for years after Veterans have returned from deployment(s); however, the
neuropathobiology underlying these symptoms is poorly understood. Our published and preliminary studies
demonstrate in a battlefield-relevant mouse model of blast mTBI, in living Veterans with repetitive blast
mTBIs, and in postmortem brain tissue from Veterans and Servicemembers with blast mTBIs that the
cerebellum is particularly vulnerable. The cerebellum is increasingly implicated in cognitive/behavioral
changes characteristic of persistent postconcussive symptoms. Our preliminary studies suggest that these
neuropathobiologic changes extend to the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) and its projections to the
cerebellar dentate nucleus (CDN) via the superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). To understand the nature and
implications of mTBI damage to the LC-cerebellar dentate nucleus network, the following conceptually
integrated translational Specific Aims are proposed:
 Specific Aim 1.1. To determine whether LC and cerebellar changes on initial DTI scan predict
longitudinal impairments in: a) cerebellar regional glucose uptake by FDG-PET, b) working memory, and c)
cognitive set-shifting in Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans with repetitive blast mTBI.
 Specific Aim 1.2. To determine in postmortem brain tissue from repetitive mTBI
Veteran/Servicemember and control cases whether mTBI is specifically associated with LC-cerebellar fiber
injury and/or loss as compared to LC-cortical and/or LC-hippocampal fibers injury and/or loss.
 Specific Aim 2. To determine, in our mouse blast model, whether LC-cerebellar projections are
specifically vulnerable to degeneration following repetitive blast mTBI. Cerebellum-projecting LC neurons will
be labeled using a canine adenovirus (CAV) red fluorescent reporter in mice expressing green fluorescent
protein in LC fibers. Single cell RNA sequencing will test whether dual-labeled LC neurons projecting to the
cerebellum exhibit a specific neurodegenerative and cell stress phenotype following repetitive blast mTBI.
 Specific Aim 3.1. To determine in non-blast mice whether working memory and cognitive set shifting
deficits are caused by nonspecific SCP WM injury or by specific injury to LC fibers projecting to the
cerebellum. SCP WM injury will be induced by bilateral injection of 1% lysolecithin. LC fiber injury will be
induced using bilateral viral transduction with CAV-Cre AAV-DO diphtheria toxin.
 Specific Aim 3.2. To determine in non-blast mice if loss of NA signaling by LC neurons projecting to
the posterior cerebellum is sufficient to cause working memory and cognitive set shifting deficits similar to
blast mTBI. A viral transgenic approach will be used to knock out TH expression bilaterally in LC neurons
passing through the SCP."
10725150,"Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating
effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people
50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment
options for the disease require a greater understanding of the cellular events and signaling
pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed research capitalizes on a recently
identified secreted inhibitor of Wnt glycoproteins. The long-term goal of the proposed project is
to investigate whether targeting a new, secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling—Notum--can improve
bone properties and reduce fracture susceptibility. In the first aim we propose to determine the
cell type in which Notum inhibition exerts its effects on bone homeostasis, by crossing
conditional Notum mutant mice to different Cre drivers that are active during different stages of
the mesenchymal cell lineage. We will also look the gene expression changes induced by
Notum inhibition to see if the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical Wnt pathway, the
Hedgehog pathway, or some other pathway, is primarily affected. We will also identify
downstream nodes in the pathways altered by Notum inhibition, to see if there are more readily
targetable effectors of the HBM phenotype induced by Notum inhibition. I the second aim, we
will conduct functional studies targeting Notum, which has direct applicability to future
therapeutic approaches in patients. Glucocorticoids are widely used among the veteran
population for numerous conditions, including organ transplant, rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and others, but side effects are not trivial, and bone wasting is a
major concern among glucocorticoid-treated patients. Likewise, mechanical disuse is a major
problem among veterans, which results from long term bedrest, paralysis, and other
complications. We will inhibit Notum in these preclinical models to determine whether Notum
inhibition represents a viable strategy for preserving bone mass and function during two relevant
bone wasting conditions. In this renewal Merit application, we address these questions in order
to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the
public in general."
10725136,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a pathological process affecting solid organ allografts and occurs
when a transplanted organ subjected to prolonged disruption of blood flow undergoes tissue damage following
surgical implantation. IRI frequently occurs among deceased donors and predisposes to chronic antibody-
mediated rejection (CABMR), decreased graft survival, and worsened patient outcomes. This condition has no
effective medical treatments and is especially relevant to veteran transplant recipients who undergo higher
rates of deceased donor transplants and are thus at risk for developing IRI and its related complications.
 In recognition of the significant lifetime health burden and costs incurred by IRI to veteran patients and
to the VA Healthcare System, respectively, recent federal mandates have established mechanisms to
systemically improve care for veteran recipients of solid organ transplants, in particular renal transplants. This
mandate will increase the number of transplanting VA centers, institute systems-based changes to improve
pre- and post-operative access to care, and promote basic research to improve allograft survival.
 In this context, we submit this transplant immunology application to explore a role for Hedgehog (Hh)
signaling in CABMR, an IRI-associated complication in solid organ transplantation. Complement (C') are
immune proteins involved in host defense that are pathologically activated on endothelial cells (ECs) during
IRI, a process we have found selectively expands T peripheral helper (TPH cells), a recently discovered CD4+ T
cell subset specialized in provision of B cell help. Hh signaling is a widely studied pathway regulating wound
healing by eliciting vascular cell proliferation. We reasoned that Hh ligands are released by C'-injured ECs
during IRI as a signal for autologous wound repair, but concurrently these same ligands could expand
alloimmune TPH cells that go on to promote alloantibody responses and CABMR-related pathologies.
 To test this notion, we used humanized models in vitro and in vivo, and we used prospectively collected
patient samples to increase the clinical relevance of our findings. Our data showed that IRI-treated ECs
produced Hh ligands in a C'-dependent manner that selectively activated T peripheral helper (TPH) cells, a
newly described T cell subset specialized in provision of B cell help. Mechanistically, Hh induced ZFYVE21, a
novel Rab5 effector we discovered, to elicit Akt-mediated NRLP3 inflammasomes in TPH cells. This resulted in
IL-18 release and IL-18-mediated expansion of IL-18R1+TPH cells that promoted CABMR-like pathologies
including vascular inflammation, alloAb production, and vasculopathy. These exciting preliminary data address
an important and prevalent clinical problem that is a focus area of recent federal initiatives at the VA.
 From these data, we hypothesize that Hedgehog ligands released by C'-injured EC during IRI activate
CD4+ TPH cells to elicit CABMR-associated pathologies. We will explore this hypothesis in 2 non-
interdependent Aims. In Aim 1, we will employ biochemical and functional assays to identify mechanisms(s) by
which Hh agonism activates a ZFYVE21-Akt-Casp1 axis to elicit inflammasome-dependent expansion of TPH
cells. We propose cutting edge approaches including phosphoproteomic analyses to facilitate mechanistic
discovery. In Aim 2, we will test the relevance of ZFYVE21-Akt-Casp1 signaling in vivo using 2 humanized
mouse models of CABMR, and we will test the clinical relevance of lead molecule(s) using prospectively
collected patient specimens. Our studies explore Hedgehog signaling as a new pathway that may be feasibly
modulated in clinical settings with recently FDA-approved agents to putatively block IRI-associated
complications like CABMR in solid organ transplantation. As such, findings from these studies may be relevant
for improving allograft survival in veteran patients who are at risk for IRI and its associated complications."

to maintain and upgrade the hardware, infrastructure, software and systems necessary for peak
performance and to develop and support the proposed improvements described in other sections
of this application. Knowledgebases like Xenbase must integrate and process a diverse array of
data and provide users with tools and interfaces to query and explore its content. These are all
computational processes. In addition, Xenbase must interface with external databases and
resources (NCBI, the AGR, publishers) to synchronize content and to provide annotated Xenopus
data. Although invisible to the user, there is a considerable amount of computing that occurs
behind the scenes every time a researcher uses Xenbase. Xenbase is a complex computing
environment consisting of multiple, separate databases, many different software applications,
user and curator web interfaces, and many automated data exchange pipelines. To ensure
stability and enhance performance, tool sets are isolated on their own virtual machines (VMs) -
we currently run ~20 VMs in our private cloud - and we constantly monitor, test, maintain, and fix
bugs to keep it all running smoothly. Each time new software is implemented, we test it on isolated
VMs, then optimize and integrate it with existing systems. All of this activity is contained within
the Computation component and is paramount to achieving our overall project goals. In this
component, we describe the computing work needed to maintain current functionality, generate
custom content and the resources necessary to implement expansions and improvements over
the next award cycle.
Aim 1. Upgrade hardware, servers and software stack to increase capacity and expanded
functionalities.
Aim 2. Maintain and expand computation of Xenbase content.
Aim 3. Manage and monitor networking and systems"

Clinical time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems capable of excellent coincidence time
resolution (CTR) promise to drastically enhance effective 511 keV photon sensitivity. The ability to more precisely
localize annihilation origins along system response lines constrains event data, providing improved signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) and reconstructed image quality by associating 511 keV photons more closely to their true
origin. This SNR enhancement increases as CTR is improved, and a major goal of ongoing PET instrumentation
research and development is to push system CTR ≤100 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). At this level of
performance, events are constrained ≤1.5 cm, providing more than a five-fold increase in SNR relative to a
system with no TOF capability. Advanced systems capable of ≤100 ps FWHM CTR would effectively more than
double or quadruple the effective 511 keV system sensitivity, in comparison to state-of-the-art, clinical TOF-PET
systems (250-400 ps FWHM CTR). Thus, advancing CTR is also a pathway for greatly improved system
sensitivity without increasing detection volume and system cost. Standard PET detectors comprising segmented
arrays of high-aspect-ratio scintillation crystal elements cannot achieve this level of performance and are
ultimately limited by poor light collection efficiency and depth-dependent scintillation photon transit time jitter
seen by the photodetector. To address this, we propose to develop a new detector readout concept which allows
scintillation photons to be counted and a unique timestamp to be assigned for the first arriving photon at each
photosensor pixel. We will leverage this new advancement in scalable PET detector readout and produce PET
detector modules capable of high resolution, three-dimensional positioning capabilities and 100 ps FWHM CTR
in a design that also makes no sacrifices on 511 keV photon detection efficiency. The new detector design will
be integrated into large area detector modules that span the full axial extent (>20 cm) of a clinical PET system,
including front-end signal and back-end data processing. We will construct a prototype tomographic imaging
setup and quantify relevant system performance metrics and the imaging performance of future clinical systems
made from this new detector. The proposed PET detector technologies can have a significant impact on
quantitative PET imaging. The image SNR enabled by the significant boost in effective sensitivity can be
employed to substantially reduce tracer dose and shorten scan time/increase patient throughput, or to better
visualize and quantify smaller lesions/features in the presence of significant background, which are important
features that can make PET more practical and accurate, as well as help to expand its roles in patient
management."
10690535,"Project Summary/Abstract
There is a critical need to develop novel effective, well-tolerated therapies for children and young adults with
recurrent or progressive high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors and meningiomas, who currently have
limited treatment options and an extremely poor prognosis. Somatostatin receptors regulate cell growth through
complex downstream modulation of both proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways, and thus represent a
potential therapeutic target. 177Lu-DOTATATE, a radionuclide therapy which binds type-2A somatostatin
receptors (SST2A) and delivers local radiation via beta particle emission, has recently gained FDA approval for
the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors given efficacy and safety data in adults with
these SST2A-expressing tumors. There is potential for successful expansion of 177Lu-DOTATATE to pediatric
and young adult neuro-oncology, based upon growing evidence that many CNS tumors are characterized by
high SST2A expression, exhibit corresponding uptake on somatostatin receptor imaging (e.g., DOTATATE PET),
and have preliminary data demonstrating response (disease stabilization or regression) to somatostatin receptor-
targeted therapy in case reports/series, suggesting sufficient CNS penetration to achieve therapeutic benefit.
Minimal toxicity has been observed aside from a low prevalence of myelosuppression. We, therefore, are
conducting a phase I/II trial assessing safety and efficacy of 177Lu-DOTATATE in pediatric and young
adult patients with refractory SST2A-expressing high-grade CNS tumors (medulloblastoma and other
embryonal tumors, high-grade gliomas including DIPG, and anaplastic ependymomas) and
meningiomas, using both SST2A immunohistochemistry and DOTATATE PET imaging as screening
criteria for eligibility to ensure presence of the target. The primary aims of this proposal are to (1) establish
the maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 177Lu-DOTATATE in pediatric
patients with recurrent or progressive CNS tumors [Phase I arm] and (2) evaluate efficacy of 177Lu-DOTATATE
in adolescent and young adult patients, administered at the FDA-approved adult dosing, assessed via 6-month
progressive-free survival compared to historical controls [Phase II arm]. Several exploratory studies will be
incorporated, with goals of (1) determining the prevalence, heterogeneity, and key clinical, radiographic,
histopathologic, and molecular correlates of SST2A expression across pediatric and young adult CNS tumors,
(2) identifying imaging (DOTATATE PET and MRI) and peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid (‘liquid biopsy’)-
based molecular biomarkers predictive of response to 177Lu-DOTATATE, and (3) characterizing radiation
dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTATATE to estimate tumor dose/CNS penetration and minimize toxicity risk, including in
patients who received prior cranial radiation. If a preliminary efficacy signal is detected, further research will be
planned to expand this targeted radiotherapy to a larger patient population with refractory brain/spine tumors
and eventually incorporate 177Lu-DOTATATE into upfront treatment backbones for these aggressive diseases."
10725135,"Osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is highly prevalent in U.S. military service
members and veterans due to the impact of joint trauma and overuse injury. Its socioeconomic impact is
substantial, estimated to approach $60 billion per year, and no disease-modifying treatments exist. Current
understanding is that PTOA is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the pro-
inflammatory pathways of innate immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural decline. This
project addresses the hypothesis that promotion of hyaline cartilage repair will effectively alter the course of
PTOA, relieve joint pain and improve joint function. Native mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) residing in the joint
are important targets for manipulation to differentiate into chondrocytes. These joint-resident MSCs include
cartilage progenitor cells, MSCs in synovial fluid, synovium and adipose tissue. SOX9 (SRY-type high-mobility
group box gene-9) is the master transcription factor for chondrogenesis of MSCs. We have produced a
superpositively charged SOX9 (scSOX9) which can penetrate into MSCs and induce chondrogenesis. We
have demonstrated in an acute cartilage injury model that scSOX9 induced hyaline-like cartilage repair by
promoting chondrogenesis of bone marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). By using medial meniscal transection
(MMT) induced rat PTOA model, we will test the therapeutic effect of scSOX9 by harnessing the chondrogenic
potential of these joint-resident MSCs for regeneration of hyaline cartilage. Pain and joint function will be
assessed clinically in live animals by measuring behavior changes at different time points of the disease
course. The degree of cartilage regeneration or repair and synovitis will be quantified by advanced imaging
system. At the termination of experiments, the biomechanical property of the repaired cartilage will be
measured on intact cartilage with subchondral bone using biomomentum indentation technology. Cartilage
degradation, repair and synovitis will also be determined by standardized methods of histopathology and
immunohistochemistry."
10725123,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing multifactorial disease involving genetic ab-
normalities and environmental insults. AMD is the leading cause of blindness for Americans over age sixty.
Since smoking, a major cause of oxidative stress, significantly increases the risk of AMD and there is a 20%
higher incidence of smoking in veterans than in the general U.S. civilian population, the VA system will have to
provide care for potentially >7 million AMD cases. The current concepts of AMD recognize that chronic oxida-
tive stress and inflammation (including complement activation) can trigger pathological changes in RPE,
Bruch’s membrane (BrM) and choroid. Major efforts to develop new AMD therapeutics have been focused on
complement inhibitors. However, to date, all targets within the complement cascade have failed. We pose
that one complication not yet considered is the potential issue of intracellular complement signaling. The
overarching goal is to determine how damage signals leading to mitochondrial dysfunction are spread
throughout the RPE monolayer, and to elucidate the contribution of intracellular complement signaling. Using
highly differentiated RPE cells we have made significant progress demonstrating that oxidative stress
changes the cargo in exosomes that are released from cells and that those exosomes induce short- and
long-term changes in recipient RPE. Importantly, we found that long-term changes triggered by exosomes
included changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and have identified potential mediators. Likewise, we
showed that oxidative stress triggers mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium changes in an individual
stressed cell that is then propagated through gap junctions to receptive cells. A receptive cell was identified
as a cell with high baseline calcium, less negative membrane potential and low melanin levels. Based on the
new knowledge identified in the previous funding period, we wish to expand on the following hypotheses. 1)
As it is now accepted that an overactive complement system is tied to AMD incidence, we propose to investi-
gate the contribution of intracellular complement signaling in mitochondrial damage and ensuing pathology.
And 2) as mitochondria are the organelles responsible for energy production and making life/death decisions
in a cell, we wish to determine the contribution of exosomes to the transfer of information to recipient cells.
Two aims were designed to answers those questions. Aim 1 tests the prediction that intracellular calcium
and complement signaling contribute to mitochondrial stress in the RPE network; Aim 2 tests the prediction
that exosomal content alters intracellular milieu resulting in changes in mitochondrial homeostasis in the
RPE network. We will test questions in three sets of cells with different features: ARPE-19, which can easily
be manipulated; second, we will use J and H mitochondrial cybrids, in which the J haplotype is associated
with increased risk for AMD; and third, we will examine questions in iPSC-RPE cells with Chr1 versus Chr10
risk alleles and their isogenic controls. These studies will have important implication in AMD biology. First,
knowledge about the role of intracellular complement signaling in mitochondrial metabolism, and second, elu-
cidating how endogenous signaling transmitted via exosomes can alter mitochondrial homeostasis within the
RPE, together will have important consequences for the future development of AMD therapeutics."
10725122,"Stroke is one of the major medical concerns for United States veterans. At least 15,000 veterans are
hospitalized every year for stroke and most survivors live with long-term neurological impairments.
Unfortunately, development of effective therapies is seriously limited. Extensive studies have shown that BBB
breakdown promotes a devastating cascade of events, contributing to transmigration of peripheral immune
cells, cerebral inflammatory responses, edema, hemorrhagic transformation, neuronal loss and eventual
neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Thus, it is necessary to identify mechanisms and
develop effective therapeutic strategies that protect BBB integrity and prevent permanent neurovascular injury
after I/R.
 Nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2), a nitroalkene formed in nitric oxide (NO)-dependent oxidative reactions, has
been found in human plasma and is thought to be a novel cell signaling mediator that regulates physiological
functions in multiple cell types. It has been shown that OA-NO2 is an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) ligand and activates PPARγ at physiological levels. Recent data have shown that
OA-NO2 significantly reduces peripheral vascular inflammation and endoluminal vessel injury. Provocatively,
several publications have documented that OA-NO2 is increased under ischemia-reperfusion conditions and
attenuates cardiac or renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the functional significance and molecular
mechanisms of OA-NO2 in regulating cerebrovascular pathogenesis, in particular BBB disruption, and resultant
neurological outcomes remain unexplored in ischemic stroke.
 In our preliminary studies, we have recently identified for the first time that intravenous (i.v.) administration
of OA-NO2 leads to reuced BBB leakage, smaller brain infarction, and improved neurobehavior in mice after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Moreover, we found that OA-NO2 significantly elevates the mRNA
and protein expression of major BBB tight junctions in cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs).
These findings suggest that nitroalkenes may play a critical neurovascular protective role in ischemic brain
damage. In this proposal, we will test our Central Hypothesis that OA-NO2 preserves BBB integrity after I/R
via activation of PPARγ and other signaling pathways, attenuates BBB disruption and subsequent
pathological cascades, thereby eliciting neurovascular protection. Three aims will be performed in this
proposal. Aim 1: Define the role of OA-NO2 in BBB dysfunction/recovery and brain injury after ischemic stroke;
Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanisms of OA-NO2 regulation of post-stroke BBB dysfunction/recovery; Aim 3:
Explore systematic delivery of OA-NO2 as a potential BBB stabilizing therapy in ischemic stroke. Elucidating
the molecular mechanisms of OA-NO2-mediated BBB stabilization and recovery may lead us to discover novel
pharmaceutical approaches for the effective treatment against ischemic stroke."
10725157,"Overall Research Strategy: The overall goal of the CaRa-AP Collaborative Program is to develop a treatment
for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) that will relieve pain and improve function. We hypothesize that PTOA
is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the pro-inflammatory pathways of innate
immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural decline. This Program addresses the hypothesis
through two highly-integrated aims: (1) innovative intra-articular treatments using small molecules, biologic
inhibitors and immunomodulatory cells to reduce pain and inflammation in the joint and (2) tissue engineering
using stem cell-based therapies for reconstruction of the damaged joint infrastructure. The investigators
collaborating in this program will coordinate testing of therapies in four animal models that mimic different
mechanisms of injury that initiate PTOA in patients. The experiments will take into consideration relevant factors
affecting joint physiology and treatment response. The effects of different therapeutic modalities will be evaluated
using group-standardized measurements of pain, function, inflammation and structure, so that results can be
compared across laboratories and the most promising therapeutic strategies prioritized for clinical trials.
We provide compelling evidence that sequential treatment of mesenchymal progenitors with BMP2 and non-
canonical Wnt5a, cultured in high density pellets, yield articular-like cells in vitro. These effects are reproduced
when small molecules Kartogenin (KGN), a chondrogenic small molecule targeting Runx1, and Foxy5, a Wnt5a
mimetic peptide, are sequentially used. Moreover, implantation of pellets, treated with BMP2 followed by Wnt5a,
into a rat chondral defect regenerate articular-like cartilage. Our preliminary data also demonstrate an influence
of physical exercise on cartilage preservation and joint function in a rat model of PTOA. Thus, we ask whether
the source of stem cells can differentially promote hyaline cartilage regeneration and if physical rehabilitation
can improve pellet integration and treatment outcome. Specifically, we aim to compare the efficacy of somatic
cells (human articular chondrocytes and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells) to that of patient-
specific, and readily available, pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesize that cell plasticity will determine the
potential of adult versus pluripotent stem cells to treat cartilage degeneration, and that successful
restoration of cartilage integrity via cellular and physical therapy will lead to enhanced functional
outcomes and reduced nociception in vivo.
We will first establish the capacity of iPSC-derived MSCs to that of adipose-derived and human articular
cartilage MSCs with and without sequential treatment with KGN and Foxy5 to regenerate articular cartilage
following implantation of control or treated high-density pellets into a rat chondral defect model of PTOA.
Histological evaluations, matrix synthesis, mechanical testing and molecular imaging analyses will be performed
(Aim 1). We will then assess the effect of cellular and physical treatment of animals on long-term
functional, nociceptive, and centralized pain outcomes. We will evaluate functional outcomes in control and
experimental rats that receive either iPSC-derived MSCs or the most effective adult stem cell source identified
in Aim 1. Specifically, gait, voluntary running, muscle strength, mechanical testing, and allodynia analyses will
also be performed. We will also assess the neurological changes that often lead to chronic joint pain (Aim 2)."
10725148,"Summary/Abstract:
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains remarkably lethal with a 5-year survival rate of less than
9%. Due to its widespread resistance to conventional therapy, PDAC is expected to be the second most common
cause of cancer-related death in the United States by 2030. Oncogenic KRAS mutations are nearly uniform in
PDAC, affecting over 90% of patients. The mutant KRAS is a key driver in the neoplastic phenotype, and leads
to hyper-activation of KRAS, permitting for sustained proliferation, the evasion of apoptosis, as well as facilitating
metastasis and the development of chemo-resistance. In spite of the importance of KRAS in PDAC pathobiology
and extensive research aimed at the discovery of RAS-directed therapeutics, there are no FDA-approved drugs
directed to target RAS; and RAS family proteins are largely considered `un-druggable'. Therefore, there is a need
to identify either alternative- druggable target(s) or better approaches in hopes of improving patient outcomes.
The inflammatory pathway is known to play significant roles in many cancer, including pancreatic cancer.
Number of reports suggest that there is a direct link between inflammation and pancreatic cancer. We identified
MLK3, a novel kinase that is activated by TNFα and plays role in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Recently we
identified an MLK3 upstream kinase, MAP4K4, which is also activated by TNFα, suggesting perhaps, TNFα-
MAP4K4-MLK3 axis might play a role in pancreatic cancer, which was corroborated by a recent report indicating
worst outcomes in PDAC patient with high expression of MAP4K4. Considering our observation, we treated
animal model of PDAC with a specific inhibitor of MAP4K4, GNE-495. Interestingly, the GNE-495 was able to
ameliorate PDAC in the pre-clinical animal model, a significant decrease in stroma and increased cell death in
cancerized ductal cells. Since immune cells play vital roles in cancer therapy, we examined peripheral immune
compartment that had no effect of GNE-495. We rationalized to treat animals with 4-1BB agonistic antibody to
activate effector T cells. The combined treatment of GNE-495 along with 4-1BB mab had profound effect on
animal survival and almost stroma/Desmoplasia was absent in tumors. The overall objective of this proposal is
to elucidate the role of MAP4K4 in PDAC and strategize a rational approach to combine MAP4K inhibitor and
immunotherapies to overcome pancreatic cancer. The central objective will be addressed by: (1) defining the
role of MAP4K4 in PDAC, (2) determining the impact of MAP4K4 inhibition in TME, and (3) determining impact
of MAP4K inhibition along with immunotherapy on host immunity.
Upon completion of these three aims, it is our expectation, that first, we will be able to establish the role of
MAP4K4 in PDAC. Second, we would establish clinical significance of targeting MAP4K4, along with
rationalized immunotherapy for an alternative pancreatic cancer treatment strategy."
10725142,"The overarching goal of my research is to apply molecular neuroscience research to identify
better treatments for Veterans conditions for which there are currently no effective treatments.
Specifically, my work has focused on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Gulf
War Illness (GWI) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Primarily, I use mouse models of
these conditions, in order to explore the pathobiology of each condition over the mouse lifespan at the
behavioral, biochemical and pathological level, and therein identify key targets for potential
therapeutic intervention. Mouse models of AD, created using human AD-causing mutations
(including those which I discovered), are commercially available; the mouse models of TBI, GWI and
PTSD I have developed in-house. Using brain tissue and blood samples from these mice, we
investigate cellular and molecular level changes that correlate with behavioral and pathological
outcomes, in order to identify i) in the brain, potential molecular targets to intervene in the
pathobiological sequelae; and ii) in the blood, potential diagnostic and theragnostic signatures. I work
closely with many clinical collaborators to inform and direct the development and characterization of
these models and to ensure that they have clinical relevance, in order to facilitate translation into
clinical applications. This includes obtaining human blood and autopsied brain samples which can be
used to verify and validate findings from our mouse models. Neuroinflammatory and neuroimmune
mechanisms are emerging as key contributors in all of these conditions, but those umbrella terms
encompass a multitude of detail into which we are now delving, including cell-specific and timing-
specific responses.
 One of the unique aspects of my research programs has been our attention to lifelong
consequences of the insults/exposures experienced in TBI, GWI or PTSD. These lengthy studies
have resulted in e.g. 1) characterization of the lifelong (27 months old) consequences of single and
repetitive mild TBI in mice aged 3 months at the time of injury – critically important data to understand
the chronic effects of neurotrauma and provide a platform for studies of potential therapeutics; 2)
characterization of the lifelong (25 months old) consequences of early life (3 months old) exposure to
agents known to be contributory to GWI – very important for the current patient population who are
suffering Today from GWI, more than 28 years after their toxic exposures; 3) demonstration of
behavioral, biochemical and pathological outcomes in our novel PTSD mouse model 6 months after
stress exposure –a translationally relevant preclinical platform in which to model our military and
veteran populations with persisting PTSD.
 In these relevant laboratory models, we are identifying cell signaling pathways which, when
modulated, mitigate against the negative outcomes of these various exposures. In GWI we have
shown that the PPARa agonist, and dietary supplement, oleyoylethanolamide (OEA) is an effective
treatment in our model, and have advanced into a Phase II human trial of OEA (ongoing). We have
demonstrated that Nilvadipine (our lead anti-AD drug with anti-amyloid, anti-tau and anti-inflammatory
properties) and Anatabine (a potent NFkB inhibitor / anti-inflammatory agent, previously available as
a nutraceutical) each show positive outcomes in our mTBI models, including when administered at
delayed timepoints post-injury (again highly relevant to the human mTBI patient population). My goal
over the next ten years is to advance validated, well rationalized, novel treatments, derived from
these research studies, into human clinical trials for AD, TBI, GWI and PTSD."
10725132,"The overarching theme of my current research is to understand how growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF1) regulate adult metabolic function and how dysregulation of GH/IGF1 production and
signaling contributes to the progression of metabolic disease, as well as related tissue injury and repair. A major
focus of my work is to understand the etiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD represents
a spectrum of excess fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) without or with inflammation/fibrosis (non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis - NASH). NAFLD is commonly observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes, but is also observed in
non-obese patients associated with cardiovascular disease, where all diseases are more prevalent in Veterans,
compared to the general population. NASH increases the risk of developing liver cancer, and is now recognized
as the leading cause for liver transplantation. Dietary fatty acids (FA) and FA derived from adipose tissue
lipolysis, due to systemic insulin resistance, are major contributors to NAFLD. In addition, enhanced hepatic de
novo lipogenesis (DNL) contributes to NAFLD. Clinical and experimental studies show NAFLD is associated with
reduced GH-signaling (reflected by low plasma GH and hepatic GH resistance, leading to low IGF1 levels). The
reduction in GH-signaling may exacerbate NAFLD, based on studies showing SNPs within the GH / GH receptor
(GHR) /JAK2 / Stat5 signaling pathway are associated with NAFLD. Also, increasing GH can reduce NAFLD in
both humans and mice.
 We have reported that adult-onset loss of hepatocyte GH signaling (aHepGHRkd; GHRfl/fl mice treated with an
adeno-associated viral vector expressing thyroxine binding globulin promoter driven Cre [AAV8-TBGp-Cre]) led
to the rapid development of steatosis, associated with an increase in DNL (Cordoba-Chacon et al., Diabetes
2015). Of translational relevance, hepatic DNL/steatosis after aHepGHRkd is sustained with age and associated
with hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis (hallmarks of NASH; Cordoba-Chacon et al.,
Endocrinology 2018). Studies outlined in my current R01 take a multi-level approach to define the
biochemical/molecular mechanisms by which hepatocyte GH-signaling directly controls glycolysis-driven DNL
and steatosis, by manipulating hepatocyte GH signaling in mice by hepatocyte-specific, AAV-vector delivery of
transgenes within the GH-signaling pathway then assessing; gene and protein expression of enzymes in
glycolytic and lipogenic pathways, fatty acid composition by GC/MS, glycolytic flux and TCA cycle intermediates
under hyperinsulinemic:hyperglycemic clamps, using stable isotope tracers. Studies outlined in my current
BL&RD VA Merit are focused how the reduction in hepatocyte GH signaling contributes to diet-induced NASH
and how reconstitution of the GHR signaling pathway (specifically Stat5b activity and/or IGF1 using AAV vector
delivery) may prevent and/or reverse steatosis and liver injury. To date we have exciting preliminary data
suggesting, hepatocyte GH-signaling works independently of Stat5b/IGF1 to suppress hepatic DNL, while Stat5b
is critical to protect the liver from diet-induced injury. These protective effects may extend to other types of liver
injury including those induced by environmental toxins (focus of CACHET pilot award).
 In addition to assessing the role of GH/IGF1 in protecting the liver from injury, in collaboration with Timothy
Koh, PhD (UIC, wound healing expert) we are exploring the role of IGF1 in regulating diabetic wound healing.
These studies are funded by a RR&D VA Merit and examine the basic mechanisms of wound healing in mouse
models of insulin-resistance (diet-induced) and diabetes (db/db) with or without hepatic IGF1 production. Studies
will also examine if low-intensity vibration patches (developed and optimized by Onur Bilgen PhD, Rutgers) can
speed wound healing via enhanced IGF1 production/actions. Taken together, these basic studies will help to
identify unique targets that can be used to develop treatment strategies, in order to prevent the deleterious
consequences of obesity/diabetes, which are commonly found in the Veteran population."
10725147,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goals of my research programs are to elucidate molecular mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis,
cancer metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity, and to translate our discoveries towards improved
cancer therapy. During this RCS award period I will continue to: (1) Targeting mTOR signaling
pathways in lung cancer subtypes that are refractory to current targeted therapies. We
demonstrated previously that mTOR is a common signaling node downstream of “bypass” kinases,
and targeting mTOR represents a promising approach in multiple settings of drug resistance. Rictor,
a unique components of mTORC2, is commonly amplified in approximately 13% of lung cancer.
While mTOR kinase inhibitors inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, selective inhibition of mTORC2
has the advantage of not perturbing the mTORC1-dependent negative feedback loops and mTORC1-
mediated inhibition of macropinocytosis in mutant Ras tumors. We found that point mutations
disrupting mLST8-mTOR binding specifically destabilize mTORC2 without affecting mTORC1,
pointing to a viable strategy for inhibitor design. We will continue to gain a rigorous understanding of
the contribution of mTORC2 to subtypes of lung cancer that are currently refractory to targeted
therapies, and to further investigate if targeting mLST8 can be used to selectively inhibit mTORC2.
(2) Determine the therapeutic potential of low dose mTORC1 inhibitors in normalizing tumor
blood vessels and recruiting anti-tumor lymphocytes. My lab pioneered studies of mTORC1 and
mTORC2 in tumor blood vessels. We discovered that lymphocyte infiltration increased significantly in
the tumors with endothelial-specific deletion of Raptor (mTORC1 inactivation). Although standard
high doses of Rapalogs can inhibit immune function, we discovered that a low, relatively immune-
sparing dose of everolimus (RAD001), an mTORC1 inhibitor, normalized tumor blood vessels and
enhanced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Promising results of pre-clinical animal studies will set the
stage for initiating a clinical trial to improve immunotherapy. (3) Role of EphA2 RTK in glutamine
metabolism and anti-tumor immunity. Our serendipitous discovery that the ephrin-A1/EphA2
signaling axis regulates lipid accumulation in cancer cells has led us systematically to investigate the
role of ephrin-A1/EphA2 in tumor metabolism. Global metabolic profiling revealed a significant
increase in glutaminolysis, a critical metabolic pathway that generates intermediates for lipogenesis,
in ephrin-A1 knockout or EphA2 overexpressing tumor cells. Investigation of mechanisms led us to
discover that EphA2 RTK promotes glutamine metabolism by upregulation of the glutamine
transporter ASCT2 (encoded by SLC1A5) and glutaminase GLS via activation of the transcription
coactivators YAP and TAZ. Knockout of GLS in tumor cells, however, increases anti-tumor immunity.
We will continue to dissect the effects and mechanisms by which tumor cell-specific loss of GLS on
immune cells. Further, we will test and compare inhibitors of glutamine access (V-9302) or
glutaminase (CB-839) on their effects in inhibiting tumor cells versus anti-tumor lymphocytes.
Significance: Success of these projects will have significant translational potential for the veteran
populations, by identifying new therapeutic targets for lung cancer subtypes that are refractory to
current targeted therapies, and by enhancing immunotherapies via normalization of tumor blood
vessels and inhibition of tumor metabolism."

VAMR award, national peer-reviewed research support since 2005, office (Room 303-4) and
laboratory (Suites 300 and 303) in James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital Research Service space. I have
developed and established a strong program in cellular and molecular mechanisms of metabolic
diseases. My research integrates human studies (translational relevance to human
physiology/pathophysiology), in vitro cell studies (for mechanistic studies of alternative splicing and
role of noncoding RNA; elucidation of cause vs. effect), in vivo rodent studies (for determining whole
body systemic impact of novel inhibitors and stabilizers) and cutting-edge transcriptomics (such as
RNAseq global analysis of coding and noncoding RNA and cellular signaling). I have successfully
carved a niche in integrating RNA biology with signaling in biologically relevant systems and
understanding how it may be a cause or consequence of a disease. Overall, my projects focus on the
role of adipose as an endocrine organ and impact of its secretome on the metabolic processes in the
body. My research was pivotal to demonstrate that the adipose stem cells’ niche is altered in obesity.
61-83% of DoD beneficiaries and 78% of VA beneficiaries are over-weight or obese, a significantly
higher percent compared to general population (VA/DoD Clinical guideline, 2014). With over 9.2
million beneficiaries, the cost of obesity and its related diseases exceeds $1.7 billion annually for the
VA while total US expenditures has risen to $254 billion annually. An important application of my
research is development of exosomes derived from human adipose stem cells as treatment
for traumatic brain injury (TBI) related sequelae. TBI significantly affects the quality of life of veterans
and military readiness of our country. A significantly higher percent (22%) of US soldiers and veterans
who served in Iraq and Afghanistan (OEF/OIF) have brain injuries compared to those from Vietnam
era (12%). The VA projects the 10-year (2016–2025) economic costs of TBI to be $2.2 billion with
$0.5 billion for OEF/OIF veterans (CRS report on TBI, 2015). The exosomes from human adipose-

I am an Infectious Diseases physician-scientist with over 28 years of experience in medical mycology.
During my career, I have been working in the clinic and at the bench, teaching and training many
students, post-docs and junior faculty at Duke University, the Medical University of South Carolina,
and now at Stony Brook University and at the Northport VA Medical Center. My overall career goal is
to bring a new antifungal in the clinic, and I am closer than ever with MicroRid Technologies Inc., a
start-up company I co-founded for the research and development of new antifungal drugs.
My laboratory pioneered the studies on lipid-mediated infectious diseases. My lab and my co-workers
reached such a high visibility in this field that we are continuously contacted for consultant work by
investigators from all over the world for lipid analysis in their favorite organisms. My studies have
mostly focused on fungal infections, particularly invasive fungal infections, because they are on the
rise in our Veterans and in our non-Veterans populations. As we live longer thanks to many benefits of
chemo- and immunosuppressive-therapies and organ transplantations, we are also facing a rise of
invasive fungal infectious diseases. Current antifungals are either fungistatic, toxic, with narrow
spectrum of activity or they become resistant. New treatment strategies are needed. In addition to
develop a new class of antifungal agents, the studies in my laboratory are also crucial to the
understanding of the host mechanisms required for fungal containment versus fungal dissemination
and disease. For these studies, I partnered with many collaborators at the VA medical centers, at
various Universities, and at the industry setting, establishing fruitful and successful collaborations. The
VA RCS award will allow our group to continue this great work and will provide stability to fulfill the
current goals and to start new research directions. The RCS Award will also allow me to broaden my
collaborative research even further, particularly with the VA physicians involved in the MVP,
enhancing my research clinical enterprise, and to continue my service to the scientific community at
the VA and beyond."
10725125,"The overall research program of the applicant seeks to develop new insights and understanding of the key
molecular mechanisms regulating the functions of, and interactions between immune cells, with a particular
emphasis on B and T lymphocytes, and B cell-derived tumors. The ultimate goal is to apply this knowledge to
development of improved measures to both prevent and treat diseases involving lymphocytes, as well as to
inform the clinical selection of the optimal available treatments for a specific Veteran's tumor. The basic
science investigations that began in the applicant's laboratory 30 years ago are now leading to important
collaborations with physician-scientists to translate the findings of these studies into treatments and clinical
trials. The projects to be pursued during the proposed funding period of this SRCS award, and their relevance
to Veteran health, include the following.
1) Define the role of the signaling protein TNF Receptor Associated Protein 3 (TRAF3) as a tumor suppressor
in B cell cancers. B cell lymphoma (BCL) and multiple myeloma (MM), the most common cancers of
lymphocytes in humans, are over-represented in the Veteran population. In both BCL and MM, loss-of-function
TRAF3 mutations are common, and the applicant discovered that post-translational loss of TRAF3 protein can
also occur. The proposed project will continue to define how TRAF3 restrains survival pathways which, when
dysregulated, contribute to BCL/MM pathogenesis, define how TRAF3 regulates BCL metabolism, determine
the mechanisms and biological consequences of post-translational loss of TRAF3 protein in the B cells of aging
humans, and develop new biomarkers for MM-initiating cells. Importantly, all these projects will involve ongoing
collaborations with clinician colleagues. 2) Determine clinically-relevant roles of TRAF3 in other immune cell
types. The applicant's lab will continue studies revealing how TRAF3 enhances and regulates the function of T
lymphocytes, critical to human immune responses to infectious disease and tumors. A new project, in
collaboration with two physician-scientists, investigates the consequences of monoallelic TRAF3 disruption in
humans, leading to chronic susceptibility to infections, and autoimmunity. We strongly suspect that this genetic
defect is in fact much more widespread than previously appreciated. 3) Translate the applicant's knowledge of
CD40 function into clinical application. This involves projects that seek to optimize an antagonistic anti-human
CD40 antibody for use in blocking transplant rejection, a clinical problem of relevance to Veterans, and to
understand the protective role played by CD40 in resistance to Ebola virus infection. 4) Provide key expertise
in B lymphocyte biology to funded collaborative projects in MM and pancreatic cancer. Both these malignancies
occur at higher-than-normal rates in the Veteran population. In addition to these 4 major project areas, which
form the major research Aims, the applicant will continue her strong commitment and activities in mentoring
and teaching the next generation of biomedical researchers, both PhD and MD, and serve the scientific
community in committee participation, review of grants and manuscripts, and leadership roles in scientific
societies."
10722346,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) poses a serious clinical problem due to the increasing incidence and
limited treatment options. One of the strongest known risk factors for EAC is gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD), a chronic digestive condition in which acidic contents from the stomach, frequently mixed with duode-
nal bile, enter the esophagus resulting in esophageal tissue injury. At the cellular level, gastroesophageal re-
flux is characterized by continuous damage to esophageal cell DNA that increases the mutation rate and pro-
motes genomic instability. GERD is common among veterans. However, only a percentage of affected individ-
uals develop neoplasia, underscoring the importance of defining mechanisms that regulate tumorigenic interac-
tions.
 We have developed an innovative hypothesis to explain how continued reflux induces tumorigenic altera-
tions in the esophagus through inhibition of the DNA Damage Response (DDR), a critical tumor suppressor
mechanism that is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the genome. This hypothesis is supported by
strong preliminary data generated by animal and human studies.
 We will expand on these novel findings by detailing the impact of GERD on the DDR. In aim 1, we will define
previously unknown molecular mechanisms through which reflux inhibits the DDR. In aim 2, we will investigate
the DDR regulation in the esophageal niche using animal models of esophageal reflux injury. We will also ana-
lyze human clinical specimens. In aim 3, we will test various options to avert inhibition of the DDR induced by
GERD in vivo.
 Combined, our studies will further elucidate the potential risk factors for tumorigenic alterations in the
esophagus and lay the groundwork for novel therapeutic approaches that halt the development of malignant
esophageal lesions."
10732269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Environmental genotoxic carcinogens target numerous proto-oncogenes (and tumor-suppressor genes) to
induce point mutations in key codons, leading to oncogene activation. Oncogene activation disturbs a wide range
of cellular processes, including alterations in the genomic and molecular landscape of precancerous cells that
contributes to genomic instability, which accelerates chromosomal breakages, rearrangements and promotes
tumorigenesis. Part of this cellular turmoil involves early deregulation of physiologic DNA replication, known as
replication stress. Oncogene-induced replication stress is an early driver of genomic instability and is attributed
to a plethora of factors, most notably aberrant origin firing, replication-transcription collisions, and defective
nucleotide metabolism. Despite much progress in the field, the mechanisms through which oncogenes induce
replication stress, particularly in early events leading to carcinogenesis, remains poorly understood. Major gaps
in our knowledge of this process include: 1) What are the early steps that contributes to oncogene-induced
replication stress in precancerous cells? and 2) How are replication stress response factors coordinated to
overcome/resolve replication stress in a time-dependent manner? Research into these questions have been
hampered by limitations inherent in using traditional cancer cell lines and cell biological approaches that may or
may not accurately reflect the temporal and spatial regulation of the DNA replication stress response in a more
physiologically-relevant in vitro pre-cancer model.
 In this application, we propose to address these knowledge gaps by using cancer-relevant primary human
cells to explore how oncogene-induced replication stress can shape genome-wide replication fork initiation and
termination sites, focusing on how these changes in the replication program will impact genome integrity.
Furthermore, we will determine how recently discovered players in the replication stress response pathway are
regulated to subvert oncogene-induced replication stress. Deciphering the mechanisms that contribute to this
early replication stress response at the genome-wide level may provide new avenues for targeted cancer
treatment. The questions we address here will set the stage for future investigations that include (but are not
limited to) analyses of how environmental genotoxins may influence oncogene-induced replication stress to
exacerbate genomic instability to accelerate tumorigenesis."

Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease, yet the emergence of drug-resistant variants
and comorbidities after long-term ART remain a concern. Therefore, alternative approaches to inhibit infection
and cure AIDS are needed. The proposed “Pittsburgh Center for HIV Protein Interactions” (U54 PCHPI) is well-
positioned to succeed in the search for the much-needed alternative targets for HIV-1 suppression. The U54
PCHPI is a highly integrated, collaborative effort, building on established productive collaborations. The
fundamental research program will focus on structurally characterizing HIV-1 protein and protein-nucleic acid
complexes involved in three aspects of infection: HIV-1 assembly and maturation, ingress and nuclear entry, and
integration. Studies to address these stages of the infection cycle will be carried out in three projects, each
focused on one of these areas, and in four scientific cores (Computational, Cryo-EM/ET, NMR and Virology)
along with Administrative and Developmental cores. Importantly, our program will work to define the structural
basis underlying maturation and allosteric integrase inhibitor activities to promote a mechanistic understanding
and seeks to identify paths of resistance development. Further, we will identify new targets for inhibition of HIV-
1 by defining interaction interfaces within capsid-host protein/nucleic acid complexes involved in trafficking,
nuclear entry, and integration, with a particular focus on native pre-integration complexes (PICs). We will also
develop tools for examining capsid interactions under near-native conditions (in situ NMR spectroscopy and
single-molecule CLEM for HIV-1). In addition, a robust management plan, implemented via an Administrative
Core, will ensure a cohesive effort with frequent and transparent communications, while our mission to facilitate
research career development will be enabled by a collaborative development program, a mentoring program,
and a researcher embedding program, among other initiatives in the Developmental Core. Upon completion of
our aims, we expect to have identified and characterized, at high resolution, several previously
unknown/uncharacterized interaction interfaces in HIV-1 protein complexes, alone and with inhibitors, between
HIV-1 RNA and proteins, and within PIC components, including retroviral intasome interactions with host
chromatin. Detailed knowledge of such interfaces will enable structure-guided improvements in inhibitor design
as well as identify potential new targets for inhibition."
10851980,"Project Summary
 Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and according to some studies,
the most expensive cancer to manage per patient lifetime. But current screening tests have low sensitivity, high
cost, or require invasive procedures, presenting a barrier to the early detection this disease. In prior work, I led
a team showing that next-generation sequencing of bulk urinary DNA can serve as a sensitive and specific
method for the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer. I now seek to build on this work by addressing three
major obstacles to the use of urinary tumor DNA as a biomarker in a screening context: 1) Most patients
referred for bladder cancer screening present with hematuria, or blood in their urine. This results in the dilution
of tumor DNA by leukocyte DNA and decreased sensitivity of sequencing-based assays. 2) Bulk sequencing of
urinary DNA may detect mutations in cell types that do not give rise to bladder tumors (e.g. clonal
hematopoiesis), thereby decreasing assay specificity. 3) The high cost and complexity of next-generation
sequencing methods limits their accessibility. This proposal seeks to overcome all three obstacles, creating a
practical, high performance diagnostic workflow for bladder cancer screening.
 In Aim 1, I will refine a novel method for the enrichment of urothelial cells from voided urine, called Cell
Enrichment by Size and Selective Lysis (CESSL). Using urine samples from patients with known bladder
tumors, I will then investigate the achievable degree of tumor cell enrichment and generalizability of CESSL
using sequencing and microscopy. Depletion of non-urothelial cells from urine will improve the sensitivity and
specificity of downstream assays in the population that presents for screening.
 In Aim 2, I will develop a flow cytometry assay for the detection of bladder tumor cells in urine based on
the presence of aneuploidy and/or global hypomethylation, two DNA aberrations that are present in >90% of
bladder tumors and highly specific for cancer. I will then determine the analytical and clinical performance
characteristics of this assay, as well as the impact of CESSL on its performance.
 This proposal will be carried out at the Johns Hopkins Hospital under the mentorship of Bert Vogelstein,
MD. It will be guided by a scientific advisory board including experts in pathology, urology, medical oncology,
biostatistics, and flow cytometry. Through completion of this proposal, I will develop new skills in cell-based
diagnostic methods, diagnostic study design, and laboratory management. My goal is to become an
independent laboratory-based physician-scientist who develops novel molecular and cell-based diagnostic
tools for solid tumor pathology specimens and evaluates their utility in clinical trials. Successful completion of
this study will produce novel methods that I can refine and apply to other pathology sample types in my future
laboratory, as well as the data necessary to initiate a prospective study of our assay for bladder cancer
screening, forming the basis of an R01 application."
10747978,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT.
Research Project: Spatial memory – memory of where an event happened or an object was located –
depends on the hippocampus in a wide range of vertebrate species, including mammals and birds. In humans,
most spatial memories are formed through visual experience. However, it is unclear how visual information is
processed by hippocampal memory circuits to support spatial memory formation. Two obstacles have hindered
answering this question: 1) the complexity of networks in which the hippocampus is embedded in mammals,
and 2) the need to observe many independent memories being formed and recalled at identifiable moments in
time. This project overcomes these obstacles by leveraging the unique advantages of the black-capped
chickadee Poecile atricapillus, a food-caching bird that depends on an intact hippocampus to retrieve
previously hidden food items. Chickadees rely predominantly on vision for navigation, as in humans. They also
form many independent memories at precisely identifiable times. Finally, the neural pathways carrying visual
input from the retina to the hippocampus in birds are relatively simple. I will exploit these features to dissect the
transformation of lower-order visual inputs into the observed spatial firing patterns and memory functions of the
hippocampus. I will (1) dissociate visual and spatial representations in the chickadee hippocampus using a
novel discrete foraging task, (2) compare the visual and spatial representations in a visual cortex analog that
provides monosynaptic input to the hippocampus, and (3) causally test the role of this visual input pathway for
hippocampal coding and memory. Hippocampal circuits are highly similar in mammals and birds, so the results
promise to reveal fundamental computations that are shared across vertebrates. Further, this project is broadly
relevant for hippocampal disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, which is associated with visuospatial deficits
and altered eye movements. Candidate and Career Goals: I aim to establish an independent lab studying
how visual information is processed by memory circuits. I have a background in engineering and vision-related
systems neuroscience, and have made foundational discoveries in the hippocampus of food-caching birds,
including recently publishing the first neural recordings in these species. This history, combined with the
scientific and professional training planned during the K99 phase of this project, positions me uniquely to
succeed in my goals. Career Development Plan: I will be trained by mentors Dr. Dmitriy Aronov and Dr. Larry
Abbott at Columbia University, and Dr. Elizabeth Buffalo at the University of Washington. Dr. Aronov is an
expert in the experimental techniques I will learn, while Dr. Abbott is a world-renowned theoretical
neuroscientist who will provide training in the analysis and modelling of complex datasets. Dr. Buffalo
pioneered the study of visual representations in the primate hippocampus and will advise on task design and
analysis, while ensuring that the project is broadly relevant to hippocampus researchers across species. All
mentors will provide career development training and advice for my transition to independence."

Our U01 CREATE grant supported development of BIIB105, an ATXN2 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for
treatment that is now in a phase 1 trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We are now proposing to expand
the ATXN2 target space by developing ASOs to STAU1. STAU1 interacts with ATXN2, and is overabundant in
multiple in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegeneration. Our proof-of-concept data showed positive PD
efficacy, in that lowering STAU1 modifies disease-related phenotypes. ATXN2[Q127] SCA2 mice
haploinsufficient for Stau1 had normalized cerebellar gene and autophagy protein abundances, ATXN2 protein
aggregates were eliminated, and motor behavior was improved. In addition, the abnormally slow intrinsic
Purkinje cell (PC) firing frequency in SCA2 mice is restored following Stau1 ASO treatment. STAU1 expands the
ATXN2 target space and may prove more effective as a therapeutic target for ALS and other TDP-43
proteinopathies as its protein abundance is increased 3-4 fold in multiple in vitro and in vivo neurodegenerative
models including sporadic ALS spinal cord. We have already screened for ASOs targeting STAU1, identifying
10 top leads that lower STAU1 expression by 90-99% in SCA2 patient fibroblasts, including two potent ASOs
that also target mouse Stau1 invaluable for in vivo efficacy studies in disease models. Our overall objective is to
optimize ASO sequence and chemistry for lowering STAU1 expression, and to refine an in vivo efficacy models
for characterizing target engagement and PD/PK parameters in vivo. Currently, no therapeutics exist that
significantly modify sporadic ALS. STAU1 is overabundant in multiple neurodegenerative disease models, and
Stau1 knockdown by genetic interaction improves in vivo phenotypes. The R61 phase of our study will span one
year and is organized in two aims: Aim 1 will prepare sequence optimized chemically-modified ASOs for
efficacy testing in BAC-STAU1 mice and Prp-TDP43Q331K mice. Aim 2 refines the use of Prp-TDP43Q331K mice
for characterizing efficacy of STAU1 ASO, resulting in optimal doses required for effective STAU1 knockdown
and phenotype modification. The R33 phase spans the remaining two years of the study and is comprised of
two additional aims: Aim 3 will demonstrate that lead ASOs modify TDP-43 abundance & solubility, normalizes
autophagy markers, histological phenotypes and motor neuron counts and motor behavior of Prp-TDP43Q331K
mice. Aim 4 will determine ASO effects for improving survival for three most efficacious lead ASOs using Prp-
TDP43WTxQ331K double transgenic mice. The terminal milestone for this study will be validation of in vivo efficacy
for three optimized ASOs with long duration of action for Staufen knockdown, and efficacy data for additional
ASO sequences useful or future investigation. The crucial objective is the identification of lead STAU1 ASOs
that modify an ALS neurodegenerative phenotype suitable for advancing to a URGenT or Blueprint
Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) application to the NIH. Ultimately, our study will significantly expand
therapeutic targets for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases."
10725143,"Stroke and related diseases consume 5% of Veteran Health Administration (VHA)
patient care resources, and about 15,000 Veterans annually receive acute inpatient care for
stroke. Genetic association studies based on large samples of carefully phenotyped subjects
are potentially powerful tools for better understanding disease etiology as they can highlight
biological mechanisms underlying disease and point the way to improved prevention and
treatment. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ischemic stroke (IS) populations
in older adults have identified over 30 variants associated with this disorder. As with other
complex traits, the challenge now is to identify the genes that these variants tag and the
pathways through which they alter stroke susceptibility.
 To complement these efforts in older adults our group has pursued the strategy of
studying the genetic underpinnings of early-onset ischemic stroke, a strategy that has been
used successfully for many other complex diseases to identify large effect susceptibility
variants and to generate novel biologic insights into disease etiology. As with other complex
disorders, early-onset stroke has a higher heritability than older-onset disease, and
approaches focusing on age of onset or early-onset disease have uncovered new stroke-
associated variants that were less prominent in older-onset disease. For example, in contrast
to the importance of atherosclerotic mechanisms in older-onset stroke, prothrombotic
mechanisms are likely to be more important and discernable in studies of early-onset stroke.
 The scientific premise underlying our study is that early-onset stroke (in contrast to
later-onset stroke) is enriched for rare variants with high penetrance and large effect sizes and
that occur disproportionately in the exons (coding regions) of genes. To address this
hypothesis, we have assembled a Young Stroke Exome Sequencing Consortium with over
19,000 well-phenotyped early-onset stroke cases (stroke onset 18-59 years) - including
ischemic stroke subtype, and ancestry-matched controls. Our consortium includes populations
of European Caucasian, African, Hispanic and Asian ancestry. Through a separate agreement
(see letter of support), we are currently obtaining whole exome sequencing (WES) in these
cases and their controls. Thus, this application is to provide administrative and analysis
support for the WES analysis.
 To identify variants and genes associated with early-onset IS and IS subtypes, we will
utilize both single variant and burden testing approaches. The analysis plan includes state-of-
the-art analysis methods that our group is experienced in using through our participation in
other sequencing consortia. Exonic variants or genes identified in our young stroke
consortium will be tested for association with stroke-related phenotypes in the UK Biobank,
biomarkers related to stroke in the TOPMed Consortium, and older-onset IS from the UK
Biobank and TOPMed Consortium.
 Genomic medicine is a priority within the VHA with the goal of bringing
precision/personalized medicine to the forefront of VA health care. By identifying new genetic
loci and novel mechanisms associated with stroke, this study will contribute towards that goal."
10722344,"Dry eye (DE) affects 1 in 5 veterans and impacts quality of life. It is a complex disease that manifests with
multiple symptoms (e.g. pain, visual disturbance) and signs (e.g. decreased tear production, increased
evaporation). Key pathophysiological components of DE are ocular surface inflammation and meibomian gland
dysfunction (MGD). Despite its frequency and morbidity, current therapies do not relieve symptoms in all
patients. In order to appropriately manage DE, it is necessary to understand mechanisms and specific
contributors to disease sub-types. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve such knowledge by studying
the role of bioactive sphingolipids (SPL) in MGD and other aspects of DE. Our preliminary and published
work suggest SPL composition changes (higher sphingomyelin (SM)/ ceramide (Cer) ratio) in poor quality
meibomian gland secretion (meibum); a higher ratio of pro-inflammatory (ω-6) /pro-resolving (ω-3) lipids, and
higher levels of prostaglandin E2 in tears from DE patients. Bioactive Cer generated from SM by
sphingomyelinases (SMase) and its derivatives, ceramide 1-phosphate and sphingosine 1-phosphate are
inflammatory lipids and can induce formation of other inflammatory lipids such as prostaglandins. We detected
SMase activity in human tears. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that changes in SPL composition in
meibum contribute to various signs of DE including ocular surface inflammation, tear film disturbances, and
MGD. In Aim 1, we will profile meibum and tear SPL and pro- and anti-inflammatory PUFAs and eicosanoids
by LC-MS/MS from 120 cases (poor meibum quality) and 120 controls (normal meibum quality), chosen from
our prospectively collected samples from a large veteran population after a comprehensive eye evaluation
(mean age 62±10; 467 males, 46 females; 230 white, 272 black). Correlation and regression analysis will be
performed with clinical data as dependent variables and lipid mediators as independent variables. In Aim 2, we
will determine acitivity of SMAse (acidic and neutral) from 240 Schirmer's strips corresponding to the samples
in Aim 1. We will then build models looking at relationships between SMase activity, SPL, and ocular surface
inflammation. In Aim 3, we will identify molecular connections between SPL and inflammation in an in vitro
model by using human immortalized meibomian gland epithelial cell line (HMGEC) to test the effects of
bioactive SPL on mediating inflammation, cell viability, cell death etc. in normal and hyperosmolar conditions.
Impact: Our results will identify SPL differences by MGD status, elucidate relationships between bioactive
SPL, inflammatory lipid mediators, and SMase activity with ocular surface inflammation and clinical features of
MGD and DE sub-types. The knowledge generated will advance the field by determining the relative
contributions of different lipids on different manifestations of DE and provide the foundation for developing new
molecular targets for therapy."
10725163,"This proposal will continue the topic of our current Merit Award and examine a relatively recently described
secretory protein, renalase, which appears to have a potent and novel protective role in acute pancreatitis (AP).
AP has an incidence of up to 5/10,000 in the U.S. population, but is much more common in Veterans. It can
cause death in 30% of those with severe disease, and is the most common reason for hospitalization for
individuals with gastrointestinal disease in the U.S. Since AP is often caused by alcohol abuse, cigarette
smoking, and increases in incidence with age, it is frequently encountered in our Veteran population. During this
funding period we published a manuscript that examined most of our current Merit Aims on renalase in
experimental murine AP and showed that: 1) Plasma renalase levels fell dramatically at the onset of AP and
rebounded much higher than basal levels during recovery, 2) Genetic deletion of renalase was associated with
worse experimental AP, 3) Administering recombinant renalase (rRNLS) reduced experimental AP severity in
vivo even when given after disease onset, 4) rRNLS could act directly on pancreatic acinar cells to reduce injury,
5) The protective effects of renalase on acinar cells is mediated by a specific plasma-membrane calcium export
pump (PMCA4b). Our preliminary studies in clinical AP suggest that plasma renalase levels also falls in human
AP and may reflect disease severity. Here we propose to extend these observations with 3 specific aims that will
examine the following questions: 1) Does renalase also affect recovery from acute pancreatitis? 2) What
mechanisms account for the rapid decrease in plasma renalase and appearance in the kidney in experimental
AP and the subsequent increases in plasma renalase during recovery? 3) Do plasma binding proteins interact
with RNLS and how might it affect its biology? These issues are relevant when considering renalase as a
potential AP therapy because the data could serve as a guide for its future administration by showing benefits
when given well after disease onset to promote recovery. The plasma levels of renalase may be a prognostic
factor for AP severity and could also guide therapies including administering renalase. The following preliminary
data provides a scientific foundation for pursuing these questions and aims. First, we find that severe human AP
is associated with levels of plasma renalase that are persistently lower than baseline, indicating a deficient. We
propose to examine the levels of plasma renalase in other murine AP models, including one that causes severe
disease, to determine whether they conform to the patterns in human. In mice with genetic deletion of renalase,
we find that AP recovery is delayed. The human and AP model findings led us to predict that renalase may be act
to both reduce the acute AP severity and enhance recovery- we will test this experimentally. Second, we
observe that during AP, the levels of renalase in the kidney dramatically increase in the mouse kidney while the
plasma levels reach their nadir; kidney renalase mRNA levels fall during this time, suggesting the absence of
new kidney renalase synthesis. We conclude the acute kidney increase is likely due to sequestration. We also
find that plasma renalase levels rebound well above baseline during experimental AP recovery. We propose to
explore these responses by examining plasma renalase trafficking and turnover. The potential uptake and
secretion by the kidney during AP onset and the source(s) of plasma renalase during AP recovery will also be
examined. Third, we find that a major fraction of plasma renalase is bound to alpha-2-macroglobulin family
proteins in murine plasma and predict that humans will be similar. We propose to explore the trafficking of these
proteins during AP and their interactions with renalase. We believe that these studies in murine models should
provide useful insights for future studies of renalase in clinical pancreatitis including its most appropriate potential
uses as a as a therapeutic agent."
10725137,"Candidate: I am a staff cardiologist at the William S. Middleton Memorial VA and Assistant Professor of Medicine
at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. I obtained my MD from Northwestern
University and completed internal medicine residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital and cardiology fellowship at
the University of Pittsburgh. During my fellowship training I dedicated additional time in the laboratory of Dr.
Ferhaan Ahmad to study mechanisms of genetic cardiomyopathies, which eventually led to the study of
cardioprotective mechanisms in ischemia reperfusion injury due to my clinical interest in interventional
cardiology. I was recruited to the William S. Middleton Memorial VA and University of Wisconsin to provide
increased interventional cardiology coverage to Veteran patients but to also continue my work in cardioprotection
with start-up funds, institutional mentorship and laboratory resources.
Research Project: Activation of mitochondrial K+ flux confers cardioprotection in models of ischemic injury. Of
the potential channels that modulate K+ flux, the putative mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel
(mitoKATP) is most closely related to cardioprotection. However the molecular identity of mitoKATP is unknown and
represents a critical gap in knowledge to discover therapies that target the mitochondrial K+ cycle. Prior studies
and my preliminary data provide evidence for a short 55 kDa splice variant of the sulfonylurea receptor 2A
(SUR2A-55) that targets mitochondria, regulates mitoKATP activity, enables increased glucose metabolism and
protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury when overexpressed. In addition, prior studies and my
preliminary data suggest a role for the renal outer medullary K+ channel (ROMK) in mitochondrial ATP sensitive
K+ transport and cardioprotection. In this proposal we hypothesize that SUR2A-55 combines with ROMK2 to
form a cardiac mitoKATP channel that blocks ischemic injury by activating the mitochondrial K+ cycle
and enhancing glucose metabolism. By targeting both mitochondria and myocardial substrate utilization,
SUR2A-55 represents a novel target in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. We propose to investigate this
hypothesis with three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine if SUR2A-55 associates with ROMK in cardiac
mitochondria to form a mitochondrial K+ channel. Immuno-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectroscopy
will be used to examine potential associations between SUR2A-55 and ROMK2. Specific Aim 2: Determine if
the loss of function of cardiac ROMK prevents activation of mitoKATP and cardioprotection. We will test whether
pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockdown of ROMK prevents activation of mitoKATP and protection from
ischemic preconditioning. Specific Aim 3: Examine how TGSUR2A-55 mice utilize metabolic substrates and
whether a preference for glucose utilization over fatty acids during ischemia contributes to cardioprotection.
Glucose and fatty acid metabolism from isolated hanging hearts during rest and after ischemia will be assessed
in TGSUR2A-55 and WT mice.
Career Plan: My long-term career goal is to become an independently funded VA physician-scientist who is a
leader in the field of treating ischemic heart disease by targeting cardiac mitochondria and metabolism. My
primary VA research mentor, Dr. Nihal Ahmad, will guide my progress and training. My additional mentors and
collaborators will provide training to accomplish my research aims and career goals. The results from this VA
CDA will provide me with the preliminary data and research experience to formulate a competitive MERIT Review
proposal to further develop novel therapeutic targets for ischemic heart disease.
Environment: I will complete the proposed research at the VA and the University of Wisconsin. Both
organizations provide an exceptionally collegial atmosphere and strong institutional support that include
laboratory resources, equipment, and core facilities."

 This competitive renewal application of my SRCS program is focused on three major health problems in
the VA patient population, TBI, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. One of our major areas of focus is on the long-
term negative impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on bone. TBI, a signature injury of combat operations, results
in a myriad of clinical complications that have devastating effects on our battlefield warriors and represents one
of CRADO’s five cross-cutting clinical priorities. In our studies, we have established that repetitive mild TBI
exerts a significant negative impact on the skeletal system over the long term by influencing peak bone mass
and by promoting ectopic bone formation in soft tissues after injury. Our current studies are focused on
elucidating the key cellular elements and the relevant systemic and local signaling pathways that impact the
development of ectopic bone in response to TBI and local trauma with a goal of developing novel therapeutic
strategies for prevention and treatment of heterotopic ossification in TBI patients.
 The population of elderly veterans continues to increase, and, therefore, issues affecting the aged have
become a VA research priority. Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis (OA) are significant age-related public health
problems in the Veterans as well as in the general U.S. population and pose a substantial financial burden. It is
estimated that approximately one in two women and one in four men age 50 and older will break a bone due to
osteoporosis. OA is known to affect over 30 million adults in the U.S. The pathogenesis of osteoporosis and OA
are known to involve increased destruction of bone and cartilage, not compensated by parallel increases in the
synthesis of new tissue. Therefore, the long-term goals of my VA- and NIH-sponsored research is focused on
identifying the defective signaling pathways that contribute to bone and cartilage loss in the elderly, and to
develop novel anabolic strategies for treatment of these debilitating bone diseases.
 Our laboratory has been very productive over the years with 370 peer review research articles, 30 review
articles and 28 book chapters. Our publications have received more than 45,000 citations with an H-factor of 89
and an i-10-index of 839. Our research has led to several important discoveries in the areas of bone and mineral
metabolism and has received continuous funding from federal agencies (VA, NIH, DOD) over a span of 30 years.
I was the recipient of the 2017 ASBMR Louis Avioli Founder’s award given in recognition of life-long contributions
in translational research related to bone and mineral metabolism. Besides establishing strong active
collaborations both locally and nationally, our program continues to successfully mentor a new generation of
researchers and contributes to VA research administration at both a local and national level. Our ongoing
studies are designed to not only provide mechanistic insights into the role of the key signaling pathways in the
pathophysiology of the various bone-wasting diseases but also to identify novel and rational drug targets for the
development of novel effective therapies to treat metabolic bone diseases that impact the health of veterans."
10725145,"Salmonella infections are responsible for an estimated 3 million annual deaths worldwide. Multidrug
resistance among clinical Salmonella more than doubled from 2011 to 2013. The World Health
Organization has ranked Salmonella as one of the top 12 antibiotic resistant bacterial threats to global
health. The goal of this Research Career Scientist Award is to continue with our efforts to apply our
knowledge of Salmonella virulence to the development of novel antibiotics against multidrug resistant
bacterial pathogens.
Resistance of Salmonella and other pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is in great part regulated by the
nucleotide alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate and the DksA protein. Both of these mediators bind to
the secondary channel of RNA polymerase, regulating transcription of central metabolic pathways and
a variety of virulence programs. We will carry on our research on the molecular mechanisms by which
guanosine tetraphosphate and DksA regulate Salmonella transcriptional programs. The Research
Career Scientist Award will also allow us to develop novel antibiotics that inhibit DksA-dependent
bacterial transcription. Binding of DksA to the secondary channel of RNA polymerase is in competition
with Gre transcription elongation factors. We have found that Gre proteins are needed for Salmonella
virulence and the resistance of this Gram-negative rod to antibiotics. We plan to characterize the
molecular mechanisms by which Gre factors promote bacterial pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance.
These research projects are highly collaborative in nature, involving scientific interactions with
investigators at the Veterans Affairs Eastern Colorado Healthcare System, the Atlanta VA Medical
Center and the Veterans Administration Ann Arbor Healthcare System. I plan to continue fostering
these productive collaborations. Training of junior faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
are also important components of this Research Career Scientist Award. Moreover, in collaboration
with other investigators at the at the Veterans Affairs Eastern Colorado Healthcare System and
Wisconsin-Madison VA Medical Center, we will continue mentoring promising CDA- 2 candidates, and
thus help train the next generation of outstanding VA scientists."
10725127,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in adults under the age of 45, affecting
∼20% of veterans from recent wars. Once thought to be a monophasic injury, TBI is now known to trigger an
indolent neurodegenerative process that substantially increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and other forms of
dementia for older veterans. All disability resulting from TBI stems from its disruption of functional neural
networks. The mechanisms by which TBI interrupts these networks and sets up further neurodegenerative
network breakdown are inadequately defined, though injury loci beyond those observed in white matter are
increasingly recognized. Synaptic injury has been identified following TBI in humans and in animal models,
resulting in pathological molecular, structural, and functional changes to synapses, or their frank loss. Synapse
loss is also a common, early finding in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) where it is the strongest pathological correlate
of AD-induced dementia—even stronger than amyloid plaques or tau tangles. Neuroinflammatory pathways
are activated in a prolonged fashion after TBI in animal models and in humans, and play a central role in
mediating synapse loss in AD. A better understanding of synaptic injury in TBI, and its neuroinflammatory
mediators, therefore, could supply a missing and potentially interruptible structural-mechanistic connection
between these conditions. Synapses, however, are very challenging to study due to their extremely small size
and admixture within the extraordinarily complex subcellular milieu of mammalian neuropil. We developed an
innovative, widely accessible super-resolution imaging and image analysis platform called SEQUIN (Synaptic
Evaluation and QUantification by Imaging of Nanostructure) to enable routine monitoring of synaptic health in
animal models and in humans. Our preliminary data demonstrate that synapse loss is a prominent feature of
diffuse, closed head TBI in a militarily-relevant mouse model, and indicate that inhibition of the complement
pathway (part of the innate immune system) prevents traumatic synapse loss and improves function after TBI.
These findings suggest that neuroinflammatory synaptic injury leads to acute neurological disability following
diffuse TBI and sensitizes the brain to subsequent neurodegenerative changes, hastening the onset of
dementia. We propose to first (Aim 1) characterize regional synapse loss resulting from diffuse TBI and
determine its neuropsychological and behavioral correlates at a scale impossible to achieve pre-SEQUIN. We
will then (Aim 2) determine the role of the complement pathway in mediating traumatic synapse loss, and
determine whether genetic and/or pharmacological targeting of this pathway can rescue synaptic endpoints
and improve functional outcomes. Lastly, we will (Aim 3) determine whether and how TBI potentiates synapse
loss later in life in response to the amyloid- and tau-related neurodegeneration that typifies AD. These studies
are expected to reveal novel, druggable mechanisms of circuit injury after TBI that are connected to cognitive
and emotional disability in returning active military, guard, and reserve personnel. They will furthermore
establish innovative tools (SEQUIN) for the understanding of conditions with unique significance for veterans,
and identify an intervenable mechanistic link between AD and its best-established epigenetic risk factor, brain
trauma."

10735875,"ABSTRACT. Bipolar Disorder (BD), defined by a history of hypo/mania, is common and debilitating. Yet, the
neural mechanisms predisposing to hypo/mania, to guide new interventions for BD, are poorly understood. BD
is characterized by abnormally elevated reward sensitivity, impulsivity and sensation seeking, response
tendencies that predispose to hypo/mania in potentially rewarding contexts, e.g., uncertain reward expectancy
(RE). In adults with BD, we reported abnormally elevated uncertain RE-related left ventrolateral prefrontal cortical
(vlPFC) activity. Moreover, we showed a positive relationship between RE-related left vlPFC activity and an
impulsivity component, negative urgency; and that negative urgency mediates a positive association between
RE-related left vlPFC activity and the severity of lifetime predisposition to hypo/mania in young adults who have
not yet developed BD. Abnormally elevated left vlPFC activity to RE is thus a potential neural mechanism
underlying heightened negative urgency, which confers risk for development of/ worsening hypo/mania. Theta-
burst stimulation (TBS) is a Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) paradigm that can acutely,
rapidly, and non-invasively modulate the left vlPFC. Examining if continuous (inhibitory) TBS (cTBS) over left
vlPFC leads to acute changes in hypo/mania-related affect is thus a first step toward elucidating the neural
mechanisms that predispose to hypo/mania. We will recruit 50 remitted/mild-moderate hypomanic adults with
BD type I (in whom we reported the majority of RE-related neuroimaging data): 18-35 yrs (unmedicated/ on
common BD medications), to avoid confounds of long psychiatric illness/ long medication history; and 50 age-
and gender ratio-matched healthy/ non BD (history of anxiety/ non BD mood disorders) adults. We will examine
activity in and functional connectivity (FC) among left vlPFC and reward regions: ventral striatum (VS), amygdala,
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (d/rACC). Each participant will have
baseline assessments of negative urgency (and other BD-related response tendencies) and a baseline structural
scan for neurotargeting and TBS dose thresholding. One week later, there will be 3 scan sessions over <2 weeks:
each with 1 of 3 TBS conditions interleaved between pre and post cTBS scans, in randomized order: left vlPFC
cTBS; left control region, somatosensory cortex, cTBS; and left vlPFC sham TBS. Positive and negative affect
will be measured before each pre cTBS and after each post cTBS scan. We aim to: 1. Determine the impact of
acute cTBS over left vlPFC (vs. other cTBS conditions) on RE-related activity in and FC among left vlPFC, VS,
amygdala, d/rACC, OFC; 2. Determine if cTBS-induced neural changes lead to acute changes in hypo/mania-
related affect, and if negative urgency moderates these relationships; 3. Compare effects of cTBS over left vlPFC
(vs. other conditions) on neural-affect measures in BD vs. healthy/ non BD adults. We will explore whether other
BD-related response tendencies moderate cTBS-induced neural-affect changes. We will examine the acute
impact of cTBS on reward circuitry and affect, to elucidate neural mechanisms that predispose to hypo/mania."
10737645,"Recent advances in human genetics have defined hundreds of causal variants for Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). However,
substantial effort is required to define downstream disease processes and thus to guide
development of interventions for each one. One such new ASD gene is MYT1L – while mutations
in MYT1L have recently become associated with ASD and Intellectual Disability (IDD) in humans,
the role of MYT1L in neural cells and circuits is unclear. Thus, here, we propose a comprehensive
mechanistic investigation of MYT1L. This project uses both cutting-edge established workflows
as well as innovative new approaches to enable in-depth study of MYT1L loss at the molecular,
cellular, structural, and behavioral circuit levels. We will utilize two complementary experimental
systems, mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, to
define MYT1L's normal roles, and to identify the consequences and reversibility of MYT1L loss.
We focus initially on a mutation identified in a patient with a MYT1L putative loss-of-function
variant who has ASD and ID. In addition to knock-in of this variant into isogenic control PSC lines,
we derived iPSC models from this subject, with and without MYT1L variant correction, enabling
us to define consistent consequences of MYT1L mutation across human genetic backgrounds.
We also developed mouse models targeting the paralogous amino acid, to enable studies of the
consequence of MYT1L loss on brain structure, physiology, and behavioral circuit function.
Further, cutting-edge gene therapy-like tools developed for both mouse and human models will
allow us to investigate the effects of rescuing gene function. Similar landmark experiments
profoundly changed the understanding of other neurodevelopmental disorders by demonstrating
that a substantial proportion of the phenotype was reversible, thus spurring the development of
therapeutics based on rescuing gene expression. Together, the experiments performed here will
elucidate the requirements for and mechanisms by which MYT1L controls brain development and
function, will determine how these are disrupted by pathogenic MYT1L mutation, and could also
chart a course towards MYT1L-targeted therapies."
10800650,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
 The SLC6A1 gene has been recently implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including
epilepsy, autism, and intellectual and motor disability, collectively named SLC6A1 syndrome. SLC6A1 encodes
the GABA transporter GAT1, but the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which SLC6A1 mutations cause SLC6A1
syndrome remain unknown, thus hampering the development of effective treatments. To fill this gap, I propose
to dissect the mechanisms that cause epilepsy in a new mouse model carrying a human SLC6A1 mutation.
 My preliminary data show that Slc6a1 S295L/+ mutation leads to state-dependent seizures in
thalamocortical circuits, disrupting sleep. Motivated by these findings, I will test the central hypothesis that
thalamic circuits are key regulators of epileptic seizures associated with SLC6A1 syndrome. To test this
hypothesis, I will determine the impact of S295L mutation on synaptic and intrinsic properties of thalamocortical
neurons and thalamic circuit excitability in brain slices, and on thalamocortical function in vivo. I will also
investigate whether thalamic targeting with optogenetic tools can treat epileptic seizures.
 The proposed work will harness in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological and optogenetic circuit dissection
techniques. These results will elucidate our basic understanding of GAT1 dysfunction and assess how the
subsequent increased tonic GABA current might impact the thalamocortical circuit in SLC6A1 syndrome.
Ultimately, this work will help identify potential therapeutic targets to treat SLC6A1-related epilepsy."
10725155,"The goal of this proposal is to validate the feasibility of the swine model to test our novel therapy for the
prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). POAF is the most common complication from cardiac
surgery affecting 30%-50% of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgeries. POAF
leads to increased heart failure and hospital stays, costing an excess of US$2 billion per annum. POAF is an
independent predictor of the development of AF long term. POAF is a highly prevalent issue in the veteran
population. We recently reported a 40% incidence of POAF at our institution, with a 30% 5-year risk of
recurrence of AF compared to 3% without POAF. Overactivity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system
(CANS), is an important substrate for both POAF and AF. We hypothesize that neuromodulation of CANS can
suppress POAF. We recently published in a canine model of POAF, that microinjection of nanoformulated
CaCl2 into cardiac ganglionated plexi (GP), a critical component of the CANS, during open heart surgery,
suppresses/prevents POAF. The mechanism of action is by inducing neuronal apoptosis in GP thus protecting
the heart from sympathetic surge and inducing reverse remodeling of the heart, with potentially long term
suppression of AF.7 The goals of this proposal are to (a) validate our successful canine model of POAF in
Yucatan miniature swine species (b) test the safety and efficacy of nCaCl2 for neuromodulation and
suppression POAF vulnerability in swine. Validating the swine model facilitates clinical translation of our novel
therapy with the significance of targeted, effective and safe therapy for POAF and potentially long term
suppression of AF vulnerability in a high-risk population."
10725118,"The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
with an impact orders of magnitude larger than all other AD-linked genes combined. In the past, mainstream
research of APOE in AD has focused on structural and functional differences among apoE protein isoforms.
Yet, despite the broad and valuable hypotheses that work has generated, the exact mechanism by which
APOE contributes to AD remains elusive, thus hindering development of precise APOE-based therapeutic
strategies. In order to develop more effective approaches to treat and ultimately prevent AD, it will require
outside the box thinking and research efforts aimed at identifying the underlying mechanisms of APOE’s role in
AD. Several lines of emerging evidence suggest the presence of other AD-risk loci in close proximity to APOE.
For example, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently identified APOE and its
adjacent regions to be strongly associated with AD. In our preliminary study, we analyzed the genetic
association of an extended APOE region using Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) GWAS
data. We observed that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) all carry strong AD association
signals independent of the APOE ε4 allele. This region consists of 11 critical SNPs that span four genes (i.e.,
PVRL2, TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1), most of which have AD-specific mRNA expression in postmortem
brain. From this evidence and observations, we hypothesize that multiple genes and loci in the extended
APOE region contribute to AD risk, and genetic variants of these loci compose distinct haplotypes that
differentially regulate local gene expression to modify the AD risk. This concept forms the foundation of the
current proposed study. We have designed a research plan, and our short-term goals are to identify APOE-ε4
independent genetic loci associated with AD, and to precisely define how genetic variability in this extended
APOE region contributes to AD risk. We will first construct molecular haplotypes across this region and
determine their genetic association with AD risk. We will then investigate how these haplotype variants
correlate to gene expression and explore any underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to use
this knowledge to develop more precise APOE locus-based prediction, prevention, and/or therapeutic
strategies for AD."
10904761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-immune cells greatly outnumber professional immune cells in the body, providing intracellular pathogens
with many opportunities to shelter and take refuge. How does the immune system protect this huge landscape?
My previous work described the ability of the immune cytokine interferon-g (IFN-g), classically considered a
macrophage activating protein, to broadly activate non-immune cells and confer the ability to mount sterilizing
cell-intrinsic responses through effectors encoded by Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs), collectively termed
the ‘interferome’. However, our understanding of how ISGs execute tissue localized responses is in its infancy,
with remarkably few of these effectors being well characterized and virtually nothing known about how multiple
ISGs functionally interact to achieve host defense. The principal barrier to understanding ISGs is that they rarely
work in isolation; rather they are part of complex genetic networks that are buffered from the phenotypic effects
of perturbation. I propose a radical new strategy that exploits this genetic complexity by mapping functional
relationships between ISGs using combinatorial forward genetic screens. My central hypothesis is that
systematically mapping genetic interactions will uncover the effectors of localized IFN-g signalling and enable
hierarchical organization of ISG products into functional complexes and pathways (network) that execute specific
protective and pathological responses. On a small scale with a single query gene in my postdoctoral work, this
approach unveiled a pair of synergistic ISGs that execute unexpectedly potent bactericidal defense of the
cytosol. Further development of this technology for use at a larger scale in my own lab will provide the framework
to fully deconvolve the interferome into distinct host resistance pathways. I will develop an experimental pipeline
that enlists a pooled CRISPR-based screening system for multi-locus gene perturbation paired with a novel
single cell imaging and expression analysis platform. Focusing on the human airway epithelium, this innovative
approach will be applied to dissect the ISG-encoded effectors that mediate cell-intrinsic control of three diverse
pulmonary pathogens (C. pneumoniae, B. pertussis, and RSV), and those that mediate lung tissue damage
downstream of cytokine storm. Newly identified ISGs and their connections will be validated for their protective
or pathological activities using tissue explant systems from donated human lungs and models of human lung
organoids. The ensuing genetic interaction network will provide unprecedented insight into the effectors that
dictate infection outcome in the human lung during type 1 immune responses. These findings will reveal new
local therapeutic targets and establish a paradigm for appreciating the full spectrum of immunity. The
approaches pioneered here will also extend to the downstream effectors of other non-immune cells and tissues
whose integrated study will define a new biological landscape of critical importance to human health."

11161091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intracranial recordings in patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions provide a unique opportunity to directly
access, study, and learn about both normal human brain function and neuropsychiatric disease. Because of their
value, the NIH has made significant investments in this line of research through the BRAIN Initiative and has
likewise required public archiving of data through the Data Archive for the BRAIN Initiative (DABI). With the
accumulation of data from over 500 subjects, DABI presents a unique opportunity to conduct large scale studies
using data from multiple sites and investigations. Moreover, with the inclusion of both neurophysiological and
imaging data (including anatomic and connectivity-based imaging), DABI has the potential to address important
questions about functional-anatomic relationships in human neurophysiology and sources of variability across
age, disease, and anatomy. There is a strong emerging yet underexplored literature that neural oscillation
patterns relate to brain morphometry, yet the tools to explore this with greater spatial precision and spectral
sensitivity are currently unavailable. While the multimodal nature of DABI data has the potential to significantly
impact such questions, the data is not currently in a form that makes it easily accessible or analyzable. The
BRAIN integrated Resource for human Anatomy and Intracranial Neurophysiology, B(RAIN)2, has an overall aim
of creating a spatially integrated and standardized dataset that will enable such large scale studies. In Aim 1,
we will (1) identify and curate data for inclusion in B(RAIN)2 based on required data elements (as well as solicit
additional archiving from BRAIN funded investigators), (2) perform standardized neurophysiological signal
processing and anatomic localization, (3) perform standard anatomic image processing, based on the Human
Connectome Project framework and established quality control measures, and (4) transform all data into a
standard space for large scale analyses. To ensure high impact and continued growth of B(RAIN)2, in Aim 2, we
will share, document, and define pipelines for continued data integration, including webinars and training
modules and providing support to potential users. Finally, in Aim 3, we will conduct a demonstration project to
highlight the power of B(RAIN)2, investigating the relationships between motor cortical beta power and peak
frequency as a function of cortical thickness, connectivity, and disease. The proposed work will enable
investigators to harness the power of intracranial physiology and neuroimaging collected across BRAIN-funded
sites to increase the power and impact of these valuable and relatively rare signals. Future investigators will use
the B(RAIN)2 standardized metrics across anatomy and physiology in both native and standard space to perform
novel analyses and gain unique insights into anatomic contributions to variability in human neural oscillator

10889122,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death and often goes undiagnosed until it has already
advanced and metastasized. Aberrant changes in O-glycans, such as increased expression of truncated
carbohydrate antigens (Tn, sialylated Tn/STn), are commonly observed in PC. However, the mechanistic
involvement of these truncated O-glycan structures in PC progression and metastasis is under-explored. Hence,
our study is focused on investigating the mechanistic role of truncated O-glycans during early metastatic
dissemination in PC. The O-glycosyltransferase Core 1 β1,3-Galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) catalyzes the
second step of mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis by adding galactose to the first sugar N-acetylgalactosamine
(Tn) that forms the Core 1 carbohydrate structure. Such structures are usually elongated to mature O-glycans
found on normal tissue, but their extension may be truncated at the Tn-glycan stage during cancer due to inactive
C1GALT1 activity. Our preliminary data demonstrated the loss of O-glycosyltransferase activity, C1GALT1, in a
subset of (poorly differentiated) human PC tissue. Further, CRISPR/Cas9-based C1GALT1 knockout (KO) in PC
cells resulted in aberrant O-glycosylation (increased Tn and STn glycans). Along with glycan alterations presented
upon oncogenic glycoproteins (mucin glycoproteins and cancer stem cell markers), our studies also indicate
increased tumorigenicity and metastasis of C1GALT1 KO PC cells. We have also observed O-glycan truncation
present on CD44, a cancer stem cell marker, in C1GALT1 models. Interestingly, knockout of C1galt1 along with
KrasG12D and Trp53R172H/+ mutations in mouse models resulted in early-onset (in 3 weeks) and early distant
metastasis (in 10 weeks) of PC. Based on these observations, our major goal is to investigate the mechanistic
role of truncated O-glycans in PC progression and metastasis. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that ""Truncated O-glycans on cancer-associated glycoproteins (mucins and stemness markers) induce the early

 The suicide rate is about two times higher for Black children ages 5-12 than White children of the same age
group. Identifying factors that disproportionately impact young Black children and contribute to their high rates
of suicide and suicidality (i.e., ideation, planning, attempt) represents a critical gap in the field. Racial
disparities in school discipline practices that are due to racial biases (i.e., racialized discipline) have been seen
throughout the literature. Black children in elementary school are two to three times more likely to be
suspended or receive an office discipline referral compared to White children for the same behaviors. Despite
robust evidence demonstrating the negative psychological impact of Black children’s experiences of
discrimination, the association between racialized discipline and young Black children’s suicidal ideation and
behavior has not been established. This proposal seeks to test 1) whether higher rates of racialized discipline
predict Black children’s suicidality, 2) whether the proposed association between racialized discipline and
Black children’s suicidality is moderated by child emotion regulation and neurocognitive functioning, and 3)
whether racial socialization—a cultural parenting strategy—protects against childhood suicidality. These aims
will be addressed via a two wave prospective study of 200 Black children ages 8-10, their primary caregivers,
and their teachers, recruited through a University Hospital program providing school-based mental health
treatment to schools in a major metropolitan area. Racialized discipline will be assessed via a novel teacher
daily diary approach and triangulated with standard measures, including disparities in office discipline referrals
and children’s perceived teacher and school discipline inequity. Children’s suicidal thoughts and behaviors will
be assessed via a gold standard semi-structured interview. Children will also complete computerized
neurocognitive functioning tasks and an observed emotion regulation task. Parents will report their preparation
for bias and cultural socialization messages. Data will be analyzed using multilevel structural equation
modeling. This study has the potential to inform school-based policy to address racial bias in schools and
culturally relevant, targeted intervention programs for Black families with the goal of decreasing suicidal
thoughts and behavior in Black children."
10699586,"The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the potential of and develop HBI-201, a novel oral formulation of nitrous oxide (N2O), that enables the home use of N2O to treat pain associated with Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOCs) in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The analgesic properties of N2O are well known, and N2O is an FDA- designated medical gas that is used for its analgesic, among other, properties. Importantly, current analgesic uses of N2O using inhaled gas include pain from SCD VOC in the emergency department (ED) in France, as well as in obstetric labor, acutely painful procedures such as fracture reduction, and in the management of the pain of ureteric colic. As a widely used, approved drug in the US, EU, and other geographies, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inhaled N2O (iN2O) has been demonstrated. However, barriers to home dosing of iN2O have prevented the development of an N2O therapeutic for home treatment of SCD VOC pain. Inhaled N2O gas is the approved modality for N2O. However, inhaled N2O is not a viable therapeutic option for home use due to poor dosing control, potential inhalation equipment issues and variability in patient ventilation and pulmonary absorption, the risk of inadvertent exposure due to leaking or incorrectly operated compressed gas cylinders, and patient resistance to gas therapies due to issues with mask and cannula use. HBI-201, a novel oral N2O drug product, enables home use of N2O in SCD and is being developed for the treatment of pain associated with VOCs in SCD. The administration of a defined dose of N2O delivered by oral administration of HBI-201 enables the further development of N2O as a therapeutic for home use while obviating the problems associated with iN2O. In this multi-PI application, we combine the expertise of the Simone and Belcher laboratories with Hillhurst’s experienced team and innovative technology and propose to build on compelling data to develop HBI-201 as a treatment for SCD VOC pain."

In this competitive renewal of my Senior Research Career Scientist (SRCS) award I will continue my research,
service, and teaching/mentoring efforts that have been the areas of concentration during past funding periods.
My research program focuses on antibiotic resistance as it is now recognized that the ability of bacterial
pathogens to evade the action of antibiotics is now one of the most important threats to worldwide public health.
My research program since entering the VA Medical Research service in 1987 has been to understand the
molecular basis by which bacteria develop resistance to antimicrobials with the ultimate goal of advancing basic
science knowledge to improving human health. As a model system, the laboratory has largely used the human
sexually transmitted pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae since this pathogen has historically developed resistance
to every antibiotic that has been brought into clinical practice and has a remarkable ability to avoid the action of
multiple host defense systems. Our research focus is of importance to both the veteran/active military and
civilian populations in the United States given that over 550,000 cases of gonorrhea are reported yearly with
over 50% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates resistant to one or more antibiotics. Moreover, the worldwide estimate of
cases approaches 100 million with reported instances of strains resistant to front-line antibiotics (azithromycin
and/or ceftriaxone). A major accomplishment of my laboratory has been the finding that mechanisms of
antibiotic resistance including multidrug efflux pumps, drug permeability changes due to alterations in
outer membrane structure and inner membrane homeostasis can be linked to the ability of gonococci to
evade mediators of host defense and survive during experimental infections. Thus, we advanced the
concept that antibiotic resistance and bacterial pathogenesis are not necessarily separate entities and should
be studied together. Importantly, our basic research efforts have now reached a point where translational-driven
efforts can facilitate vaccine development and new antibiotic discovery. In addition to these research efforts, I
have participated in and provided leadership for multiple local, national and international endeavors to combat
antibiotic resistance. These efforts include extensive peer-review service for journals and study sections,
membership on national and international advisory boards for agencies advancing new antibiotic development,
teaching/mentoring programs through directing an NIH-funded T32 program for pre-doctoral students,
developing and directing graduate level courses, and mentoring junior faculty at the Atlanta VA and Emory
University School of Medicine. These extensive efforts coupled with my ongoing productive research program
will be the focus of my SRCS-supported work during the next funding period."
10725124,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating dementia without a disease-modifying therapy. According to
FDA, AD clinical trials are over 200 but so far have made zero success in slowing AD progression. This continuous
failure speaks for the difficulty of this task and calls for re-evaluating the existing therapeutic strategies.
 As a neurodegenerative disorder, neuronal death is fundamental to AD pathogenesis. Current therapeutic
strategies concentrate on combating neurotoxic insults implicated in AD (i.e., Aβ, phospho-tau, free radicals,
inflammatory toxins, etc.). Less attention has been paid to strengthening neuronal defense given that neuronal
death is an imbalance between its defense and insult. Studies in our lab revealed that defense mechanism of
central cholinergic system in AD is compromised in subjects with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase-5
(GRK5) deficiency; the latter appears during aging and worsens in AD. The compromised neuronal defense leads
to susceptibility to degeneration triggered by excessive Aβ or hypoxia whereas an active anthranilamide
derivative CN168 was able to prevent the neurodegeneration and the cognitive impairments in GRK5-deficient
Swedish APP transgenic (GAP) mice. Therefore, emerging evidence supports the idea that strengthening
neuronal defense raises neuronal death threshold thus increasing the difficulty for various neurotoxic insults to
trigger neuronal death. This new therapeutic strategy focuses on the defense rather than individual insult but
works against multiple insults simultaneously. Such a therapeutic effort will not replace, but rather complement,
the existing therapeutic effort, therefore bringing new hope for discovering disease-modifying therapy for AD.
 While CN168 was proven to be effective at the level of proof-of-concept (PoC) in preventing cognitive
decline in GAP mice, we also noticed that CN168 has two violations of the five drug-likeness rules (MW>500;
LogP>5), with a short duration of central action. This requires further optimization of the pharmacokinetic (PK)
properties of CN168 prior to future clinical studies. Because CN168 has proven in vivo efficacy and previously
demonstrated superb selectivity and sensitivity towards muscarinic receptor-2, we propose to use CN168 as the
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and to improve its brain to plasma (B2P) ratio using prodrug approach.
In this project, we will characterize three carefully selected prodrugs of CN168 by comparing their PK properties,
and study their pharmacodynamics (PD) and toxicology before preparing the investigational new drug (IND)
application for the finally selected prodrug(s). We will achieve our goals with the following three Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. Pharmacokinetics of the API (CN168) and its prodrugs: in this aim we will (1) synthesize
CN168 and its prodrugs in quantities sufficient for their PK profiling in vivo; and then (2) carry out their PK
characterization and select the prodrug(s) outperforming CN168 with improved B2P ratios.
 Aim 2: Pharmacodynamics and toxicology of the selected CN168 prodrugs: in this aim, we
will perform (1) PD studies for target engagement verification, effective dose range finding, and evaluation of
potential side effects in GRK5-deifienct mice along with wild type mice; and (2) Drug toxicity studies, including
in vitro and in vivo acute toxicity, and repeated dosing toxicity and long-term (9 months) toxicity.
 Aim 3: Drug cGMP manufacturing and IND application: In this aim, we will (1) manufacture the
final prodrugs domestically in the US at a cGMP facility; and (2) prepare for the IND application to FDA.
 AD is the most persistent and devastating dementia worldwide. Yet the clinical trials aimed at finding a
disease-modifying therapy for AD have failed one after another. Through decades of research on GRK5 deficiency
in AD we came up a new therapeutic strategy that is distinct from, but may complement with, the existing
therapeutic efforts that focus on individual insult. We have obtained PoC evidence with the API CN168. Further
improvement of its PK properties will ensure its success at preclinical stage and ease its way towards a successful
translation to future clinical trial. We believe this is a chance to develop a disease-modifying therapy for AD."
10725162,"The long-term goal of our work is to understand how the human innate immune system responds to
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection and to find novel methods to control the infection. Cigarette smoking is a
significant public health problem, particularly among veterans. Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) significantly
increases the risk for respiratory viral infections. Influenza infection is seven times more common and is much
more severe in smokers than nonsmokers. The goal of our proposed studies is to determine the severity and
mechanisms of CS-mediated innate immune suppression. Induction of interferon (IFN) is a critical component
of the host response to influenza infection. IFNs are further divided into type I (mainly IFN-α and β), II (IFN-γ)
and III (IFN-λ) subtypes, based in part on the differential use of unique receptors through which they mediate
signal transduction to induce antiviral activity. Retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) plays an important role in
the recognition of, and IFN induction by, IAV. Our previous studies have shown that CS and cigarette smoke
extract (CSE) suppress antiviral innate immune responses in IAV-infected human and mouse lung, especially
immunosuppression due to RIG-I inhibition. This immunosuppressive effect of CS may play a critical role in the
enhanced susceptibility of smokers to serious influenza infection. We have also shown that reversing the RIG-I
defect prevents CS induced immunosuppression, restores all three types of IFN responses, and reduces
mortality. We have also discovered a new mechanism whereby IAV and CS decreases barrier function and
increases lung injury during infection through induction of cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1
(CYP1B1). We have new preliminary data that demonstrates this effect, and that RIG-I activation appears to
suppress CYP1B1 induction, and that partial loss of CYP1B1 decreases lung injury during infection. These
novel findings support the idea that understanding the mechanisms of CS-induced immunosuppression may
have significant therapeutic potential.
 Our overall hypothesis is that CS increases lung injury by suppressing RIG-I and upregulating CYP1B1.
We further hypothesize that RIG-I overexpression or chemical RIG-I activation using SLR10 suppresses
CYP1B1, decreases lung injury and mortality during IAV infection. We will use an in vitro human model and an
in vivo mouse model to test these concepts to evaluate the role of CYP1B1-mediated lung injury and RIG-I-
mediated immune restoration in smokers during IAV infection.
We will test these hypotheses using the following integrated Specific Aims:
 AIM 1: Determine whether chemical activation of RIG-I alleviates CS-induced mortality and
immunosuppression during IAV infection.
 AIM 2: Determine whether CYP1B1 induction by CS enhances lung injury and mortality during IAV
infection.
 This proposal is conceptually innovative, as it addresses unanswered questions regarding whether specific
stimulation of RIG-I has potential benefits in human and mouse CS models during IAV infection, and whether
CS and IAV increase lung injury through induction of CYP1B1. We have extensive evidence that combustible
cigarette smoking impairs antiviral responses and increases lung injury in human and mouse models. The
experimental team combines experience in immunology, animal models, genetic manipulation of cell models,
and bioinformatics. Our team is uniquely positioned to combine our basic and clinical research expertise and
experience to determine basic mechanisms and clinical consequences of CS-mediated immunosuppression
and enhanced lung injury to identify targets for new therapeutics."
10796995,"Project Summary/Abstract
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for PD
patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. While STN DBS is an effective treatment for motor symptoms,
it can produce unintended side effects cognition including executive function, language and attention deficits
which affect quality of life and independence. Developing an individualized STN DBS approach which optimizes
patient selection prior to surgery and enhances specificity when targeting neural networks is significant because
it has the potential to reduce DBS induced cognitive decline. The research proposed in this K99/R00 Pathway
to Independence Award will lay the groundwork needed to establish this approach by determining 1) how limited
cognitive reserve prior to surgery and 2) how direct DBS interference with cognitive networks contribute to
cognitive decline. Cholinergic and dopaminergic network hubs (i.e., the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert; NBM, and
striatum) support cognition, however, these regions degenerate in PD and may be indirectly modulated by STN
stimulation. Thus, the central objective of this proposal is to determine how vulnerability (K99) and the direct
modulation (R00) of the NBM, and striatal networks contribute to cognitive decline in individuals with STN DBS.
NBM/striatal vulnerability will be measured using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) which reflects microstructural
changes associated with the progressive degeneration of neuronal tissue. Network interference will be measured
by assessing the change in NBM/striatal connectivity using combined DBS-fMRI which allows functional MRI
data to be collected while simultaneously cycling stimulation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
pre-surgical microstructural integrity (K99) and DBS induced interference (R00) of the NBM, and striatal networks
will be associated with greater cognitive decline. Preliminarily data demonstrates that reduced mean kurtosis of
diffusion within the NBM and striatum are associated with reduced executive function and language deficits in
those with PD. In the 2-year mentored K99 phase of this proposal, I will establish the relationship between
NBM/striatal microstructure and cognition (Aim 1) and cognitive decline 1-year following STN-DBS surgery (Aim
2). To accomplish these aims I will collect DKI and longitudinal neurocognitive data from 50 participants with PD
planning to undergo clinical STN-DBS treatment. Additionally, I will receive training in DBS as a research tool,
neurocognitive testing, combined DBS-fMRI and DKI analysis/interpretation. This will be facilitated by my
mentoring team which includes DKI co-developer Dr. Jens Jensen (Primary Mentor) and DBS neurologist Dr.
Gonzalo Revuelta (Co-mentor). After securing a tenure track faculty position, I will transition into the R00 phase
of the award to investigate the relationship between STN-DBS modulation of the NBM/striatal networks and
cognitive decline (Aim 3). This independent R00 phase will build upon my technical training and mentoring skills
established during the K99 phase. Ultimately, this award will generate the pilot data necessary to apply for a R01
and establish a research program in individualized neuromodulation therapies for movement disorders."
10732260,"Project Summary
 The project addresses a common challenge in the remediation of groundwater contaminated with
chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) and 1,4-dioxane. CVOCs include chlorinated solvents, such
as trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), and their degradation products. Many CVOCs
and 1,4-dioxane are known or potential human carcinogens and on the Substance Priority List (SPL) for
Superfund sites. CVOCs bioremediation under anaerobic conditions (i.e. reductive dechlorination) is well
established. However, bioremediation of mixtures of CVOCs and 1,4-dioxane is not yet feasible due to at least
the following three obstacles: 1) low biodegradability of 1,4-dioxane at environmentally relevant concentrations,
2) requirement for aerobic conditions for 1,4-dioxane metabolism but anaerobic conditions for most CVOCs
metabolism, and 3) inhibition of 1,4-dioxane biodegradation by CVOCs. This project proposes the following
combined remediation approach to address these challenges: first, an innovative macrocyclic material approach
to selectively adsorb CVOCs and promote the growth of dechlorinating biofilm on the material surface to
anaerobically biodegrade CVOCs. After the CVOCs treatment, another type of innovative macrocyclic material
as an effective and selective sorbent for 1,4-dioxane sustains biofilms consisting of a highly efficient culture to
aerobically metabolize 1,4-dioxane. The macrocyclic molecules, which comprise repeating cyclic oligomers with
unique geometry and internal chemistry, form specific host-guest complexes with only selected guest molecules
(i.e., 1,4-dioxane or CVOCs). A highly efficient 1,4-dioxane-metabolizing culture (previously established) is much
more effective at low, environmentally relevant concentrations compared to all others reported in literature. To
understand the mechanisms of how the novel sorbents enhance bioremediation and to demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed remediation approach, the researchers will conduct the following work: 1)
Computational study, synthesis, and characterization of novel macrocyclic materials. Two sorbents, one that
selectively and reversibly adsorbs CVOCs and another that selectively adsorbs 1,4-dioxane will be optimized for
use in the bioremediation studies. 2) Mechanistic study of the highly efficient 1,4-dioxane-metabolizing culture.
Key microorganisms responsible for the high affinity to 1,4-dioxane in the mixed culture will be isolated and
investigated for their degradation intermediates, pathways, and kinetics. 3) Elucidation of interactions among
contaminants, microbial cultures, and the novel sorbents. To achieve this, completely mixed flow experiments
will be performed, and they will be coupled with mathematical modeling that incorporates phenomena of both
sorption and biodegradation in biofilms. 4) Proof-of-concept column studies for bioremediation of CVOCs and
1,4-dioxane mixtures. Two long-term column studies will be performed: ex situ treatment of 1,4-dioxane and in
situ bioremediation of CVOCs and 1,4-dioxane mixture in series. Performance objectives will be Maximum
Contaminant Levels for CVOCs and the Health Advisory Level for 1,4-dioxane (0.35 µg/L)."

Shenqqing (Stan) Gu, Ph.D., is an experimental-computational biologist whose career goal is to develop
personalized strategies for optimal combination immunotherapy to cure cancer. Titled “Enhancing the efficacy
of immunotherapy by optimal use of SMAC mimetics”, the proposed research seeks to elucidate the context
dependencies of SMAC mimetics’ effects and examine its optimal combination with existing immune
checkpoint blockade therapy.
Career development plan: Dr. Gu is a recipient of Sara Elizabeth O’Brien Trust Fellowship. His previous work
has focused on the regulation of cancer-immune interaction, using various approaches including clonal tracing,
data mining, and genome-wide CRISPR screening, which have prepared him to conduct the proposed
research. Dr. Gu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) T cell biology, 2)
machine learning, 3) single-cell technologies, 4) leadership and professional skills. This skill set is necessary to
succeed in my independent research career.
Collaborators/Environment: Dr. Gu’s collaboration team assembles world-leading experts in cancer
immunology, computational biology, translational and clinical research, melanoma, and single-cell technology.
Leveraging the extensive collaboration resources at DFCI, Harvard, and NCI, and access to a large amount of
clinical samples, Dr. Gu is uniquely placed to identify the optimal usage of SMAC mimetics to enhance the
efficacy of immunotherapy of cancer.
Research: Our previous research identified that SMAC mimetics can upregulate MHC-I in some cancer cells
and potentiate immunotherapy, but it is unclear which subset of cancer patients can benefit from SMAC
mimetic treatment. To facilitate effective use of SMAC mimetics in the clinic, this proposal will interrogate
SMAC mimetics regarding the optimal contexts of gene regulation and rational combination with immune
checkpoint blockade. Aim 1 will integrate genetic/epigenetic feature selection and functional validation to
identify the context dependencies of SMAC mimetics’ effects on cancer cells. Aim 2 will integrate multi-omic
profiling at single-cell level to examine the effects of SMAC mimetic treatment on immune cells. Aim 3 will
evaluate the efficacy of different scheduling of combination of SMAC mimetics and ICB using in vitro co-culture
and in vivo transplantation models.
Outcomes/Impact: This project will reveal the genetic/epigenetic context dependencies of SMAC mimetics’
effects, elucidate their effects on immune cells, and examine the optimal combination with immunotherapy.
Data from this study can help improve the design of clinical trials testing SMAC mimetics in cancer patients.
The development career transition award will enable Dr. Gu to become a leader in the new field of developing
personalized combination immunotherapy strategies."
11140667,"Project Summary
The objective of this proposal is to delineate the role of the transcriptional repressor ZEB2 during human neural
crest cell formation, craniofacial differentiation, and Mowat-Wilson Syndrome. The neural crest is a multipotent
embryonic cell population unique to vertebrates which migrates extensively and differentiates into a variety of
derivatives, including most of the craniofacial bone, cartilage, and dental organ tissues. Numerous human
pathologies are associated with abnormal neural crest cell development, including the recently delineated
neurocristopathy Mowat-Wilson Syndrome (MWS). MWS is a rare syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous
mutations in ZEB2 leading to a distinct facial phenotype, dental abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other
anomalies including Hirschprung disease which are indicative of neural crest cell defects at multiple axial levels.
However, significant genotypic and phenotypic variability has been observed among MWS patients, and the
underlying mechanisms that contribute to this disease are not well understood. Furthermore, while ZEB2 has
been implicated as a major developmental regulator of the nervous system as well as in neural crest cell
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migration, recent evidence in our human neural crest cell model
indicates a crucial role for ZEB2 in the early formation of the neural plate border and neural crest. ZEB2 is known
to negatively regulate TGFb superfamily signaling, whose modulation is essential for proper neural crest
formation and differentiation. Therefore, it is hypothesized that ZEB2 functions reiteratively to establish the
repressive epigenetic landscape throughout neural crest cell formation and craniofacial development by
modulating proper TGFb superfamily signaling, and that the failure of this regulation underscores the MWS
pathology. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will examine the modular functionality
of ZEB2 in regulating the proper levels of TGFb signaling throughout wild-type human cranial neural crest cell
formation. In particular, the cis-regulatory interactions between ZEB2 and TGFb receptor activated Smad
proteins and the functional requirement of co-repressors leading to changes in chromatin accessibility will be
delineated. In Aim 2, the MWS pathology will be addressed through the establishment of induced pluripotent
stem cells from MWS patients of diverse genotypes. Using these tools, the precise transcriptomic and epigenetic
misregulation during MWS-based neural crest cell formation will be interrogated, providing much needed
molecular insight into this understudied pathology. In Aim 3 of this proposal, the role of ZEB2 in wild-type and
MWS human tooth formation will be interrogated through the establishment of a human neural crest cell-based
tooth organoid model. These results will reveal for the first time the molecular role of this transcriptional repressor
throughout multiple stages of human neural crest cell formation, differentiation, and pathology."
10810660,"We have established that allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell infusions have an anti-leukemic effect and induce
remission in 25-40% of patients with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Limitations include
effector cell persistence, activation, and specificity. Here, we will test novel approaches that address these
limitations. Our overarching hypothesis is that NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells given in a setting of “missing self”
will overcome suppressive mechanisms and mediate potent anti-AML activity and that targeting these cells with
immune engagers containing IL-15 will enhance their specificity to kill AML. Our group and others have explored
a population of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced adaptive NK cells expressing NKG2C and defined by a unique
methylation signature that is associated with superior inflammatory cytokine responses and antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). These cells are also more resistant to regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells. We completed a 1st generation trial to enrich for adaptive NK cells, but the frequency of NKG2C+
NK cells in the final product averaged <10%. We have now developed a 2nd generation process for expanding
NKG2C+ NK cells to generate a >80% NKG2C+ cells using HLA-E+ K562 feeders. In the current funding, we also
conducted first-in-human testing of IL-15 treatments. We developed our own IL-15-containing Tri-specific Killer
Engager (161533 TriKE) comprised of three functional domains: 1) an NK cell-engaging single chain variable
fragment (scFv) against CD16, 2) an AML-engaging scFv against CD33, and 3) an IL-15 linker between them.
We predict that the 161533 TriKE will target and activate endogenous NK cells to treat AML/MDS without
bystander T cell activation. We produced the 161533 TriKE under GMP conditions, cleared an IND, and started
clinical testing. However, NK cells are diminished in many cancers, and we believe that TriKE therapy might
ultimately prove most effective when combined with adoptive transfer of adaptive NK cells or other NK cell
products. Using adaptive NK cells as a model, we developed an off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC)-derived NK cell product that expresses NKG2C/DAP12. When combined with an NKG2C TriKE, these
cells become antigen specific. We have developed themes in Project 1 that will inform the Program on whether
CMV-induced adaptive NK cells are optimal for cancer therapy, engage unique metabolic programs, can be
targeted with TriKEs, are more active in the setting of missing self, and can be mimicked in an off-the-shelf
strategy. Our Specific Aims are to 1) test a 2nd generation NKG2C+ adaptive cell product clinically in advanced
AML/MDS; 2) test a CD33-targeted, IL-15-containing TriKE in a phase I trial in patients with AML/MDS; and 3)
pre-clinically test the combination of the two in xenogeneic models and test whether our iPSC-derived NK cell
expressing NKG2C can be targeted with an NKG2C-specific TriKE. Results from these studies will inform Project
2 and 3 on the importance of NKG2C itself, optimization of targeting components within the TriKEs, and the
importance of missing self for clinical efficacy."
10810674,"Limiting relapse is the biggest challenge following autologous transplantation for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Antigen-directed CAR T cell products and other targeted therapies may be changing the field, yet for high-risk
lymphomas, new and safer approaches are needed. We will study the safety and efficacy of antigen-directed,
off-the-shelf, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cells engineered for dual-antigen targeting. We
have optimized the differentiation of iPSC-derived CD34+ cells to highly potent NK cells, scaled production at the
University of Minnesota, and can now produce hundreds of doses in a manufacturing run with a clonal iPSC
transduced with a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (called hnCD16). In late 2019, we initiated clinical trials
testing this engineered iPSC product (designated FT516). The overarching hypothesis for this project is that
dual targeting of NK cells with a CAR and through hnCD16 will protect against relapse after auto-transplant for
lymphoma and that future gene edits to alter metabolism will enhance adoptive transfer. This hypothesis fits with
the themes of this Program, and Project 2 will inform the Program on the development of off-the-shelf NK cells,
NK CAR, and the role of membrane IL-15, as well as pre-clinically on whether manipulating metabolism will
enhance NK cell therapy. These investigations are supported by the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test dual
targeting of NK cells to CD19 and CD20 using two mechanisms of action, ADCC and an NK CAR, to prevent
relapse after autologous transplantation for lymphoma. We will test a triple gene-modified iPSC-derived NK cell
product (FT596) transduced with hnCD16, an NK cell-optimized CD19 CAR, and membrane bound 15/IL-15Ra
fusions. FT596 will be combined with rituximab as maintenance therapy to limit relapse after autologous HCT.
This trial is FDA-approved and will first establish an MTD at day +30 after engraftment and then, if single dosing
is safe, move to day +7 before engraftment with the goal of 3 doses in the first hundred days to prevent relapse.
Aim 2 will test enhancement of NK cell metabolic fitness by ARID5B overexpression and CD38 knockout. Our
preliminary data shows both adaptive NK cells and CD38 knockout iPSC-derived NK cells resist oxidative stress-
induced cell death. ARID5B overexpression, naturally increased in adaptive NK cells, mediates similar effects.
We will generate new iPSC lines to build on FT596 with transgenic expression of ARID5B or a CRISPR knockout
of CD38. These clones will be evaluated to probe the mechanisms on how they drive NK cell metabolism and
augment function. Aim 3 will test whether manipulating ARID5B and CD38 will drive metabolic fitness and
enhance FT596 persistence and function in vivo. These pre-clinical trials will inform future clinical trial
modifications—all to promote enhanced anti-lymphoma activity by extending transferred NK cell persistence and
potency. These metabolic and potency findings will directly inform Project 1 to improve cell targeting and
metabolism, Project 3 for cell persistence, and all 3 Projects to define the advantages of autonomous
presentation of IL-15."

Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prevalent among Veterans, puts Veterans at increased
risk for obesity and related conditions. Veterans with PTSD lose less weight in VA’s MOVE! weight
management program, due to PTSD symptoms that interfere with activity and healthy diet. In addition, many
Veterans who receive evidence-based PTSD treatment remain symptomatic. A behavioral weight loss program
that augments standard PTSD care and targets PTSD-related weight loss barriers called MOVE!+UP was
piloted and iteratively refined among 44 overweight Veterans with PTSD. The fully developed MOVE!+UP is
led by a psychologist and a Veteran peer support counselor, who provide complementary expertise. It includes
16 in-person group sessions with 90 minutes of general weight loss support, coupled with Cognitive Behavior
Therapy skills to address PTSD-specific barriers. Each session also includes a 30-minute community walk to
address hypervigilance-based activity barriers and enhance classroom-based learning. Veterans receive two
individual dietician visits, and counseling calls as needed. The cohort receiving the final MOVE!+UP package
reported high satisfaction and had better weight loss outcomes than Veterans with PTSD in the general MOVE!
program. They also reported substantial PTSD symptom reduction. Treatment targets like eating behaviors,
activity, and insomnia also improved. MOVE!+UP effectiveness must be tested in a randomized trial.
Significance/Impact: MOVE!+UP is timely and efficient, simultaneously addressing physical and mental
health of a priority Veteran group. MOVE!+UP is positioned to address HSR&D priorities by promoting mental
health and improving PTSD symptoms, access to care, and whole health. This study is aligned with HSR&D
and ORD methodological priorities by using a hybrid type 1 trial. This study’s cost and utilization analyses, and
systematic identification of implementation barriers and facilitators, would place effectiveness findings in
context and facilitate rapid translation to the field if MOVE!+UP is effective. This study will also provide insights
about ways that general MOVE! and PTSD care can be enhanced to improve reach and effectiveness.
Innovation: MOVE!+UP is the first weight loss program designed to address obesity in Veterans with PTSD.
Specific Aims: This study proposes to randomize overweight/obese Veterans with PTSD enrolled in PTSD
care to usual care enhanced with enrollment in MOVE! (control) or usual care enhanced with MOVE!+UP
(intervention), and is guided by three aims: 1) Test whether intervention participants have greater 6-month
weight loss (primary outcome), and 6-month PTSD symptom reduction and 12-month weight loss (secondary
exploratory outcomes), relative to controls; 2) Assess whether compared to control, intervention participants
have greater improvements on 6-month treatment targets: physical activity, eating behavior, insomnia,
depression, and social support; 3) Estimate intervention and control condition costs and utilization, and identify
MOVE!+UP implementation barriers and facilitators, to contextualize Aim 1 and inform future implementation.
Methodology: Hybrid type 1 trial with 164 overweight/obese Veterans with PTSD enrolled in PTSD care.
Implementation/Next Steps: This hybrid type 1 trial will provide data needed to prepare a MOVE!+UP
implementation package for broader VA implementation if MOVE!+UP is effective. If it is not effective, Aims 2
and 3 will help understand how overweight Veterans with PTSD could be better supported in the future.
Implementation activities would be coordinated with existing local, VISN, and national operational partners."

acoustic learning is critical for survival. And, yet, the formation of these representations during
real-time learning remains largely unknown. In this proposal, we posit that learning can be
dissociated into two distinct learning processes: the initial acquisition and subsequent
expression of knowledge. Acquisition involves learning the core discrimination learning that
underlie a behavior, and expression entails the use of this acquired discrimination in context.
Acquisition and expression have typically been conflated in most laboratory tasks, leaving an
important gap in our understanding of learning mechanisms in the central auditory system.
Moreover, dissociating between acquisition and expression has important implications for
development and language disorders. For example, soothing music can elicit neurotypical
behavior in autism patients with otherwise severe symptoms. We aim to identify the separable
neural mechanisms that enable sensorimotor acquisition versus contextual expression.
Recently, we have shown that we can precisely dissociate acquisition from expression in a
sensorimotor reward learning task. Thus, we now have a powerful behavioral approach to
isolate acquisition from expression during learning. In this proposal, we will define the precise
neural circuitry in the auditory cortex that enables these two aspects of learning. The auditory
cortex is known to be a major site of plasticity; associative learning between sounds and
rewards induce shifts in the “tuning” of cortical neurons. The cholinergic basal forebrain,
moreover, has been implicated as a potent driver of receptive field plasticity in the central
auditory system. These plasticity mechanisms likely reflect fundamental neural changes that are
linked to acquisition of task knowledge. A1 is also heavily modulated by brain state and context,
suggesting that A1 may also play a role in expression of task knowledge. Here, we propose to
combine simultaneous real-time two-photon imaging of neurons in the auditory cortex (Aim 1)
and cholinergic axons (Aim 2-3). We will perform causal manipulations of AC (Aim 1),
cholinergic activity (Aims 2-3), in vivo whole-cell voltage clamp recordings (Aim 2), and detailed
behavioral analysis (Aims 1-3) to determine the neural basis of audiomotor learning."

 The Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LA CaTS) Center is a consortium of the major academic
and biomedical research centers in the State of Louisiana. Pennington Biomedical Research Center is the lead
institution and will continue to partner with Louisiana State University Health (LSUH)-New Orleans and Tulane
University Health Sciences Center in this initiative. LSUH-Shreveport, LSU-A&M (Baton Rouge), Xavier
University and Children's Hospital New Orleans, were early Research Partners in cycle 1. Southeast Louisiana
Veterans Healthcare System, a newly opened University Medical Center in New Orleans ($1 billion State
investment), Ochsner Health and the LSUH-NO School of Dentistry joined during cycle 2. The LA CaTS Center
is growing a unified clinical translational science program for Louisiana based on the creation of synergistic
programs and unparalleled collaboration from all the major academic and biomedical research institutions in the
state. Since inception 9 years ago, the LA CaTS Center has: 1) successfully leveraged resources and expertise
of multiple participating institutions to build a vibrant statewide research infrastructure; 2) developed highly
synergistic and integrative collaborative programs; 3) implemented a systematic approach to clinical research
across all institutions, that includes a new SMART IRB Reliance Model review; and 4) implemented a highly
effective governance system based on an unprecedented level of trust between partners. LA CaTS is
experiencing exponential growth in research productivity as assessed by key metrics including a three-fold
increase in external grant awards, a more than two-fold increase in publications with authors acknowledging LA
CaTS Center resources and services and over 600 researchers benefiting from and using our services. Notably,
during a period that has been marked by unique and unprecedented challenges from COVID and then Hurricane
Ida, LA CaTS has achieved, and in many cases exceeded, its stated objectives and projected milestones.
Indeed, since the COVID pandemic hit Louisiana in March of 2020, LA CaTS has led multiple successful grant
applications for Administrative Supplements and NOSI awards, notably to facilitate COVID testing and
vaccinations in underserved Black communities through the RADx-UP program and most recently our
partnership with the IDeA state ISCORE consortium on the national Long-COVID initiative - Post-Acute Sequelae
of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC)/RECOVER trial. However, we fully recognize that our work has only just
begun, as we collectively address disparities and improve the lives of our citizens. It is also apparent, that slowly,
but surely, we are impacting public health one project at a time! With new services proposed and the additional
resources that will be added, our Center is uniquely positioned to devote our activities and resources to our major
theme for the next 5-year cycle that will “address health disparities and improve the health outcomes of the
citizens we serve”."
10738255,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Since 1980, the global prevalence of overweight and obesity increased by 27.5% in adults and by 47.1% in
children. Although rates appear to have tapered off over recent years in many developed countries, steady
increases continue to be reported in developing countries, most particularly in Africa. Between 1990 and 2010,
the number of overweight and obese children doubled in Africa and in 2017, the highest prevalence of
overweight and obesity among young children was found in the Southern Africa U.N region. In South Africa’s
Vhembe district, the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity increased by a factor of 2.7 between 2008
and 2015, reaching 40%. Concomitantly, earlier onset of puberty has been observed globally and it has been
suggested that increasing trends in obesity prevalence may play a role. Although changes in diet and physical
activity likely influence these trends, growing evidence suggests that exposure to chemicals that disrupt
endocrine function may be a factor.
 A total of 88 countries practice Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), the use insecticides on the interior walls of
residences to control malaria, resulting in high exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as
dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids. DDT, a known environmental estrogen, increases
body fat and advances puberty in female rodents while DDT’s breakdown product dichlorodiphenyl
dichloroethylene (DDE), an antiandrogen, delays puberty in males. Few human studies have investigated
associations between DDT exposure and body composition or pubertal onset but studies of DDE found
relations with delayed puberty in boys and our preliminary studies suggest that DDE is obesogenic in South
African girls. Animal studies show that pyrethroids, which are androgenic, delay puberty onset in females and
accelerate puberty in males but this question has only been studied by one group in China.
 To our knowledge, no study has investigated the impact of exposure to DDT or pyrethroids on body
composition, pubertal onset or endocrine function in peripubertal African children. We propose to address
these important knowledge gaps by extending a unique birth cohort study of rural South African children with
extensive data on health, exposure and confounders, rich research infrastructure and strong community
networks. We aim to identify the levels and determinants of exposure to DDT/E and pyrethroids among
children aged 7 to 10 and determine whether pre- and postnatal exposure to these insecticides is associated
with: 1) altered body composition, 2) puberty timing and tempo, and 3) hormone levels.
 This study will provide policy-makers with data to better understand the determinants of the dramatic rise in
obesity and the acceleration of puberty in South Africa and other developing countries. It will also provide
essential information on the potential unintended consequences of IRS to malaria-endemic countries and
international bodies so that they can determine the safest and most sustainable methods to control malaria."

In this new and unfunded study, we will capitalize on the lessons from the past 15 years of psychiatric
genomic. Based on these lessons, we propose an exceptionally novel and important set of aims to further
knowledge of the genetic architecture of mental illness. We propose to perform whole-exome sequencing and
SNP-array genotyping on >150,000 cases with severe psychiatric disorders along with a similar number of
controls. It will be large, transdiagnostic, based on patients seen in clinical psychiatry, and comprehensively
analyze ultra-rare exonic, rare copy number, and common variation. Because assay costs are prohibitive (on
the order of $US 80 million), we are partnering with Regeneron Genomics Center (RGC) that will conduct all
genomic assays. NIMH funding is within the $500K direct cost cap at each site.
We will: (1) Acquire samples with clinically severe psychiatric disorders. Cases will have lifetime diagnoses of
schizophrenia (SCZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), bipolar I disorder (BD1), or severe major depressive
disorder (sevMDD). Roles: UNC is responsible for data coordination; the sampling sites are ISMMS (the
Americas and East Asia) and Cardiff (Europe, Africa, and South Asia) and each will collate samples (i.e.,
MTAs, ethical approvals, individual consent, harmonize phenotypes, QC DNA). Phase 1 (Years 1-2) will focus
on existing samples (N=100K cases). Phase 2 (Years 1-4) will focus on obtaining new samples (N=50K
cases), and will enable colleagues from low-income countries to obtain genetic data that would otherwise be
impossible. This will help those investigators and greatly increase diversity in genomics research. 2) Genomic
assays (Years 1-4). Samples will be sent to RGC in batches from ISMMS and Cardiff. RGC will generate whole
exome sequencing and SNP array data. UNC and RGC will jointly conduct alignment, QC, variant calling
(SNVs, indels, SVs), and array processing (common SNPs, imputation and CNVs). QC includes assessment of
multiple biases and comparison to independent datasets. Deliverable: analysis-ready data frames for rare
exonic, rare CNV, and common genetic variation. 3) Analysis for substantive scientific aims. Briefly, the main
analytical themes are to identify genetic variation associated with: (a) severe mental illness, (b) specific
disorders, and (c) cross-cutting clinical features (e.g., psychosis, treatment resistance, mania, ID). All analyses
will be conducted using robust methods/bias control, formally compared to relevant prior studies, and evaluate
the impact of all types of measured genetic variation across diverse genetic ancestries. 4) Data sharing will
align with NIMH policies via the NIMH Data Archive.
Successful completion of the proposed work will markedly increase the number of genes pinpointed by
burdens of rare coding variation, rare CNVs, as well as less specific GWAS associations–we will markedly
increase knowledge of the genetic architectures of these critically important and burdensome disorders."

SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause severe morbidity and mortality in the ongoing pandemic. Future RNA virus
epidemics and pandemics are inevitable. New clinical-trial-ready antivirals are urgently needed RNA viruses of
pandemic potential. COVID-19 has further underscored the need for early, global access to clinic-ready
compounds. Beyond coronaviruses; flaviviruses and picornaviruses also cause frequent and ongoing epidemics
worldwide and have no effective therapeutics. Maintaining a portfolio of novel, clinic-ready therapeutics are
critical for our future pandemic preparedness.
The AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) AViDD Center will develop novel chemical assets
that have antiviral activity against three target viral families. ASAP will leverage state-of-the-art structure-enabled
technologies capable of leveraging recent advances in AI/ML and computational chemistry in identifying,
enabling, and prosecuting discovery campaigns against novel viral targets. ASAP is built on principles of open
science and rapid dissemination (enabled by a dedicated Data Infrastructure Core).
ASAP builds on the successful COVID Moonshot, an open science collaboration that recently secured $11 million
from the Wellcome Trust via the WHO Access to COVID Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) to fund preclinical
development of a novel oral noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral acting against the main protease (MPro).
Beginning with a high-throughput X-ray fragment screen, the discovery team spent just 18 months and $1M to
reach the preclinical phase. ASAP will mirror this rapid, cost-efficient approach: automated structural biology at
Diamond Light Source (Frank von Delft); AI/ML synthesis models from PostEra (Alpha Lee); nanoscale
chemistry and covalent fragment libraries from Nir London; massively distributed free energy calculations on
Folding@home (John Chodera); an industrial medicinal chemistry team led by MedChemica (Ed Griffen);
and antiviral assays and virology expertise at Mount Sinai (Kris White; Adolfo García-Sastre). ASAP
augments this seasoned antiviral discovery team with new approaches to resistance-robust targeting (Karla
Kirkegaard and Matt Bogyo, Stanford) and deep mutational scanning (Jesse Bloom, Fred Hutch). ASAP is
supported by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) (PI Ben Perry), and Letters of Support from
Takeda, Pfizer, Novartis, and Grupo Insud.
ASAP Impact: ASAP will become the nexus of a robust global antiviral discovery community. Our open science
approach focuses on ensuring global, equitable access to therapeutics to combat future pandemics. We aim
to produce a robust antiviral pipeline consisting of 3 new Phase I ready candidates, 6 lead optimization
campaigns, 9 fragment-to-lead campaigns, and 10 structure-enabled resistance-robust viral targets. Our
associated data packages will accelerate follow-on development and investment."
10725152,"Accumulation of toxic proteins (i.e. Aβ42 & tau) and dysfunctional mitochondria are associated with synaptic and neuronal loss in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Such clearance defects are thought to arise in large part from deficits in the autophagy-lysosome system. While mounting experimental evidence supports the notion that AD is a tauopathy at least in part driven Aβ, there is still a considerable knowledge gap in the way Aβ and tau pathogenesis are mechanistically connected. Our recently published and preliminary studies indicate that the Slingshot homolog-1 (SSH1) pathway constitutes a critical link between Aβ and tau pathogenesis. SSH1 is a protein phosphatase, classically known for its cofilin dephosphorylating activity. SSH1 is activated by oxidative stress (i.e. H2O2, Aβ, etc.) and/or intracellular Ca2+ elevation, which results in activation / dephosphorylation of cofilin. Activated cofilin can then sever F-actin (at the synapse) and/or translocate to mitochondria to promote mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Likewise, we have found that activation of SSH1 and cofilin are required for Aβ42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic loss, as wells as deficits in LTP and/or learning/memory in cellular and mouse models of A pathogenesis (APP/PS1). In support of these experimental findings, activated cofilin and SSH1/cofilin complexes are increased in APP/PS1 mouse brains as wells as in mitochondria of AD brains. In preliminary studies, we found that in addition to cofilin, SSH1 contains a modular and independent activity on the autophagy cargo receptor p62, which functions to regulate autophagy and tau clearance. By utilizing molecular, biochemical, cell biological, viral, and histochemical tools, we propose to (1) dissect the modular activity of SSH1 in p62-mediated autophagy and mitophagy; and (2) determine the role of SSH1 in p62-mediated autophagy and tauopathy in vivo."
11062877,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors (TFs) in the extended MYC network play essential
roles regulating cellular growth, differentiation, and homeostasis. Seminal studies have implicated MYC
and its interacting network of TFs as drivers of proliferation and metabolism in development and cancer, but
how dosage of these factors encodes transcriptional state remains contentious. Here, I propose a novel
chemical genomic framework to systematically determine how TF dosage, transcriptional output, and
cellular state are linked. I will combine our recently published massively multiplex single-cell RNA-seq
screening method (sci-Plex) with chemical genetic degradation of protein targets to examine how
embryonic stem cells are transcriptionally reprogrammed following dosed degradation of TFs. I will then
employ state-of-the-art computational tools to quantify the cellular state trajectories encoded by specific
dosages. Finally, I will leverage this single-cell ‘perturbation atlas’ to support genomic mapping experiments
to understand how reduced dosage of these factors in vivo leads to physical redistribution across the
genome. These studies will i.) illuminate mechanisms by which TF dosages encode transcriptional output,
ii.) elucidate how intracellular concentrations of interacting TFs maintain chromatin, transcriptional, and
cellular states, and iii.) provide mechanistic insight into how a transcription factor network interacts with the
epigenome to regulate mammalian pluripotency. More generally, these approaches have the potential to
address long-standing gene regulatory questions of how protein dosage controls cellular state in both
health and in cancer."

 In humans, Brucella spp. can cause a lifelong, debilitating disease, with relapses of undulating fever and
other complications even with antibiotic treatment. No vaccines are currently licensed to prevent human
brucellosis, and mechanisms underlying the ability of Brucella to cause chronic infection are not well known. We
have found B cells enhance susceptibility to Brucella infection by inhibiting CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity. In
this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that B cell antigen presentation skews the CD4+ T cell response during
brucellosis which impairs vaccine efficacy and contributes to chronicity of infection. In Aim #1 of this proposal
we will investigate mechanisms by which B cell antigen presentation affects control of infection and modulates
differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th17, or regulatory T cells. In Aim #2 of this proposal, we determine how
follicular interactions between B and CD4+ T cells affect antibody production and CD4+ T cell function and
determine the relative contribution of IgG and IgM to immunity to infection. Collectively, our results will enhance
our knowledge of the pathogenesis of chronic brucellosis and identify immunomodulatory strategies that can be
incorporated into the rational design of brucellosis vaccines"
10731739,"SUMMARY. Loss of B cell tolerance and production of auto-antibodies (Ab) by plasma cells (PCs) play a major
role in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) pathology. Though Ab-dependent pathogenesis can be partially
controlled with immunosuppression, there is no cure for Ab-mediated disorders. One of the main limitations
when developing therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent Ab-dependent pathology is the lack of a precise
understanding of how auto-reactive PCs are generated and maintained. In this regard, T follicular helper (Tfh)
cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells that provides help to B cells, play a critical role in promoting auto-reactive PCs.
As such, the expansion of self-reactive Tfh cells correlates with auto-Ab production and disease severity in
murine and human lupus. Similar to Tfh cells, Double-negative (DN) T cells, a particular population of T cells
that characteristically lack CD4 and CD8 expression, are also expanded in lupus. Importantly, the frequency of
DN T cells also correlates with disease activity and auto-Ab production. Thus, it is generally believed that these
cells play a role in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Despite their putative role in disease development, we
do not know what signals control DN T cell formation, and their exact origin and pathogenic function remain
largely elusive. Furthermore, the mechanisms that regulate DN T cell homeostasis are entirely unknown, and
there are currently no therapies to selectively deplete DN T cells in vivo. The main goal of this proposal is to
define the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control pathogenic DN T cell development and function. In
this regard, our preliminary data demonstrate that DN T cells and Tfh cells share phenotypic, transcriptional,
and developmental requirements. As such, we have identified a population of Bcl6+ DN T cells that
phenotypically resemble Tfh cells. The central hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal is that Tfh cells are
the precursors of Bcl6+ DN T cells and that, similar to Tfh cells, these cells are efficient B cell helpers.
Importantly, our preliminary data also suggest that Bcl6+ DN T cells are more plastic than Tfh cells, which
allows them to acquire a “hybrid” Tfh/Th17 signature that we believe is critical for supporting auto-reactive PC
responses. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that Tfh cells are precursors of Bcl6+ DN T cells and examine
the capacity of these cells to help self-reactive B cell responses. In Aim 2.1, we will test the hypothesis that IL-
17 production by DN T cells is critical for supporting PC responses and Ab-mediated pathology. In Aim 2.2, we
will determine the molecular mechanisms controlling the acquisition of a “hybrid” Tfh/Th17 signature. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will develop a new synergistic IL-2-based immunotherapy aimed to selectively target Tfh and
prevent the differentiation of IL-17+Bcl6+DN T cells by combining “ultra-low” doses of rIL-2 with STAT3-
signaling blockade. We believe that our studies will provide a new paradigm for how pathogenic DN T cells are
generated, will reveal new pathways implicated in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, and will be crucial for
designing new therapeutic interventions to target Tfh and DN T cells and prevent Ab-mediated pathology."

10700994,"ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant neoplasm of myeloid lineage cells arising in the bone marrow and
outgrowing normal hematopoietic elements. In the US, ~3,500 AML patients receive hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) every year, however relapse after HSCT remains a major cause of mortality, leading to poor
1-year survival and low complete remission rates.
Although AML has been shown to be sensitive to immune-based interventions (e.g., donor lymphocyte infusion
or CAR-T cells), these are limited in AML because of: 1) lack of one antigen with sufficient tumor specificity, 2)
tumor immune escape, 3) requirement for lymphodepletion, preventing engagement of the endogenous immune
system (epitope spreading), and 4) risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other adverse effects.
Marker is proposing a novel T cell-based therapy that targets multiple tumor-associated antigens (mTAAs)
simultaneously, thereby minimizing tumor escape. Specifically, the product to be tested here, MT-401, targets 4
antigens which are highly expressed in AML but are absent or expressed at low levels in healthy tissues.
Manufactured from allogeneic apheresis material from an HSCT donor, MT-401 recognizes the target cells via
the native T cell receptors (TCRs), by interacting with both class I and II MHCs, leading to killing of cells
expressing any of these antigens, as well activation of other immune cells.
Pre-clinically, MT-401 T cells exhibited specific killing of HLA-matched leukemia cells expressing these antigens.
Such mTAA-specific T cells were shown to be clinically safe in >150 patients with various kinds of cancer. In a
heavily pretreated AML population with active disease post-HSCT, this therapy demonstrated objective clinical
evidence resulting in complete (CR) or partial (PR) responses in some patients, while adjuvant patients remained
in remission longer than expected. Additionally, a patient with measurable residual disease (MRD) showed a
relatively steady decline in MRD levels post-treatment. Importantly, epitope spreading was observed due to the
lack lymphodepletion, leading to more durable responses compared to other cellular therapies.
This grant proposes a Phase 2 clinical study of MT-401, an innovative allogeneic T cell product for the treatment
of patients with AML who have received their first allogeneic HSCT. Within the portion of the study covered by
the proposed grant, 40 AML patients who are MRD+ following HSCT will be enrolled in the study.
Specific Aim 1 will include execution of the clinical trial: enrolling, treating and following subjects until study
completion. Specific Aim 2 will include evaluation of the primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints.
Specific Aim 3 will include evaluation of patient samples for biomarker analysis, including expansion, persistence,
clonality, anti-tumor immune effects of MT-401, and epitope spreading, as determined by exploratory objectives."
10728330,"Background: Urinary stone disease (USD) imposes a major economic and health burden on
the United States and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Current barriers to delivering
optimal health care to patients with USD include the dearth of evidence-based process measures
and treatments and the complexity of secondary prevention measures for USD.
Significance/Impact: Current guidelines for best practice management of USD are largely
based on clinical principles or expert opinion. The relative lack of evidence-based guidelines
may lead to suboptimal care and drive unwanted practice pattern variability of quality of care for
USD. The proposed research will address the following VHA/ORD priorities: Primary care
practice and management of complex chronic diseases (such as recurrent USD) and quality
measurement of USD prevention.
Innovation: The proposed research will determine which guideline-recommended strategies
are effective for secondary prevention of USD. Randomized clinical trials are not yet on the
horizon, and so our findings hold the promise of rapidly expanding the evidence base for
optimal care of USD and shift the clinical practice paradigm for USD towards primary care
providers so that more Veterans with USD can receive effective stone prevention.
Specific Aims: We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine which prevention
measures are associated with lower rates of USD recurrence in the VHA; 2) Evaluate how VHA
providers are currently implementing prevention measures for USD; and 3) Identify current
barriers to implementing effective prevention measures for USD in the VHA. We hypothesize
the following: 1) prevention measures such as screening for primary hyperparathyroidism, 24-
hour urine testing, and prescription of stone-related medications are associated with longer
periods of time to recurrent USD and/or fewer stone events; 2) primary care providers are less
likely than specialty providers to implement prevention measures for USD; and 3) each provider
type face unique barriers that reduce utilization of effective stone prevention measures.
Methodology: Aim 1 will identify a national cohort of Veterans with incident or recurrent USD
between 2010 and 2016 and use methods that mimic randomized clinical trials to identify which
guideline-recommended measures lead to longer times to a second USD event or fewer USD
events. Aim 2 will examine the proportion of patients who receive care from primary care,
nephrology, and urology providers following their index stone event and identify which
providers are more or less likely to implement each prevention measure. Aim 3 will conduct
national surveys with primary care, nephrology, and urology providers affiliated with the VHA
to identify barriers to implementation of effective stone prevention measures.
Next Steps/Implementation: The VHA is ideally positioned to support comparative
effectiveness studies to determine which best practice guidelines are most effective at reducing
USD recurrence. The proposed research will define more clearly best practice management of
USD, evaluate how VHA providers are currently implementing prevention measures, and
identify barriers that obstruct uniform adoption of best practice management of USD across the
VHA. We anticipate that our findings will inform the design of prospective clinical trials (where
feasible) and facilitate diffusion of best USD care practices within and beyond the VHA."
10728340,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Efforts to measure, report, and incentivize the quality of healthcare are now widespread within
the Veterans Health Administration (VA), Medicare, and private healthcare settings—but common
musculoskeletal disorders including carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been omitted from these efforts due to
a lack of valid, feasible quality measures. Although clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of CTS have recently been published, no valid and feasible measures of these guidelines
currently exist. Also, great interest exists across healthcare specialties in developing and implementing patient
reported outcome measure-based quality measures (PRO-QMs). Before implementing process or outcome-
based quality measures, it is essential to determine if they are valid and produce actionable information.
Significance/Impact: VA is increasingly becoming a purchaser of community-based healthcare, making it
essential to evaluate if healthcare quality measures are valid for both VA and cross-system comparisons. This
proposal is aligned with VA ORD and HSR&D priorities including quality and safety, supporting the
development of value-based payment models, methods for monitoring quality and safety of non-VA purchased
care, and evaluating measures and methods to compare the quality of VA and non-VA care. The continued
absence of valid CTS quality measures leaves all stakeholders without any means to identify quality gaps,
evaluate the impacts of quality improvement initiatives, or to enact performance-based reimbursement or
purchasing initiatives.
Innovation: Enthusiasm for implementing PRO-QMs has outpaced careful consideration of issues related to
logistics, statistics, measurement, and unintended consequences. Currently, methods are under-developed to
evaluate if sufficient variability in outcomes exist to justify implementation of PRO-QMs. The work proposed in
Aim 2 will significantly advance the conceptual and statistical basis of methods to examine outcome variance
for quality measurement applications. In Aim 3, we propose to examine associations between fully
operationalized and pilot tested process quality measures (Aim 1) with PROMs collected for Aim 2. Information
about each process measure's predictive validity is essential for future prioritization and implementation.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 – Complete development and validity testing of process-oriented quality measures for
the treatment of CTS using diverse administrative datasets. Aim 2 – Evaluate the measurement characteristics
of PRO-QMs for CTS. Aim 3 – Test the predictive validity of promising process measures from Aim 1
Methodology: Existing healthcare data from VA, Medicare, and 3 university and community systems will be
used to examine the measurement characteristics of four currently proposed, but inadequately tested, CTS
process quality measures (Aim 1). Patient reported outcome measures will be collected from 2000 patients in 5
diverse health care settings representing 24 hand surgeons to examine if meaningful between-facility and -
surgeon variation exists in changes in outcome among patients receiving initial consultation with a hand
surgeon (Aim 2). The predictive validity of the process measures in Aim 1 will be evaluated using the outcome
data collected in Aim 2 (Aim 3).
Next Steps/Implementation: Study results that support the validity of specific quality measures will facilitate
planned efforts to pursue National Quality Forum endorsement, and provide VA hand surgeons, quality
managers, and community care purchasers a means to judge CTS treatment quality. Study results that do not
support the validity of specific quality measures will be used to resist their implementation."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common, costly, and at times devastating condition associated with cognitive
impairment, disproportionately affecting U.S. racial/ethnic minorities and individuals in low and middle-income
countries. Asylum-seekers and refugees represent one especially vulnerable group that have high rates of TBI due to
experiences such as war, torture, and interpersonal violence. Existing cognitive rehabilitation interventions targeting
cognitive symptoms following TBI present an effective and evidence-based approach to address the cognitive sequalae of
TBI in this population; but they require adaptation and evaluation. The central objective of this research proposal is to
optimize and evaluate the first culturally adapted, trauma-informed cognitive rehabilitation intervention (“SMART-Plus”)
delivered by community health workers (CHWs) using video-based telemedicine. This approach addresses several
individual and system-level challenges such as linguistic barriers, cultural variations in perception of, and stigma around
TBI, high trauma exposure, healthcare mistrust, lack of access to specialty-trained clinicians, and transportation barriers
that make in-person interventions less feasible. Given the epidemiology of TBI in this population and to reduce sample
heterogeneity in the early stages of intervention adaptation, the project will focus on those with interpersonal violence
related mild TBI. The three Specific Aims are: (1) To develop SMART-Plus for asylum-seekers and refugees with
interpersonal related mild TBI using input from asylum-seekers and refugees to tailor content, incorporate intervention
delivery preferences, and identify engagement determinants; (2) To conduct an open pilot of SMART-Plus delivered by
trained CHWs using telemedicine and further refine the intervention, study procedures, and outcome targets; and (3) To
conduct a pilot feasibility randomized trial of SMART-Plus compared to wait-list control to improve post-concussive and
cognitive impairment symptoms. These aims are consistent with the NIH Stage Model, representing a Stage IA (Aim 1
and 2) and Stage 1B (Aim 3) study, as well as Barerra’s stage model for cultural adaptation that involves information
gathering (Aim 1); preliminary adaptation design and testing (Aim 2), and full adaptation design and testing (Aim 3). The
findings of this project will fill an existing gap in a high impact research area that will inform the care of a growing and
vulnerable population. At the same time, it offers a translational model for cultural and trauma-informed adaptation for
other health disparities populations experiencing cognitive impairment and similar barriers to care, both domestically and
globally. The PI, Dr. Saadi, is an early-career clinician investigator and neurologist, who will use this career development
award to enhance her skills in mixed methods research for intervention adaptation, cognitive rehabilitation therapy and
neuropsychiatric outcomes, equity-centered technology-based approaches, and RCT design involving vulnerable groups.
She will leverage this training to launch an independent research career in scalable, technology-enhanced, community-
engaged interventions to promote brain health equity. Throughout the award period, Dr. Saadi will work closely with an
expert, committed and multidisciplinary mentorship and advisory team to carry out her stated career objectives and
specific aims."
10725166,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the leading sources of cancer mortality worldwide,
including US Veterans. An initial response to chemotherapy, such as Gemcitabine (GEM) is often followed by
emergent resistance reflecting an urgent need for targeted therapies. Our studies have found that CYR61 is a
druggable PDAC driver, and it can be suppressed by Zoledronic acid (ZA) under tissue culture conditions.
Regrettably, the weak availability in the target tissue limits the therapeutic efficacy of ZA. Thus, the goal of this
proposal is to evaluate a new approach for an iRGD-mediated-hypoxic/pH-responsive nanocarriers (ZA-iPRNCs)
based therapy, which can efficiently release ZA from the nano-capsule exclusively in the hypoxic
microenvironment of PDAC. In our in vitro and in vivo preliminary studies, we have established the feasibility of
the proposed method. We have shown that like free-ZA, CYR61 expression can be blocked significantly by ZA-
iPRNCs in different PDAC cell lines. We have also obtained results indicating that after intravenous delivery to
tumor-bearing mice, ZA-iPRNCs lead to robust tumor uptake detectable by in vivo imaging and, importantly,
results in suppression of CYR61 expression and tumor growth. Building on these exciting preliminary findings,
we now propose to unravel the mechanism of regulation of CYR61 by ZA, and determine whether ZA, via
blocking CYR61, inhibits PDAC growth and metastatic progression as well as makes cancer cells sensitive to
GEM using genetically engineered cell lines and mouse models. Further, we will also explore an additive impact
of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane, NPac) on GEM sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice treated with ZA-iPRNCs, GEM,
and NPac together. To accomplish these goals, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanism
of regulation of CYR61 expression in PDAC cells by ZA. In Aim 2, we will determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) and bioavailability of ZA using immunocompetent mice. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will evaluate whether
nano carrier-based ZA therapy alone or in a combination of ZA-iPRNCs, GEM, and NPac leads to improved
tumor control and mouse survival in KPC and PDX mouse models. To achieve these aims, we have standardized
a non-invasive ultrasound imaging technique that reveals the various steps of tumor progression in mouse
models. With the help of these techniques and the unique collaborative expertise of the multidisciplinary team,
we will establish a new therapeutic approach for future clinical trials."
10744251,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and diabetes are associated with the chronic overconsumption of high sugar foods and fluids, driven in
large part by their palatable taste. A single heterodimeric G-protein coupled receptor (T1R2+3) found in
mammalian taste cells is widely considered the principal means through which all simple sugars are detected
and promote ingestion via the gustatory system. Yet, recent studies from our laboratory revealed that rodents
come to respond more positively to the orosensory properties of glucose over fructose, when provided the
opportunity to learn about their divergent metabolic consequences, and this phenomenon does not require the
canonical T1R2+3 taste receptor. Collectively, these published studies point to the existence of a previously
unknown taste receptor linked to glucose appetite. The preliminary findings included in this proposal now show
that glucokinase, a phosphorylating enzyme involved in other glucosensing mechanisms, is expressed in murine
taste cells. We further demonstrate that glucokinase levels in the taste tissue are regulated by energy state and
dietary sugar exposure. Moreover, pharmacological activation of lingual glucokinase specifically bolsters licking
behavior and neural responsiveness in the chorda tympani nerve for glucose, but not fructose or water. Our
working hypothesis is that glucokinase is part of a T1R2+3-independent taste receptor that transduces glucose-
specific signals in the gustatory system. The overall goal of this proposal is to further clarify the functional and
molecular properties of this novel gustatory glucosensor. In Aim 1, we will combine genetic and pharmacological
approaches to selectively disrupt and/or activate canonical “sweet” taste inputs and lingual glucokinase while
measuring taste-driven licking for various “sweet” and “non-sweet” tastants in sugar-naïve and sugar-exposed
mice. With immunoblot and qPCR, we will further quantify changes in glucokinase and other sensory
mechanisms linked to glucokinase in taste tissue as a function of dietary sugar exposure. In Aim 2, we will
combine genetic and pharmacological approaches to psychophysically assess the discriminability of glucose,
fructose, and other tastants in a series of two response operant discrimination tasks in order to fully elucidate
the behavioral outputs functionally linked to gustatory glucosensors. In Aim 3, we will combine genetic and
pharmacological approaches with electrophysiology to determine how T1R2+3-independent, glucokinase-linked
taste signals are neurally-transmitted from tongue to brain. The outcomes of these aims will identify novel and
potentially critical aspects of nutrient sensing, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential new strategies to curb
appetite."
10731748,"Groundwater contamination with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a widespread issue throughout the
United States. Over 50% of more than 3500 groundwater samples collected from 98 major drinking water
supply aquifers from 1985-2001 contained at least one anthropogenic contaminant, with VOCs detected
most frequently. Among the top 15 VOCs detected, eight were chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs):
chloroform (CF), perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA),
cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE), trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (trans-DCE), dichloromethane (DCM),
and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA). All of these CAHs are listed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as being likely human carcinogens. Of increasing concern are emerging co-contaminants, such
as 1,4-dioxane (1,4-D), which is also a likely human carcinogen. Common remediation techniques, such
as pump-and-treat, are not sustainable for treating contaminant mixtures that slowly diffuse from low
permeability zones in the subsurface. These issues highlight the need for long-term, passive, and
economical remediation techniques.
Passive and sustainable systems are proposed for the aerobic cometabolism of emerging contaminants, such
as 1,4-D, that are mixed with CAHs. These passive systems will be created by co-encapsulating axenic
bacterial cultures with a slow release compound (SRC) in hydrogel beads. The SRC will slowly hydrolyze
in the beads to produce an alcohol, which will serve as a microbial growth substrate and as an inducer for
non-specific contaminant-degrading monooxygenases. Groundwater contaminants will diffuse into the
hydrogels where they will be cometabolically transformed to non-toxic products. In preliminary studies,
the alkane-oxidizing bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 21198 was co-encapsulated with an
orthosilicate SRC in a gellan gum hydrogel. Continuous degradation of 1,1,1-TCA, cis-DCE, and 1,4-D
was maintained for over 300 days. In the proposed work, proteomic analyses of this model bacterium will
be performed to identify the active monooxygenases and to characterize the enzymatic and physiological
changes that ultimately limit the long-term activity of this bacterium in the encapsulated systems. Genome-
enabled approaches will also be used to rationally identify other microorganisms with different
monooxygenase compliments that can also be co-encapsulated with SRCs to achieve the degradation of a
broad range of emerging contaminants. Material science research will determine how to produce hydrogels
beads that maintain mechanical integrity for extended periods, focusing on processes that can be easily
scaled-up for producing large quantities of beads needed for in-situ treatment. The beads will then be used
in different platforms at the laboratory scale to create passive permeable reactive barriers. The hydrogel
beads might also be used for treating contaminated soils and sediments and other emerging contaminants."
10725114,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has profound effects upon skin and generates systemic consequences from fever
to immunosuppression to vitamin D production. The ability of UVB to serve as both an immunosuppressant and
mutagen allows this environmental agent to serve as a complete carcinogen, and is the cause for non-melanoma
skin cancer and melanoma. Skin cancer is the most common diagnosis in VA Dermatology clinics, and this is
expected to increase as our military forces are often stationed in areas with a high UV index. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms by which UVB generates skin cancer is relevant to our veterans. As UVB only
penetrates the epidermis, a major question in photobiology is how UVB-treated skin sends systemic signals.
Recent studies have indicated that small membrane-bound vesicles known as microvesicle particles (MVP)
released from cells in response to various stressors can act as potent signaling agents due to their ability to carry
nuclear and cytoplasmic components. We have demonstrated that UVB generates MVP release from epithelial
cells and skin, which could provide a potential mechanism for UVB-mediated systemic signaling. Our group and
others have previously reported that UVB radiation generates high levels of the lipid mediator Platelet-activating
factor (PAF) produced enzymatically and PAF-receptor (PAFR) agonists produced non-enzymatically via
reactive oxygen species. Recent studies using antioxidants and PAFR-expressing/null cell lines and
pharmacologic/genetic inhibition of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) have implicated involvement
of PAFR signaling resulting in aSMase activation in UVB generated MVP (UVB-MVP). Finally, we provide
evidence that UVB-MVP carry bioactive PAF agonists, which we hypothesize mediate the delayed
immunosuppressive effects of UVB. Yet knowledge gaps exist as to how UVB-MVP are generated and if this
new pathway can be exploited to address UVB-induced immunosuppression involved in skin tumor
generation/progression. Two aims are planned for the renewal of this long-running and highly productive VA
Merit grant which is centered around the role of oxidized glycerophosphocholines in UV-induced
immunosuppression. These aims are designed to test the hypothesis that UVB generates MVP in human skin in
a PAF-dependent manner involving aSMase and transfers both local and systemic effects via their carried PAF
agonists. Aim 1 will use in vitro cell lines and murine genetic and pharmacologic models to determine the
mechanisms of UVB-MVP generation. Aim 2 will use tools (in part validated in Aim 1) to define the roles of UVB-
MVP in delayed immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting effects of UVB. Successful completion of this project
will (i) address an important question in photobiology as to how a keratinocyte-specific stimulus can generate
systemic signaling effects, (ii) offer pharmacologic mechanisms to block UVB local and systemic effects."
10725140,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disabling psychiatric condition that is highly prevalent in
combat veterans. Only a fraction of trauma-exposed individuals develop PTSD, suggesting that pre-existing
neurobiological factors contribute to susceptibility/ risk. Currently, specific molecular/ circuit-level mechanisms
that contribute to PTSD risk are not well-defined. Substantial information supports that pre-existing dysfunction
in fear circuits may promote vulnerability to PTSD, however mechanisms contributing to pre-trauma individual
differences in fear regulation are unclear. To date, most of our current understanding of fear is based on
defensive reactions to external threats. While the importance of “body-to-brain” signaling in emotional regulation
has long been recognized, the role of homeostatic threats in shaping individual differences in fear and PTSD risk
has not been investigated. Previous studies reported increased sensitivity in veterans with PTSD to carbon
dioxide (CO2), a homeostatic threat producing intense fear. Importantly, pre-deployment CO2 sensitivity
associates with later development of PTSD symptoms, suggesting that CO2 sensitivity and associated
mechanisms can provide valuable information on PTSD risk.
 Previous work from the PI’s lab reported a unique role of interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R1) signaling within
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) compromised sensory circumventricular area, subfornical organ (SFO) in CO2-evoked
fear responses. In a mouse model of CO2 sensitivity-PTSD, we observed delayed fear extinction deficits and
enhanced startle in CO2-sensitive mice, a response attenuated by IL-1R1 antagonism in SFO. Our molecular
studies reveal IL-1R1 localization on SFO endothelial cells and interaction with renin angiotensin system (RAS)
targets, and forebrain regions infralimbic cortex and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), also implicated in
PTSD. Collectively, our data support a unique neurovascular signaling mechanism in an interoceptive brain
region (SFO) that may regulate forebrain fear circuits contributing to increased PTSD risk. Proposed studies will
investigate how neurovascular mechanisms within the SFO regulate fear circuits and contribute to PTSD-
relevant behaviors. We will use cell-circuit based transgenic, electrophysiological and chemogenetic approaches
in male and female mice. Our hypothesis that, SFO neurovascular IL-1R1-RAS interactions with forebrain circuits
promote CO2-sensitivity and PTSD relevant behaviors will be tested under three aims. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that CO2-associated PTSD relevant behaviors are dependent on SFO endothelial IL-1R1 and RAS
Delayed fear conditioning, extinction, and startle (PTSD-relevant behaviors) will be measured in air/CO2 exposed
wild type or endothelial-specific deletion of IL-1R1 (Tie-2Cre:IL1R1fl/fl) mice treated with SFO-targeted RAS
modulators. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that CO2-evoked activation of SFO projection neurons is dependent
on endothelial IL-1R1 and AT1R signaling Functional IL-1R1-RAS associations will be assessed using patch
clamp electrophysiology and pharmacology in SFO slices from wild type, Tie-2Cre:IL1R1fl/fl or AT1R-tdtomato
reporter mice. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that SFO►IL and SFO►BNST projections regulate PTSD relevant
behaviors. Using a retroCre-dependent chemogenetic strategy we will modulate SFO ►IL and SFO►BNST
projections during the CO2 challenge and measure delayed PTSD-relevant fear and startle behaviors
Relevance: Our data will reveal a unique neurovascular core mechanism and novel circuit underlying PTSD
risk. Beyond CO2, this mechanism is relevant to underlying neuroimmune, RAS and neurovascular abnormalities
reported in veterans with PTSD The long-term goal is to identify predictive risk factors and therapeutic targets
for management of PTSD in the veteran population."
10725158,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Stroke remains as the 5th leading cause of death and
long-term adult disability in the USA because only ~15%
patients can
benefit from current standard therapies (
tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular
recanalization) due to their short therapeutic windows. Therefore, identification of novel stroke therapeutic targets
for neuroprotective drugs remains to be an unmet urgent need. Hypertension is the most significant risk factor
for stroke epidemics and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced neurogenic hypertension is associated with worsened
ischemic brain damage. However, the clinical trial studies show no benefits of post-stroke blood pressure (BP)-
lowering treatment in the acute stage of ischemic stroke on improvement of the risk of death or disability because
it hinders cerebral perfusion. These findings challenge us to develop a novel strategy to block the AngII -mediated
detrimental effects in the ischemic brains without lowering BP and cerebral perfusion.
The serine-threonine WNK kinase family [with no lysine (K)], and its two downstream kinases SPAK (the
STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) activate
multiple ion transporters and channels via protein phosphorylation. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1)
is one of the major substrates of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinases. Stimulation of
the
WNK-SPAK kinases
increased brain NKCC1 activity via protein phosphorylation and led to ischemic cell damage through NKCC1-
mediated Na+ and Cl- overload, cytotoxic edema and excitotoxicity. Our pilot study reveals that Ang II-induced
hypertensive mice exhibited 2-5 fold increase in the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 protein complex expression in ischemic
brains, which was accompanied with worsened outcomes in infarct, edema, and neurological deficit in the
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model (pdMCAO). Post-stroke administration of a novel, non-ATP
competitive, selective SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a in these mice significantly reduced infarction and edema, and
improved neurological function recovery. However, how Ang II signaling pathway regulates WNK-SPAK-NKCC1
protein complex expression and efficacy of ZT-1a in reducing ischemic brain injury in the Ang II-induced
hypertensive mice remains unknown. We hypothesize that (1) Ang II stimulates Ang II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R)-
NF-κB cascade which leads to upregulation of WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling complex after stroke; (2) elevated
WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling directly contributes to the worsened ischemic neuronal damage and neurological
deficits; (3) post-stroke administration of the novel SPAK kinase inhibitor ZT-1a reduces ischemic brain damage
by preventing excessive activation of brain SPAK-NKCC1 signaling. These hypotheses will be tested in three
specific aims. In summary, we investigate that Ang II-induced hypertension comorbidity causes worsened
ischemic stroke outcome in part via stimulating the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling pathway in the CNS.
Completion of this study will enable us to gain new knowledge on whether targeting brain WNK-SPAK-NKCC1
signaling pathway will improve outcomes of ischemic stroke patients with comorbid hypertension."
10725117,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Insulin resistance, excess hepatic glucose production, and impaired insulin secretion are the hallmarks
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and tissue iron levels significantly affect all three. In mice and humans, we
have shown that high iron impairs insulin secretion and down regulates leptin and adiponectin. Our preliminary
data show further that these effects of iron are fuel-dependent, with much of this difference based on higher
iron levels supporting higher levels of fat oxidation. Our mechanistic work on these effects of iron has revealed
the involvement of numerous pathways, including transcriptional regulation (notably by CREB, FoxO1, and
PGC1α) and nutrient/metabolite signaling (AMPK, sirtuins, and mTOR). Thus, the effects of iron are complex,
pleiotropic, and cannot be explained by invoking a single linear signal transduction pathway.
 Recently our work on the mechanism by which iron regulates leptin secretion has revealed a unifying
concept for these pleiotropic effects: High tissue iron down-regulates a central integrator of nutrient and redox
status, the O-linked N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) pathway. This pathway results in the O-GlcNAc
modification of most transcription factors and numerous enzymes that regulate metabolism. Activation of the
pathway is often a direct readout of cellular nutrient fluxes, and we have shown it to be sufficient to induce
changes in insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and hepatic glucose metabolism in ways that recapitulate
T2DM. A second pathway that responds to both nutrient and oxidative stresses is the hypoxia-sensing
pathway. Like the O-GlcNAc pathway, it functions at both ends of two metabolic spectra—low glucose and low
oxygen as well as high glucose and oxidative stress. The pathways regulate one another and interact in
determining hepatic glucose production, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Importantly, both the O-
GlcNAc and hypoxia pathways are not only relevant to pathologic iron overload and hypoxia, but regulate
metabolism in normal physiology, across the very broad range of “normal” iron and in individuals at sea level.
 In sum, the O-GlcNAc and hypoxia pathways cooperate to sense the availability or excess of two
essential elements required for oxidative metabolism, iron and oxygen. Based on the above, our published
work, and Preliminary Data, we therefore hypothesize that these two pathways integrate these signals to
regulate several metabolic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Modulation of the O-GlcNAc
pathway by iron affects numerous signal transduction pathways, leading to broad-based changes in
metabolism that globally alter fuel utilization to confer adaptive responses to either a lack or excess of iron. In
parallel, the hypoxia pathway performs a parallel function based on oxygen availability or excess oxidant
stress. Crosstalk between the two pathways can amplify their effects, resulting in integration and a “fine-tuning”
of metabolism based on nutrient availability, iron and oxygen levels, and oxidant stress. To test these
hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims:
1. Determine the mechanism by which O-GlcNAc mediates the regulation of leptin secretion by iron.
2. Define the effects of dietary iron on β-cell function in mice, in normoxia and hypoxia.
3. Determine the mechanism for the effects of iron on O-GlcNAc protein modification.
 The significance and impact of these studies is that they aim to define ideal levels of tissue iron that
may be narrower than the broad “normal” range in humans, and tissue iron is easily modifiable by diet or blood
donation. Ideal iron levels may also differ based on oxygen status (i.e. in those with different habitation
altitudes), ultimately allowing personalized therapy for diabetes in those individuals. Finally, the studies will
also identify new pathways to treat diabetes: For example, the HIF hydroxylases can be pharmacologically
manipulated, and advances are also being made in doing so for the O-GlcNAc pathway.

10726580,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The burden of tuberculosis (TB) in children and adolescents is massive and current TB control strategies, even
at full scale-up, are insufficient to address it.4,6-8,10 Novel strategies to expand TB control outside of the home
and into the community, where children acquire an estimated 80% of new TB infections,11-12 are urgently
needed. However, an incomplete understanding of where and from whom youth acquire TB, and how these
drivers change throughout the early life-course, hampers the design of novel interventions. Thus, we propose
the first-ever population-representative, longitudinal TB Infection Incidence Cohort of youth ages 1 to 18 years,
in rural communities in Uganda. Using a combination of epidemiologic and network analytic techniques, this
study will address key foundational knowledge gaps about TB transmission within 3 socio-spatial networks of
youth: the household network, the non-household social network (close contacts), and the network of casual
contacts encountered in community venues. In Aim 1 we will characterize the role of the household social
network in TB infection throughout the early life course. In Aim 2 we will employ social network analysis to
assess the relationships between child and adolescent TB infections and their community-based social
network, and in Aim 3 we will use location-based networks to assess the relationships between community
venues and incident TB infections in youth. Data from this proposal will directly inform novel, age-specific,
community-based TB control strategies and will help optimize existing household-based strategies."
10738732,"Intimate partner violence (IPV), a potent risk factor for depression, anxiety, and Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder (common mental disorders; CMDs), is a devastating public health problem with the highest rates
occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Mental health interventions that aim to reduce IPV often fail to include men,
which could be addressed by treatment in a couple modality. Yet, couple-based treatments often exclude
couples who are living with IPV. The goal of this K23 Award is to expand the candidate’s skillset and prepare
her to conduct independent research on couple-based mental health interventions for CMDs that address
social determinants, such as IPV, to improve mental health outcomes and sustainability of gains. The proposed
training program involves mentorship from leading experts, coursework and workshops, attending and
presenting at scientific conferences, and developing collaborative manuscripts for publication to develop
competency in (1) engagement and mental health treatment of men; (2) adaptation of an evidence-based
treatment for CMDs to address IPV in couples; (3) methods and analyses of randomized controlled trials for
couples; and (4) skills for a successful career as an independent investigator.
 These training goals and activities will align with the aims of a research study in Mozambique, one of
the poorest countries in the world with a significant mental health treatment gap. Half of women in Mozambique
endorsed being exposed to IPV in the past year, and there are high prevalence rates of CMDs. The candidate
is Project Director of PRIDE (Partnerships in Research to Implement and Disseminate Sustainable and
Scalable EBPs, U19MH113203), a collaborative project with the Mozambique Ministry of Health that is scaling-
up comprehensive mental health care across a province using Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat CMDs.
Scale-up, however, has not considered the coordinated treatment of CMDs and the co-occurring problem of
IPV among couples. The overall goal of the research plan is to investigate the feasibility of reducing CMDs in
women through a couple-based treatment that addresses CMDs and situational IPV (discord between intimate
partners that escalates to physical violence). This study has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify
gender roles including local contextual influences relevant to engaging men in couple-based treatment of IPV
in public MH care. The second aim is to adapt IPC-C to reduce CMDs in female partners through resolution of
IPV and improvement of couple functioning. The third aim is to determine acceptability and feasibility of using
Interpersonal Counseling for Couples (IPC-C) to reduce CMDs in women and IPV in couples. This study has
applicability for low-resource populations internationally and the US that experience couple-based violence and
a mental health treatment gap. With its focus on intimate partners, the intervention also has the potential to
benefit health and wellbeing of children."

10731062,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Mtb utilizes host-derived lipids to promote pathogenesis and this is a defining feature of this intracellular
pathogen. During infection Mtb imports and metabolizes host lipids to support pathogenesis by producing: i)
energy, ii) central metabolic intermediates, or iii) polyketide virulence lipids. While the metabolic pathways in Mtb
that degrade or process lipids are complex and contain redundant enzymes, the bacterial Mce lipid transporters
appear to be specific for dedicated lipid substrates.
 Aim 1 of this work proposes to employ genetic and biochemical approaches to identify and characterize novel
gene/proteins required for fatty acid import in Mtb. While it is understood that Mce1 imports fatty acids, the
substrate specificity of this transporter is unknown. Therefore, we intend to define substrates and the biochemical
basis of Mce1 substrate specificity. Our preliminary studies indicate that Mtb transports fatty acid precursors of
immune signaling lipids via Mce1 and we include here studies to evaluate if scavenging of this immune lipid
precursors by Mtb impacts the immune response.
 Aim 2 proposes to identify and characterize protein subunits that are shared by all the Mce transporters and
are required for lipid import in Mtb. We have determined that LucA is required for Mce1- and Mce4-mediated
transport and LucA stabilizes these transporter complexes. These studies seek to characterize the basis for this
transporter stabilization. Similarly, MceG is required for Mce1- and Mce4-mediated transport and we intend to
understand how MceG stabilizes and interacts with Mce1. We will use a genetic approach to silence LucA and
MceG in Mtb within chronically infected mice and quantify bacterial fitness to determine the therapeutic potential
of drugs that potentially block these proteins."

Maternal immune activation (MIA) during prenatal or postnatal development significantly increases the risk for
offspring neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) later in life. Growing evidence suggest that regardless of the
MIA stimuli (infectious or environmental), offspring exhibit an enhanced risk for lifelong neuropathology defects
ranging from reduced brain volume to alterations in neurocircuit organization. The brain extracellular matrix-
containing chondroitin and dermatan sulfate-glycosaminoglycans (CS/DS-GAGs) are key regulators of brain
development and can be biochemically altered by neuroimmune responses. Defects in CS/DS-GAG abundance
and/or sulfation patterning (4S (CS-A), 2S4S (CS-B/DS), 6S (CS-C), 2S6S (CS-D), 4S6S (CS-E), 0S (CS-O))
result in the manifestation of similar neuropsychiatric behaviors as reported in offspring affected by MIA, but
whether and how MIA affects offspring brain matrix is unknown. By employing a novel laser capture
microdissection coupled mass spectrometry methodology (LMD-LC-MS/MS), our Preliminary Data provide the
first evidence for inter- and intra-regional differences in CS/DS-GAG sulfation pattern differences throughout the
developing mouse and non-human primate (NHP) brain. Specifically, the hippocampus exhibits a significant
increase in both developmental 6S (CS-C) and 2S6S (CS-D) isomers compared to the cortex, implying that the
hippocampus remains developmentally plastic long after the maturation of adjacent regions. Moreover, we show
that infectious Zika virus MIA during gestation in NHPs decreases the abundance of the developmental 2S6S
(CS-D) axonal growth factor attractant isomer in the hippocampus, suggesting stunted neurocircuit formation
after infectious MIA, while the non-infectious maternal high fat diet (mHFD) MIA during lactation in mice
decreases the abundance of the developmental 6S (CS-C) plasticity isomer in the hippocampus, suggested
accelerated early maturation of hippocampal neurocircuits in response to non-infectious MIA. The implication
that both infectious and non-infectious MIA insults influence the spatiotemporal regulation of brain CS/DS-GAG
sulfation patterns fits a global interconnecting theory linking a range of MIA insults with changes in offspring brain
neurodevelopment through re-coding of CS/DS-GAGs. From these results, we propose to 1) determine how MIA
exposure affects spatiotemporal expression of offspring CS/DS-GAGs and link these changes to NDDs later in
life, 2) mechanistically investigate how these MIA-induced changes in offspring CS/DS-GAGs influence glycan-
protein interactions involved in neurodevelopment, and 3) engineer a state-of-the-art nanopore sequencing
technology capable of single-molecule sequencing of biological CS/DS-GAGs to discover glycan-protein binding
elements. This multidisciplinary proposal has important translational potential to clarify how MIA exposure leads
to neuropsychiatric illness through changes in CS/DS-GAG sulfation patterning during childhood
neurodevelopment and provides valuable targets in the prevention and treatment of mental health diseases."
10734781,"Infections associated with Candida species cause the 4th most common type of bloodstream infection.
Only three effective antifungal drugs exist, causing a real threat to the continued viability of antifungal
therapy. C. glabrata is the second most commonly isolated species associated with candidemias and
has both low intrinsic susceptibility to azole drugs and can readily acquire robust tolerance to this most
commonly used class of antifungal compounds. Azole-resistant C. glabrata isolates are almost
exclusively caused by point mutations in the gene encoding a transcription factor called PDR1. These
point mutations lead to the production of a gain-of-function (GOF) form of the Pdr1 transcriptional
regulator that in turn cause high level constitutive expression of target genes. A key Pdr1 target gene is
the CDR1 locus that encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter thought to act as a broad specificity
drug efflux pump, preventing the accumulation of azole drugs in cells carrying these GOF PDR1 alleles.
The goal of this application is to use a chemical genetic approach to identify small molecules that can
inhibit activation of CDR1 by GOF forms of Pdr1. We will use two different chemical libraries to screen a
C. glabrata strain containing a CDR1-luciferase (CDR1-LUC) gene fusion to identify compounds that are
able to inhibit this central regulatory step in azole resistance acquisition in this pathogenic yeast. We
have already validated our ability to readily detect expression changes in CDR1-LUC using a 384 well
format assay that will be employed in the chemical library screen. Aim 1 will employ this CDR1-
luciferase reporter strain to screen two different chemical libraries to identify small molecules that are
able to block the normal constitutively high expression seen in the presence of a GOF allele of PDR1.
Inhibitors of the luciferase enzymatic reaction and aggregation-dependent inhibitors will be eliminated.
Compounds that satisfy these initial screening criteria will be tested for the ability to modulate the native
CDR1 locus by RT-qPCR assays. Aim 2 will identify the action of compounds that modulate CDR1
expression by testing their ability to impact azole resistance of a collection of C. glabrata clinical isolates
as well as a set of different PDR1 GOF alleles that we have previously characterized. The interaction of
candidate compounds with a set of transcriptional Mediator complex mutations will also be analyzed to
gain insight into how these molecules may impact Pdr1 transcriptional regulation. RNA-seq experiments
will be carried out on several of the most promising compounds to examine the range of transcriptional
changes these molecules cause and the similarity between their activities. Completion of this proposal
will provide new chemical reagents that will be useful as potential adjuvants with fluconazole and
powerful new probes for Pdr1-mediated activation of CDR1 expression."

Osteosarcoma, the most common primary tumor of bone, primarily affects children, adolescents, and young
adults. A diagnosis of osteosarcoma is devastating, as approximately half of pediatric osteosarcoma patients
experience metastasis and ultimately succumb to the disease within 10 years of their diagnosis. Currently
there is no diagnostic test to predict prognosis, so all patients are treated with aggressive surgery and intense
chemotherapy with high rates of toxicity. However, a subset of patients may not require as aggressive therapy
to achieve remission. Additionally, those that survive have a high incidence of lifelong morbidities, including
treatment-related secondary malignancies. Accurate prognostic indicators could be integrated into the standard
of care for osteosarcoma to guide therapy. Children with more favorable prognoses could be treated more
conservatively, reducing the need for aggressive surgery, and decreasing the intensity of systemic therapy.
This would decrease the likelihood and severity of long-term morbidities, and reduce the probability of
secondary, treatment-related malignancies without negatively affecting prognosis. Conversely, patients with a
worse prognosis could receive more aggressive treatments or be guided to experimental clinical trials to
improve their long-term survival. In this project, we will develop a serum exosomal gene signature associated
with prognosis in pediatric osteosarcoma. Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles containing cargo
associated with tumor biology and disease state. We will first identify biomarkers by sequencing serum
exosomes from a large cohort of pediatric osteosarcoma patients with known clinical outcomes. We will then
identify genes associated with metastatic propensity using xenograft mouse models established from pediatric
osteosarcomas with distinct biologic behavior. We will analyze co-regulated gene clusters and apply machine
learning, improving sensitivity and specificity, and ultimately resulting in a more robust gene signature. The
osteosarcoma gene signature developed in this project can be utilized in the clinical setting to predict
prognosis, stratifying patients into more appropriate treatment categories, and having the potential to improve
management of this devastating disease. Additionally, these biomarkers will contribute to our understanding of
the biological behavior and progression of osteosarcoma, allowing us to infer mechanisms of host response,
metastasis, and response to therapy. Importantly, this K01 is critical to advancing my career as a translational
scientist by providing the necessary protected time and dedicated resources to perform high-quality, clinically
relevant research, under the guidance of an exceptional multidisciplinary mentor team. This award will facilitate
my transition to independence, as the data procured in this project will allow me to be competitive for future
independent funding applications. Additionally, as I complete these aims, I will develop the necessary
knowledge and leadership skills of a successful independent research scientist specializing in exosome biology
and translational models of pediatric osteosarcoma and ultimately expanding to other cancers."

Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), composed of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, is effective
for preventing HIV acquisition, but PrEP efficacy is highly dependent on drug adherence. In several trials and
implementation studies, PrEP clients have difficulties maintaining adequate adherence and persistence, and
monitoring their PrEP use is challenging. PrEP providers have relied on self-reported adherence, which is often
inaccurate and unreliable. The lack of an objective PrEP adherence monitoring tool has led to inefficient
counseling and poor supportive care. To address these issues, we completed a randomized pharmacokinetic
study to determine drug levels during controlled directly-observed PrEP. Longer-term metabolites, such as
tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) (~17-day half-life), provide a more accurate picture of long-term PrEP
adherence. We recently developed a novel enzymatic assay that semi-quantitatively measures the concentration
of TFV-DP by measuring inhibition of reverse transcriptase, which is the cellular target of oral PrEP drugs. In this
proposal, our primary objectives are optimizing the REverSe TRanscrIptase Chain Termination (RESTRICT)
assay to measure drug concentrations of PrEP clients, to establish validation for CLIA criteria when implemented
in a near-patient clinical lab, and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using the RESTRICT assay for
drug level measurement among PrEP clients and providers. We will test our central hypotheses with three
specific aims: (1) to calibrate and optimize the RESTRICT assay for measuring long-term TFV-DP drug
concentrations, compared to gold-standard liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
measurement; (2) to validate the RESTRICT assay for meeting established CLIA criteria to enable clinical
reporting of an objective near-patient measure for monitoring long-term TFV-DP drug concentrations; (3) to
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of near-patient TFV-DP testing among PrEP clients and providers at a
major PrEP clinic in Seattle. Our proposed study will be the first to validate a rapid, near-patient long-term
objective measure of oral PrEP adherence. This study will also provide crucial data on the feasibility and
acceptability of a novel approach for improving PrEP delivery and monitoring to prevent HIV transmission. The
results of this study will develop a new tool that may help improve PrEP delivery in the US and worldwide."
10907702,"Project summary
 Caveolin-1 (Cav1), traditionally viewed as the signature protein of caveolae membrane domains, plays
crucial roles in blood-retinal barrier integrity and retinal inflammation. Gene variants in Cav1 are associated
with risk of primary open angle glaucoma and Cav1 protein expression is upregulated in uveitic retinas and in
models of diabetic retinopathy. We have found that Cav-1 and caveolae play important roles in blood-retinal
barrier (BRB) and inflammation-induced cytokine release. Intriguingly, ablation of Cav1 only from the
neuroretinal compartment (Müller glia and neurons) suppresses cytokine release and immune cell influx
following inflammatory and neurodegenerative insult. As Cav1 is upregulated in several retinal inflammatory
conditions, we hypothesize that local manipulation of Cav1 function presents a viable therapy to suppress
retinal inflammatory stress. Given that current steroid-based therapies for retinal inflammatory disease are not
completely effective and fraught with potentially severe side effects, we hypothesize that Cav1 represents a
novel therapeutic target to suppress retinal inflammation. Thus, it is crucial to understand the function of this
protein in the context of the retinal stress adaptation response. We have made the exciting observation that
Cav1 in Müller glial cells of the neural retina does not reside within traditional, morphologically-identifiable
caveolae. This is because differentiated Müller glia do not normally express significant levels of Cavin1 which,
via interaction with Cav1, is necessary to form caveolae. In all tissues studied to date, loss of Cavin1 results in
coincident loss of Cav1 protein stability. However, in Müller glia, Cav1 is stably expressed (outside of
caveolae) in the absence of Cavin1. This provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of non-caveolar
Cav1 in an organ in which Cav1 is associated with human disease. We hypothesize that this non-caveolar
localization is crucial to Cav1’s ability to promote secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. In
this proposal, we will test this novel concept in Müller glia in culture and in vivo by inducing the expression of
Cavin1 to sequester Cav1 within caveolae. We will also take advantage of the unusually stable expression of
Cav1 outside of caveolae to examine the composition of the non-caveolae Cav1 domain (called herein “Cav1
scaffolds”) and to identify the mechanism by which Cav1 is stably expressed without Cavin1. These goals have

10725154,"The goal of the proposed research is to identify mechanisms that regulate neutrophilic lung
inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a novel severe asthma. New therapeutic targets
are critically needed for non-type 2 or neutrophilic severe asthma. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) drives group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to promote type 2 eosinophilic lung inflammation, but emerging evidence
suggests that significant ILC2 plasticity exists that allows a switch in phenotype to group 1 ILCs (ILC1s)
that promote type 1 inflammation. We have developed a novel innate severe asthma model with
neutrophilic inflammation, high corticosteroid-resistant AHR, ILC2 to ILC1 shift ,and elevated type 1 and
2 interferon levels. We hypothesize that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) regulates the
inflammatory and AHR responses in the model as well as drives ILC plasticity towards an ILC1 phenotype.
We will determine the role of STING in AHR and neutrophilic inflammation in wild type and STING
knockout mice as well as in wild type mice receiving STING antagonists. Further, we will assess co-
blockade of STING and IL-33 as a therapeutic strategy in the model and use adoptive transfer studies to
investigate ILC2 plasticity and the role of ILCs in the severe asthma model phenotype. We will also
identify the cellular sources of STING, including potential novel contributions from ILC expression of
STING. Additionally, we will assess whether type 1 and/or type 2 interferon receptors and STAT1 are
required for features of severe asthma in the model. Finally, we will use human lung and peripheral blood
samples to determine the translational impact of STING in ILC plasticity and evaluate expression levels
of STING-related pathway transcripts in samples from asthmatics and controls. As novel treatments are
needed for severe non-type 2 asthma in Veterans, these studies support STING as a potential candidate
in driving neutrophilic lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a severe asthma."
10725113,"Abstract:
Glomerular disease such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are
the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. The treatment options of both diseased are very limited. Through
proteomic analysis of glomeruli in diabetic rats, we identified protein S (PS) as a highly regulated protein in early
DKD. PS is known to bind to TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer), which belong to a family of receptor tyrosine
kinases that mediates regulation of inflammation and cell survival. Individual TAM receptors appear to mediate
different functions. During last funding period, we found that PS protects podocytes from injury in early DKD and
FSGS through the effects mediated by Tyro3. These findings are included in two recent papers [Zhong F JASN
2018] [Zhong F JCI Insights 2018] and the key findings from the paper include: 1) In human kidney, we found
that Tyro3 is expressed mostly in podocytes. Glomerular Tyro3 expression is reduced in DKD and FSGS and
positively correlates with eGFR in DKD patients. In addition, low glomerular Tyro3 mRNA levels predicts the
progression of primary glomerular disease in the NUPTUNE study. These findings highlight the importance of
Tyro3 in human glomerular disease. 2) In cultured human podocytes, PS has anti-inflammatory effects through
inhibition of NF-KB activation and anti-apoptotic effects through induction of AKT phosphorylation. Tyro3, but not
Axl and Mer, mediates these protective effects of PS in podocytes. 3) Knockout of PS in podocytes aggravates
DKD while overexpression of PS attenuated it. 4) Morfolino-mediated knockdown of tyro3 led to altered
glomerular filtration barrier development in zebrafish larvae. 5) Tyro3 knockout mice developed more DKD and
Adriamycin-induced nephropathy (ADRN) while induction of Tyro3 expression in podocytes attenuated DKD,
ADRN, and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Together, these findings suggest that PS-Tyro3 is a key renal
protective pathway against podocyte injury in both DKD and FSGS. Since PS could not be used as a drug due
to its effect on coagulation, we propose here to develop new agonists of Tyro3 as potential drugs to treat DKD
and FSGS. To address this, we propose in the aim 1 to determine the specificity of Tyro3 in comparison to Axl
and Mer on the ligand-receptor interaction and the activation of downstream pathways in podocytes. These
studies will help us to design specific agonists for Tyro3. Since Tyro3 could be cleaved into soluble Tyro3
(sTyro3) which serves as a decoy receptor and the levels of sTyro3 increase in DKD patients, we will determine
the mechanism of Tyro3 cleavage and the role of sTyro3 in regulation of inflammation and podocyte apoptosis
in diabetic condition. These studies will help us to determine whether inhibition of Tyro3 cleavage could be
another approach to enhance Tyro3-mediated renal protective pathway in glomerular disease. In the aim 2, we
propose to develop Tyro3 agonists as drugs for treatment of DKD and FSGS. By using structure activity
relationship (SAR) studies of Tyro3 we have designed and synthesized 10 compounds as Tyro3 agonists. Based
on their biological activity we selected two potential hits (compound 8 and 10) to further determine the binding
activity and selectivity to Tyro3 and the biological activity in cultured human podocytes and the renal-protective
effects in mice with DKD and ADRN. Finally, we will refine the structure of hit compounds to develop the lead
compound to increase potency, solubility, bioavailability, and decrease toxicity for treatment of DKD and FSGS."

The uterine circulation and placenta are specifically designed to regulate the flow of blood and transport of es-
sential nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of maternal hemodynamic regulation during pregnancy can adversely
impact fetal health, resulting in miscarriage and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current treatment op-
tions for IUGR patients are extremely limited, focusing primarily on early delivery; thus, putting the mother and
child at risk for complications associated with preterm birth. Epidemiological studies indicate that pregnant
women exposed to fine particulate matter (PM) have a heightened risk of fetal loss and development of IUGR.
We have reproduced this phenomenon in laboratory rodent models, wherein animals exposed to nanosized
titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) aerosols develop IUGR and suffer a greater number of ‘miscarriages’ (fetal
reabsorptions). We have demonstrated that acute and chronic exposures significantly impair uterine vascular
endothelium-dependent dilation, severely limiting maternal-to-fetal blood flow and impacting fetal growth. An
understanding of the mechanisms underlying dysregulation in uterine and placental blood flow is critical for
developing treatments and reducing IUGR. Based on previous findings, we hypothesize that maternal
inhalation of nano-TiO2 aerosols during pregnancy promotes the development of IUGR by disrupting
endothelium-dependent NO and AA signaling cascades, resulting in reduced uterine vasodilation and
blood flow. Moreover, folic acid (FA) supplementation will rescue this utero-placental hemodynamic
imbalance and prevent IUGR through its action in NO signaling. Using novel approaches and methodolo-
gies, these studies will: (1) evaluate uterine nitric oxide-driven vasodilation, (2) determine whether alterations in
arachidonic acid metabolism impair uterine vascular reactivity and impact placental perfusion, and (3) assess
the therapeutic benefit of dietary folic acid supplementation to improve utero-placental blood flow and attenuate
the development of IUGR after maternal exposure to nano-TiO2 aerosols. These studies are conceptually
innovative as we will utilize our unique resources to identify mechanistic targets within the utero-placental mi-
crocirculation and test directed nutritional interventions for IUGR. This work is technically innovative as we will
use novel methodologies developed for the evaluation of environmental toxicity in maternal-fetal medicine.
Overall, the successful completion of these studies will: (1) create the conceptual framework to identify
environmental exposure as a risk factor for the development of IUGR; (2) reveal new mechanistic insight into
the vascular pathogenesis resulting from nanomaterial exposure; (3) provide a molecular basis to identify how
nanomaterial exposure manifests as vascular disruptions; and (4) identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic
strategies to ameliorate microvascular dysfunction and improve utero-placental blood flow. These intervention-
al strategies are not only limited to PM, but are widely applicable to understanding the role of a spectrum of
environmental toxicants in the pathophysiological development of IUGR."
10730546,"Food allergy affects up to 10% of the US population, and peanut is one of the most common food
allergens, often leading to persistent IgE-mediated food allergy. Only a subset of patients with food allergy
develop clinical tolerance after oral immunotherapy (OIT), while most only have transient benefit. We and
others have shown that serum IgG antibodies to peanut allergens suppress basophil activation, which is a
biomarker of tolerance in OIT. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of long-term tolerance in OIT, we still need
to understand how these peanut-specific IgG antibodies contribute to clinical protection on a clonal level.
 Our long-term goal to develop new antibody-based treatments for IgE-mediated food allergies depend
on elucidating the underlying antibody-mediated mechanism of long-term tolerance induced by OIT. During
OIT, peanut-specific IgG antibodies are induced and can inhibit effector cells, such as mast cells or basophils.
in vitro, these IgG antibodies can prevent allergen effector cell activation by both blocking IgE from being
cross-linked by allergen and binding to inhibitory receptors. Our previous work focused on Ara h 2, which is the
most immunodominant and clinically relevant peanut allergen. In that study, suppression of Ara h 2 stimulated
basophils was a biomarker of tolerance while the concentration of Ara h 2 specific IgG, was not. Therefore, we
hypothesize that tolerance after OIT results from the induction of uniquely protective IgG clones rather than the
general increase in allergen-specific IgG. These protective antibodies effectively prevent IgE-mediated
reactions.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that protective antibodies share unique structural
characteristics that allow them to bind to critical epitopes of Ara h 2 with competitive fitness and that epitope-
specific protective antibodies can functionally suppress allergen-specific IgE from a diverse set of patients. Our
approach involves using recombinant antibodies cloned from single antigen-specific B cells isolated from
individuals with or without tolerance after OIT. We are uniquely positioned to conduct this study in that we have
expertise in affinity-selection of antigen-specific B cells, recombinant antibody cloning, and antibody
characterization from a unique patient cohort. We will address our hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1)
Define Ara h 2 binding characteristics of protective allergen-specific IgG antibodies in tolerance; and (2)
Identify functionally suppressive allergen-specific IgG antibodies in tolerance.
 We anticipate that the proposed studies will elucidate the connection between long-lasting clinical
efficacy of OIT on a clonal level with protective antibodies, highlighting the critical role of specific clones in
conferring long-term tolerance in food allergy. This work will lead to new strategies for the treatment of food
allergies."
10830241,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is increasing evidence that men who have sex with men (MSM) experience dual epidemics of HIV and
intimate partner violence (IPV), yet understanding of the synergies between these two epidemics is
underdeveloped. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) continue to be the risk group
most severely affected by HIV in the United States. In parallel, estimated prevalence for receipt of IPV among
MSM range from 12% to 78%. Emergent evidences demonstrates associations between the experience of IPV
among MSM and the risk of HIV acquisition or participation in risk behaviors that heighten the risk of HIV (i.e.
substance use), but the relationship between the experience of IPV for MSM living with HIV and HIV clinical
care is less understood. The overwhelming majority of evidence linking IPV and sub-optimal HIV care comes
from studies of heterosexual women. A recent meta-analysis showed that women's experience of IPV was
associated with 55% lower odds of self-reported adherence and 36% decreased odds of viral suppression. The
four studies that have looked at associations between clinical care and IPV for men living with HIV have all been
hampered by methodological limitations: cross-sectional study designs with clinic-based populations that limit
the ability to draw conclusions as to how IPV affects engagement in HIV care for partnered men living with HIV.
We propose an innovative 24-month cohort study of HIV-positive MSM, coupled with nested qualitative data, to
identify the pathways and points of intervention between IPV and HIV care for US MSM. The proposed research
activities include a prospective 24-month cohort of 300 HIV-positive partnered MSM (>18 years) recruited
through a combination of online and venue-based recruitment methods in Atlanta, GA and Detroit, MI. The
cohort study will employ a measure of IPV developed specifically to capture IPV as experienced by MSM, and
will consider the experience of IPV (victimization, perpetration and bidirectional IPV), and severity and
frequency of IPV as drivers of engagement in HIV care. Biomarkers of viral load and adherence to ARV will be
collected from all participants. The overall aim of the proposed activities is to provide new knowledge of how
victimization or perpetration of IPV shapes engagement in HIV care and is associated with the ability to achieve
and maintain viral suppression."

secretion from the pancreatic β-cells. Diabetes affects approximately 20% of the Veterans that receive
health care through the Veterans Health Administration. Therefore, efforts to understand the
pathophysiology of this debilitating disease are highly relevant to future developments in care and
therapeutics of this disease. The PI has been conducting diabetes research for nearly 30 years. His
current investigations are aimed at understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
β-cell dysfunction leading to the onset of diabetes. Seminal contributions from his laboratory have
defined novel roles for Rac1, a small G-protein, in the pathogenesis of islet β-cell dysfunction under
metabolic stress and diabetic conditions. His current studies are based on the hypothesis that
metabolic stress promotes functional and transcriptional activation of Rac1 to promote intracellular
oxidative stress, mitochondrial and nuclear damage/ collapse leading to the loss of functional β-cell
mass. His team is also aiming to identify key signaling proteins/factors in the Rac1 activation-
deactivation cycle that might contribute to the metabolic and functional defects in the pancreatic β-cell.
These studies employ state-of-the art microscopic, molecular biological, proteomics and lipidomics
approaches involving islets derived from animal models of impaired insulin secretion as well as islets
from T2D human donors.
In addition to his ongoing investigations (above), during the next renewal period, the PI will continue
collaborative studies toward the development of novel small molecule and peptide-based inhibitors for
halting metabolic defects of the islet β-cell in in vitro and in vivo models of metabolic stress and
diabetes. The long-standing expertise of the PI and his collaborators in this field will provide a unique
opportunity to address these important aspects of islet function in health and diabetes. Furthermore,
the PI will continue his ongoing, highly productive, collaborative studies to decipher the molecular and
cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Lastly, the PI proposes to
establish new collaborations with researchers at the JDD VAMC to assess islet β-cell function in
animal models of TBI and PTSD. Significant knowledge gaps exist in this area, which is highly
relevant to the VA healthcare mission. Collectively, data accrued from these complementary
investigations will provide actionable insights that will impact the prevention and treatment of diabetes
and its associated complications in humans, including our Veterans.
In support of the proposed investigations, the PI has already established numerous collaborations
with VA and non-VA investigators. He is highly productive with a large number of publications in high
impact journals; the majority of which are coauthored by his trainees and collaborators. He wrote
authoritative reviews on these topics in leading journals including Endocrine Reviews, Diabetes,
Obesity and Metabolism, and Comprehensive Physiology. In summary, this application seeks renewal
of Dr. Kowluru’s a well-established and highly recognized SRCS program for studies on

10725151,"TBI is a major cause of disability and a significant burden to health care costs in the US. TBI management
lacks effective pharmacological treatment. Neuroinflammation is a component of secondary injury that can
worsen brain injury, and it progresses over time, thus allowing opportunities to pharmacologically intervene. The
goal of this project is to better understand a novel microglia subset in TBI, and determine whether it is a cellular
mechanism driving pathology in TBI. We hope that knowledge of microglia heterogeneity will lead to more
effective and precise therapeutic approaches or help identify biomarkers for TBI. Our vision is to target
inflammatory microglia subsets to block harmful responses, while allowing neuroprotective microglia to promote
wound repair.
 We used the unbiased approach of single-cell RNA sequencing to identify several microglia subsets
induced by acute, sub-acute, and chronic TBI in mice. The gene expression profile Irf7hi microglia significantly
express RNA of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) indicating that they are responding to type I IFNs,
such as IFN. It has been shown the type I IFN pathway is harmful in TBI. However, the mechanisms, cells, or
subsets of cells mediating this pathway have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the Irf7hi microglia subset
worsens TBI, and that dampening of IFNAR1 in microglia by genetic and pharmacological targeting will reduce
the activation of this microglia subset and improve TBI.
 The type I IFN response is relevant to civilian TBI as IFN is significantly upregulated in the plasma of
human patients within 6 hours post-TBI. We will test whether the mechanism of the type I IFN-mediated pathway
mediating detrimental effects in mice is due to Irf7hi microglia. In our first aim, we propose to investigate the
temporal dynamics and spatial localization of Irf7hi microglia to determine its persistence and progression during
acute, sub-acute, and chronic TBI by histology and single-cell RNA seq. Sex differences in the response to TBI
will be examined by high-throughput multiplexing approaches. In our second aim, we will test the impact of
conditionally targeting IFNAR1 and possibly STING in microglia. Inflammation, histopathology, and behavior
post-TBI will be evaluated. Our third aim will employ a new approach of therapy for TBI by using antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to knock down IFNAR1 or IRF7 gene expression. We will test the capacity of
these ASOs to improve TBI in a preclinical study.
 Studies of microglia subsets will be reciprocally informative across neuroinflammatory diseases. This
proposal is mechanistic, and translationally relevant to the clinic. Elucidation of critical innate immune cell
subsets during neuroinflammation will advance TBI and neuroscience research."
10732258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Environmental contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is a major public health concern
because of the wide range of toxic effects that have been associated with exposure to these persistent chemicals.
Due to the strong stability of the C-F bond, very few microorganisms have been found capable of degrading
PFASs, and the biodegradation is very slow and incomplete. Often, bioremediation efforts result in the formation
of shorter chain PFASs that remain toxic, persistent, and highly mobile in the environment. Current abiotic
treatment technologies can be more effective, but have very high energy requirements. Therefore, this research
proposes an innovative remediation strategy that couples a pre-treatment step using catalytic hybrid
nanomaterials with biodegradation using enriched microbial communities to achieve more efficient and complete
destruction of PFASs without the formation of toxic by-products. Multifunctional reduced graphene oxide-metallic
nanohybrids (e.g. rGO-nZVI-TiO2) that are capable of catalyzing defluorination and oxidation of PFASs will be
synthesized and characterized for their efficiencies in converting highly stable PFASs to more biodegradable
forms. Pure cultures (e.g. Dehalococcoides sp. and Dehalobacter sp.) and enriched microbial consortia collected
from PFAS-contaminated sites and anaerobic wastewater treatment plants will be used to degrade different
types of PFASs and measure their removal efficacy. Using metagenomic and transcriptomic tools, the
microorganisms responsible for degradation, their functional characteristics, and the genes being transcribed
during defluorination will be identified. By-products formed at each step of the pre-treatment reaction, and during
the course of the microbial degradation of PFASs will be characterized using liquid chromatography with high-
resolution mass spectrometry, 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ion chromatography to obtain
information on the identities of PFASs transformation products, degradation kinetics, and mass balance.
Molecular modeling will be used to bring mechanistic insight into specific PFAS-surface and PFAS-enzyme
interactions. The effect of the structural features of PFASs (i.e. branching, chain-length, type of head groups) on
their biodegradability will be systematically evaluated, first by molecular modeling, and then by experimental
validation. Knowledge from the chemical characterization of PFASs degradation by-products combined with in
silico site-directed mutagenesis will facilitate the tuning of enzymatic activities and discovery of novel bacteria
that are efficient degraders of PFASs from the natural environment. These insights will guide the systematic
design of highly efficient nano-enhanced bioremediation systems for complete microbial degradation of PFASs."
10515651,"Circadian clock disruption: A risk factor for environmental carcinogenesis
Abstract/Summary
 Circadian clocks respond to environmental time cues to coordinate 24-hour rhythmicity in gene
expression and biological processes in virtually all cells of the body. According to the US Department of Labor,
~15-20% of Americans are engaged in rotating shift work, and the resulting altered timing of wake/sleep
disrupts their endogenous circadian clock. Epidemiological studies have concluded that individuals who
perform long-term rotating shift work suffer from an increased risk of several cancer types, including skin
cancers. Skin cancer is the most common malignancy and its incidence is increasing dramatically in the U.S.
Among the contributing factors, exposure to solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is the major risk factor (up to
90%) for malignant transformation of skin cells and skin cancer development. In humans and mice, nucleotide
excision repair (NER) removes genetic damage caused by UVB. Therefore, protection from UVB exposure and
ensuring efficient NER capacity are critical for maintenance of genomic stability and prevention of skin cancer.
Previous studies using genetic mouse models have shown that the circadian clock regulates several tumor
suppressing pathways, including NER, that are critical for preserving genomic stability and protection against
environmental carcinogenesis. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how circadian disruption
associated with rotating shift work leads to environmental carcinogenesis and in the underlying molecular
mechanisms that influence disease progression in humans. This lack of knowledge is an important roadblock
because it highlights the need for mechanistic insight into malignant transformation and represents a barrier to
predicting the severity of disease outcomes in shift workers. The overall objectives of this project are to identify
and characterize early stage carcinogenesis mechanisms and consequences of circadian disruption in UVB-
induced skin carcinogenesis. Our central hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, is that circadian disruption
undermines DNA repair capacity, inflammatory responses, and other genotoxic stress-related cellular
pathways that underlie the carcinogenicity of shift work. Our studies use circadian synchronized skin cells in
vitro, circadian-disrupted and skin carcinogenesis-prone SKH-1 genetic mouse models in vivo, and skin
samples from human subjects in vivo. In Aim 1, we will determine how the circadian rhythm impacts solar UVB
radiation-mediated DNA damage responses including DNA repair and inflammatory responses. The
experiments described in Aim 2 will examine how clock disruption by rotating shift work influences circadian
rhythmicity and NER. In Aim 3, we will characterize how rotating shift work and genetic disruption of the
circadian clock influence skin cancer initiation and progression. Collectively, the outcomes from these studies
will provide a molecular roadmap of circadian disruption in UVB radiation-mediated genomic instability and
carcinogenesis and will lead to the identification of novel mechanisms that can be applied toward disease
prevention in individuals with abnormal circadian function."
10733419,"Project Summary
In the cerebral cortex, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons are the major source of inhibition.
Interneuron dysfunction is strongly associated with autism and childhood epilepsy. We demonstrated that
environmental influences such as electrical activity are fundamental for the maturation of GABAergic circuits.
However, the identity of the activity patterns controlling interneuron development remains poorly understood.
The long-term goal of this research is to uncover how early interneuron dysfunction leads to lasting
neuropathologies. The objective of this proposal is to reveal the signaling pathways underlying activity-
dependent development and to assess how perturbations in this process lead to aberrant brain function.
To this end, we will use the murine barrel cortex as a well-established model for the study of activity-dependent
circuit maturation. We will focus our studies in cortical interneurons since our previous work indicates that
these neurons are exquisitely sensitive to environmental perturbations in the neonate. In the near term, this
proposal is aimed at investigating the role of specific interneuron subtypes in regulating the emergence of early
activity patterns (Aim 1). In addition, this project will determine the calcium-dependent signaling pathways for
the functional maturation of interneuron networks. We will study the role of Cacna1c, a gene encoding for the
Cav1.2 subunit of L-type calcium channels. Mutations in this gene are strongly associated with Timothy
syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess how developmental defects
in interneuron number lead to abnormal brain activity during development and impaired behavior in the adult
(Aim 3).
With respect to the outcomes, our work is expected to identify basic mechanisms fundamental for the
emergency of a healthy balance in the number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In addition, these results
are expected to have a significant translational impact because they will expand our mechanistic knowledge on
how mutations in the CACNA1C gene, strongly associated with autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and
Timothy syndrome, may lead to behavioral abnormalities frequently observed in these patients."
10815803,"This application for the Center for Structural Biology of HIV RNA (CRNA) focuses on determining the structural
and mechanistic bases of HIV-1 RNA-related replication functions and the host’s response at the cellular, viral,
and atomic levels. Although considerable progress has been made over the past 40 years in understanding how
proteins function in HIV-1 replication, comparatively little is known about how HIV-1 RNA structures, dynamics,
trafficking, and interactions with proteins alternately enable or limit virus replication. The past decade has
provided transformative examples of the therapeutic use of RNA and RNA-targeted therapies, and recent
progress by members of the proposed team has begun to unlock structural and dynamic features of RNA
elements in HIV-1. Because HIV-1 RNA is exceptionally rich in biologic functions, the potential for RNA-targeted
approaches in the prevention, maintenance, and cure of HIV-1 disease is highly compelling. However, this
potential is limited by the general paucity of high-resolution structural information for RNA and protein-RNA
complexes, which reflects inherent challenges in using RNA as a subject for structural analysis and the
inadequacy of traditional biophysical approaches to address these challenges. The CRNA will face these
challenges for HIV-1 RNA with its multidisciplinary team of structural biologists, chemists, cell and computational
biologists, biochemists, immunologists, and virologists. Many are leaders in the study of HIV-1 RNA and the
roles of its structures in virus replication, while others are new to the HIV-1 field and bring a fresh perspective
and complementary expertise. Together, this team brings cutting edge technologies and incisive biologic
approaches to overcome current technological obstacles, enabling mechanistic determination of the role of HIV-
1 RNA structures and associated proteins in viral transcription, splicing, translation, packaging, particle
assembly, and interactions with host factors. These studies will enable the CRNA to advance goals of clinical
relevance, including the development new RNA-centered strategies for treating HIV-1, the reactivation of latent
proviruses as a potential approach for eradicating HIV-1 infection, and the augmentation of host defenses against
HIV-1 infection. The proposed studies will also result in the development of powerful new computational, imaging,
and structural biology technologies that can be applied to all areas of RNA biology."
10516077,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Halogenated compounds, including legacy pollutants (e.g., chlorinated ethenes
(CEs), polychlorinated biphenyls) and emerging contaminants (e.g., 1,2,3-trichloropropane), are frequently en-
countered at Superfund sites. A common bioremediation strategy for halogenated pollutants in groundwater
and sediments is anaerobic reductive dehalogenation by organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB). Although
effective, OHRB-driven bioremediation strategies are often incomplete in field applications. An emerging reme-
diation strategy involving amendment of pyrogenic carbonaceous matter (PCM; e.g., activated carbon (AC)) to
the subsurface offers a potential solution to problems with OHRB-driven bioremediation. Recent research high-
lights the potential for PCM to promote synergistic interactions among OHRB and the auxiliary microbial com-
munity and subsequently improve OHRB-driven bioremediation efficacy. However, the underlying mechanisms
of how PCM properties best support microbial network interactions, and thereby enhance OHRB performance
and contaminant biodegradation remain unknown. These unknowns limit our ability to optimize OHRB perfor-
mance in bioremediation strategies where PCM is used. This proposal is aimed at closing the knowledge gap
concerning specific surface effects of PCM on the performance of pollutant-degrading microorganisms, espe-
cially OHRB. The central hypothesis is that key PCM properties will shape microbial community structure and
drive the expression of metabolic functions associated with reductive dehalogenation processes. Elucidat-
ing positive impacts between PCM and OHRB will allow for the development of tailored PCM that foster syner-
gistic microbial network interactions and facilitate more effective and sustainable bioremediation. The hypothe-
sis is based on preliminary data showing that OHRB-driven CE biotransformation performance was improved
in the presence of biochar, OHRB were attached to carbon surfaces, and that PCM-like tunable polymer net-
works can be successfully synthesized. Guided by these preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis by 1)
providing a tunable platform for synthesis of PCM-like polymer membranes where surface charge and redox-
active properties are varied individually, 2) quantifying the effects of PCM surface properties on microbial net-
work interactions and subsequent performance of an organohalide-respiring mixed culture and, 3) developing
tailored PCM for enhanced anaerobic bioremediation and contaminant mixture retention and validating material
performance in microcosms. The proposed research is innovative because we will use a tunable platform to
change material surface properties and employ advanced molecular microbial ecology tools to assess the im-
pacts of these properties on microbial community structure, function, and activity including OHRB. Outcomes
of this project will benefit human health and realize economic benefits by reducing human exposure to halo-
genated pollutants in the environment and demonstrating the potential for more effective and sustainable re-
mediation approaches that combine tailored PCM and OHRB."

 One of the major pathophysiological characteristics of hypertension is the presence of vascular
remodeling. Accordingly, it has been shown that 100% hypertensive subjects present small artery remodeling.
However, there is a gap in the literature in understanding the exact trigger that leads to vascular remodeling, and
this may limit our ability to adequately treat and prevent hypertension.
 Recent evidence implicates immune mechanisms in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Formyl peptide
receptor (FPR)-1 is a pattern recognition receptor which plays a crucial role in the function of the innate immune
system. In fact, one of the most powerful signaling pathways that induces actin polymerization and neutrophil
movement is mediated by FPR-1. Recently, we observed that this receptor is expressed in arteries. Therefore,
we questioned why a receptor that is crucial for immune defense and cell motility in leukocytes, would be
expressed and functional in arteries? We observed that activation of FPR-1 in arteries is important for the
temporal reorganization of actin, which rapidly induces actin polymerization.
 FPR-1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that can bind N-formyl peptides produced by bacterial
degradation. Interestingly, mitochondria carry hallmarks of their bacterial ancestry. Consequently, both
mitochondrial and bacterial-derived peptides have a formyl group at their N-terminus. Therefore, N-formyl
peptides (NFPs), regardless of origin, are recognized by FPR-1 as pathogens and thus play a role in the initiation
of inflammation. Here, we observed for the first time that NFPs are present in the circulation of hypertensive
animals and humans. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that synergistic action of leaky gut-derived bacteria
NFPs and cell damage-derived mitochondria NFPs lead to FPR-1 activation. Consequently, FPR-1 activation
maybe the trigger to induce vascular remodeling, via actin polymerization, and subsequently, hypertension.
 This planned research is uniquely suited to the NHLBI Early Stage Investigator (ESI)-Research Project
Grant (R01). It is innovative and has a strong, translational and multi-disciplinary research team of collaborators
that have the capabilities and expertise to make this project successful. As an independent ESI, my short-term
goal is to use state-of-art approaches, including culture-pressure myographs, genetic-engineering technologies,
and arteries from humans and animals to explore a major driving force behind vascular-immune network
dysfunction in hypertension."
10760256,"Project summary description
 Influenza virus infections affect millions of people worldwide every year and cause serious mortality.
Current treatment options are limited to viral strain-specific vaccination and are problematic due to antiviral drug
resistance. There is an urgent need to identify novel host innate immune mechanisms providing broad range
protection against influenza. Bronchial epithelial cells orchestrate an oxidative extracellular antimicrobial system
present in the airway surface liquid consisting of the protein lactoperoxidase (LPO), the thiocyanate anion (SCN-
) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). LPO oxidizes SCN- using H2O2 into hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) that has known in
vitro antiviral effects. Dual oxidase 1 (Duox1), an NADPH oxidase highly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells,
is the H2O2 source for the system. Our long-term goal is to determine whether the Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN-
antiviral system could be manipulated in influenza infection for therapeutic purposes in human patients. The
objective of this proposal is to determine and characterize the antiviral role of Duox1 and LPO against influenza
in multiple experimental systems. Our preliminary data show that 1) primary bronchial epithelial cells inactivate
several influenza viruses in an Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN- -dependent manner, 2) Duox1-deficient mice have
increased mortality and morbidity, impaired viral clearance and leukocyte recruitment following influenza
infection in vivo, and 3) the in vitro influenza-inactivating effect of this mechanism can be enhanced to inhibit
influenza infection. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that the Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN- system
attenuates influenza infection, both in vitro and in vivo, and can be boosted to fight influenza. The rationale for
the proposed research is that there is a need to better understand how powerful the antiviral Duox1/LPO-based
system is and how can it be manipulated for therapeutic purposes. The main hypothesis will be tested in cell-
free, airway epithelial and mouse model systems using a wide range of influenza strains. It is anticipated that
our aims will yield several impactful outcomes including 1) detailed description of the anti-influenza mechanism
of action of the Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN- system; 2) determination of the in vivo relevance of Duox1 in fighting a
wide range of influenza strains; and 3) exploring the therapeutic potential of the Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN- system
to improve influenza clearance and to diminish associated lung damage. Our innovative work shows that the
Duox1/H2O2/LPO/SCN- system inactivates influenza, and uses a Duox1-deficient mouse strain for in vivo studies.
The significance of the outlined work relies in establishing the relevance of a novel innate immune mechanism
of the airways that can be enhanced to attenuate influenza infections or applied in conjunction with influenza
vaccines to potentially enhance efficacy. In summary, our proposed work will have a positive impact in the fields
of airway epithelial biology and antiviral innate immune responses by identifying Duox1 and LPO, as novel,
crucial weapons of the bronchial epithelium against influenza."

Hypertension (HTN) and has become the largest driver of morbidity and mortality (M&M) worldwide, affecting
nearly 1 billion persons, the vast majority living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While clinical
research has identified highly-efficacious and inexpensive options to control HTN, rates of awareness,
treatment and control of HTN are abysmally low. Implementation strategies that can effectively reach and
engage patient populations while feasible within the constraints of frail health systems are urgently needed. In
Peru, less than 10% of those with HTN are optimally controlled and thus avoidable M&M continues to increase
at unacceptable levels. In the proposed ANDES strategy, we will study a vulnerable, impoverished indigenous
Andean population that has a high prevalence of HTN (18.5%) and T2D (7.4%); living at high altitude (similar
to ~140 million people worldwide–thus highly significant). The study has two phases: UG3/UH3. The formative
UG3 phase (24 months) will draw from two implementation strategies: a) health fairs (HFs) that draw an entire
community to an event using community mobilization and entertainment where HTN diagnoses can be rapidly
made and linked to care, and b) community health worker (CHW)-based multicomponent intervention to
overcome logistical and structural barriers to treatment. CHWs are used in LMIC for episodic conditions, but
adaptations are required to effectively address HTN. We draw from the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research to guide a formal adaptation process including using: a) key stakeholder qualitative
interviews, b) discrete choice experiments, and c) human centered design to re-shape the HFs and CHWs to
meet community needs and fit health system context. The UG3 phase will end with a 12-month pilot
intervention of HF and CHWs in two communities focusing on implementation outcomes. The UH3 phase will
test the adapted ANDES strategy in a cluster-randomized trial. We will enroll 1,608 individuals with HTN
(with/without type 2 diabetes, T2D), aged 55-89 years, from 24 clusters (67 subjects/cluster); all 24 clusters
receive the HFs, but 12 clusters will be randomized to a CHW-based multicomponent intervention (i.e., diet,
behavioral, medications) vs. usual care in the other 12 clusters. We will assess the implementation, service
delivery and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome is change in SBP at 12 months. Secondary outcomes
include proportion of subjects with controlled HTN (SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg) and controlled T2D
(HgbA1c<7%). We will also assess implementation fidelity and adaptations, engagement in care, costs and
early sustainability. We have assembled a strong research team from Peru and USA with a robust track record
of collaboration and expertise in HTN, implementation science and clinical trials, and have partnered with the
Peruvian Ministry of Health. We are uniquely positioned to advance the implementation science agenda to
address HTN in Peru, a major stakeholder for the scale-up phase. The pragmatic trial design will provide
rigorous and relevant evidence to inform national and global policies and subsequent intervention scaling-up."
10725120,"Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S., has one of the highest recurrence rates of all solid
cancers, and is the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death. Veterans are at increased risk for
bladder cancer due higher rates of tobacco use and environmental exposure. There are significant unmet needs
for biomarkers and molecular diagnostic tools to better inform decision making across all stages of bladder
cancer. For patients with early stage disease, current diagnostic approaches are either invasive (e.g. cystoscopy)
or lack sensitivity (e.g. urine cytology). We propose to develop molecular diagnostics that will lead to more
effective and personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with localized bladder cancer. Tumor-derived
nucleic acids in biological fluids such as urine represent promising biomarkers for non-invasive measurement of
disease burden and response to therapy. Previously, we developed a pipeline for bladder cancer biomarker
discovery, validation, and technology integration for clinical translation. We applied high throughput RNA
sequencing of urinary sediments as a biomarker discovery tool and identified a urinary mRNA (u-mRNA) panel
with promising diagnostic performance. In parallel, we validated an integrated microfluidics cartridge capable
of “sample-in, answer-out” within 90 minutes using a separate u-mRNA panel. Our recent preliminary data
indicate further improvement of diagnostic performance by combining the two panels within the integrated
cartridge. Based on these promising preliminary data, we propose three specific aims: 1) to validate the
optimized mRNA panel for bladder cancer surveillance and risk stratification; 2) to validate the optimized u-
mRNA panel to improve bladder cancer screening and assess risk stratification; and 3) to validate the optimized
u-mRNA panel for response assessment and monitoring in patients with high risk NMIBC treated with BCG
immunotherapy. Our team is led by experienced academic VA investigators with complimentary expertise in
molecular diagnostics (Liao), urologic oncology (Liao, Leppert), and clinical validation study design (Liao, Yu).
Successful completion of the studies proposed here will serve as a foundation for incorporating urine-based
biomarkers in bladder cancer surveillance and into prospective clinical trials to assess therapeutic interventions.
We foresee that our approach will allow personalization of treatment strategies to improve outcomes for BC
patients in both veterans and the general population."
10725149,"The applicant, Aliza Wingo, M.D., M.Sc., is a board-certified psychiatrist and principal investigator at the
Atlanta VA Medical Center. The first focus of Dr. Wingo’s research is to identify the genetic and molecular
contributors to psychological resilience, PTSD, and depression, respectively. She is keenly aware of the
complex relationships among these three facets of mental condition and also works to identify common and
distinct mechanisms among them. The second focus of Dr. Wingo’s work is to identify how resilience, PTSD,
and depression share common genetic and molecular basis with Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Through
studying psychological constructs, she aims to identify novel pathways for enhancing resilience, treating
PTSD/depression, and identifying novel causes of Alzheimer’s dementia that could be leveraged for new
therapies. This work is currently supported by a Merit Review award from the VA, an R01 from the NIA/NIH,
and a U01 from the NIMH/NIH.
 With regard to resilience, Dr. Wingo has shown that a genetic variant on chromosome 1 (rs322931) and
brain expression level of miR-181 contribute to resilience (Wingo et al, Molecular Psychiatry, 2016). Resilience
here is conceptualized as having high levels of positive emotions and/or sense of life purpose and meaning
after adverse or traumatic life experiences. In her current funded Merit Review, Dr. Wingo examines brain
microRNA profile to identify a microRNA signature of resilience. Next, she will use systems biology approach to
identify brain transcriptomic drivers of resilience using brain transcriptome. Finally, she will examine the
mRNAs and proteins that are downstream targets of the resilience-associated microRNAs with the overall goal
of identifying novel genes regulating resilience.
 Regarding PTSD and depression, Dr. Wingo has shown that DICER1 and microRNA regulation
pathway contributes to PTSD and depression (Wingo et al, Nature Communications, 2016). In this CDTA, Dr.
Wingo proposes to harness deep human brain proteomes quantified by mass spectrometry from post-mortem
brain tissues as a reference to impute brain protein expression level in Veterans who have genotyping. The
imputed protein expression profile is then used for a proteome-wide association study of PTSD and
depression, respectively, to identify proteins in the brain that predispose to PTSD or depression. In addition,
epidemiological studies have observed that offspring of pregnant women suffering from PTSD or depression
have higher risk for developing psychological or behavioral issues later in life. To investigate the mechanisms
behind this intergenerational association, Dr. Wingo has been funded by a U01 to examine offspring’s blood-
based transcriptome and global microRNA profile. These findings are highly relevant to female Veterans who
suffer higher risk for PTSD and depression.
 Regarding dementia, Dr. Wingo has shown that hundreds of proteins in human brain are altered with
cognitive decline in advanced age (Wingo et al, Nature Communications, 2019). Since large epidemiological
studies have observed that depression, especially late-life depression, increases the risk for dementia, Dr.
Wingo is funded by an R01 to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying detrimental effects of depression
and protective effects of life purpose on Alzheimer’s dementia risk using multi-omics data from post-mortem
brain tissues.
 Through studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the conditions that
disproportionally affect our Veterans – PTSD, depression, and Alzheimer’s dementia, Dr. Wingo hopes to
contribute to advancing our understanding of their etiologies to develop novel and effective interventions. As a
long-term goal, Dr. Wingo aspires to carry out novel and innovative research questions to make transformative
impact on the health and resilience of our Veterans."
10725116,"Veterans have more severe chronic pain than non-veteran patients and are reportedly twice as likely to die of
an opioid overdose in attempts to find relief. These consequences lie behind the critical need to determine brain
alterations causing chronification of pain that are too often progressing to the anxiety and depression responsible
for the increased suicide rate among our veterans. Better understanding of underlying mechanisms driving
chronic pain is imperative to development of more effective non-opioid treatment approaches for chronic pain.
During the currently funded VA Merit grant period, we performed manganese enhanced MRI (MEMRI) studies
using our experimental chronic neuropathic pain model. MEMRI allows visualization of neural activation in the
small rodent brain using a 7T Bruker MRI scanner. As in clinical fMRI studies, we identified specific limbic
emotional brain regions overactivated by chronic pain in addition to activation of the pain circuitry itself. It is
apparent in our Preliminary Data histological follow-up that ongoing cellular stress is occurring in limbic brain
circuitry. Due to the neuronal overactivation, pathophysiological alterations in limbic brain pain circuitry include
increased expression of cellular stress biomarkers and altered expression of protective autophagy biomarkers.
Autophagy is defined as the ongoing cellular protective mechanisms removing damaged and misfolded proteins
generated during cellular stress. Disrupted autophagy homeostasis that produces autophagic dysfunction
adversely affects cell function and eventually viability. The goal of the proposed studies is to examine whether
boosting cell protective autophagy mechanisms can not only reduce neuropathic pain chronification related
behaviors but can conceivably reduce the related brain pain circuitry neuropathology. Our studies performed at
8-10 weeks after induction in our chronic neuropathic pain model allows salient clinical relevance.
We will test whether cellular stress/autophagy mechanisms are related to the noradrenergic alpha 1 receptor
(NAα1R) signaling we identified as a primary chronic pain generator in the previous Merit grant funding period.
The NAα1R blocker we will test is the clinical therapeutic doxazosin that might also be used as PTSD therapy.
Doxazosin is longer lasting than the prazosin we tested in the same model in the previous grant period. Prazosin
reduced chronic pain and aversive anxiety and depression related behaviors we observed through the 10 week
time points (see Progress Report). We will test efficacy of doxazosin to reduce chronic neuropathic pain induced
mechanical hypersensitivity, and perform anxiety and depression related behavioral assays. Comparisons of the
efficacy of doxazosin can be made to prazosin and the effects of cellular stress inhibitors/autophagy enhancers.
We find based on our recently completed MEMRI study that overactivation in specific limbic cortical regions after
10 weeks of ongoing neuropathic pain results in altered cellular stress/autophagy biomarker expression that
accompanies the chronic pain related behaviors. The Aims proposed in this VA Merit renewal application include
identification/validation of the cellular stress/autophagy RNA/protein expression signature in the chronic pain
model at 10 weeks. Pilot efficacy testing of a cellular stress signaling pathway inhibitor and protective autophagy
promotor finds reversal of chronic pain behaviors. Enhancement of protective autophagy mechanisms as
defense against cellular stress and disrupted cellular homeostasis will be further demonstrated by quantifying
oxidative stress/autophagy RNA, proteins, and other neuropathology as readouts. Imaging the distribution of
inflammatory biomarker cathepsin B over time in live animals with whole body IVIS fluorescent infrared imaging
will be a readout of the inflammatory component in peripheral and central nervous system.
Completion of our assessment of the efficacy of these treatments to provide enhancement of protective
autophagy mechanisms during chronic pain as defense against cellular stress and chronic pain related behaviors
will increase the understanding of the chronification of neuropathic pain. Improved understanding will lead to
better non-opioid treatments for chronic pain that provide better outcomes for veterans living with chronic pain."
10729858,"ABSTRACT
Mechanical force is essential for T cell activation. It activates TCR signaling, and allows the T cell to sample
the quality of TCR-pMHC interactions. This greatly expands the dynamic range of TCR responses and permits
antigen discrimination during thymic selection, T cell priming, and effector responses. Our understanding of
how force influences TCR-pMHC interactions has advanced significantly, thanks to biophysical studies at the
single molecule level. However, there are large gaps in knowledge at the cell biological level. This project
seeks to identify the biochemical and mechanical circuits within the TCR signal transduction network that
permit the rapid translation of small differences in the physical characteristics of the TCR–pMHC interactions
into distinct cellular responses. During the first project period, we showed that the T cell actin network exerts
force on the integrin LFA-1 as well as the TCR, supporting mechanical crosstalk that influences the activation
of both molecules. Interestingly, this process is sensitive to the biophysical features of the stimulatory surface,
including ligand mobility and stiffness. These parameters are physiologically relevant, as they are regulated
during DC maturation to optimize T cell priming. Further analysis reveals that this mechanobiology also
impacts cytoplasmic signaling molecules that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. In particular, we find that T
cell stiffness responses involve phosphorylation of the stretch-sensitive adapter protein CasL. On the basis of
these findings, we hypothesize that TCR-induced actin polymerization allows the cell to sense biophysical cues
provided by the interacting APC, initiating mechanical feedback loops that modulate force-dependent signaling
of cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling molecules that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. To test
this hypothesis, we will carry out 3 specific aims. First, we will determine how ligand mobility influences actin
dynamics and TCR signaling. Using stimulatory glass coverslips, planar bilayers with different mobility
properties, and mixed mobility patterned surfaces, we will ask how the agonist strength and mobility of pMHC
complexes and integrin ligands influences actin dynamics and TCR signaling. As part of this analysis, we will
use TCR tension probes to define how altering the mobility of TCR and integrin ligands influences the forces
experienced by the TCR. Next, we will carry out similar studies to understand how substrate stiffness
influences T cell activation. We will stimulate T cells on hydrogels of varying stiffness, and analyze the effects
on actin dynamics, TCR tension, and TCR signaling events needed for full T cell activation. Finally, we will
investigate the role of CasL, a prototypic force-sensitive signaling intermediate. Using T cells lacking CasL, we
will study the function of CasL during T cell responses to changes in ligand mobility and substrate stiffness. In
addition, we will probe the signaling pathways leading to CasL phosphorylation during stiffness responses, and
use mass spectrometry to identify relevant binding partners."

This NIA Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development proposal will provide Dr. Cizginer with
critical skills in dissemination and implementation (D&I) science and support her development as an
independent researcher and leader in geriatric surgery. Her specific training goals include 1) gaining D&I
science and qualitative research expertise, 2) training in clinical trial design and mixed methods data
integration, and conducting a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial for evidence-based practices in geriatric
surgery, and 3) advanced leadership training. Older adults make up 40% of all inpatient surgeries, and those
patients experience twice the morbidity and mortality of younger patients. Given the projected exponential
increase in geriatric population, there is an urgency to make inpatient surgery safer. In response to this urgent
need, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Geriatric Surgery Verification (GSV) Program recently
introduced 30 evidence-based standards designed to systematically improve surgical care and outcomes.
However, there is a paucity of focused efforts to support the uptake of these standards into routine practice.
Thus, this proposal aims to address the knowledge gap regarding the optimal ways to disseminate and
implement the GSV program to improve outcomes of older surgical patients. This goal will be met in the
following aims: Aim 1 will identify the barriers and facilitators for enrollment to the ACS GSV program; Aim 2
will create implementation strategies and address barriers to GSV Program implementation; and Aim 3 will be
a pilot implementation trial in a local hospital to test the effectiveness of the strategies to overcome barriers for
GSV implementation, which will generate data to support an R01 proposal. Dr. Cizginer is uniquely qualified to
lead this effort as (1) she is the Medical Director of Geriatric Surgery at Brown and has experience
implementing and evaluating an integrated geriatric surgery model, (2) has previous clinical research
experience with over 20 peer-reviewed articles, (3) has formal training in epidemiology and health services
research and (4) lacks formal training and research experience in D&I science (new research interest).
Ultimately, this work will pave the way for Dr. Cizginer to launch her independent research career while
creating novel and valuable strategies to implement evidence-based practices into routine clinical practice for
geriatric surgery patients, reducing related health care costs and improving patient outcomes."
10924046,"This U19 proposal focuses on one of the most important, complex questions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD) research: What are the determinants and the nature of cognitive
impairment among persons with pre-diabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), who are a high-risk group for
cognitive impairment and represent a large fraction of the United States (US) population? Despite knowledge
that persons with PreD and T2D are a high-risk group for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and
dementia, the risk factors, mechanisms, and neuropathology of cognitive impairment in persons with PreD and
T2D remain unclear. Gaps in knowledge on cognitive impairment in PreD and T2D include: (a) the role of AD
and/or non-AD neuropathology beyond vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID); (b)
the role of glycemia, related metabolic factors such as hyperinsulinemia, and traditional micro and macrovascular
complications of PreD/T2D; (c) the role of glucose-lowering medications, primarily metformin; and (d) the role of
physical activity, physical function, and frailty, key in PreD and T2D. We propose 4 interrelated projects that will
address these gaps, leveraging the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcomes Study (DPPOS) cohort and
its detailed PreD/T2D phenotyping, adding state of the art AD/ADRD phenotyping. The DPPOS cohort currently
has a mean age of 72 years, with 76% over the age of 65. Thus, the cohort is in a period of the lifespan when
the development of cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia accelerates. This extensively phenotyped cohort

11162996,"This U19 proposal focuses on one of the most important, complex questions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD) research: What are the determinants and the nature of cognitive
impairment among persons with pre-diabetes (PreD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), who are a high-risk group for
cognitive impairment and represent a large fraction of the United States (US) population? Despite knowledge
that persons with PreD and T2D are a high-risk group for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and
dementia, the risk factors, mechanisms, and neuropathology of cognitive impairment in persons with PreD and
T2D remain unclear. Gaps in knowledge on cognitive impairment in PreD and T2D include: (a) the role of AD
and/or non-AD neuropathology beyond vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID); (b)
the role of glycemia, related metabolic factors such as hyperinsulinemia, and traditional micro and macrovascular
complications of PreD/T2D; (c) the role of glucose-lowering medications, primarily metformin; and (d) the role of
physical activity, physical function, and frailty, key in PreD and T2D. We propose 4 interrelated projects that will
address these gaps, leveraging the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcomes Study (DPPOS) cohort and
its detailed PreD/T2D phenotyping, adding state of the art AD/ADRD phenotyping. The DPPOS cohort currently
has a mean age of 72 years, with 76% over the age of 65. Thus, the cohort is in a period of the lifespan when
the development of cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia accelerates. This extensively phenotyped cohort
represents an estimated 50 million Americans. To address this proposal’s complex interrelated questions, we
will perform two waves of state-of-the-art AD/ADRD phenotyping during the proposed 5-year funding period,

Research Project: Dengue virus (DENV) is a medically important pathogen posing a major public health threat.
DENV infection can result in potentially fatal cases of severe dengue associated with vascular leak as a result
of endothelial dysfunction, but the triggers of these pathologies were unknown. We and others have defined a
direct role for the DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in mediating endothelial dysfunction in vitro and vascular
leak in vivo, independently from viral infection, via direct interactions with endothelial cells. Our preliminary data
indicate that NS1 binding to endothelial cells and uptake via clathrin-mediated endocytosis are distinct steps that
are both critical for NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction, but the NS1 receptors on endothelial cells that
mediate uptake of NS1 are unknown. My preliminary data identified a role for beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR)
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Further, activation of
β2AR has been reported to transactivate EGFR, triggering endocytosis. Thus, I hypothesize that β2AR and
EGFR serve as a NS1 receptor complex where NS1 functions as a β2AR agonist to trigger EGFR-
mediated endocytosis. This proposal will test this hypothesis by investigating the capacity of NS1 to activate
β2AR and EGFR signaling pathways in Aim 1. Aim 2 will investigate the capacity of β2AR and EGFR to serve
as NS1 receptors. The proposal holds the potential to characterize a fundamental and novel step in dengue virus
pathogenesis via identification of NS1 receptors which also serve as therapeutic targets for treatment of dengue.
Candidate and Career Goals: The candidate for this K22 proposal has a strong track record investigating host-
pathogen interactions from his work studying entry mechanisms of Nipah virus as an undergraduate student in
the labs of Dr. Benhur Lee and Dr. Hector Aguilar-Carreno at the University of California, Los Angeles,
investigating innate immune mechanisms by which interferons control viral infection as a graduate student in Dr.
Seungmin Hwang’s lab at the University of Chicago, and investigating flavivirus NS1-mediated pathogenesis as
a postdoctoral scholar in Dr. Eva Harris’s lab at the University of California, Berkeley. In Dr. Harris’s lab, Dr.
Biering recently identified candidate NS1 receptors on endothelial cells and will investigate their role in NS1
pathogenesis in this proposal. Dr. Biering is committed to establishing his own research group at a major
research university where he will investigate mechanisms by which viral pathogens cause disease.
Career Development Plans and Environment: Dr. Biering will work with his mentor (Dr. Eva Harris) and
mentoring committee (Dr. Britt Glaunsinger, Dr. Michael Diamond, Dr. Kamil Godula, Dr. Suzanne Fleiszig, and
Dr. P. Robert Beatty) to acquire additional training in biochemistry, advanced-microcopy, glycobiology, and in
vivo models of virus infection which will enhance his current research proposal and the research in his future
lab. This, coupled with the additional courses and trainings outlined in his training plan, will prepare Dr. Biering
for a successful transition to a primary investigator role able to prepare data for a competitive R01 proposal."

 This mentored career development award proposal will facilitate my career goal to become an
independent translational researcher using advances in experimental genomics and bioinformatics to develop
improved precision medicine therapies for children with difficult-to-cure cancers. During the 5-year training period
I plan to acquire critical skills in computational biology and pursue additional didactic training in transcriptional
regulation, death pathways, single cell analyses, and early-phase clinical trial design. The proposed studies and
training will be completed under the co-mentorship of Dr. Kai Tan and Dr. Sarah Tasian, both internationally
recognized leaders with complementary expertise in systems and single cell biology and in translational leukemia
research, respectively. My multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee is composed of world-renowned scientists who
have extensive mentoring experience and diverse expertise, including Drs. Chi Dang, Nancy Speck, John Maris,
and Xiaolu Yang. The scientific proposal is aimed at elucidating critical dependencies that synergize with kinase
pathway oncogene addiction in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a
kinase-driven leukemia with dismal outcomes. Ph-like ALL comprises 15-40% of childhood and adult ALL cases
and is associated with extremely high relapse rates and very poor overall survival. We observed in preclinical
Ph-like ALL models that treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib has incomplete efficacy and also resulted in
global gene expression changes. Thus, combination therapy approaches that effectively target key therapeutic
escape mechanisms are needed. Additionally, single-cell variability in Ph-like ALL that may drive targeted
therapy resistance is unknown. I hypothesize that ruxolitinib treatment in JAK/STAT pathway-altered Ph-like ALL
cells leads to rewiring of the gene regulatory network at transcriptional and epigenetic levels (likely mediated by
c-MYC), resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic priming amenable to co-targeting. I propose in Aim 1 to model
patient leukemia reponse to kinase inhibition in vivo and to identify transcriptional regulatory network changes
during chronic ruxolitinib treatment with subsequent functional validation. This represents an unbiased approach
to identifying unknown oncogenic dependencies. In Aim 2, I will use single-cell techniques to examine genetic
and non-genetic sub-populational changes during targeted drug perturbation over time, then to characterize and
target resistant cell states. These studies will form the basis for developing rational combinations of molecularly
targeted therapies to improve cure rates for patients with Ph-like ALL. In summary, I will benefit from the
exceptional interdisciplinary expertise and track-record of my mentors and Advisory Committee, as well as the
rich intellectual environment and scientific resources available at CHOP and Penn, which provide an ideal setting
in which to conduct cutting-edge omics analyses for eventual clinical translation. These research and training
efforts will help me realize my ultimate goal to translate “big data” into clinically relevant cures for children with
cancer."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and
liver cancer, and is a major public health issue worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 170 million people
globally. With no prophylactic HCV vaccine available, HCV remains difficult to eradicate. Newer generations of
Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAA) are effective in eliminating the virus in up to 95% of the patients, however, this
treatment remains out of reach for many individuals. Multiple HCV extrahepatic manifestations (EHM) have been
reported in patients with chronic HCV infection including chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, and sicca syndrome
indistinguishable from Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). Yet, the mechanisms of the xerostomia and salivary gland (SG)
hypofunction remain controversial. Thus, understanding the clinical aspects of HCV-associated xerostomia is of
interest to better assess and manage this symptom. The objectives of this project are to determine the
pathophysiologic changes in the minor salivary glands (MSG) and changes in saliva composition associated with
chronic HCV infection and correlate these changes with clinical features of SG hypofunction (mentored phase)
and to mechanistically describe the HCV-associated xerostomia (independent phase). To achieve this goal, Dr.
José Maldonado-Ortiz will work with a mentoring team including Dr. John Chiorini (primary mentor), Dr. Blake
Warner (co-mentor), Dr. Raj Gopalakrishnan (collaborator), Dr. Valeria De Giorgi (collaborator), and Nobel
laureate Dr. Harvey Alter (collaborator). In Aim 1, the pathophysiologic changes in the MSG of patients with
chronic HCV infection will be determined and correlated to xerostomia and clinical features of salivary
dysfunction in patients with and without complaints of xerostomia. In Aim 2, the effects of HCV DAA therapy in
salivary physiology will be determined and correlated to clinical features of xerostomia. To understand the
pathophysiology of chronic HCV-associated SG dysfunction (Aim 1), and the effects of DAA therapy in SG
function, MSG biopsies will be collected and used to provide histopathological evidence of SG damage/changes
and research tissues to perform RNAseq and scRNAseq, in addition to sialometry, sialochemistry, and
ultrasonography of the major SG. Dry mouth and oral health related quality of life instruments will be completed.
In Aim 3, the mechanisms of HCV induced salivary gland dysfunction will be determined in vivo. To this end, an
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the antigenic HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 will be
transferred into the submandibular SG of mice to 1) better understand the HCV/host immune cell interactions
and 2) tissue changes that may result in SG dysfunction. In combination, these studies will reveal new information
about viral infections and the triggering or initiation of SG diseases such as SS. HCV infection offers a unique
opportunity to study viral induced SG dysfunction and can provide mechanistic data on the role of viruses in
driving inflammation, dysfunction, and damage in the SG."

Insomnia, present among 15-25% of low-income adults and other overlapping socioeconomically
disadvantaged groups such as racial/ethnic minorities, is frequently undertreated, impairs quality of life, and is
associated with increased risk for depression, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. Our long-term
goal is to test the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments for insomnia for
socioeconomically disadvantaged adults who face insomnia care inequities. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for
insomnia (CBTI) is recommended as first-line treatment. However, CBTI’s real-world adoption is constrained
by a limited number of specialty-trained clinicians, treatment time, costs, and language barriers. Brief
behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) was developed to expand CBTI’s reach by reducing the time burden
(1.5 vs  6 hours) of treatment and clinician training while harnessing the broad workforce and embedded
payment models of routine medical settings, such as primary care. Thus, BBTI offers a scalable solution for
delivering CBTI’s core behavioral components to socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, who face the
greatest barriers to accessing CBTI and have been underrepresented in insomnia research. This study is
supported by evidence demonstrating BBTI’s short-term efficacy in improving insomnia outcomes. However,
BBTI’s effects have not been adequately compared to CBTI. This application proposes to fill this gap by testing
the non-inferiority of BBTI compared to CBTI on insomnia and insomnia-related outcomes in a low-income,
diverse sample receiving care in community and academic-based primary clinics across a single site. During
the one-year R61 start-up phase, we will conduct foundational work to ensure the R33 clinical trial phase is
launched expeditiously and optimally structured to efficiently engage all partners and our target patient population
and meet recruitment milestones. The R33 phase consists of a 52-week effectiveness-implementation trial
enrolling 350 primary care patients with insomnia who are eligible to receive insurance through a medical
assistance program (e.g., Medicaid), speak Spanish, or represent a racial or ethnic minority. We hypothesize
that BBTI will be non-inferior to CBTI (defined by a non-inferiority margin of 4 points on the insomnia severity
index) at 3-months. Secondary outcomes will include quality-of-life; depression; and diary-reported sleep
duration and efficiency; hypnotic use; and adverse events. We will also explore the durability of effects at 6 and
12 months. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to explore patient- and
clinic-level contextual factors influencing implementation to inform future strategies. By concurrently testing the
effectiveness and investigating implementation factors, this proposal will lay the foundation for subsequent
implementation trials testing the broad uptake of evidence-based behavioral insomnia treatments. Thus, the
information gained for the proposed work would directly advance the treatment of insomnia for underserved
groups along the translational continuum, strongly aligning with the goals of this RFA."
10931961,"Proposal Summary/Abstract
Communication access for deaf communities promotes equity and inclusion, thus there is heightened concern
regarding the many variables that impact the physical and mental health of sign language interpreters. The
Model of Interpreter Injury introduced sign production and style, the interpreting situation, and the interpreter’s
individual characteristics as factors associated with injury development. Trademarked by the National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in 2011, Total Worker Health (TWH®) combines health protection
with health promotion to prevent worker injury and advance well-being, making it a promising holistic approach
to address the multivariate factors of interpreter injury. Using mixed-methods and a clinical efficacy trial design,
the overall objective of this study will employ implementation strategies to adapt and evaluate a previous
integrated TWH® program and pilot test its efficacy on interpreter well-being.
 My central hypothesis is that interpreters in the health and well-being curriculum (intervention) will
demonstrate significantly improved well-being compared to those in a general health program (control). The
goal of Aim 1 is to adapt and tailor a previous integrated TWH® program into a health and well-being
curriculum for interpreters. Group model building will be used for curriculum development during virtual
listening sessions with interpreters and the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded
will guide documentation of the process for adapting to the context of interpreting. The goal of Aim 2 is to
evaluate implementation outcomes of the curriculum via a collective post-intervention satisfaction survey.
Finally, the goal of Aim 3 is to determine the efficacy of the health and well-being curriculum via the NIOSH
Worker Well-being Questionnaire (WellBQ) collected pre- and immediately post-intervention, as well as, at 6-
and 12-month timepoints in a parallel group randomized control trial. The contribution of the proposed research
will effectively implement a health and well-being curriculum to protect and promote the occupational health of
interpreters. This project is innovative because it will implement the integrated TWH® program to the
contextual needs of interpreters and bring experts in the interpreting field together for the first time to deliver a
combined interventional approach. This work relates to the NIOSH priority goal seven for extramural
research (promote safe and healthy work design and well-being), along with goals four (reduce occupational
musculoskeletal disorders) and six (improve workplace safety to reduce traumatic injuries).
 Evidence from this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will establish me as an
independent occupational safety and health researcher, contribute to the body of work dedicated to TWH®,
and further inform WellBQ development. I have assembled an outstanding advisory team that will provide me
with the necessary training to ensure I develop expertise in three primary domains: 1) dissemination and
implementation science, 2) occupational health, and 3) advanced statistics."

10725153,"A. ABSTRACT
A significant impediment towards improvement of outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the limited axonal
regeneration due to insufficient regrowth of the axonal fibers at the lesion site. Signaling mediated by RhoA
GTPases presents a significant impediment to growth. To date, there exists no small-molecule RhoA antagonists
that have shown in vivo efficacy. This is attributed to the fact that small GTPases like RhoA do not have druggable
pockets, making the development of small molecules that directly bind to them extremely difficult. However, over
the years, several proteins with druggable pockets have been discovered to interact with RhoA. We stipulated
that small molecules that bind to these druggable targets will promote axonal regeneration and recovery to a
similar or greater extent than direct inhibition of RhoA activity. To identify such compounds we pursued a unique
approach that consisted of structure-based computational docking of large chemical libraries to druggable targets
that interact with RhoA. We tested the top 50-100 compounds for their effect on neurite outgrowth and axonal
regeneration. One compound, RLA-47, inhibited in vitro neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration. The
compound also showed substantial axon crossings in an animal model of spinal cord injury. Our central
hypothesis is that RLA-47 and its derivatives will promote axonal regeneration and recovery following spinal cord
injury. Our preliminary data puts us in a strong position to test our hypothesis. In our first aim, we propose to
design and synthesize derivatives of RLA-47 that will be tested in our neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration
in vitro assays. The most promising candidates will be explored in our in vivo hemisection model of spinal cord
injury. In our second aim, we propose to develop RLA-47 derivatives with suitable pharmacokinetics and blood-
brain permeability that promote axonal regeneration in vivo. We also test the most promising compounds using
a more clinically relevant contusion model of spinal cord injury. We will use a standard chemical biology strategy
of affinity purification and mass spectrometry to uncover targets of RLA-47 and its derivatives. Along with RNA
sequencing, these studies will provide deeper insight into the mechanism of action of compounds. We expect
1-2 derivatives of RLA-47 to exhibit superior pharmacokinetics, brain permeability and efficacy. These
compounds will lead to investigational new drug filing that we expect will eventually lead to candidates that can
be explored in clinical trials either alone, or in combination with other therapies to promote regeneration and
recovery in spinal cord injury patients."
10739818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective emotion regulation (ER) requires the ability to flexibly and dynamically respond to affectively-valenced
stimuli in the service of goal-directed behaviors. Patients with major mood disorders, including bipolar disorder
(BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by brain-based abnormalities in affective
processing and cognitive deficits that make it difficult for them to regulate their emotions. Disruptions in ER are
thought to play a role in risk for onset of illness, a relapsing course, and incomplete remission. Aging may amplify
poor outcomes in older adults with depression, as reflected in a more severe course and treatment resistance. In
contrast, in healthy adults, ER improves across the lifespan with a shift from attending to negative to attending to
positive stimuli in attention, learning and memory.
Consistent with RDoC, we will leverage multiple units of analysis (circuit, performance, self-report) in a
transdiagnostic sample enriched for a range of ER-related network functions, implicit attentional biases, and ER
strategies. We will enroll 200 adults (ages 41-80) with an affectively-stable mood disorder (100 BD, 100 MDD),
and 100 demographically-matched healthy controls, allowing us to capture the range from extreme positive to
extreme negative emotional experience. We will assess performance-based affective biases, cognitive control,
and resting-state functional connectivity (FC), to define age-related changes in ER circuitry. We will assay
habitual use of ER strategies, social functioning, and well-being to determine how brain-based processes affect
these functionally- and clinically-relevant outcomes.
Impact. The goals of this project are directly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan to develop new ways of
characterizing and treating mental illness that are predicated on understanding brain-based mechanisms.
Beyond the heuristic value of understanding the specific mechanisms and developmental trajectory of ER in mid
and late life, results can be used to inform the development of novel interventions (e.g., neurostimulation,
cognitive interventions) designed to “rescue” the specific network dysfunctions that give rise to maladaptive ER
in depressive disorders."

 This is a Beeson (K76) career development award for Sachin J Shah, MD, MPH, a physician-investigator
trained in internal medicine, clinical epidemiology, and aging research. Dr. Shah is an Assistant Professor in
the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Shah's long-term goal is to
build evidence to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults facing high-risk, high-benefit
therapeutic decisions using new epidemiologic methods and geriatric research principles. The decision to use
anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) is the paradigm of a high-stakes therapeutic decision
because while anticoagulants prevent stroke, they increase the risk of bleeding complications. Guidelines use
a one-size-fits-all approach; for older adults, they recommend near-universal anticoagulant use. In numerous
studies of clinical practice, physicians report concern with the current approach voicing the need to
individualize treatment recommendations for older adults. This proposal addresses the pressing need to
individualize anticoagulant treatment decisions in older adults with AF through two aims. Aim 1: Develop and
validate individualized estimates of the treatment effect of anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in
older adults with AF. This aim will use clinical trial and observational data to develop and validate a treatment
effect model that will estimate individual-level treatment benefit. Aim 2: Ascertain functional outcomes after
major extracranial hemorrhage, both short-term and longer-term. The functional outcomes following major
hemorrhage, a key adverse event of anticoagulant therapy, are unclear, especially in older adults. Through two
studies, this proposal will determine the short- and long-term functional outcomes following major hemorrhage.
 Dr. Shah's exceptional, multidisciplinary mentoring team is led by Dr. Margaret Fang, nationally recognized
for her work studying the clinical outcomes of anticoagulants in older adults and co-mentored by Dr. Kenneth
Covinsky, whose nationally recognized research program has advanced our understanding of the predictors
and outcomes of disability in older adults. This career development award will support Dr. Shah's transition to
research independence through mentorship and focused training in (1) measuring heterogeneous treatment
effects using novel epidemiologic tools, (2) primary data collection to build prospective cohorts of older adults,
(3) designing decision aids and (4) leadership development to lead cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional
research teams. This proposal will support a development grant to design and pilot a clinical decision tool for
older adults considering anticoagulant and a project grant to measure heterogeneous treatment effects of
procedural interventions in older adults with AF. The proposed research and training aims will provide Dr. Shah
with the data, training, and experience to support competitive R-series applications."

Different patients with Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) can harbor mutations that result in constitutively
activated versions of tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR, RET, ALK, ROS1, TRK) that can be precisely targeted with
inhibitors. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are vulnerable to existing, known and unknown, drug resistance
mechanisms found in tumors. This results in a game of molecular “whack-a-mole” whereby, resistance evolution
appears, the mechanism is isolated, drugs are administered to combat that drug resistance, and then resistance
re-emerges until no effective therapies remain. This process of reverse engineering drug resistance has been a
losing battle with a high cost for patients. A promising approach to combat the challenge of resistance evolution
is to design and test cell therapies that can sense the therapeutic environment and respond through synthetic
biology circuits to reproducibly control evolutionary trajectories. We propose a synthetic biological technology
with proof-of-concept function in mammalian cells that we term “dual-switch selection drives”. These drives use
inducible drug resistance to create a cell therapy that can engineer a tumor’s evolution in situ. The first switch
senses the presence of a dimerizer molecule to create reversible drug resistance. Using the mathematical rules
of biophysics and evolution, our cell therapy calculates a response to small molecules and produces a tunable
amount of cellular fitness that competes with pre-existing drug resistance variants in a tumor. A second switch
with a suicide gene payload hitchhikes on this evolution guided cell therapy until the selection drive cells comprise
the majority of the tumor. Then, at the flip of a second switch, a locally diffusible toxin is produced that kills all
cells--gene drive or pre-existing resistance mutants of any molecular origin--through a bystander effect. This
technology works with the existing standard of care drugs in NSCLC to produce localized combination therapy
that can eradicate pre-existing resistance regardless of the molecular mechanism. Therefore, instead of
responding to and combatting evolution, we use forward engineering of cell therapies to direct evolution. In Aim
1 we will use nonintuitive insights from stochastic models of the evolutionary stability of our designs to propose
further optimized selection drives. Aim 2 expands our forward engineering approach by pushing our model driven
design of safety and efficacy towards the spatial, cellular, and microenvironmental heterogeneity present in
NSCLC. Aim 3 proposes to move evolutionary proof-of-concept experiments into primary human organoids from
NSCLC patients with activating mutations in EGFR. Beyond practical testing of a technology, we will also “build
to understand” the basic cancer biology of resistance evolution."

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) comprise a group of severe neurodevelopmental disorders that are typified
by communication deficits and social impairment. Given that the onset of symptoms occurs by the age of 3, it is
largely agreed that neuronal dysfunction arises during early brain development. A developing brain shows a
remarkable capacity for plastic changes in response to experiences; thus, its development is most vulnerable to
the environmental factors that can derail normal brain function. In utero exposure to drugs that raise blood 5HT
levels, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has demonstrated behavioral and psychological
deficits in offspring that closely resemble autistic symptoms in both animals models and human studies. In order
to understand how these alterations arise, it is necessary to first understand the basic mechanisms of
serotonergic modulation of brain function. Formation and stabilization of excitatory synapses are known to be
essential for the initial establishment of functional neural circuits. Conversely, disrupted synapse development
impairs neuron function and is thought to underlie the pathology of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. PFC
is densely innervated by serotonergic axon terminals and associated with higher cognitive processes that may
be disrupted in illnesses such as ASDs. Despite a wealth of literature examining the role of 5HT in modulating
behavior and in the pathogenesis of brain disorders, little is known at the cellular and molecular level about the
role of 5HT in early cortical development, and particularly the postsynaptic 5HT mechanisms that modulate
synapse development in the developing PFC. In the present study, we utilize a novel combination of tools
including two-color, two-photon uncaging that enables precise release of 5HT and glutamate neurotransmitters,
calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetic stimulation of genetically-targeted 5HT neurons to test our
central hypothesis that 5HT signaling promotes the initiation of excitatory synapse formation and controls the
maturation of excitatory synapses during brain development. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will examine
this hypothesis in two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of 5HT signaling in lowering the threshold for induction
of activity-dependent synapse formation. 2) Define the actions of 5HT on activity-dependent, input-specific and
heterosynaptic spine stabilization. Results from these studies will further our understanding of the unique and
detailed mechanisms by which 5HT regulates brain development, with critical relevance to cellular underpinnings
of neurodevelopmental disorders. In the U.S., approximately 13% of pregnant women use SSRIs, which typically
increase fetal 5HT levels. We expect that our results will highlight new avenues into the investigation of the
pathophysiology underlying neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from early perturbation of 5HT signaling."

Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are increasing health and economic burdens. Non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD/NASH), alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), chronic hepatitis (CHC), and autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH) are common etiologies. Unfortunately, many patients do not adhere to recommended life style
modifications, thus, we need better techniques for predicting risk of fibrosis progression and personalizing
therapies prior to development of poor outcomes. Intrahepatic macrophages (Macs), liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells (LSECs), and stellate cells (HSCs) can greatly influence the composition of the hepatic microenvironment
and development of fibrosis. Therapies targeting these initiators of fibrosis are being investigated in phase II-III
clinical trials; however, the underlying hepatic microenvironment and patient variability in these cells and
expression of these targets is not being considered prior to treatment. We use cutting-edge spectral imaging
microscopy combined with NanoString technology to evaluate these cells and associated pro-fibrotic gene
expression profiles in the same patient's liver biopsy at the time of initial diagnosis. From our liver tissue biobank,
we identified 225 biopsies with different chronic liver diseases (NASH, AALD, CHC, and AIH) that were collected
at the time of diagnosis from patients that had adequate follow-up either with a repeat biopsy or by liver
replacement (for those that later developed cirrhosis). The majority showed no progression of hepatic fibrosis
over time (n = 150) while a portion rapidly developed cirrhosis (n = 75). We use the above platforms to assess
differences in these patients' hepatic microenvironments in their initial liver biopsies. We propose to test the
hypothesis that patients with definable pro-fibrotic variations in their hepatic microenvironment early in the course
of disease predicts their propensity to develop fibrosis. Preliminary data showed that initial liver biopsies from
patients with a predisposition to rapidly develop cirrhosis have increased profibrotic macrophages (e.g.,
Mac387+ and CD163+, respectively), enhanced cellular interactions of Mac-LSEC-HSCs, increased expression
of therapy-related targets (e.g., CCR2 and galectin 3) and increased pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic gene
expression profiles (e.g., CCL2, TNF, and TGF-beta). Imaging and molecular bioinformatics will be used for data
analyses. For Aim 1, we will use three panels to phenotype intrahepatic Macs and examine their interactions
with LSECs and HSCs, and will assess differences in expression of pro-fibrotic therapy-related targets. For Aim
2, we will analyze over 200 Mac-LSEC-HSC-related and pro-fibrotic genes in the other half of the biopsy from
Aim 1. The proposed approach will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective: personalization of targeted
therapies (e.g., cenicriviroc or obeticholic acid), similar to the manner in which the response to immunotherapy
is predicted by staining of tissue in patients with cancer. In this retrospective longitudinal study, we will determine
which platform (Spectral imaging-Aim1 vs. NanoString-Aim 2) is the most performant for determining potential
targets of fibrosis progression and most cost efficient for clinical implementation in the future."

This K01 career development proposal was developed to support Dr. Shakia Hardy, a tenure track Assistant
Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), in her path
towards becoming an independent researcher. The Candidate earned her PhD in Epidemiology in 2017 from
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and has a strong record of published research in the fields of
cardiovascular and social epidemiology. Her goal is to integrate her epidemiology skills with implementation
science to develop an independent research program at the intersection of implementation and population
science. Dr. Hardy’s research aims to reduce health disparities in cardiovascular disease through the
modification of lifestyle behaviors that contribute to increased blood pressure in early life. Training: To
accomplish her overall goal, Dr. Hardy has proposed an intensive mentored research plan that includes
didactic education, and experiential learning in 1) intervention development, 2) implementation science for
intervention delivery and evaluation, 3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials, and 4) leadership
skills for academic scientists. Mentorship: An interdisciplinary team of renowned scholars will mentor Dr.
Hardy and provide ongoing guidance as she transitions to independence. Her mentoring team includes a
Primary Mentor, Dr. Andrea Cherrington (Department of Preventive Medicine, UAB), co-Mentors, Dr. Paul
Muntner (Department of Epidemiology, UAB), Dr. Nathalie Moise (Department of Medicine, Columbia
University) and Dr. Daniel Feig (Department of Medicine, UAB) and two content advisors at UAB. Each of
these mentors are fully committed to this project and to Dr. Hardy’s success. Research: The prevalence of
high BP, defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥120 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥80 mm Hg, is two-times higher
(20% versus 10%) among Black versus white adolescents 13-17 years of age in the US. The availability of
lifestyle behavior counseling in a clinical setting to lower BP is limited in rural communities due to long travel
distances to access healthcare, limited funds for co-payments, and ineffective provider-patient communication.
The proposed K01 addresses this gap by developing and testing the feasibility and acceptability of a peer
support intervention to lower BP among rural Black adolescents with high BP. First, Dr. Hardy will identify
aspects of the rural environment that present barriers to lifestyle behavior change. Next, using the behavior
change wheel for intervention development, she will develop and pilot test a peer support intervention devised
to address these barriers. The successful completion of this project will lead to an R01 grant submission to test
the effectiveness of this peer support intervention in a multi-site cluster-randomized trial and allow Dr. Hardy to
become an independent investigator contributing to health equity among adolescents, where lifestyle behavior
change could preempt the development of racial disparities in BP and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of producing all erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid blood
cells of an organism. Coupled with their unique capacity for self-renewal, successful transplantation of healthy
HSCs is the only therapy currently available that can completely replace and restore the blood system in patients
with leukemia and lymphoma. Despite this need, HSCs presently cannot be efficiently created or cultured in vitro,
suggesting that extrinsic factors supporting their growth and development in vivo are lacking from existing
protocols. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that blood flow is an essential non-genetic environmental
cue required for HSC production in vertebrate embryos, mediated in part by stimulating mechanical activation of
the Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcription factor (TF). This proposal intends to resolve the physical, genetic
and molecular mechanisms underlying mechanically-activated, YAP-driven HSC production. YAP, while a potent
co-activator of gene expression, lacks DNA-binding ability of its own. To understand the molecular logic behind
flow/YAP-driven hematopoiesis, the goal of the first aim is to employ chemical, physical and genetic perturbation
of shear stress and cyclic stretch in live zebrafish embryos to assess the impact of these individual components
of hemodynamic force on HSC production from hemogenic endothelium (HE). To this will be added tissue-
specific transcriptomic and genome-wide YAP/DNA interaction profiling from sorted HE from wildtype zebrafish,
flow-deficient and yap-/- animals (with normal blood flow) in order to discriminate flow-dependent gene regulatory
modules and transcriptional targets that rely on YAP. Hypothesis-driven candidate TFs will be tested in vivo and
in vitro to evaluate YAP-interaction ability and uncover key partners required for normal YAP-dependent
hematopoiesis. In the second aim, the zebrafish system will be used to investigate candidate membrane-
localized proteins, Piezos and Integrins, as components linking hemodynamic forces with YAP activation. These
studies stand to provide a comprehensive “membrane-to-nucleus” paradigm for how blood flow activates YAP
to guide developmental hematopoiesis, which may improve current efforts to generate or expand HSCs.
 As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Sugden will conduct his research in the laboratory of Dr. Trista North at
Boston Children's Hospital. Her expertise in extrinsic regulation of developmental hematopoiesis, together with
dedicated co-mentorship by Dr. George Daley (an expert in stem cell biology and hematology) and a strong
advisory team provide an exceptionally well-supported environment for career development and research
training. Dr. Sugden will build on a solid background in developmental genetics and live-imaging, by adding new
technologies in transcription factor/DNA interaction profiling, transcriptomics and in vitro methods to study protein
interactions. A rigorous research and training plan lay the groundwork for success, both in the mentored and
independent phases of the award. The environment at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School
will provide the ideal surroundings to support Dr. Sugden to become a successful independent scientist."
10725138,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia affecting adults, but
unfortunately there has been no change in standard therapy for most patients in over 40 years.
Traditional chemotherapeutics exhibit poor efficacy in patients over the age of 56, with a median
survival of less than one year and only 20% surviving two years. The development of novel
therapies for AML is urgently needed. We previously identified a plant derived alkaloid as a
promising agent that impaired the growth and survival of AML cells. Through medicinal
chemistry efforts, we have identified a series of securinine analogues with high potency and
promising activity in mouse models of human AML. We have identified that these compounds
inhibit the enzyme thioredoxin reductase and that this leads to direct and marked effects on
metabolism. In this grant, we will investigate how thioredoxin reductase functions as a major
regulator of cancer cell metabolism through pharmacologic and genetic studies. In addition, we
will perform lead optimization chemistry to identify securinine analogues with improved
pharmacologic properties and test them in mouse models of human AML. It is hoped that this
work will lead to improved therapies for AML and a novel understanding of how thioredoxin
reductase can directly regulate cancer cell metabolism."

Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses (GWVI) presents as a complex constellation of diverse symptoms that have
persisted in Gulf War Veterans more than 25 years after their deployment to the Gulf region. This set of
symptoms is so broad, it baffles diagnostic criteria and as a result, consideration of GWVI as a bona fide illness
has progressed slowly from denial of its existence to the use of such terms as “unexplained illnesses” (used by
the VA) and “multisymptom illness”. The most recent report by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Gulf War
and Health (2016) concludes that GWVI is not a psychosomatic condition and sufficient evidence now exists to
conclude that a causal relationship exists between being deployed to the Gulf War and the health outcomes
associated with this disorder. This august Committee noted that little progress has been made in elucidating
the pathological mechanisms that underlie the complex symptom set associated with GWVI and as a result, “it
does not appear that a single mechanism can explain the multitude of symptoms seen in Gulf War Illness, and
it is unlikely that a single definitive causal agent will be identified this many years after the war” (p. 3 of report).
We agree that a single cause for all elements of GWVI is unlikely, it is possible that a single pathophysiological
mechanism that could influence the diverse symptoms of GWVI, and explain their persistence, and that
mechanism is a dysbiosis in the gut microbiome. The broad objectives of this project are to analyze the effects
of Gulf War agents on the commensal bacteria in the gut and to determine if these interactions result in
changes in the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other bioactive small molecules
produced by gut bacteria. These products of bacterial fermentation and metabolism exert numerous effects
throughout the body to include the CNS. Mice will be treated with a validated mouse model of GWVI
(pyridostigmine bromide plus permethrin) and the gut microbiome will be analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing
using the MiSeq platform. The effects of these same agents on SCFA production will be determined using
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. CNS and GI disorders that are confirmed symptoms of GWVI will
also be assessed. Thereafter, the effects of a high fat diet on the microbiome and SCFA production will be
evaluated. Finally, a new treatment aim is proposed that will test dietary intervention and fecal microbiota
transfer for their ability to restore balance in the GWVI-modified gut microbiome and to diminish the CNS and
GI symptoms of this serious disorder. It is predicted that a high fat diet will magnify the effects of Gulf War
agents on the microbiome and the metabolome and cause a time-dependent worsening of GWVI symptoms.
Together, the application of next generation sequencing and cutting edge mass spectrometry will help fill gaps
in our understanding of how Gulf War agents influence communication along the gut-brain axis. These studies
may also reveal new therapeutic targets for GWVI by restoring balance in the gut microbiome through dietary
and microbiota transfer interventions."

Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) are highly prevalent Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, the
antipsychotic medications used to treat psychosis are contraindicated in the elderly where the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) issued a black-box warning for all first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications
indicating that these drugs increase the risk of death in elderly dementia patients. We have demonstrated that
the hippocampus plays a central role in the regulation of dopamine system function and that aberrant
hippocampal regulation of dopamine neuron activity likely contributes to psychosis in schizophrenia. Given that
the hippocampus is a key site of pathology in AD, we posit that the hippocampus may be a site of convergence
contributing to comorbid psychosis in AD, and we will use rodent models to study this hypothesis. Specifically,
we will examine basal activity and afferent regulation of dopamine neuron activity as well as behavioral correlates
of psychosis in two distinct rodent models of AD (Aim 1). We will then examine the consequence of AD pathology
on vHipp interneuron function and whether transplantation of stem cell derived interneurons (Aim 2) or
pharmacological modulation of hippocampal function (Aim 3) can reverse aberrant neuronal activity and
behavior in AD models. This proposal with therefore identify a potential novel therapeutic target and inform the

Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is a set of behavioral symptoms characterized by excessive daydreaming,
slowed thinking, and mental confusion and fogginess. It is now established that SCT can be reliably measured
across parent, teacher, and self-report ratings and is distinct from other psychopathology dimensions including
ADHD and internalizing symptoms. A rapidly growing body of research also demonstrates SCT to be strongly
associated with functional impairment, above and beyond other psychopathologies. However, SCT remains
absent from current models of psychopathology, in large part because the field lacks rigorous longitudinal
research examining SCT in relation to other psychopathologies. In cross-sectional studies, SCT symptoms are
consistently and strongly associated with internalizing symptoms. Preliminary findings also document
associations between SCT and increased suicide risk. Importantly, our pilot data show SCT predicts increased
internalizing symptoms rather than the reverse. Further, SCT symptoms uniquely predict internalizing problems
and not externalizing behaviors, suggesting that SCT may be a unique factor in understanding the
development of internalizing problems specifically. Yet studies linking SCT to internalizing symptoms in youth
are limited in several ways, including: (a) use of cross-sectional designs that preclude establishment of
temporal associations, (b) using convenience samples (e.g., ADHD) rather than a sample enriched for SCT
specifically, (c) failing to examine possible mechanisms or vulnerabilities linking SCT to internalizing
symptoms, and (d) focusing on school-aged children even though SCT symptoms and internalizing problems
sharply increase in adolescence. This study will address these limitations by using a prospective longitudinal,
multi-informant, multi-method design across the developmentally sensitive period of early adolescence to
examine SCT symptoms as a predictor of diverse internalizing outcomes and to test mechanisms and
vulnerabilities linking SCT to internalizing symptoms in a community sample enriched for SCT
symptomatology. Specifically, a community-based sample of 330 young adolescents (ages 10-12 years)
enriched for SCT symptomatology will be recruited and assessed at three timepoints one year apart.
Consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative and a developmental psychopathology
framework, a multi-informant, multi-method battery that cuts across physiological, behavioral, and self-report
units of analysis will be used. We will examine dimensional SCT symptoms as a predictor of internalizing
psychopathology change over time, test mechanisms of the longitudinal relation between SCT and internalizing
psychopathologies, and explore vulnerabilities (physiological reactivity, punishment sensitivity) that exacerbate
these longitudinal relations. Findings establishing longitudinal effects and identifying mechanisms and
vulnerabilities that cut across units of analysis will advance the development of theoretical models of SCT.
Findings from this study will also provide avenues for targeted clinical assessment and treatment."

11083489,"ABSTRACT
Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a very common congenital optic nerve (ON) disorder and is the leading cause
of childhood blindness in developed nations. ONH incidence has increased ~8-fold over the last two decades.
ONH is characterized by a thin, underdeveloped ON that often results from secondary loss of retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs). The most common prenatal determinants of ONH are a young primiparous mother, an unhealthy
maternal lifestyle including alcohol abuse, and nutritional deprivation. We have developed and published murine
models of ONH by manipulating the X-linked gene CASK, since CASK mutations in humans are associated with
ONH. The ONH pathology of CASK mutant mice recapitulates human ONH, including the timing of pathology
onset (after RGC development; i.e., secondary loss) and the non-progressive nature of the pathology.
Biochemical experiments show that CASK interacts with metabolic proteins and modulates mitochondrial
function. CASK deficiency leads to increased fatty acid oxidation and a deficit of the ω-6 fatty acid arachidonic
acid (ARA) in the central nervous system (CNS). ARA deficiency is also observed in other conditions associated
with ONH. We hypothesize that ONH results from an early ARA deficit, thus ONH can be exacerbated by
perturbing brain ARA metabolism (via astrocyte dysfunction) and ameliorated by dietary ARA
supplementation. During the third trimester, ARA is exclusively obtained from the mother; in neonates, brain
ARA is also obtained from the diet until adequate enzymatic activity (conversion of the essential fatty acid linoleic
acid into ARA) is reached. This post-neonatal shift in ARA acquisition from diet to synthesis may contribute to
ONH’s non-progressive nature. In the CNS, fatty acid metabolism (including ARA uptake and production) occurs
predominantly in astrocytes. In this proposal we plan to test our hypothesis in two independent ONH mouse
models: 1) CASK(+/-) heterozygous knockout mice, and 2) a previously published fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
mouse model. With these models, we will examine mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative damage and fatty acid
metabolic defects in the retina, ON and brain. We will also quantify levels of two ω-fatty acids (docosahexaenoic
acid and ARA), as well as phospholipids in the ON of both types of ONH mice. Next, we will genetically disrupt
the function of astrocytes (crucial for brain ARA metabolism) in a CASK hypomorph ONH model by complete
deletion of CASK in astrocytes. We will investigate if this manipulation exacerbates the metabolic defect and
ONH as assessed both morphologically and functionally, using a visual behavioral assay and an innovative
electrophysiological tool called Network Response to Visual Excitation (NeRVE). Finally, we will test if ARA
supplementation ameliorates ONH in the two models described above. Our study is likely to identify ARA
deficiency as the final common pathway that explains ONH’s association with nutritional deprivation, maternal
diabetes, infantile cholestasis and FAS. Positive results from ARA supplementation will be readily translatable."
10734052,"Genome-wide association studies have been key for identifying genetic variation associated
with psychiatric disorders. Whenever these GWAS are based on large sample sizes, however,
they implicate a plethora of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in risk. This polygenicity
presents challenges for mapping risk variation onto the biological mechanisms that predispose
individuals to illness. Many studies have integrated genomic and transcriptomic variation with the
goal of colocalizing the GWAS SNP associations and cis transcriptional patterns determined by
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), as well as other QTLs. In some instances, these studies
highlight one or more genes whose transcriptomic variation is driven largely by variation in specific
risk SNPs. For a substantial fraction of the risk loci, however, colocalization is inconsistent across
studies or no effect on transcription is observed. These missing links between genetic risk variation
and biological variation could be due to many factors, including cell-type specificity, developmental
patterns, or missing -omics characterizations. Notably, bulk tissue and even single cell mRNA
levels are imperfect predictors of the cellular levels of the proteins they code for. We hypothesize
that a substantial portion of these missing links is due to our limited knowledge of how proteomic
variation relates to genetic variation in the human brain. SNPs can regulate the proteome via
mechanisms that “skip” transcript levels and protein levels are tightly regulated by posttranslational
modifications (PTMs) that are not readily predictable from the transcriptome.
 We propose to characterize transcriptomic and proteomic variation in human post-mortem
brain, specifically protein expression (Aim 1); PTMs (Aim 2); map genetic variation onto
transcriptomic (eQTLs) and proteome and PTM variation (pQTLs and PTMQTLs) and evaluate their
interrelationships (Aim 3); and then perform colocalization analysis to inform the biological
pathways by which genetic variation confers risk to psychiatric disorders (Aim 4). In our preliminary
proteogenomic experiments, we combined proteomics with SNP genotyping to identify pQTLs.
We discovered that a substantial fraction of pQTLs bypass the transcriptome (~50%), in line with
another recent human brain pQTL study and our hypothesis.
 Our aims are consistent with goals from RFA-MH-21-100: (1) develop novel proteomic
and other omics resources; (2) use them to map how genetic risk variation influences
omics features in neural tissue and cell types; and (3) provide a high confidence set of
causal variants, genes, and isoforms that likely contribute to disease risk, enhancing our
insights into proximate disease mechanisms."
10735881,"Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs), with a prevalence of 13 – 15% in the United States. CAUTIs are also blamed for
increased morbidity and mortality of affected patients with an estimated 13,000 deaths annually. It is
well known that the abiotic catheter materials are prone to colonization of microbes, which then ascend
the catheter via motility and biofilm formation, causing infections in the urinary tract. Due to the protection
of the biofilm matrix and slow growth of attached cells, biofilm cells are up to 1,000 times more resistant
to antimicrobials than the planktonic cells of the same species. Thus, CAUTIs are difficult to treat and
blockage of the catheter lumen can occur especially during long-term use, leading to stone formation
and infections of the bladder and even kidney. Treatment of CAUTIs with high doses of antimicrobial
agents can also adversely promote the development of multidrug resistant bacteria. Despite extensive
research to date, no current technology can provide long-term (>30 days) fouling control. This unmet
challenge motivated us to engineer smart catheters to ultimately eradicate CAUTI.
Recently, the PI’s lab developed a new antifouling strategy based on active topography that drives
magnetically responsive micron-size pillars to beat with a tunable frequency and force level. This was
achieved by loading Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the tip of each pillar and generating an electromagnetic
field using an insulated copper coil embedded in the catheter wall (thus does not change the catheter
profile). This novel design demonstrated unprecedented strong antifouling activities that can inhibit
biofilm formation of multiple species by up to 3.6 logs (99.98%) for 48 hours and remove mature biofilms
by up to 3.5 logs (99.97%) on demand with a stronger force, compared to the flat control. A prototype
catheter with micron-size pillars on the inner wall was engineered and remained clean for more than 30
days under the flow of artificial urine and the challenge of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), while
both flat and static controls were completely blocked by UPEC biofilms within 5 days. These results
motivated the team to further develop this technology to also control biofouling of the outer catheter wall,
which is covered by urethral mucosa and involved in two thirds of CAUTIs. Integrated simulation and
experimental studies will be conducted to understand the mechanism of biofouling control by active
topography and the design principles for antifouling topographies on both sides of the catheter wall. The
best design will be further tested in vivo using a rabbit model of CAUTI induced by UPEC. Both CAUTI
prevention (up to 30 days) and removal of established biofilms will be evaluated."

Nitrogenase reaction represents a major source of the usable form of nitrogen that supports the
existence of human population. As such, understanding how small building blocks are
assembled into a functional nitrogenase entity is of significant relevance to human health. Using
combined genetic, biochemical, spectroscopic and structural approaches, we propose to
investigate how M-cluster, the unique metallocofactor of molybdenum nitrogenase, is
assembled into a functional unit. Specifically, we will investigate how an interstitial carbide is
inserted via a radical SAM-dependent mechanism concomitant with fusion of two 4Fe modules
into an 8Fe core of the M-cluster, what is the in vivo donor/carrier of the “9th sulfur” and how this
sulfur is inserted into the catalytically important belt region of the 8Fe core, and how Mo is
mobilized and inserted into the 8Fe core to form a mature M-cluster. Through our proposed
studies, we expect to further refine the biosynthetic pathway of the unique metallocofactor of
nitrogenase, which will provide crucial insights into the structural-functional relationship of this
important enzyme and reveal some general principles of the assembly mechanisms of complex
metalloclusters in biological systems."

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a low grade neoplasm that causes progressive lung destruction, lung cyst
formation, and respiratory failure. Bi-allelic mutations in TSC2 (or much less commonly TSC1) have been
known as the main genetic driver of LAM in both individuals with TSC as well as sporadic LAM. It has also
been thought that the distinction between TSC-LAM and sporadic LAM was well-defined. However, recent
studies by PI Kwiatkowski and co-investigator Darling have shown that mosaicism for TSC1/TSC2 is common
in adults with TSC-LAM, and associated with a milder clinical phenotype that may be missed in some apparent
sporadic LAM patients. In addition, detailed analyses of LAM lung lesions have been able to identify TSC1 or
TSC2 mutations in only a fraction of sporadic LAM patients, suggesting the involvement of other genes.
Furthermore, a LAM GWAS led by the PI has identified SNPs on chromosome 15 near the transcription factor
NR2F2 as having alleles that show association with sporadic LAM. In this proposal, we examine all three of
these issues in greater detail. Two of the Aims will use massively parallel sequencing (MPS) and a novel
technology we have developed, Multiplex High-sensitivity PCR Assay (MHPA), that is capable of highly
sensitive variant detection in TSC2, down to an allele frequency of 0.05%, 10-fold lower than our previous
targeted capture assay. In Aim 1, we will determine whether mutations in other mTOR pathway genes and/or
MITF family member translocation or amplification cause sporadic LAM in a set of 100 LAM patients. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether the presence of TSC2 mutations in cell free (cf) DNA is a biomarker of LAM; and
examine the frequency of genetic mosaicism in selected subsets of apparent sporadic LAM patients;
simultaneously, also in 100 LAM patients. We will enrich the patients studied for those with singleton TSC
lesions, such as hypomelanotic macule (HMM) or facial angiofibroma, or bilateral angiomyolipoma. We will use
our new MHPA assay for this analysis. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of NR2F2 in LAM development, by
examining allelic imbalance in the H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data, performing NR2F2 ChIP-Seq, using Binding and
expression target analysis to infer the genes most likely to have their expression driven by NR2F2, determine if
NR2F2 is part of the Core transcription Regulatory Circuitry (CRC) in angiomyolipoma, and assess effects of
NR2F2 expression modulation, and treatment with activators and inhibitors in the human angiomyolipoma cell
line 621-101."

Lipid storage is a fundamental process for organisms to buffer fluctuations in the availability and need for
metabolic energy. Lipids are predominantly stored as neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TGs), in organelles
called lipid droplets (LDs). These organelles are hubs of metabolism with most of their biochemical functions
being executed by proteins targeting their surface. Consistent with the important function of LD proteins in
metabolism, their aberrant accumulation on LDs can cause diseases, such as liver disease or lipodystrophy.
Despite the fundamental importance of LD proteins and their intimate link to human physiology and pathology,
little is known about the mechanisms how protein target LDs. In this proposal, we address this question for some
of the most important lipid metabolism enzymes that target LDs after initial insertion into the endoplasmatic
reticulum. Capitalizing on results from the previous funding period, we will define the machinery building bridges
between the ER and LDs for protein targeting and decipher the molecular driving forces for transport to LDs.
Completing these aims will reveal a fundamental aspect of evolutionarily conserved cell biology. Since
accumulation of protein variants on LDs causes common metabolic diseases, our may also provide new
therapeutic avenues for intervention."

Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1 disease) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the lysosomal storage
of cholesterol and sphingolipids, and clinical signs of progressive cerebellar ataxia, dementia, vertical
supranuclear gaze palsy, dysphagia, and early death. There are no FDA-approved therapies for NPC1
disease. Repeated intracisterna magna (IC) administration of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPßCD) in
cats with NPC1 disease prevented the onset of cerebellar ataxia, prevented Purkinje cell death, normalized
cerebellocortical and cerebrocortical cholesterol and gangliosides concentrations, and increased survival time.
These preclinical data advanced IC HPßCD into clinical trials where efficacy has been demonstrated.
However, HPßCD must be administered IC every two weeks for the duration of the patient’s life and results in
progressive dose-limiting ototoxicity, highlighting a clear need for less invasive and safer therapies for these
patients.
We hypothesize that optimization of IC gene therapy using an AAV9 vector to deliver NPC1 to the brain will
effectively prevent NPC1 disease-associated cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell pathology without repeated
lifelong injections and without ototoxicity. We also hypothesize that intracarotid (IV) administration of a novel
AAV serotype to cats can deliver NPC1 to the basal ganglia and brainstem, regions which are untreated by IC
administration of HPßCD or AAV9, and are responsible for dystonia, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and
dysphagia. Therefore, in the proposed studies we will assess methods to optimize AAV9-mediated
transduction of the greatest number of Purkinje cells (Aim 1), evaluate the efficacy of AAV9-NPC1
administration to treat clinical, biochemical, and histologic aspects of NPC1-associated cerebellar disease (Aim
2), and evaluate the efficacy of intracarotid AAV-NPC1 administration to treat extracerebellar regions
responsible for dementia (cerebral cortex), dystonia (basal ganglia), and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and
dysphagia (brainstem) (Aim 3).
These proof-of-concept studies will be the first to optimize the delivery of a non-diffusible membrane-bound
protein to Purkinje cells, thereby advancing gene therapy for many other genetic diseases affecting Purkinje
cells including spinocerebellar ataxias. Moreover, these studies will be the first to develop a one-time therapy
for NPC1 disease that treats both cerebellar and extracerebellar disease and results in no ototoxicity."
10746821,"Lipid-storing cells such as adipocytes are essential for maintaining organismal homeostasis, and can efficiently absorb circulating fatty acids (FAs) prior to their storage as triglycerides (TG) in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs). Defects in lipid uptake, storage, or export lead to elevated blood-circulating FAs and fat buildup in non-adipose tissues, ultimately contributing to metabolic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2- diabetes (T2D). Although central to their function, how fat-storing cells spatially and temporally coordinate FA absorption, storage, and mobilization remains enigmatic, yet central to the understanding of lipid storage in human health and disease. My lab recently characterized a family of proteins that coordinate the spatial organization of LDs by defining sub-domains within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from which LDs bud (Hariri, EMBO reports, 2017; Hariri, JCB, 2019; Ugrankar, Dev Cell, 2019; Datta, JCB, 2019). Using Drosophila, we showed that one such protein, Snz, localizes to adipocyte ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts and promotes LD biogenesis in the cell periphery (Ugrankar, Dev Cell, 2019). We propose that the ER, PM, and LDs are functionally coupled in the adipocyte cell periphery, providing a unique sub-cellular environment for FA processing and LD biogenesis adjacent to the cell surface. This project will dissect the role of Snz and its human ortholog Snx14 in FA desaturation and TG synthesis (Aim 1), as well as characterize the molecular determinants that regulate LD spatial organization within Drosophila adipocytes (Aim 2). Finally, we will dissect how LDs are generated in the periphery of mammalian cells in response to metabolic cues such as lipolysis and FA absorption, and interrogate the role of Snx14 in this process using a murine model system (Aim 3). Collectively this work will provide new mechanistic insights into how LDs are produced, spatially organized, and utilized during specific metabolic cues in both Drosophila and mammalian fat-storing cells. The work provides mechanistic insights into the functions of lipid-storing and secreting cells such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, and milk-secreting cells, as well as enhances our understanding of metabolic syndromes such as T2D. Snx14 is linked to the cerebellar ataxia disease SCAR20, and this work provides new mechanistic insights into the lipid metabolism defects underlying SCAR20."
10760260,"ABSTRACT
Visceral obesity associates with insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are major risk factors for
the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although the cellular hallmark of obesity is
neutral lipid expansion in adipocytes, adipose tissue of obese mice and humans also accumulate
macrophages and other leukocytes. It is well accepted that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play a critical
role in systemic insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory mediators produced by ATMs are important
factors linking excess fat mass to insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and increased atherosclerotic risk.
Understanding the mechanistic basis of the pro-inflammatory ATM phenotype and ATM function is required to
devise new strategies for attenuating inflammation in metabolic disease.
Pro-inflammatory pathways in ATMs are commonly attributed to classical activation (exposure to bacteria, M1),
establishing molecular links between innate immunity and metabolic dysfunction. Recent studies, including
work from our lab, suggest that M1 activation fails to accurately represent the complex phenotype of ATMs in
vivo. We have shown that ATMs in obese adipose tissue from humans and mice adopt a unique ‘metabolically
activated’ (MMe) phenotype that is distinct from the M1 phenotype. Inhibiting MMe activation of macrophages
in vivo, attenuates ATM inflammation and improved glucose tolerance in mice. Moreover, the abundance of
MMe-like ATMs in visceral fat is positively correlated with insulin resistance in patients controlled for adiposity.
These findings underscore the pathophysiological importance of MMe macrophages in mice and humans.
Although MMe and M1 macrophages are both characterized by increased expression of NFkB-induced
inflammatory cytokines (ie. Tnfa, Il1b, Il6), our preliminary studies demonstrate that the upstream signaling
cascades driving NFkB activation are remarkably distinct. We provide evidence for a novel fatty acid-driven,
ROS-dependent, tyrosine-kinase mediated, pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in MMe macrophages.
Targeting this ‘metabolically activated NFkB’ (Me-NFkB) pathway at any point selectively attenuates
inflammatory cytokine expression by MMe macrophages.
Our work has positioned us to test the innovative hypothesis that this Me-NFkB pathway promotes ATM
inflammation and insulin resistance during obesity but is dispensable for inflammation required for
host defense during infection. Specifically, we plan to 1) Delineate the Me-NFkB pathway that drives
inflammation in MMe macrophages, and 2) Determine if targeting the Me-NFkB pathway improves insulin
sensitivity in mice. Overall, our proposed studies aim to demonstrate that macrophage inflammation in
metabolic disease can be attenuated without blocking these same cytokines in bacterial infection, a conceptual
milestone that may lead to an improved anti-inflammatory strategy in the clinic."

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy. Findings from SUDEP cases and from animal models of seizure-induced death suggest that central
apnea is critical for SUDEP. The mechanisms underlying seizure-induced inhibition of breathing during SUDEP
are unclear, and therefore, no known preventive strategies exist. Candidate: Dr. Brian Dlouhy, M.D. is a
neurosurgeon at the University of Iowa whose clinical practice focuses on the surgical treatment of epilepsy.
This proposal will be critical for his continued development as a neurosurgeon-scientist. This proposal will
allow his research to build upon his established interest in how the amygdala modulates the neural control of
respiration, will produce novel scientific results, and will provide critical training for Dr. Dlouhy. Dr. Dlouhy’s
ultimate goal is to become an R01-funded academic neurosurgeon-scientist with an independent research
program exploring neural control of respiration. Environment: The University of Iowa provides a rich training
environment for Dr. Dlouhy, and he has the full support from the Carver College of Medicine and his Chair in
the Department of Neurosurgery, Dr. Matthew Howard. Dr. Dlouhy has combined a unique team of mentors,
each leaders of their respective fields and who possess expertise instrumental to Dr. Dlouhy’s research plan:
amygdala circuitry, neural control of respiration, and human brain neurophysiology. Dr. George Richerson, is
an expert in the field of respiratory neurophysiology; Dr. John Wemmie is a leader in the field of amygdala
neurobiology; Dr. Matthew Howard is an expert in human electrophysiology. Research: Using intracranial
recordings in epilepsy patients, Dr. Dlouhy previously found that apnea occurs when seizures propagate to the
amygdala. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala can lead to apnea that is not associated with air hunger
(dyspnea) or urge to breathe. Volitional control of respiration is spared during stimulation-induced apnea;
subjects can speak normally and breathe when prompted. The underlying neural mechanisms by which the
amygdala influences the brain’s respiratory control network to mediate these effects or regulate normal
breathing are unknown. This proposal aims to identify and characterize neural activity within the amygdala and
its functional connections with brain respiratory control sites. Dr. Dlouhy will also study how experimental
neuromodulation of the amygdala affects volitional versus automatic breathing, and the perception of dyspnea.
These aims will be accomplished using a combination of direct electrophysiological recording and stimulation
techniques, electrical stimulation concurrent with fMRI, and respiratory physiology experiments. The proposed
scientific research plan, the excellent mentorship team of Drs. Richerson, Wemmie, and Howard, and the
enthusiastic support of the candidate’s institution and department will enable Dr. Dlouhy to launch a successful
career as an independent neurosurgeon-scientist."
10744787,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research addresses a critically important question in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
research: how defects in cerebellar circuits contribute to ASD. In particular, it examines the role of the
predominantly cerebellar gene ASTN2 in cerebellar circuit function and ASD-related behaviors. Copy
number variations (CNVs) in ASTN2 have been identified as a significant risk factor for ASD (Lionel et
al, 2014), suggesting that ASTN2 mutations such as those found in patients with ASTN2 CNVs, lead
to altered cerebellar synaptic function. In addition, we recently reported a family with a paternally
inherited intragenic ASTN2 duplication, which caused a heterozygous loss of function of ASTN2. The
family manifested a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD, learning difficulties and
speech and language delay (Behesti et al, 2018). Our cellular and molecular studies on mouse
cerebellum show that ASTN2 binds to and regulates the trafficking of multiple synaptic proteins,
including Neuroligins, which have been genetically linked to ASDs, and modulates cerebellar Purkinje
cell (PC) synaptic activity (Behesti et al, 2018). To provide a genetic model to study cerebellar circuit
function, we generated both a global loss of function Astn2 line and a floxed Astn2 line for conditional
knockout experiments. New, preliminary evidence indicates that PCs in mice lacking Astn2 have a
decrease in evoked excitation relative to inhibition in PCs and reduced PC dendritic spine density,
suggesting specific cerebellar circuit defects. In addition, preliminary evidence shows mild motor
deficits and defects in USVs and an open field assay, ASD-related behaviors. As other preliminary
findings do not indicate major defects in cerebellar development, we hypothesize that the behavioral
defects we observed relate to defects in the cerebellar circuitry with underlying changes in receptor
trafficking.
In the proposed research, we will 1) test how loss of Astn2 alters intrinsic excitability in PCs and
the synaptic efficacy of their presynaptic inputs from GCs and molecular layer interneurons, 2) use
proteomics to identify changes in the levels of synaptic proteins and live imaging to assess whether
such changes relate to changes in the rate of endocytosis, 3) compare changes in PC dendritic
branching as well as the regional distribution of PC spines in wild type and mutant animals to provide
insight on whether there are changes in the organization of PC inputs during the establishment of the
cerebellar circuitry, and 4) analyze changes in social behavior and ultrasonic vocalization in Astn2 wild
type, heterozygous and mutant animals. Taken together, the proposed research will provide a new
mouse model that allows us to link an ASD-related gene that is predominantly expressed in the
cerebellum with specific cerebellar circuit function and molecular pathways."

 Developing immunological memory is crucial for surviving deadly pandemics and while a better
understanding of how memory B and T cells form and function is being gained, there are still many gaps in
knowledge that limit our ability to create superior vaccines for several pathogens and new immunotherapies.
CD8+ T cells differentiate into heterogeneous subsets that display diverse functions, migration patterns and long-
term fates to protect against recurrent viral infection. How CD8+ T cells toggle between less-, intermediate- and
terminally-differentiated states remains a major question because this can influence the number and quality of
memory T cells that form. Great progress has been made in identifying transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic
writers and erasers that control CD8+ T cell differentiation states, particularly the long-lived, multi-potent memory
precursor (MP) cells and shorter-lived, terminally-differentiated effector (TE) cells. But it is unclear what
determines which enhancers open and close to permit the targeting of these factors to specific loci that ultimately
creates the molecular foundation for a range of gene expression patterns and differentiation states in T cells. To
address this question, we are focusing on the nucleosome remodeling BRG1/BRM associated factor (BAF)
complexes because they sculpt the chromatin landscape by moving or evicting nucleosomes to control
accessibility of TFs and other chromatin modifiers.
 There are three major BAF complexes (cBAF, ncBAF and PBAF), but BAF complexes lack intrinsic DNA-
binding specificity, and therefore how their chromatin remodeling activities are targeted within the genome
remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that lineage-specifying TFs target BAF complexes to discrete loci
in activated T cells, allowing BAF in turn, to make enhancers and promoters accessible for other TFs and
chromatin modifiers to regulate the spectrum of effector and memory CD8+ T cell fates that form during infection.
Our preliminary data show that cBAF is critical for the differentiation of TE cells in viral infection, demonstrating
that cBAF restricts CD8+ T cell plasticity and memory cell potential. This proposal aims to ‘map’ cBAF activity
across the genome to decode how it controls enhancer accessibility for specific TFs and other epigenetic
regulators such as CTCF and PRC2 in differentiating effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Conversely, we will
identify how certain TFs control cBAF recruitment to open-up sites that permit new differentiation states to arise.
This grant will also help us understand how nucleosome remodeling allows T cells to listen to certain signal
inputs while insulating themselves from others during infection to adopt specific differentiation states. Lastly, this
proposal will determine how the BAF complexes regulate the stability of or interconversion between T cell
differentiation states, and establish if cBAF, ncBAF and PBAF play cooperative or opposing functions in CD8+ T
cells. Broadly, the plasticity and rapid differentiation of CD8+ T cells responding to an infection in vivo offers an
unparalleled model for studying the biology of cell differentiation, lineage commitment, and reprogramming."

The overall goal of this five-year proposal for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award
is for me to develop into a productive, independent academic investigator in the field of reproductive immunology.
I completed an MD and a PhD in the field of basic cellular immunology, and I now seek to apply my interest in
dysregulated immunity to the public health threat of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes of pregnancy. I
graduated from the American Board of Pediatrics Accelerated Research Pathway for Residency in General, and
I completed my Fellowship in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and
the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). I joined the faculty of CHOP and Penn as an Attending Physician and
Instructor in the Division of Neonatology. My mentor for this award, Dr. Edward M. Behrens, is a physician-
scientist with a longstanding track record of scientific innovation and providing exceptional training to mentees
at all levels. As an internationally-recognized expert in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders, Dr.
Behrens’s work complements my own, and we are thus poised for productivity. My scientific advisory committee
includes scientists and physician-scientists with collective expertise in all aspects of the proposed work, from
placental biology to next-generation sequencing. I am also extremely fortunate to have the unreserved support
of CHOP and Penn, whose combined resources are unmatched.
Scientifically, this proposal focuses on roles for novel macrophages that I discovered under the guidance of Dr.
Behrens, called CD122+Macs, in normal and threatened pregnancy. Enriched in the uterus in mice and humans,
CD122+Macs express high levels of CD122, the hallmark of responsiveness to interleukin-15 (IL-15). These
novel Macs signal and function when exposed to IL-15, surprising because killer lymphocytes like natural killer
(NK) cells, not Macs, are the classical targets of IL-15. Disrupted homeostasis of IL-15 is associated with
numerous adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including preeclampsia and abnormal feto-placental growth but
through unknown mechanisms. Based on prior literature and my preliminary data, my central hypothesis is: IL-
15 exerts its influence over outcomes of pregnancy not only by maintaining NK cells but also by modulating the
inflammatory properties of novel CD122+Macs. The aims of this proposal will establish: 1) Mechanisms by which
CD122+Macs respond biochemically and transcriptionally to IL-15 and 2) IL-15-dependent requirements for
CD122+Macs in pregnancy in vivo. This proposal will close major gaps in knowledge regarding the mechanism
by which IL-15 acts on a novel cellular target to ensure maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. In
accordance with my career development objective to become a field leader in reproductive immunology, my
scientific proposal complements my current proficiency in cellular immunologic methods with training in
advanced reproductive biology and bioinformatic methods."

Memory is our most precious possession, yet we remain unable to prevent its loss in neurological diseases.
Here we examine a fundamental property of memory, which is its dependence on rapid de novo protein
synthesis, and identify pathways that contribute to normal memory and that underlie human memory loss. Dr.
Worley's laboratory pioneered the discovery and analysis of cellular immediate early genes (IEGs) as effectors
of protein synthesis-dependent memory, and has described mechanisms mediated by IEGs Arc, Homer 1a and
NPTX2 at excitatory synapses that strengthen active synapses and weaken inactive synapses. Emerging
concepts integrate their individual molecular and synaptic functions into a temporal program of sequential
cellular and circuit adaptations that encode information. The process begins with Arc and Homer1a, which act
cell-autonomously to control the synaptic expression of AMPA type glutamate receptors. A later process
mediated by secreted NPTX2 acts non cell-autonomously to strengthen excitatory synapses on a specific class
of inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin. Studies from mouse models indicate that down regulation of
NPTX2 results in increased neural activity that may occlude the ability of networks to encode information, as
well as a propensity for activity-dependent pathology including seizures and Aß amyloid generation.
Remarkably, aspects of this inhibitory network phase of information storage can be monitored in living human
subjects. Secreted NPTX2 is detected in human CSF and is prominently down-regulated in neurological
diseases in association with cognitive deterioration. We hypothesize that NPTX2 down-regulation provides a
rational biomarker of cognitive status in human neurological disease and may be is causal for certain memory
deficits. Basic studies will examine the unusual regulatory mechanisms that control NPTX2 expression and
function, and identify processes that result in its down-regulation in human brain. We will also gain deeper
insight into how IEGs, and NPTX2 in particular, contribute to memory using gain and loss of function
approaches in in vivo models of activity-dependent network plasticity including hippocampal replay. Stable,
long-term support will allow us to establish a multidisciplinary research program that leverages the strengths of
the Neuroscience community at Johns Hopkins for basic studies, and the Clinical Departments of
Neuropathology and Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins and Neurology at UC San Diego for translational aspects of
disease research. These studies will establish a novel, rational, and translatable concept for why humans lose
memory function in disease."
10863816,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Pathological anxiety commonly emerges during childhood and is a prominent risk
factor for the later development of anxiety and depression. To gain insights into mechanisms underlying the
risk to develop stress-related psychopathology, we developed a non-human primate (NHP) model, termed
anxious temperament (AT). This model allows for mechanism-based studies focused on the well-developed
prefrontal cortex (PFC) shared by NHPs and humans. In this regard, we demonstrated involvement of PFC
regions such as the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) in pathological anxiety, along with the amygdala and other
subcortical AT-related regions. Neuroimaging research points to hypoactivation of the dlPFC in anxiety and
depression. The dlPFC is involved in emotion regulation, working memory, and cognitive control, and
modulates activity of limbic regions, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Importantly, the dlPFC serves as
a treatment target for neuromodulation strategies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
and is thought to be involved in mediating the effects of various cognitive therapies. Because of the
evolutionary relatedness between NHPs and humans, especially manifested in PFC development, NHPs are
ideally suited for investigations of the role of the PFC in psychopathology. As a translational bridge, our
laboratory employs methods that provide an in-depth mechanistic understanding of brain alterations associated
with extreme anxiety, including behavioral phenotyping, functional and structural neuroimaging, RNA
sequencing and viral vector-mediated gene delivery. The focus of this proposal is to characterize the molecular
substrates of the dlPFC in relation to AT, to understand how its top-down regulatory influences impact the BLA,
a mediator of AT, and to explore the dlPFC as a treatment target. Our laboratory is uniquely suited for this
endeavor as we use an integrative strategy in NHPs with behavioral phenotyping, multimodal imaging,
chemogenetics, electron microscopy and single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq)."
10691338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We have shown that specific members of the matrix metalloproteinase family (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are
overexpressed in preterm laboring myometrium and that these enzymes exacerbate contractile responses in
human uterine smooth muscle. Therefore, MMP-2/9 may serve as therapeutic targets to block preterm labor.
Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous MMP inhibitors with subnanomolar affinity.
Considering multifaceted role of MMPs in cellular function, we aim to target specific MMPs (MMP-2/9),
responsible for uterine contraction in patients with preterm labor, with high selectivity while avoiding
interactions with other beneficial MMPs. Our central hypothesis is that selective TIMP protein-based
therapeutics can be developed to promote uterine quiescence. We will use protein engineering techniques
such as directed evolution to produce tocolytic drug candidates based on TIMP protein scaffold to treat preterm
labor. In Aim 1, we will use directed evolution and yeast surface display to engineer TIMP-based protein
scaffolds to improve binding selectivity toward MMP-2/9. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the ability of wild-type and
engineered TIMPs to reduce contractions in human uterine tissue. These data are expected to be significant
because they will provide the foundation for candidate drug testing in preclinical in vivo models of preterm
labor."
10918237,"Project Summary: Epidemiological and pathological studies have implicated lifestyle, microbial, and
environmental factors in prostate cancer etiology/risk. A potential link between these factors and prostate
carcinogenesis is the presence of chronic inflammation associated with atrophy (PIA) in prostates of aging
men. Yet, there is a paradox surrounding the role of the immune response in prostate cancer: “the
inflammation paradox”. On one hand, inflammation may be a driver of carcinogenesis. On the other, the
immune system is known to seek and destroy cancer cells. The majority prostate cancer lesions are “immune
deserts”, and ICIs are ineffective in most cases. Why is there an evidently strong immune reaction in non-
neoplastic regions in PIA, but a lack of a robust immune response in most prostate cancers? We hypothesize
that chronic inflammation in PIA represents evidence of an innate immune response that drives
carcinogenesis. However, in this inflammatory “proving ground”, only cells that can epigenetically
switch off this response can emerge to become aggressive neoplastic precursors. We hypothesize that
the paucity of immune infiltrates and lack of PD-L1, is evidence that prostate cancer cells develop a number of
different mechanisms that evade anti-tumor adaptive immunity. We postulate that additional cell non-
autonomous immune suppressive mechanisms enable disease progression. We propose 3 synergistic
Research Projects (2 basic,1 translational) to mechanistically test key questions stemming from our “proving
ground” hypothesis. In Proj 1 (Basic Science) we hypothesize that the STING induction in PIA drives acute
and chronic inflammation, leading to cell injury/cell death and proliferation. Second, in a subset of PIA cells,
epigenetic silencing of STING dampens of the immune response, allowing them to emerge as overt pre-
neoplastic cells. We will test this in animal models and in translational studies employing annotated and
molecularly characterized prostatectomies. The combination of PTEN loss and MYC copy number gain is an
independent predictor of poor outcome in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of MYC and
PTEN stimulates a cell non-autonomous immune evasion mechanism induced by the recruitment of immuno-
suppressive myeloid cells, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive fibroblasts. Proj 2 (Basic Science)
will test these hypotheses in animal models and in human tissues. Recently introduced imaging technologies
have raised the hypothesis that PET/CT imaging results may be able to predict molecular and tumoral micro-
environmental characteristics of aggressive prostate cancer. PET imaging for PSMA using PyL PET/CT has
been FDA approved for imaging high risk men prior to prostatectomy. In Proj 3 (Translational) we employ
PET/CT scanning for PSMA and combine this with mpMRI to address these hypotheses. Also in Proj 3 we will
apply newly developed/developing PET imaging agents to non-invasively and longitudinally study the extent of
M2 macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts in our mouse prostate progression cancer models."

10738729,"Project Abstract
As a critical part of adaptive immunity, generation of a highly diverse antibody repertoire begins with efficient
assembly of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) through V(D)J recombination during early B cell
development. At IgH locus, hundreds of VHs are widely-spread within a 2.4 Mb upstream region and multiple
DHs and JHs are located within a downstream 0.3 Mb domain. The lymphoid-specific RAG1/RAG2 (RAG)
endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination by cutting paired recombination signal sequences (RSSs) flanking
V, D, and J segments. A major knowledge gap is what mechanisms bring the RSS pairs, which are widely
separated in chromosomal distance, into spatial proximity for RAG cleavage. Although 3D genome topology
and long-range chromatin interaction at IgH locus has been implicated to play important roles in directing RAG
targeting, understanding the underlying mechanisms is greatly hindered due to lack of high-resolution
chromatin interaction maps and efficient systems to comprehensively characterize the putative regulatory
elements. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms driving functional
chromatin interactions mediating IgH RAG targeting. We have recently revealed a novel mechanism driving D
to JH recombination, whereby cohesin-mediated chromatin loop extrusion propels RAG scanning within D-JH
domain to promote physiologically deletional D-to-JH joining. With new compelling evidence, we propose that
this cohesin-mediated dynamic chromatin looping also operates during V to DJH recombination to ensure
generation of a diverse VH repertoire. With ultra-sensitive chromatin interaction and V(D)J recombination
assays combined with comprehensive genetic studies, in Aim1, we will address the functional importance of
chromatin loop extrusion in V to DJH recombination. In Aim2, we will determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying cohesin-mediated IgH long-range looping. In Aim3, we will identify and characterize novel IgH cis-
regulatory elements in directing RAG long-range targeting. These studies will be greatly facilitated by a novel
v-Abl pro-B cell line we generated that shows efficient IgH long-range chromatin looping and diverse VH
utilization across IgH locus. This will provide a flexible cell-based system to systematically characterize
complex interplay between IgH cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors, which is difficult to achieve in
animal models. Completion of this project will provide new mechanistic insights on how the dynamic 3D
genome topology harnesses a major immune process for generation of diverse antibody repertoires."
10739304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), an essential human protein, attaches N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to Ser/Thr
residues of proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Dysregulated OGT expression and activity have been linked
to insulin resistance, diabetic complications, and cancer, making OGT a possible drug target. Developing
approaches to exploit OGT as a target requires understanding its physiological roles and the mechanisms by
which it achieves them. Studies to probe OGT's physiological roles have relied heavily on knockdown (KD) or
conditional knockout (KO) experiments and the resulting phenotypes have been attributed to loss of O-GlcNAc.
However, OGT has a second catalytic activity and also binds cellular proteins that it does not glycosylate; some
phenotypes attributed to O-GlcNAc loss may therefore be due to loss of other activities. Previously, the
importance of OGT's catalytic and noncatalytic functions could not be assessed because methods to replace
endogenous OGT with variants did not exist. We have now established methods to replace OGT and will analyze
cells containing specifically altered copies to deconvolute OGT's physiological roles. Growth phenotypes,
quantitative proteomics, and biochemistry will be used to address several questions. Is OGT's noncatalytic
scaffolding activity a major driver of physiology and what pathways are linked to it? What is the shortest OGT
construct that still supports cell survival and what proteins does it glycosylate and bind? How do OGT's
substrates and binding partners interact with the TPR domain and are there opportunities to target specific
regions of this domain? We will also use a small molecule inhibitor we recently developed in a chemogenomics
screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities to loss of O-GlcNAc. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge about
one of the most fundamentally important proteins in mammalian biology, the work in this proposal will provide
the foundation to guide approaches to exploit OGT as a therapeutic target."
10755676,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Emerging evidence suggests a possible limitation of myocardial infarction (MI) size by acute mechanical
left ventricular (LV) support. A phase II clinical trial of mechanical LV unloading for acute MI has begun enrolling
after the recent completion of the Door-to-Unloading (DTU) STEMI Trial, which demonstrated both safety and
feasibility of this approach. This is an exciting area of medicine, where no new therapy has become clinically
routine for salvaging ischemic myocardium in MI after establishing coronary reperfusion. Despite the strong
enthusiasm and repeatedly shown efficacy in animal experiments, limited knowledge exists on how it limits infarct
size.
 This proposal focuses on understanding the physiological effects of mechanical LV support in acute MI
and its mechanisms of infarct size reduction. Our preliminary data suggests that mechanical LV support
increases ischemic myocardial tissue flow and perfusion by lowering LV diastolic wall stress. Based on our data,
we expect that “reduced diastolic wall stress” and “improved tissue perfusion” play the key roles in infarct size
reduction during mechanical LV support, rather than generally accepted mechanism that “reduced cardiac work”
limits infarct size.
 To examine our hypothesis, we will use large animal models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and
study the impact of acute LV support on coronary flow. In Aim 1, we will study the relationship between diastolic
LV wall stress and ischemic tissue perfusion under different LV loading conditions. Comprehensive assessment
of LV pressure/volume, coronary flow, and myocardial tissue perfusion during different LV loading conditions will
offer improved mechanistic understanding. In Aim 2, we will determine the factors that regulate ischemic tissue
perfusion during LV support. This Aim will define patient characteristics that benefit most from mechanical LV
support in acute MI. In Aim 3, molecular mechanisms of coronary flow regulation is examined by focusing on
microRNA-146. We expect that decreased diastolic LV wall stress increases exosomal microRNA-146 secretion
from the heart, which inhibits coronary vascular oxidative stress and improves tissue perfusion.
 Understanding the mechanisms of infarct size reduction is essential to improve patient selection for this
novel and promising, but invasive therapy for acute MI. Results of proposed studies will help define optimal
support settings, establish effective clinical protocols, and identify appropriate patient population."
10829946,"THE HARC CENTER: HIV ACCESSORY AND REGULATORY COMPLEXES
OVERALL SUMMARY
The HARC Center is an interdisciplinary program that aims to improve our understanding of the interactions
between HIV accessory and regulatory proteins and host cellular systems, with the ultimate goal to expand on
therapeutic targets and treatment modalities for HIV/AIDS. The HARC Center will focus its efforts on the
determination of structures of the accessory and regulatory proteins of HIV-1, with a focus on Tat, Vif and Rev,
in complex with their cellular partners, which have not been targets of HIV therapeutic modalities until now. A
better molecular understanding of the functions and mechanisms of virus-host complexes may reveal new
therapeutic strategies for intervention, including strategies of host-directed therapies, which may escape the
limitations of current drug regimens where mutations in the targeted HIV enzymes can diminish drug efficacy.
The HARC Center will determine the structures of these virus-host complexes using an integrated “Systems-to-
Structure” platform that includes (1) Discovery, through novel methods of functional proteomics and genetics
being developed in the HARC Center, (2) Validation through breakthrough CRISPR methods in primary T cells
as well as targeted biochemical and functional assays, and (3) Structure Determination using a synthesis of
innovative structural techniques developed in previous iterations of the HARC Center to address the large,
flexible, heterogeneous and sometimes membrane-associated systems we study.
The proposed Research Projects are centered around three themes that serve the Center’s goal. We will explore
how HIV inhibits Host restriction factors (Theme 1), study the factors regulating HIV transcription and latency
(Theme 2) and investigate virus-host Evolution (Theme 3) across three projects: Structure and evolution of Vif
and APOBEC3 (Project 1), Regulation of HIV transcription and latency (Project 2), and Genetics and
evolution (Project 3). The HARC Center projects are supported by 4 technology cores covering proteomic
approaches (Core 1 - Proteomics), CRISPR screens and endogenous tagging in primary cells to study virus-
host function (Core 2 - Genetics), structural biology using cryo-Electron Microscopy, X-ray screening and
antibody technologies to determine the structures of HIV virus-host complexes (Core 3 - Structural Biology),
and integrative modeling of virus-host complexes (Core 4 - Computational). The overall goals, progress, and
administration as well as outreach activities and communications will be overseen by the Administrative Core
(Core 5). The Developmental Core (Core 6) will provide training opportunities to young investigators and HARC
Center members and award the Collaborative Opportunity Fund to enhance the Center’s overall research theme."
10744766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved long-term survival across diverse cancer types
including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and others. However, ICI efficacy
relies on multiple cancer, host, and environmental variables, and only a small fraction of patients will respond to
these antibody drugs. Methods to improve ICI responsiveness are therefore a highly desirable, unmet clinical
need. Human-associated microbes are critical regulators of host health and disease including cancer treatment.
Clinical studies have shown that specific gut bacterial species correlate with improved patient outcomes of ICI
therapy, and colonization by these active microbes can directly elicit antitumor activity in preclinical animal
models. These observations raise a fundamental question: what are the microbial mechanisms that dictate ICI
efficacy? My previous work has demonstrated that a secreted bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase is sufficient to
broadly improve ICI therapy in murine models of cancer. Moreover, this phenotype could be recapitulated simply
by coadministration of a synthetic fragment that mimics the product of the peptidoglycan hydrolase. These
findings raise the exciting hypothesis that the production of microbial metabolites can directly improve ICI
efficacy. The main objective of my proposal is to examine enzymatic mobilization of bacterial PG metabolites as
a general mechanism of immune modulation during cancer ICI therapy. Aim 1 will explore host enzymes as new
factors that determine ICI efficacy. Aim 2 will produce chemical probes to discover ICI-activating bacterial
enzymes. Aim 3 will examine PG mobilization as a broad-spectrum strategy to potentiate ICI response in new
indications and against new checkpoint targets. To accomplish these goals, I have built a broad and
interdisciplinary skill set from my graduate work in chemical tool development with Dr. Linda Hsieh-Wilson at
Caltech and my postdoctoral work in host-microbial communication and cancer immunology with Dr. Howard
Hang at Scripps Research. To complement these strengths, I have established collaborations with leaders in the
fields of cancer immunotherapy and host-microbial interactions to provide training in new cancer model systems
and access to critical human-derived isolates, which will greatly aid in my efforts to establish the generality and
human relevance of PG mobilization during ICI treatment. In addition, I have proposed a comprehensive career
development plan to address any residual gaps in my abilities to effectively manage a laboratory, disseminate
our findings, and obtain independent funding. The acquisition of these skills during the K22 period will fuel
progress towards the completion of my proposal, providing key preliminary data needed for my first NCI R01
grant application. My scientific and career development enabled by the K22 award will help me to achieve my
long-term career goal to become a successful independent investigator at the intersection of host-microbial
communication and cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, these efforts may yield mechanistic insights and
translational avenues to understand and augment differential ICI responses in the clinic."

The overarching goal of the Northwestern Older Americans Independence
Center (OAIC, a.k.a. `Pepper Center') is to generate innovative research to
enhance primary care for medically complex, older adults with multiple chronic
conditions (MCC) to achieve optimal health, independence, and quality of life.
The Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) will be strategically linked to the
Research Education Component (REC), to i) identify, select, and fund junior
faculty, `Pepper Scholar' trainees with aging interests related to MCC; ii) mentor,
support and monitor Scholars through a formidable research project that will
provide them with sufficient preliminary data to help justify larger, independent
grant proposals and successfully advance their career.
The specific aims of the PESC are to:
Aim 1 Fund, initiate, and conduct a first wave of Pilot/Exploratory Studies (PES 1-3) that will engage junior
 investigators in Northwestern's OAIC research enterprise and generate innovative research designed
 to improve function and quality of life for older Americans with MCC.
Aim 2 Implement a process by which the Northwestern OAIC will solicit, peer-review, select and prioritize,
 support, and monitor at least 9 PES in the first 5 years of the Northwestern OAIC.
Aim 3 Encourage the development of competitive, external grant applications leveraging Pepper Scholar
 PES and others doing related work at Northwestern, in Chicago and throughout the OAIC Network.
Our Northwestern OAIC will award three waves of PES funding in Years 1-3 (minimum 9 awards, at least 3 per
year); Center leadership held a competitive solicitation for pilot projects and have identified the 1st wave of Pepper
Scholar PES: 1) Improving Transitions of Care from Skilled Nursing Facilities to the Community (Dr. Theresa
Rowe, Assistant Professor, Geriatrics); 2) Intelligent Personal Assistant Depression Management for
Homebound Older Adults ((Dr. Katherine O'Brien, Assistant Professor, Geriatrics); 3) An Emergency Department
-based Deprescribing Intervention for Older Adults with MCC (Dr. Howard Kim, Assistant Professor, Emergency
Medicine). The PESC will leverage processes and systems developed by the Northwestern University Clinical
and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) to manage PES competitions in Years 2 and 3; projects receive
up to $100,000 direct costs over 2 years with in-kind methodological support from our OAIC Resource Cores
(Design, Measurement, Analytics). Our trainee `pipeline' now extends to other academic institutions (UIC, Rush).
Our Information Dissemination Core will also aid Pepper Scholars in widely disseminating PES findings."

The objective of the Healthcare System & Technology Design Core
(`Design Core') is to adapt and extend new methods for the design,
deployment and evaluation of technology-enabled services tailored for
older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and their caregivers.
We will translate innovative research in digital health, building to scale for
sustainable implementation in diverse primary care practices.
Significant enthusiasm exists for technologies to transform healthcare service
delivery. It has been proposed that technologies can improve quality and reduce
the cost of healthcare, increase a patient's capacity to successfully engage in
treatment decision-making and self-care behaviors, improve communication with
a primary care team, moving treatment outside of clinics into peoples' homes and deploy a variety of devices to
help embed services into the fabric of peoples' everyday lives. Unfortunately, for all the evidence demonstrating
that such technologies can work under controlled conditions, we have identified several failures of technology
development and evaluation that hinder meaningful impact on healthcare services for older adults with MCC.
The Design Core's goal is to spur research on the integration of technologies into healthcare services for older
adults with MCC and their caregivers. Our specific aims are to:
Aim 1 Provide expertise to investigators in the design, evaluation and implementation of technology-enabled
 services for older adults with MCC and their caregivers.
Aim 2 Create a prototype technology-enabled service, designed for older adults with MCC and symptoms of
 anxiety or depression, to communicate more effectively with their clinicians.
Aim 3 Develop and disseminate a methodology guide that summarizes best practices for applying user-
 centered design (UCD) to optimize technology-enabled services for older adults with MCC.
The Design Core will become a national hub of expertise in the design and evaluation of technology-enabled
services for older adults with MCC (Aim 1). We will extend CBITs' expertise accumulated over 8 years and 70+
projects to support the design, development, and evaluation of technology-enabled services. We will devise an
MCC-specific technology design prototype through a `reference' project (Aim 2). We will then integrate our work
with other leaders nationally, producing an initial guide for supporting the development of technology enabled
services appropriate for primary care settings and among older adults with MCC (Aim 3)."

An essential resource for the Northwestern OAIC, the Data Analytics Core
(Analytics Core) will 1) provide high quality, timely and specialized
expertise on research design & analytic methods to `Pepper Scholar' junior
faculty trainees and other affiliated investigators; and 2) develop new
methods for determining older adults' health status and care complexity
to better inform clinical decision making and primary care services.
Our Analytics Core will include both quantitative and qualitative support in order
to provide OAIC investigators a comprehensive suite of tools for research aimed
at primary care innovations in caring for older adults with multiple chronic
conditions (MCC). The framework for delivering research support will be drawn
from the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) and it's Biostatistics
Collaboration Center. We will model two NUCATS programs: Mentors, and Vouchers. Analytics Core mentors
will build robust scientific teams by matching Pepper Scholars with specially selected faculty who have relevant
methodological expertise (quantitative and qualitative; e.g. biostatisticians, health economists, interpretivism/
phenomenology experts). Vouchers will provide OAIC investigators with right-sized, quantitative and qualitative
expertise to fund data analysis and programming support on innovative projects related to our OAIC mission to
address MCC in primary care. The specific aims and Development Projects (DPs) of the Analytics Core are to:
Aim 1 Enhance research on older adults with MCC by providing individualized, relevant, and robust
 quantitative and qualitative methodological support.
Aim 2 Advance research on older adults with MCC by developing analytic methodology optimized for
 examining populations who have multiple and complex morbidities.
DP1 will adjudicate accurate diagnosis states for older adults with MCC using multiple sources of data, including
structured and unstructured content from electronic health records (EHRs) and patient self-report. Models will
be developed to estimate a patient's `true condition'. DP2 will leverage data available with the EHR to develop
an accurate estimate of an older patient's `care complexity', quantifying the impact of MCC on older adults' risk
of functional decline. Our Core will also support other Resource Core (Design, Measurement) DPs and Eps."

The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Core (Measurement Core)
will support the Northwestern (NU) OAIC's education and research mission
through innovations in primary care-based, patient-reported outcomes
(PROs) assessment of older adults with MCC to align care with patient
priorities, monitor function and quality of life.
The Measurement Core, guided by our proposed NU Pepper Center's
underlying conceptual framework that seeks enhancements to primary care
services to deliver patient priorities-aligned care through scalable opportunities
1) for older adults with MCC and caregivers to share their values and
preferences with their care team; and 2) the timely, routine assessment of PROs.
We will do so by using our extensive, internationally-recognized expertise on PROs measurement, functional
outcomes and experience-of-care measures. The specific aims for the Measurement Core are to:
Aim 1 Provide measurement expertise for the Northwestern Pepper Center and serve as a resource to the
 Research Education Component for junior faculty seeking skills in measurement.
Aim 2 Conduct a developmental project (DP) to build an individualized, patient-centered system for primary
 care settings to monitor patient-reported outcomes among older adults with MCC.
Aim 3 Inform patient-based studies of MCC in primary care settings by leveraging an existing External Project
 (EP) on quality of life and multimorbidity in cancer and CKD patients.
We will support Pepper Scholar Pilot/Exploratory Studies, collaborate with other Resource Cores (Design,
Analytics) on aging-specific DPs and ongoing EPs, facilitate Information Dissemination and more generally serve
as an aging research methodological support resource for Chicago and the national OAIC community (Aim 1).
The Measurement and Design Cores will heavily interface to design a primary care-based, patient-centered
system to leverage EHR-based PROs measurement among older adults with MCC (Aim 2). Older patients will
be able to choose the PROs (e.g., pain, fatigue, nausea) that are the most important to them, allowing primary
care clinicians to more effectively prioritize patients' concerns (Aim 3). Finally, two ongoing EPs will be leveraged
to probe how symptom monitoring and rapid symptom management can better inform primary care management
of medically complex, older adults with MCC. Our Core is well suited to provide ongoing mentorship, research
support, broad scientific contributions, while offering measurement expertise to the entire national OAIC Network."
10746790,"The regulation of energy storage and utilization in adipocytes is a dynamic process that influences
overall energy homeostasis. Adipocytes store nutrients in lipid droplets as triglycerides (TG), and
mobilize them as needed. While these cells respond to sympathetic signals by increasing TG lipolysis
to release free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol, they also reabsorb FFA for re-esterification as triglycerides or alternatively for oxidation. Activation of b-adrenergic receptors and downstream
cyclic AMP signaling not only increases lipolysis, but also promotes fatty acid oxidation at the expense
of re-esterification, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesize
that catecholamines direct fatty acids for oxidation through regulation of signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and suppression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3
(GPAT3). Our preliminary data demonstrate that STAT3 specifically undergoes Ser727 phosphorylation at the lipid droplet in response to stimulation of b-3 adrenergic receptors and activation of lipolysis in adipocytes. The pool of lipid droplet-associated STAT3 binds to and inhibits GPAT3, effectively suppressing GPAT3-catalyzed re-esterification, to promote fatty acid oxidation. Adipocyte-specific Stat3 KO mice exhibit normal rates of lipolysis, but manifest a specific defect in lipolysis-driven oxidative metabolism, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity on high fat diet. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to expand insights into this novel function of STAT3, determining its metabolic consequences and delineating the mechanism of action. Aim 1 will focus on the stimulation of STAT3 phosphorylation by catecholamines in vivo, delineating the signaling pathway and specific kinase(s) responsible for the critical STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation event. The interaction of STAT3 with GPAT3 will be investigated in aim 2 using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays. Additionally, the mechanism by which STAT3 interaction results in suppression of GPAT3 activity will be investigated using in vitro GPAT activity assays and proteomic approaches. Finally, in aim 3, the physiological relevance of this novel regulatory pathway in the development of obesity in males and females will be examined. Additionally, non-phosphorylatable STAT3 S727A mutant adipocytes and mice will be employed to determine the in vivo role of this phosphorylation site. These studies will provide a more complete understanding of the regulation of lipolysis-driven oxidative metabolism, and will improve our understanding of this energy expending pathway in white adipose tissue. This may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to curtail obesity and the devastating metabolic diseases with which obesity is associated."
10767878,"The long-term objective of this project is to understand the mechanisms that distinguish human thermogenic adipocyte metabolism and contribute to metabolic health. During the past funding periods, we have been successful in three significant lines of research, as follows: a, We have developed a model to interrogate human adipose tissue physiological function in vivo in mice. b, We have discovered at least 4 distinct adipocyte subtypes differentiating from human mesenchymal progenitors, associated with specific adipose tissue functions and differentially enriched in human adipose tissue depots, and c, We have discovered LINC00473, a primate-specific long non-coding RNA specifically expressed in thermogenic adipocytes and involved in lipolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. LINC00473 levels are decreased in obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, consistent
with an important physiological role. We will now further elucidate molecular mechanisms by which LINC00473 regulates these pathways and its contribution to systemic energy homeostasis. Aim 1. To elucidate the mechanism by which LINC00473 interacts with lipid droplet and mitochondrial proteins and the effect of these interactions on fatty acid and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Using affinity isolation and mass spectrometry, we have identified lipid droplet and mitochondrial proteins that interact with LINC00473. We will now: 1A. Define direct and indirect interactions between LINC00473 and candidate proteins, using molecular approaches including ChIRP and APEX2 proximity labeling. 1B. Define the kinetics of assembly of LINC00473-protein complexes and their relationship with stimulated lipolysis and respiration, and 1C. Define the role of specific interactions though expression of LINC00473 mutant constructs. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that LINC00473 mediates a feedback mechanism to control lipolysis. We shall: 2A. Determine whether inhibition of LINC00473 expression upon PLIN1 depletion is due to enhanced basal lipolysis. 2B. Determine whether impaired stimulation of lipolysis in PLIN1 depleted cells is due LINC00473 supprssion. 2C. Determine whether PLIN1 depletion suppresses LINC00473 through decreased transcription, enhanced degradation or both. Aim 3. We will test the role of LINC00473 on thermogenic adipose tissue development and systemic glucose metabolism. Using techniques to generate human adipose tissue in mice we shall: 3A. Assess the effects of overexpression or knockdown of LINC00473 on dynamics of adipose tissue growth, vascularization, and innervation. 3B. Determine how adipose tissue developed from adipocytes expressing high or low levels of LINC00473 responds to physiological stimuli such as cold. 3C. Determine whether adipose tissue developed from adipocytes expressing high or low levels of LINC00473 differentially affects systemic glucose metabolism. This work will reveal molecular mechanisms that define human thermogenic adipocyte function, and how these mechanisms operate systemically and could impact metabolic disease."
10747378,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Mesenteritis is an inflammatory disorder of mesenteric tissues. It includes mesenteric
lipodystrophy (mesenteric fat necrosis), mesenteric panniculitis (chronic mesenteric fibrosis) and
mesenteric lymphadentis (mesenteric lymph node inflammation). It is diagnosed by an abdominal
computed tomography (CT) scan; however, the cause of mesenteritis remains unknown.
Emerging clinical evidence shows that mesenteritis is associated with gut inflammation such as
IBD and Chron's Disease. As innate myeloid cells, macrophages are distributed throughout the
whole organism and they play crucial roles in mediating tissue inflammation. Based on our
supporting data, we identified macrophage populations in serous membrane of gut mesentery
(termed membrane-associated macrophages). Thus, this research proposal seeks to address
fundamental questions regarding the tissue specific role of membrane-associated macrophages
in steady state and during mesenteritis induced gut inflammation. These include how membrane-
associated macrophages are reprogrammed by local niches and gut inflammation. To better
describe the role of these macrophages and its mechanism, we performed genetic studies of
membrane-associated macrophages that provided insight into their roles in steady state and gut
inflammation. These preliminary data results have led us to pursue to the following specific aims:
(1) Determine distinct homeostatic functions of membrane-associated macrophages and
local signals that shape their tissue specification; (2) Determine the role of membrane-
associated macrophages during mesenteritis induced by gut inflammation. We will perform
lineage tracing, cell ablation, transcriptomic analysis of membrane-associated macrophages and
in vivo live imaging to understand the role and dynamic interactions of macrophages with local
environment in steady state and during mesenteritis induced by gut inflammation. Ultimately, we
hope our studies will lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets to prevent mesenteritis as well
as gut inflammation."
10908469,"The coronary blood vasculature provides the heart with oxygen and nutrients, and removes
metabolic waste. Organization of this contiguous network requires the maturation of vascular
endothelial cells (EC) into arterial and venous fates based upon their location in the heart. While
many of the guidance factors that control vascular patterning have been defined, it is not clear
how spatial information controls cell behavior and identity. The epicardium is a single layer of
mesothelial cells on the surface of the heart that harbors an important population of cardiovascular
progenitors. We previously reported that epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
required for coronary EC maturation. New preliminary data reveals profound EC patterning and
specification defects upon disruption of the epicardium, culminating with the inappropriate
localization of angiogenic ECs in the sub-epicardium. To define the cellular and molecular
mechanisms linking epicardial EMT to EC patterning and maturation we performed single cell (sc)
RNA-sequencing of epicardium-derived cells and ECs isolated from the embryonic mouse heart
at key developmental timepoints. This study defined epicardium-derived “shepherding” and
“guidepost” cells that express unique angiogenic chemokine signatures. We provide in vitro and
in vivo evidence that suggest a common mechanism controls EMT and the expression of genes
that encode important guidance cues. We also find that EC localization and arteriovenous fate
specification may be controlled by a common molecular mechanism. Based on previously
published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that EMT controls the expression and
localization of epicardium-derived chemokines that coordinate coronary EC patterning
and AV fate specification in the fetal heart. The current study will interrogate this novel
paradigm of epicardium-directed coronary EC patterning (localization and branching) and
maturation (arteriovenous specification). Here, we will use genetically modified mice, time-lapse
live embryo multi-photon imaging, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, and cell and molecular
biology approaches to: 1) Define a common mechanism regulating EMT and the expression of
genes that encode EC guidance cues; and 2) Interrogate the mechanisms coordinating
epicardium-directed EC patterning and AV fate specification. We expect these studies will provide
important insights into the mechanisms that control vascular patterning. This study may also
advance our understanding of the developmental origins of coronary artery disease, and lead to
therapeutic strategies that stimulate revascularization and repair of ischemic heart tissue."
11139689,"In less than a year, the COVID Moonshot open science collaboration developed a novel non-peptidomimetic
small molecule orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (Mpro) inhibitor with potent antiviral activity
starting from a high-throughput fragment screen. To achieve this, rapid cycles of medicinal chemistry were
performed, directed by a team composed of industry veterans with over 100 years of accumulated industry
experience. The team leveraged Al-driven synthesis planning for rapidly sourcing molecules from CROs,
high-throughput co-crystallisation data generated with just 1 week turnaround, and the world's largest
computing network to perform hundreds of thousands of alchemical free energy calculations. About 2000
compounds were synthesized and assayed, and more than 450 X-ray structures solved in the process,
generating rich structure-activity and property relationships for multiple lead series with distinct chemotypes.
With a SARS-CoV-2 specific Mpro inhibitor now progressing to IND-enabling studies, the COVID Moonshot
aims to harness the infrastructure it has built for pandemic preparedness.
Our Lead Optimization proposal (Project 5) for the ASAP Center is to progress six early lead compounds
developed by Project 3 and 4, towards readiness for preclinical development (Project 6). We anticipate that up
to three preclinical packages will be developed within the Center, and three made available externally. Within
Project 5, we will enhance and scale up existing lead optimization processes, building on the resources and
collaborator network that rapidly produced and progressed the COVID Moonshot SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor
en route to the clinic. Further, we will harness the knowledge and expertise of our new collaborators, lending
cellular assays and antiviral models that are required to develop new direct acting antivirals for coronaviridae,
flaviviridae and picornaviridae (Project 1 and antiviral core). In addition, we will develop our technology base:
the co-location of integrated, tiered in vitro - in vivo ADMET screening cascades with our synthesis partners will
increase efficiency, and exploiting cloud based material logistics and activity databases will optimize shipment
and data logistics.
We will work in a fully open-science model, to ensure resulting therapies can be produced at cost by
manufacturers world-wide and secure long term availability for future pandemics whenever they arise. In
addition to molecules that will be developed for pandemic preparedness and ultimate patient benefit, the
integrated lead optimization datasets, with linked ADMET, protein-ligand structures underpinning designed
compounds, synthesis routes, and antiviral assay, are anticipated to become a vital resource in the
improvement of oral direct acting antiviral discovery as well as a foundational teaching resource."
10740898,"Abstract (Summary): In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the related motor
neuron disease (MND) primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), deficits in motor control occur as a consequence
of the degeneration of corticospinal neurons (CSNs). ALS is more common than PLS, and genetically
more complex, with familial forms associated with causal mutations in over 30 ALS-related genes. In
these ALS mice, however, dysfunction and degeneration of CSNs have not been carefully examined,
and data implicating corticospinal (CS) circuits in these model systems of ALS is surprisingly limited.
One reason for this may be the very different pattern of connectivity between CSNs and spinal MNs in
humans vs. mice. In humans, CS axons located in the ventral and lateral funiculi form direct
connections with both MNs (cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections) and interneurons. In contrast,
CS axons in mice are located mainly in the dorsal funiculus and only form indirect connections with
MNs through pre-motor interneurons. Therefore, we will use PlexinA1 mutant mice which have CM
connections together with ALS mouse models to analyze CS circuits. Our central hypothesis is that
progressive defects in CS circuitry in ALS mice will be exacerbated by the establishment of CM
connections. In Aim 1, we will determine formation of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 2, we will determine function of CS circuits in ALS mouse models with CM
connections. In Aim 3, we will examine skilled movements in ALS mouse models with CM connections.
These studies will provide a model system to study mechanisms of CS degeneration in ALS/PLS, and
to test novel therapeutics targeting upper motor neuron dysfunction in these disorders."

Each year over 525,000 children under age five are killed by diarrhea caused by infectious disease.
Cryptosporidiosis, the second most frequent cause of childhood diarrhea, is an infection caused by
colonization of the intestines by the eukaryotic parasites, Cryptosporidium parvum or C. hominis, and
particularly damages and kills malnourished children. In contrast to other Apicomplexans (such as Plasmodium
or Toxoplasma), there is no required insect vector or animal host, since parasites can be transferred directly
from human to human through the fecal-oral route. Despite the high incidence and significant impact on
malnourished children, there are no effective treatments for cryptosporidiosis.

acid, to the N-terminal glycine residue of proteins co-translationally, which contributes to targeting the substrate
protein to membrane regions. NMT has been validated as a drug target in fungal and parasitic diseases,
including malaria and leishmaniasis. We hypothesized that NMT high-throughput screening (HTS) hits effective
against Plasmodium would also be active against Cryptosporidium and tested the top eight hits against
Cryptosporidium parvum NMT (CpNMT). Of those top eight hits, three were effective against the purified
enzyme and one showed activity against the parasite in vitro. A follow-on synthetic chemistry and structure-
based drug design program further developed these hits into a lead series (called Series-2) of highly effective
(~10nM IC50) inhibitors with 500-1000 X selectivity over the human enzyme. The two most promising leads
from the Series-2 scaffold were then tested in a mouse model of infection and found that both molecules
completely cleared infection. These data serve to chemically validate NMT as a druggable target for the
treatment of Cryptosporidiosis. In this proposal we intend to further develop lead compounds in order to
improve drug-like characteristics in preparation for preclinical drug development."
10897693,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Non-cholera Vibrio (NCV) species represent a notable and increasing threat to human health and food safety.
The biofilms formed by Vibrio species are robust and highly relevant to host infection. Biofilms are tightly
regulated communities of matrix-associated bacteria and are a major component of bacterial pathogenesis
including drug resistance. Since an estimated 75% of bacterial infections involve biofilms, it is crucial to better
understand how biofilms are formed. In this application, I propose to elucidate the molecular mechanism of an
unusual regulatory protein necessary for controlling NCV biofilm formation. This protein is conserved in NCVs
and controls the production of symbiosis polysaccharide (Syp), a component of the biofilm matrix involved in
host infection. Based on preliminary findings, this protein has an atypical mode of action compared to well
characterized homologs. My fundamental hypothesis is that this NCV biofilm regulator protein uses a novel
mechanism to control biofilm formation and will challenge our current understanding of this family of proteins.
My hypothesis will be addressed through two specific aims: 1) probing the protein’s function using biochemical
and structural characterization studies, and 2) uncovering its position in the regulatory network by identifying
binding partners. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on a system that is crucial for biofilm
formation, and to date, the system has only been investigated using cellular and genetic approaches. The
structure-function approach proposed here will provide essential information needed to fill our knowledge gaps.
The project is significant because it will provide a deeper understanding of the regulation of host-associated
biofilms from the rising threat of NCV infection. Ultimately, the work proposed will answer key questions related
to the molecular mechanisms of a protein within a critical and conserved pathway that regulates host-relevant
biofilms. Support from this K22 award will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator by providing me
with resources to generate data and publications that will strengthen my competitiveness for future funding."

To understand speech, the human brain must parse and transform a noisy acoustic signal into meaningful
linguistic content, including phonemes, syllables, words, and sentences. This involves determining the timing of
important acoustic events, such as the onset of a sentence or a phrase. Following detection of these onsets,
the content of the sentence must be determined. The posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG)—including the
classic “Wernicke’s area”—is critical to this process, but until recently, little was known about its functional
organization, and in particular how this functional organization changes throughout development. Our recent
work showed that a spatially discrete region of the pSTG is critical for indicating when a sentence or phrase
begins. This region is distinct spatially and functionally from more anterior “sustained” areas that encode
phonetic feature information throughout a sentence. Functionally, both posterior onset and anterior sustained
regions show short and long temporal integration times, respectively, suggesting complimentary roles in
natural speech processing. Here, we propose an innovative approach using rare datasets where neural activity
is recorded directly from the human auditory cortex and speech-related areas in pediatric patient participants
undergoing clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. This method overcomes the spatial and temporal resolution
limitations of other noninvasive procedures, and provides a rare window into the function of the human auditory
cortex. The proposed study will use high resolution intracranial recordings to investigate how the brain detects
acoustic onsets in natural speech sound mixtures, and how neurophysiological responses to these sounds
change from early childhood to adolescence. Furthermore, we will investigate how these responses to onsets
are modulated by context, including during attention and for self-generated sounds. In addition to providing
insight into the basic functional organization of the human auditory cortex and cortical mechanisms for auditory
scene analysis, this research has important implications for the development of a speech brain computer
interface. Our results could also inform how speech and language are processed in natural contexts, which has
implications for the treatment of developmental language disorders, auditory processing disorder, dyslexia,
autism, and aphasia."

Project Summary
 Normal heart valve structure and composition are established during development, and congenital
valve malformations, such as those arising from mutations in structural protein genes as in Marfan syndrome
(MFS), have progressive disorganization and dysfunction over time. Myxomatous valve disease (MVD) is
characterized by thickening and progressive degeneration of valve leaflets, leading to valvular regurgitation
and reduced heart function. While fluctuating mechanical forces related to blood flow act on the valve leaflets
in development and disease, it is not known how these forces affect valve structure and function at the
molecular level. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) demonstrated valve endothelial cell (VEC)
subpopulations localized in regions of heart valve leaflets with distinct blood flow profiles. One of these VEC
subpopulations expresses Prox1, a mechanosensitive transcription factor, but its roles in heart valve
development, homeostasis, and disease are unknown. Moreover, Prox1 expression is expanded to the
laminar flow side of myxomatous valves in a mouse model of MFS with reported valve regurgitation. We
hypothesize that Prox1 expression in heart VECs, subject to Wnt/β-catenin activation, is critical for valve
leaflet organization during development and for maintenance of valve structure and ECM organization in
adults. The Aims are: 1) Determine the requirements for Prox1 in heart valve development and homeostasis.
2) Determine if Prox1 mislocalization in myxomatous valve leaflets contributes to macrophage infiltration and
MVD progression. 3) Determine if Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in valve endothelial cells is required for localized
Prox1 expression and endothelial junction maturation. The long-term goals of these studies are to define
mechanosensitive regulatory mechanisms of heart valve development and pathologic remodeling, thus
leading to the development of new nonsurgical therapeutic approaches for myxomatous valve disease."
