The efforts undertaken as part of this Cooperative Agreement will further increase the capacity of Wisconsin’s food
safety regulatory programs to protect public health and to improve the food safety system. The US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) developed the RRT program as a tool to promote uniformity and cooperation among federal,
state and local agencies during food related emergencies. Maintaining and improving Wisconsin’s RRT will enhance
Wisconsin’s ability to detect, respond and abate human and animal food related emergencies through a coordinated
response utilizing the Incident Command System as an organizational structure. The framework provided by the RRT
will allow Wisconsin to establish a coordinated response program to reduce hazards in human and animal food firms
and markets.
Wisconsin first became a volunteer RRT state in 2015. During that time Wisconsin committed itself to laying the
groundwork and establishing the partnerships needed to have a successful RRT program, by conducting baseline
assessments, identifying and engaging core food safety partners, as well as sending staff the national meetings,
trainings, and workgroups. In 2018, Wisconsin was awarded the RRT cooperative and systematically began
working through the RRT developmental phases. Wisconsin’s RRT program reached full maturation at the
completion of year three of the cooperative agreement and since then has been a fully functioning RRT program.
This two-year cooperative agreement will allow Wisconsin to continue its efforts to implement its strategic
improvement plan to achieve, maintain and enhance its fully-functioning RRT program. All project goals,
milestones, objectives and required deliverables for the RRT cooperative agreement have been incorporated into its
Strategic Improvement Plan and annual plan of work. Highlights of planned activities include:
• Maintaining and continually improving our emergency response framework through evaluation of RRT
 responses and identification of continuous improvement projects;
• Improving integration and national capacity by recruiting local public health agencies into Information
 Sharing Agreement - Long-Term Limited Scope Food, Feed and Cosmetics 20.88 Agreement, thus
 minimizing operational communication barriers;
• Gathering and sharing data to support prevention and surveillance by utilizing the National Environmental
 Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) process of conducting environmental assessments as well as
 implementing Dead End Ultra Filtration water sampling techniques;
• Communicating RRT impact by seeking out opportunities to share food safety advancements through
 regional presentations, as well as, journal articles and academic papers."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Unfortunately limited therapies
for MCL are currently available suggesting a need to further unravel molecular mechanisms regulating
transformation and progression of the disease. The majority of MCL patients have a t(11;14) translocation
leading to overexpression of CyclinD1 resulting in extensive proliferation and block in differentiation originating
in the mantle zone of the lymph node, however additional mutations are necessary for transformation. Next
generation sequencing has identified a number of novel mutations in MCL patients including the ubiquitin E3
ligase UBR5. E3 ubiquitin ligases serve as the substrate-recognizing component for protein degradation by the
ubiquitin proteasome system. In a cohort of 196 MCL patients UBR5 was the 3rd most frequently mutated gene
and ~60% of the mutations were found within the HECT domain of UBR5, which can accept and transfer ubiquitin
molecules to the substrate. In order to understand the role of UBR5 HECT domain in B-lymphoid development
we generated a conditional mouse using novel CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. Loss of the HECT domain leads to a
block in pre-germinal center B cells in the spleen with a reduction of both B1 and marginal B cell subsets. In
addition, follicular B cells in the spleen are phenotypically abnormal and fail to terminally differentiate to anti-
body secreting plasma cells. Proteomic studies reveal up-regulation of proteins associated with mRNA splicing
via the spliceosome in B cells lacking the HECT domain of UBR5. These studies suggest that 1) cooperation of
UBR5 mutations along with expression of cyclinD1 may led to disease progression of mantle cell lymphoma (Aim
1), 2) understanding molecular mechanism of UBR5 mutations could provide potential therapeutic targets in MCL
(Aim 2), and 3) aberrant expression of U5 spliceosome proteins block B cell maturation and promote
lymphomagenesis (Aim 3). In this application we propose studies to understand the role of UBR5 and its
interacting proteins in B-cell lymphomagenesis and define molecular pathways regulated by UBR5 in B-cells.
Our goal of the proposed studies is to provide insights to mantle cell lymphoma transformation, progression and
potential future therapeutics targets."

The overall goals of this diversity supplement are to develop the candidate’s background in biological and
translational sciences and position her to be a strong candidate for future graduate degree training. The
supplement focuses on three main approaches: Didactic research experiences, to provide exposure to a wide
breadth of ground-breaking science; hands-on laboratory experiences, to provide a realistic view of the trials and
tribulations of research as well as develop presentation skills and confidence to critically discuss scientific
questions; and direct mentoring, to provide tailored tutorials about the scientific process, molecular and cell
biology, and methods for studying genetic diseases of the skeleton. In addition, these sessions will assist with
career development and planning. The candidate will work on two aims over the course of two years. These
aims are related to the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) work for compound screening in Aim 1 of the parental
R01 grant. Aim 1A: Create a series of isogenic human iPSC lines carrying the GNASR201H or GNASWT gene; Aim
1B: Use genetic modification to understand novel pathway interactions between GNAS and ACVR1 in human
iPSCs. The candidate will utilize a series of gene editing strategies we recently developed to carry out these aims.
Together, the research products of this supplement will help address one of the biggest challenges with any iPSC
model system – having robust isogenic biological replicates to demonstrate reproducibility and confirm that the
pharmacologic approaches are recapitulating the expected biological functions. The lines generated here will be
helpful for the parental Aim 1 by providing these replicates. In addition, these results will provide an opportunity
to explore a newly identified potential interaction between the GNAS and ACVR1 pathways. Elucidating these
interactions has the potential to find alternate strategic targets that could be used to manage diseases that affect
each pathway. Finally, at the completion of this experience, the candidate will be well positioned as a strong
candidate for further training in a graduate program in the sciences."

Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-
income countries (LMICs). Novel digital technologies, including the use of mobile health tools (mHealth),
machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI), wearables devices, and clinical decision support tools, hold
great promise for improving the care for children with sepsis in LMICs by overcoming human resource and
infrastructural barriers. However, digital health research among critically ill children in LMICs presents novel
ethical issues including concerns regarding understandability, data security, privacy, bias, and informed
consent. Additionally, ethical frameworks and policies regarding the use of these technologies (which are often
not cleared for medical use) are nearly non-existent in LMICs due to a lack of regulatory oversight and
governance specific for digital health research.
Critically ill children in LMICs are a special population who require careful consideration given their
vulnerability, reliance on caregivers for decision-making, and high variability in caregiver awareness and
exposure to digital technologies. Successful development of these novel technologies to improve patient health
relies on understanding the attitudes of key stakeholders, and barriers and facilitators to ethical
implementation, to ensure the use of best practices for facilitating trust and participation in research using
these technologies, while respecting patient/caregiver autonomy.
This project integrates new bioethical aims, research, and capacity building into an ongoing parent R33 study,
which has an objective to develop a novel wearable-linked mHealth tool deploying machine learning predictive
models for pediatric sepsis decision support in Bangladesh. This proposed research will examine and elucidate
the ethical concerns of caregivers of children with sepsis, as well as stakeholders in bioethical research
decision-making (clinicians, researchers, ethical review board members, administrators), related to research
using digital health technologies for clinical care among children with sepsis in LMICs. Knowledge gained from
this study will aid in developing an evidence base upon which to build policies, tools and approaches to aid in
the development and implementation of use of digital technologies for research in Bangladesh and other
similar LMIC settings. With guidance from a leading pediatric bioethics expert consultant, this collaborative
research between the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and Rhode
Island Hospital / Brown University, will help augment icddr,b’s reputation in research ethics in South Asia, and
build a hub of bioethical research expertise on digital tools for studies conducted in LMICs."
11064271,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 This goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a multi-level intervention focused on the health
system, clinicians, and patients that could increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates by incorporating
behavioral economic principles. Through partnership with the University of Pennsylvania Health System
(UPHS), we will develop a centralized program of inreach and outreach that includes nudges to clinicians
facilitated by the electronic health record (EHR) and direct outreach to patients’ homes. Through these
interventions, we will evaluate the effectiveness of offering sequential choice of colonoscopy then FIT
compared to colonoscopy only. Through this intervention, we will include behavioral insights such default
options and effort reduction.
 We will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial with factorial design across 30 primary care practices among
20,000 patients ages 50-72 who are not up-to-date on screening. Practices will be cluster randomized to
colonoscopy only or sequential choice (colonoscopy then FIT) alerts in the EHR (Aim 1). At the same time,
patients in all of these practices will be randomized to usual care, direct colonoscopy outreach, and sequential
choice outreach of colonoscopy then FIT (Aim 2). Outreach will be provided annually for the 3 year period of
the trial. The primary outcome is adherence to CRC screening. Our hypotheses are that sequential choice will
increase adherence to screening, and patient outreach will be superior to EHR nudges alone.
 We will partner closely with the primary care network at UPHS and leverage the EHR to facilitate the
clinic alerts and patient outreach. Our team includes a team of experienced investigators with expertise in
colorectal cancer screening, behavioral economics, health behavior, clinical trials, and health care delivery
science. By embedding the project with clinical operations in a pragmatic trial, this approach could be
applicable to other cancer screening and preventive health activities."
11064272,"PROJECT SUMMARY (funded parent award)
Maternal immune activation (MIA) during prenatal or postnatal development significantly increases the risk for
offspring neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) later in life. Growing evidence suggest that regardless of the
MIA stimuli (infectious or environmental), offspring exhibit an enhanced risk for lifelong neuropathology defects
ranging from reduced brain volume to alterations in neurocircuit organization. The brain extracellular matrix-
containing chondroitin and dermatan sulfate-glycosaminoglycans (CS/DS-GAGs) are key regulators of brain
development and can be biochemically altered by neuroimmune responses. Defects in CS/DS-GAG abundance
and/or sulfation patterning (4S (CS-A), 2S4S (CS-B/DS), 6S (CS-C), 2S6S (CS-D), 4S6S (CS-E), 0S (CS-O))
result in the manifestation of similar neuropsychiatric behaviors as reported in offspring affected by MIA, but
whether and how MIA affects offspring brain matrix is unknown. By employing a novel laser capture
microdissection coupled mass spectrometry methodology (LMD-LC-MS/MS), our Preliminary Data provide the
first evidence for inter- and intra-regional differences in CS/DS-GAG sulfation patterns differences throughout
the developing mouse and non-human primate (NHP) brain. Specifically, the hippocampus exhibits a significant
increase in both developmental 6S (CS-C) and 2S6S (CS-D) CS/DS isomers compared to the cortex, implying
that the hippocampus remains developmentally plastic long after the maturation of adjacent regions. Moreover,
we show that infectious Zika virus MIA during gestation in NHPs decreases the abundance of the developmental
2S6S (CS-D) axonal growth factor attractant isomer in the hippocampus, suggesting stunted neurocircuit
formation after infectious MIA, while the non-infectious maternal high fat diet (mHFD) MIA during lactation in
mice decreases the abundance of the developmental 6S (CS-C) plasticity isomer in the hippocampus, suggested
accelerated early maturation of hippocampal neurocircuits in response to non-infectious MIA. The implication
that both infectious and non-infectious MIA insults influence the spatiotemporal regulation of brain CS/DS-GAG
sulfation patterns fits a global interconnecting theory linking a range of MIA insults with changes in offspring brain
neurodevelopment through regional re-coding of CS/DS-GAGs. From these results, we propose to 1) determine
how MIA exposure affects spatiotemporal regulation of offspring CS/DS-GAGs and link these changes to NDDs
later in life, 2) mechanistically investigate how these MIA-induced changes in offspring CS/DS-GAGs influence
glycan-protein interactions involved in neurodevelopment, and 3) engineer a state-of-the-art nanopore
sequencing technology capable of single-molecule sequencing of biological CS/DS-GAGs to discover glycan-
protein binding elements. This multidisciplinary proposal has important translational potential to clarify how MIA
exposure leads to neuropsychiatric illness through changes in CS/DS-GAG sulfation patterning during childhood
neurodevelopment, and provides valuable targets in the prevention and treatment of mental health disease."
11064431,"ABSTRACT
Of the 6,500 known rare diseases, only about 5% have U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.
In cancer, rare tumors account for approximately 20% of cancer incidence but often lack established therapeutic
regimens. Hence, gaining a molecular understanding of rare tumors is key for development of effective therapies.
This multi-investigator proposal investigates oncogenic mutations that activate protein kinase A (PKA) to promote
defective cell signaling in rare endocrine and hepatic tumors.
Targeted therapeutics have transformed care for patients with rare cancers by targeting oncogenic mutations in
protein kinases. PKAc-driven cancers are challenging to target in this way because this broad specificity kinase
controls myriad physiological processes. Consequently, selective PKAc inhibitors have been relegated to the
role of tool compounds rather than clinically viable drugs. Thus, alternative strategies must be developed to treat
PKAc-driven cancers. Our preliminary profiling of oncogenic PKAc mutants provide compelling evidence that
PKAc engages downstream protein kinase cascades that impact translation in adrenal and hepatic tumors. We
also observed increased mRNA translation as an emerging hallmark of these PKAc driven malignancies. These
findings have forged a working hypothesis that PKAc-driven cancers can be treated by targeting downstream
effectors such the RNA helicase eIF4A rather than globally blocking the catalytic activity of the kinase.
Three specific aims will test this transformative premise. 1) Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of cells
expressing oncogenic PKAc variants that underlie Carney complex, Cushing’s adenoma and fibrolamellar
carcinoma will elucidate downstream signaling elements that impinge on mRNA translation. 2) Molecular
approaches will investigate new properties imparted by the DNAJ-PKAc-chimeric kinase in fibrolamellar
carcinoma that may confer resistance to chemically induced apoptosis. 3) Clinically relevant compounds and
novel bivalent inhibitors will dissect the mechanism of eIF4A dependence in PKAc-driven malignancies and
patient derived (PDX) models of fibrolamellar carcinoma. This proposal not only builds on a solid foundation of
PKAc research, but also affords an unparalleled opportunity to discover, develop and validate drug targets for a
group of patients in dire need."
11064650,"The parent grant studies a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor
(AHRR) gene that may influence the lung cancer risk of Black/African American (B/AA) subjects. AHRR is a
negative regulator of detoxification responses involved in the metabolism and elimination of tobacco smoke
carcinogens. B/AA men have the highest rate of lung cancer death compared to all other groups, with a 12%
higher lung cancer incidence rate and a 15% higher lung cancer death rate than White/European (W/E) men.
Elevated AHRR expression has been implicated in lung cancer risk; thus, a SNP that improves AHRR function
would likely increase lung cancer risk. We have identified a missense SNP, rs35008248, in AHRR exon 4 that,
while rare in W/E subjects, is present one third of B/AA subjects. The SNP was not included in most previously
used arrays. Preliminary data from GWAS explorer suggests an association with smoking in B/AA males
(p=3.87E-3) and with smoking-related cancers in B/AA subjects (p=0.04927). B/AA individuals comprise only a
small fraction of the subjects (<4%); power to determine the role of SNPs in this group has been limited. AHRR
is a negative regulator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Upon tobacco smoke exposure, AHR binds to
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dimerizes with ARNT and the dimer binds to xenobiotic response elements
(XREs), switching on detoxification genes. In a negative regulatory loop, AHR/ARNT turns on AHRR, which also
binds to ARNT, competing with AHR/ARNT for XRE sites, dampening the detoxification response. The reference
allele of rs35008248 (T) encodes a leucine at position 114, while the alternate allele (C) encodes a turn-inducing
proline. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) suggests the SNP might affect AHRR function. In
the co-crystal structure of the AHRR/ARNT heterodimer, leucine 114 borders a loop entwining ARNT. We
hypothesize that a proline at position 114 constrains AHRR loop conformation, thereby stabilizing AHRR/ARNT
interaction, increasing the repressive effect of AHRR/ARNT heterodimers, interfering with the detoxification
response, and increasing lung cancer risk of B/AA smokers, 34% of whom carry the minor allele. Here we
will test for associations between genetic variation at AHRR and lung cancer outcomes using existing large-scale
genetic data in B/AA individuals (Aim 1), use CRISPR-based genome editing to engineer the minor allele into
the genome of our unique immortalized human alveolar epithelial cell lines and assess its effects on the response
to tobacco smoke in vitro (Aim 2), and test whether the amino acid at position 114 affects the kinetics of the
interaction between AHRR and ARNT (Aim 3).Together, the specific aims of this pilot project will provide insight
into the role of a potential functional SNP in AHRR that is common in B/AA subjects and that could help explain
their increased lung cancer risk. The Diversity Supplement will give Diego Velarde training in research in genetic
risk (Aim 1), CRISPR engineering/transcriptomics (Aim 2), and recombinant protein production/intermolecular
protein analysis (Aim 3). Most importantly, it will provide key training in cancer health disparities research."
11064653,"Project Summary/Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally treated with chemotherapy, which only achieves incomplete
response. Relapsed disease has no new treatment options, and the long-term outcomes are poor. The central
premise of our proposal is that the TNBC’s survival dependency on high glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) functions, elevated NADPH and GSH levels, and aberrantly active
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), which are adaptation mechanisms, makes them
therapeutically vulnerable to two chemotypes: R001, R002, and H182, H333. R001/R002 (natural products)
moderated the high G6PD, TrxR1, and STAT3 functions, thereby decreased GSH levels, and induced gene
expression changes, while H182/H333 (azetidine-based) potently and selectively inhibited STAT3 activity and
gene expression in TNBC cells. The collective inhibition of the high G6PD, TrxR1, STAT3 and GSH functions
and gene expression changes led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) build-up in TNBC cells, DNA damage, cell
cycle arrests, cell death, and tumor growth inhibition in vivo of TNBC models. Though indeed, G6PD, TrxR1 or
STAT3 knockdown alone led to ROS build up in TNBC cells, and RNAseq profiling showed STAT3 inhibition
alone led to enrichment for the genes in the DNA damage, ER stress response, UPR, and senescence pathways
in H182-treated TNBC cells, we anticipate differences between the chemotypes’ activities, which we seek to
define to better tailor these compounds for TNBC treatment. Normal cells, which have low background G6PD,
TrxR1, NADPH, GSH, and STAT3 functions are unaffected. We hypothesize that the moderation of the
redox/metabolic events and gene regulation through the targeting of G6PD, TrxR1, and STAT3 by R001, R002,
H182 and H333 inhibits TNBC growth. We further hypothesize that the compounds’ effects on the metabolic,
redox and STAT3 pathways in non-tumor cells in the TME contribute to the antitumor response. We will define
the differences between the chemotypes. 1. Investigate the interactions of STAT3, G6PD, and TrxR1 with the
compounds in vitro to define their inhibition modes; 2. Study how the specific targeting of STAT3 by the azetidines
and the modulation of G6PD, TrxR1 and STAT3 functions by natural products differ in the downstream changes
in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that feed into NADPH and GSH levels and in gene
expression in vitro and in vivo; 3. Investigate ROS induction and the associated stress response, DNA damage,
cell cycle changes and cell death, their molecular regulators, including oxidoreductases in TNBC cells and tumor
tissues following treatment; and 4. Investigate the antitumor responses to the inhibitors in vivo in CDX, PDX,
4T1/Balb-c, and E0771/BL6 models. We will gain new, indept insights into TNBC’s dependence on dysregulated
G6PD, TrxR1 NADPH, GSH and STAT3 functions and the preferential effects of inhibitors. X-ray crystallographic
studies will give atomic level details into the direct interactions. The successful development of R001, R002 or
H182, H333 and their combination therapy with ICI will provide a novel effective treatment for TNBC."
11064657,"Approximately 10% of people aged 60+ suffer from depression. Such late-life depression (LLD)
is linked to broader adverse health outcomes such as stroke and dementia. Although individual
regions have been identified as neural correlates of LLD, there is no single brain region that
explains LLD. Instead, LLD is associated with a highly multivariate and complex pattern of
neural changes which can be challenging to interpret. Prior work suggests that the
sensorimotor-association axis is a key organizational principle and developmental pathway of
the human connectome, which may provide a foundation for understanding the spatial
distribution of LLD neural correlates across the brain. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will
systematically assess multivariate associations between LLD and whole-brain resting state
functional connectivity and map the results onto seven canonical brain networks within the
framework of the sensorimotor-association axis. The results will provide an unbiased
interpretable spatial pattern of the neural correlates of LLD covering the whole brain. In Aim 2,
we will identify symptom-specific spatial patterns of LLD neural correlates. Specifically, we
hypothesized that cognitive symptoms such as rumination may rely on association cortices,
whereas psychomotor symptoms such as slowed reaction time may explain unimodal
involvement in LLD.
The candidate, Kassandra Hamilton, joined Dr. Bijsterbosch’s lab in the summer for 2023
through the BP-ENDURE Program. By way of this NIH Diversity Supplement, she is seeking
one year of mentored training in neuroimaging, geriatric psychiatry, computational analytics, and
career development to strengthen her application to PhD programs, support her preparedness
for starting graduate school, and support her longer-term career trajectory towards becoming a
neuroimaging scientist.
Public health significance: The results from Aim 1 are expected to reduce the current bias
towards specific association cortices (specifically default mode, salience, and executive control
networks) in research regarding the neural correlates of LLD, and prompt increased research
efforts into the role of sensorimotor cortices in LLD. The results from Aim 2 will provide unique
symptom-level insights into the neural correlates of LLD which are expected to inform research
into LLD heterogeneity, and which may highlight distinct symptom-level treatment pathways."
11064683,"Project Summary
Averting future global pandemics requires surveillance programs that can quickly and accurately
identify potential new outbreaks worldwide. Mobile health technologies (mHealth) are a promising
strategy for collecting data on infectious diseases in remote, underserved settings at the nexus of
human and wildlife interactions and zoonotic disease spillover. As the use of mHealth
technologies has grown in high income countries, they have also been increasingly investigated
in low- and middle-income countries, including Uganda. While potentially promising, these
interventions are not one size fits all but instead dependent on a complex interplay between the
technology itself and local ethical, cultural, and other norms. Core mHealth technologies such as
mobile data collection, cloud storage, and geolocation may be entirely novel for some populations.
Differences in understanding of these newly introduced mHealth technologies may pose
significant ethical concerns around respect, consent, confidentiality, and beneficence, especially
in cultures within Sub Saharan Africa that value a more collectivist social identity. This project will
expand research conducted by the parent award which is developing a community-based human
and wildlife disease surveillance and outbreak detection system in Southwestern Uganda to
investigate bioethical considerations associated with implementation of this platform. Importantly,
we will identify key differences in understanding of mHealth concepts between a predominantly
oral tradition society as well as a society that places different value on communal vs. individual
benefits compared with western societies. Using focus groups, including pertinent subgroups (i.e.,
community members and leaders, local alternative medicine leaders, park rangers, and poachers)
and key representatives from various linguistic, ethnic, and other stakeholder groups, we will
develop a locally relevant research ethics framework, including the fundamental concepts of
respect, consent, confidentiality, and beneficence. Our study team will then develop novel or
select existing, culturally relevant engagement procedures (i.e. familial, community, multimedia,
and/or step-wise procedures) which, along with results from the focus groups, will undergo
member checking to evaluate accuracy and acceptability. Through a series of bioethics
workshops incorporating local western-trained and alternative medicine leaders along with
international bioethicists, we will review key outcomes learned through focus group discussions
and design a guiding framework for ethically informed implementation of mHealth systems in the
Ugandan context. Combined, these products will help local and international partners achieve
ethical, sustained, and effective mHealth surveillance systems in similar settings."
11086406,"Project Summary
An estimated 40.3 million adults and adolescents needed treatment for substance use disorders in 2020. Yet
only 6.5% of those needing treatment received it. Access to high-quality care remains a significant challenge.
In the past decade, private equity (PE) firms have acquired numerous substance use disorder (SUD) treatment
facilities, although evidence on the extent of these acquisitions is scarce. SUD treatment centers are attractive
targets for private equity acquisition due to increased need for SUD treatment, increased health insurance
coverage, and expansions in coverage of SUD treatments, all of which increase demand for treatment.
Opportunities for efficiencies due to the fragmented nature of the market and changes to regulations regarding
buprenorphine prescribing have the potential to increase profits. Commentators have raised concerns that a
focus on short term profits may lead to quality declines in private equity-acquired facilities. Similar acquisitions
in other areas of health care have resulted in declines in quality and increases in mortality. In this supplement,
we will, for the first time, comprehensively catalog and describe Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) acquisitions
by private equity investors from 2013-2022. This supplement would fund a predoctoral candidate for 10 months
to examine the effects of private equity specifically in opioid treatment programs. The proposed project will first
describe the number, trends and geographic distribution of PE acquisitions of Opioid Treatment Programs a
subset of SUD treatment facilities. We will also include information on PE-backed newly established OTPs
(Aim 1). We will then assess whether these acquisitions are associated with changes in measures of Medicaid-
financed methadone treatment quantity and quality at acquired OTPs, relative to non-acquired OTPs (Aim 2).
The proposed Mentorship Plan includes a mentorship team consisting of researchers with expertise in health
policy and economics, addiction medicine and Medicaid policy. Goals of the Career Development Plan include
enhancing research knowledge of state Medicaid reimbursement policy, Medicaid claims analysis, and
addiction medicine. Goals will be achieved through the proposed supplement research and professional
development activities: successful execution of project milestones, didactic training, internal work-in-progress
presentations, formal external presentations, and mentorship and interactions with co-investigators of the
parent award. The proposed supplement plan will facilitate the candidate’s transition to a faculty position as an
addiction policy researcher."

The TARA cohort is located in Mozambique and is currently overseen by Dr. Maria Lain in collaboration with
Dr. Savita Pahwa at the University of Miami (RF1/RF4). As noted in the attached request-The TARA Cohort “is
unique in that only one third of the cohort are observed to be virologically suppressed over the first year of
ART, with the remainder showing no virologic suppression or intermittent virologic control. This cohort has
provided important insights into the capacity of the infant immune system innate and adaptive immune
responses to HIV through natural exposure to autologous virus. The cohort has also contributed to the
development of novel single-cell technologies to probe the immune responses to HIV at the single-cell level,
with critical importance to assay development planned in RF4 for more widespread application. The second
cohort is the Ucwaningo Lwabantwana Cohort in KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa, overseen by Dr. Moherndran
Archary in collaboration with Dr. Philip Goulder (RF2). The cohort has been enrolling mother-child pairs since
2015 and has enrolled over 266 pairs. The funding requested is necessary for each of the teams to continue to
maintain the cohort to complete the scheduled visits, as well as processing and storage of blood samples for
the study questions. Pivotal to Pediatric HIV Cure research, is the novel scientific finding of sex differences in
susceptibility to in utero HIV infection and remission outcomes. In this cohort, Dr. Goulder and his colleagues
have reported on increase susceptibility of females to in utero HIV and remission outcomes in males only.
Maintenance of this cohort is quintessential to understanding sex differences in perinatal HIV infection. The
third cohort for which support is being requested is for the Gold Study cohort. This Cohort is based at the
Family Centre for Research with Ubuntu (FAMCRU) at Stellenbosch University, where Dr. Mark Cotton is the
PI (RF1), as well as at the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU) at Wits Health Consortium, where Dr. Caroline
Tiemessen is the PI (RF1). This cohort is critical for the successful completion of the ongoing CNS studies
underway through a supplement to the PAVE MDC from the Office of AIDS Research. This cohort is
approximately 40 participants at each site. The support requested will cover the costs of the yearly health
checks, as well as monthly peer support groups, for research participation and discussions around spinal taps
and neuroimaging to assess CNS as a reservoir in perinatal infection. These activities are deemed as critical
for study retention, which will ultimately impact on the scientific discoveries within PAVE."
11069499,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The progression of recreational drinking to alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by increased seeking
behavior and loss of intake control, with individuals continuing to use alcohol despite experiencing negative
consequences. While one operant paradigm has been developed to assess operant alcohol self-administration
in a manner that can procedurally separate the appetitive (seeking) vs. consummatory facets of behavior, no
studies have yet leveraged this model to investigate these independent aspects of alcohol self-administration in
the presence of an alternative reinforcer, an astonishing gap in the literature given that six of the eleven
diagnostic criteria of AUD are related to the individual allocating behavior towards alcohol compared to
alternative reinforcers. The paucity of translational models of operant alcohol choice self-administration may
contribute to the continued mystery of the circuitry underlying maladaptive alcohol seeking, precluding the
discovery of therapeutic targets. The present study proposes a novel operant self-administration choice
paradigm which will be used to assess the role that the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus to the nucleus
accumbens shell projection (vSub-NAc) has on alcohol seeking. Preliminary findings from our lab demonstrate
that chemogenetic inhibition of the vSub-NAc produces a uniform reduction in alcohol seeking with minimal
effects on consumption without altering seeking or intake of a sucrose solution in a separate cohort of animals.
Both our lab and others have additionally shown that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) not only produces
heightened excitability in vSub, but also results in escalation of seeking and intake. Despite these advances, it
remains unknown how the vSub-NAc projection modulates operant choice behavior when a subject can respond
for ethanol and an alternative reinforcer, whether the behavioral outcome of vSub-NAc inhibition would differ
between CIE-exposed subjects vs. AIR controls, and how sex as a biological variable might mediate these
synaptic and behavioral consequences. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to implement a
multidisciplinary approach to test the hypotheses that CIE results in reallocation of behavior towards
alcohol and away from an alternative reinforcer via hyperexcitation of the vSub-NAc projection,
suggesting that inhibition of this projection will redirect operant choice behavior towards an alternative
reinforcer. Aim 1 will employ optogenetic techniques to selectively activate or inhibit the vSub-NAc during
alcohol vs. sucrose operant choice self-administration. In Aim 2, we will use CIE as a model of alcohol
dependence coupled with optogenetic circuit manipulations to determine if this circuit has unique behavioral
effects when assessed in alcohol dependent vs. non-dependent subjects. These studies may identify a novel
behavioral mechanism through which the vSub-NAc exerts control over alcohol self-administration, with the
potential to provide further evidence that targeting this circuit may have therapeutic value in treating AUD."
11059623,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This multi-phased, community-engaged R34 proposal was developed with community partners to (1) inform,
(2) develop, and (3) pilot test protocol for ECHO (Empowering Our Community & Health Outcomes), a smoking
cessation intervention tailored for sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) people living in high-stigma places.
The proposed work qualifies as “Stage I (treatment generation, refinement)” in “the development and testing of
behavioral and integrative treatments for substance use and dependence” as per PAR-22-183. Tobacco-related
inequities among SGM people persist, especially in places with high SGM stigma. Tobacco is a leading cause
of preventable disease and death among SGM individuals, ≥35% of whom live in places with high structural
stigma. High-stigma (versus lower-stigma) places have more negative aggregate attitudes about SGM people,
weaker policy protections, and are more likely to expose SGM people to minority stressors and lack SGM
community participation outlets. Existing SGM-tailored smoking cessation interventions overwhelmingly focus
on within-person processes of behavior change rather than the adverse sociopolitical factors driving SGM
smoking inequities and the unique challenges of being SGM in high-stigma places. Our innovative approach,
grounded in Empowerment Theory (ET), posits that when SGM people in high-stigma environments participate
in SGM-serving volunteer activities that empower their communities, they may also experience cognitive and
behavioral changes that support smoking cessation (i.e., social support, minority stress coping, SGM identity
pride, prosociality). ET-informed health behavior change approaches have worked for SGM HIV prevention
and youth tobacco interventions, suggesting that ET may also enhance SGM-tailored smoking cessation. Our
pretest of ECHO in Oklahoma (OK; N=20) demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of an additive
intervention design wherein SGM people received remotely-delivered standard smoking cessation support and
did SGM-serving volunteer activities. Building on this work, we propose to: (Aim 1/Phase 1) Prioritize key
factors that support SGM smoking cessation success using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of active
smoking cessation quit attempts with n=60 nationally-recruited SGM adults in high stigma places; (Aim
2/Phase 2) Use a rapid, iterative design process with our SGM-serving community partners in two high stigma sites
(OK and the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), California) to develop volunteer activity protocols likely to maximize factors
supporting SGM cessation success with n=12 SGM adults ready to quit smoking; and (Aim 3/Phase 3) Use the
volunteer activity protocols developed in Aim 2 to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the ECHO
intervention with our community partners and n=50 SGM adults ready to quit smoking in OK and the SJV. Conducted
remotely to increase scalability and accessibility, this project lays the ground work of a future R01 application for a
fully-powered, multi-site RCT of ECHO in high-stigma sites around the country."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia. AF is uniquely associated with the development of heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Both AF and HFpEF are associated with metabolic syndromes.
Cardiac remodeling during HFpEF can be partially explained by changes in substrate utilization, AKT signaling,
and enhanced insulin resistance. As a chaperon protein, FKBP5 is known to modulate the phosphorylation and
activity of AKT via PHLPP. Mice that lack FKBP51 exhibited increased AKT activity and increased insulin
resistance. The role of ‘FKBP5 – PHLPP – AKT’ signaling in the concomitant AF and HFpEF has not been
reported previously. We recently have reported that the loss of FKBP5 can lead to cardiac fibrosis, atrial
myopathy, and enhanced AF inducibility. Whether the increased AF susceptibility, due to the loss of FKBP5, can
perpetuate the progression of HFpEF remains an open question. In this application, we will test the hypothesis
that FKBP5 deficiency accelerates the progression of HFpEF by promoting the development of AF."
11064642,"Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with BRAF and MEK inhibitors has enabled
significant improvements in treating metastatic skin cutaneous melanomas that possess
activating mutations in the BRAF gene (“BRAF mutant melanomas”). In contrast, actionable
and specific targets in metastatic cutaneous melanomas that contain the wild-type BRAF gene
(“BRAF WT melanomas”) have yet to be discovered, hindering the development of more
effective strategies for treating these tumors. Here we propose to address that knowledge gap
by validating a candidate target in BRAF WT melanomas and strategies for therapeutic
intervention. Published and preliminary data have led to the following hypothesis: ERBB4
mutations or elevated ERBB4 transcription increase signaling by ERBB4-EGFR or ERBB4-
ERBB2 heterodimers, resulting in increased PI3 kinase signaling, cooperation with NF1 or
RAS gene mutations, and increased proliferation of BRAF WT melanomas. We will test
aspects of this hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) Which ERBB4 mutants found in BRAF
WT melanomas cause increased proliferation of BRAF WT melanoma cell lines? (2) Is
EGFR, ERBB2, or the PI3K pathway required for proliferation of the ERBB4-dependent,
BRAF-WT melanoma cell lines? We estimate that the predicted outcome of these studies will
lead to effective strategies for treating approximately 30% of metastatic BRAF WT
melanomas, revolutionizing the care of patients that carry these aggressive skin cancers."

People living with HIV (PWH) have an increased incidence of cancers and worse outcomes than those not
infected with HIV. People at the age of 50 or older also have increased rates to acquire HIV infection. Individuals
living with chronical HIV infection exhibit many clinical characteristics of aging. Moreover, PWH on combined
antiretroviral therapy (ART) often have a degree of immunologic impairment and chronic immune activation. To
improve health of older individuals living with HIV, we must better understand the interface between aging, HIV
infection, and HIV-associated cancers. The goal of this P30 supplement project is to address these questions.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification and plays an important role in cellular
RNA fate and HIV infection and immunity. Dysregulation of m6A modification is frequently identified in various
cancer types, which can serve as diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers. We and others found that
HIV-1 in vitro infection induces a significant increase in m6A modification of cellular RNA. However, whether HIV-
associated cancers affect m6A levels and profiles of cellular genes in aging PWH remain unknown. Importantly,
m6A modification affects type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-responsive genes in HIV infection and cancers.
IFN-I-responsive gene expression is often dysregulated in many cancer patients. However, it is unknown whether
HIV-associated cancers can alter IFN-I-responsive gene expression in immune cells from aging PWH.
We hypothesize that HIV-associated cancers increase RNA m6A levels, alter m6A-modified gene profiles, and
dysregulate the mRNA expression of IFN-I-responsive genes in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) from
PWH at the age of 50 or older. To test this hypothesis and to explore the underlying mechanisms, we designed
two specific aims in two years: Aim 1. To determine RNA m6A levels and m6A-modified gene profiles in PBMCs
of PWH with or without HIV-associated cancers. Aim 2. To measure mRNA levels of 84 IFN-I-responsive genes
in PBMCs of PWH with or without HIV-associated cancers. Overall Impact: Our proposed study will help define
how m6A modification regulates cellular gene expression and innate immunity during HIV-1 infection and cancer
development in aging PWH. These basic and mechanistic studies can lay the foundation for developing a better
therapy approach for cancer treatment among aging PWH."

Firearm violence exacts a devastating toll in the United States (US), with dramatically disproportionate impacts
on marginalized Black and Latiné communities. To date, public investments to address this issue
predominantly fund criminalization strategies with intensive policing and mass incarceration, but this has not
consistently or substantially reduced firearm homicide rates. A promising alternative approach focuses on
investing in meeting the essential needs of the communities that suffer from high levels of firearm violence, like
housing, youth programming, and a well-maintained built environment. While these interventions have
demonstrated success in reducing firearm violence, they have been limited to particular neighborhoods or
smaller geographic areas. Evaluations of investments to strengthen support services on a greater scale are
limited by a lack of availability of robust data. To fill that gap, this project will use public available local budgets
to build a detailed, longitudinal database of local funding expenditures for the carceral system and support
services for the 50 most populous cities from 2010-2022 (Aim 1a). The database will then be used to
categorize cities into groups based on their trajectories in the ratio of total support service funding to total
carceral funding per 100,000 residents, and explore city-level predictors of these groups (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, the
database will be used along with outcome and covariable data from the City Health Dashboard and various
public sources to estimate the changes in racial and ethnic disparities in firearm homicides associated with
increasing levels of funding allocations for (1) housing, (2) financial support, (3) family support, and (4)
community-focused public safety services; and decreasing funding levels for the carceral system. This
research is urgently needed as local policymakers are actively seeking evidence-based solutions to reduce
inequities in community violence. The research plan is complemented by an excellent interdisciplinary
mentorship team and training plan to develop strong foundations in the theoretical understanding of community
violence, practical knowledge of local budgetary processes, empirical knowledge of the effect of local funding
expenditures on health outcomes, advanced causal inference methods for longitudinal policy evaluation, and
communication skills for dissemination to diverse stakeholders. Building on the applicant’s background as a
surgical trainee entering the field of trauma surgery, the combined research and training plan will prepare the
applicant to successfully pursue a career augmenting clinical care of victims of violence with research to
facilitate structural interventions that prevent interpersonal violence from occurring in the first place. It will also
position him as a thought-leader and leader of empirical science on local funding as a structural determinant of
health."

Engagement of CD28 provides a critical costimulatory signal for T cell activation. Absence of adequate CD28
costimulation is a common feature of dysfunctional T cells in cancer and viral infections. However, although
augmentation of CD28 signaling is well known to be essential for restoring dysfunctional T cells protective
immune responses upon immune checkpoint blockade treatment, it is unclear how CD28 in those T cells is
activated in the absence of corresponding ligands on cancer and virus-infected cells, indicating the limited
mechanistic understanding of the B7:CD28 pathway. My preliminary data have suggested a novel mechanism
of CD28 activation by B7 on the same T cell (cis-B7:CD28 interactions), different from the known CD28
engagement by B7 on antigen-presenting cells (trans-B7:CD28 interactions). This finding has begun to reveal a
unique avenue to trigger CD28 signaling in effector T cells for vigorous anti-tumor and ant-virus immune
responses. Based on this finding, the objective of this K99/R00 application is to understand the function and
mechanism of cis-B7:CD28 interaction and leverage cis-activation of CD28 to enhance the activity of T cells
against cancer and infection. To this end, I propose the following aims: Aim 1: Establish a role of B7:CD28 cis-
interactions in regulating T cells activity. Aim 2: Dissect the molecular mechanism through which CD28 is
activated by B7 ligands in cis. Aim 3: Identify the function of cis-B7:CD28 interaction in T cell immune response
against tumor and viral infection. These three aims will allow me to perform a comprehensive investigation on
cis-B7:CD28 interactions and the knowledge gained from this study will likely provide valuable therapeutic
implications in CD28 targeted T cell therapy. I have a strong background in studying cis-interactions and their
functions in regulating T cell activity, which is evidenced by publishing two impactful papers during my
postdoctoral training. Importantly, I have established a series of unique and robust approaches to convincingly
decouple cis- and trans-interactions in coreceptors signaling. This has been the solid foundation of my proposed
experiments. Moreover, my mentorship committee and I have developed an individualized research training and
career development plan, which helps me obtain additional skillsets and expertise and ultimately ensures my
success in seeking an independent investigator position. University of California, San Diego provides the best
possible environment for my K99 research, including world-leading research, cutting-edge facilities and
extensive career development resources. Overall, this K99/R00 award will fulfill my career goal to understand
the function and mechanism of costimulatory receptor signaling in regulation of T cell activity and promote my
career transition into an independent investigator."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is one of the deadliest pathogens
on the planet, and for decades, TB has been the leading cause of death due to infectious disease. The cell
envelope of Mtb forms a notoriously tough barrier around the cell, protecting the bacterium from harsh agents
in the environment such as antibiotics and host immune responses. At the same time, Mtb imports nutrients
from the host cell, such as cholesterol, across the cell envelope. Transport of lipids, metabolites and nutrients
across the cell envelope, between the inner and outer membranes is critical for building and maintaining the
cell envelope itself, and for import of key factors required for bacterial growth. Therefore, the transport systems
that facilitate this trafficking are critical for allowing Mtb to survive and thrive in its intracellular niche, most
typically macrophages in the lungs.
 The MCE (Mammalian Cell Entry) family of proteins are transport systems that have been implicated as
virulence factors in Mtb, and are an expanded protein family in mycobacteria compared with other
double-membraned bacteria. In Mtb, several lines of evidence suggest that MCE systems are important for
importing nutrients such as cholesterol and fatty acids. Recent work on E. coli MCE systems has shown that
these are multi-protein complexes anchored in the inner membrane of double-membraned bacteria, and may
play an important role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity, raising the possibility that this may also
be a role that MCE proteins play in Mtb. The structure and mechanisms of the highly complex MCE systems in
Mtb remain unknown, and studying these is critical for understanding how MCE systems work, what their
substrates are, and how they may be linked to virulence.
 This proposal is focused on biochemical and structural characterization of MCE transport systems from
Mtb and the non-pathogenic model, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Using single particle cryo-EM, mass
spectrometry, biochemical and functional assays, we aim to study the structure and function of endogenous
Mtb MCE systems, decipher which protein subunits come together to form MCE systems and define
protein-protein interactions that are important for the systems to assemble and function. The results of this
work will provide important insights into the structure and function of the large, multi-protein MCE complexes in
the Mtb cell envelope, and how they influence replication and virulence in the host."
11086291,"Hypospadias is one of the most common birth defects in the world affecting nearly 1% of newborn boys.
Hypospadias is the result of disrupted urethral closure where the urethra exits ventrally along the shaft of the
penis. The etiology of 70% of urethral closure defects remains unexplained. Androgen signaling in the penis
drives cell-to-cell communication between the urethra and the adjacent mesenchyme, which then influences
closure of the urethra. Normal penis development requires testosterone. In the absence of testosterone
produced by the testis, the urethra fails to close, leading to severe hypospadias. The testis-derived
testosterone eventually reaches the presumptive penis, and is metabolized into the more potent
dihydrotestosterone by 5-α reductase. Dihydrotestosterone then binds androgen receptor that are localized
within the penis, which transcribes a suite of genes that induce penis development. Surprisingly the regulation
of 5-α reductase and the diversity of cell populations involved in urethral closure are not well understood.
Recently, I discovered a unique cell population in the penis that expresses the steroidogenic enzyme master
regulator, Steroidogenic Factor 1 (Sf1). These cells are localized in the ventral-proximal aspect of the penis,
express both androgen receptor and 5-α reductase, and appear to be required for urethral closure. My central
hypothesis is that these SF1+ cells contribute to proper urethral closure by both producing and responding to
androgens. In the two phases of my K99/R00, I will investigate the role of SF1+ cells in penis development and
urethral closure. In the K99 phase, I will define the role of SF1+ cells and Sf1 the gene in urethral closure. I will
use a combination of the Diptheria toxin, cell ablation mouse model and a penis specific Sf1 gene knockout
mouse model. I hypothesize that these cells are essential for urethral closure and are responsible for the
penises steroidogenic capacity to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. In the R00 phase, I will reveal
how androgen signaling influences SF1+ cell differentiation and urethral closure. Using SF1+ cell conditional
androgen receptor knockouts and chromatin binding assays, I will test the hypothesis that androgens are
directly involved in SF1+ cell function and differentiation. The results from this study will establish the role of a
novel cell population, the function of the gene, Sf1, and androgen responsiveness in penis urethral closure.
This new knowledge will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of
hypospadias and will further human investigations on the etiology of hypospadias. Ultimately if there is a more
comprehensive understanding of penis development, we can begin to develop strategies to prevent this defect
that impacts millions of boys. With the technical skills I already have, the data generated in this proposal, and
the skills I will acquire during the fellowship, I will be well-poised to become an independent Principal
Investigator at an academic institution. Once at my future job, I will be fully equipped to submit an independent
R01 grant to further study the androgen responsiveness of SF1+ cell in the penis."
11059602,"West Nile virus (WNV) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the US and seriously threatens the health
of livestock, wildlife (especially birds) and humans. WNV transmission shows clear annual cycles, with high
levels of human and animal cases during the summer, and few or no cases during the late fall, winter, and
early spring. Furthermore, WNV transmission is higher in urban areas relative to rural areas. Yet, we do not
fully understand what is driving seasonal and spatial differences in WNV transmission, or how cycles of
WNV transmission are able to reinitiate each year. The investigators work from the central hypothesis that
mosquitoes and birds are affected by differences in rural and urban landscapes that lead to predictable,
seasonal changes in WNV transmission. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop predictive
models that incorporate critical drivers of WNV transmission in rural and urban areas, including seasonal
changes in mosquito and avian abundance and community composition. The research team has
complementary expertise in mosquito overwintering, mathematical modeling, and avian disease ecology.
 This proposal combines sophisticated mathematical models with high-resolution, field data from
mosquitoes and birds in rural and urban sites in central and northwestern Ohio. The first goal of the
proposal is to uncover how WNV transmission reinitiates each spring. Mosquito and avian community
composition, WNV infection, mosquito host-use, WNV phylogenetics and measures of urbanization will be
incorporated into predictive models and used to test the hypotheses that WNV-infected urban mosquitoes
terminate their overwintering dormancy in early spring, while uninfected rural mosquitoes acquire WNV
from migratory birds. The second goal is to characterize factors that drive WNV transmission during the
peak of the epidemic. Abiotic factors and data from birds and mosquitoes will be incorporated into models
to determine why WNV transmission starts earlier, persists longer and is higher in cities relative to rural
areas. The third goal is to determine how WNV persists during fall and winter. Continuous collections of
rural and urban mosquitoes and birds, WNV phylogenetics and environmental data will be modeled to test
the hypotheses that urbanization postpones mosquito overwintering dormancy, increases WNV in birds,
and allows more urban mosquitoes to overwinter infected with WNV. Finally, the models will be re-coded to
be adaptable to multiple locations using freely available, open-source weather, bird, and mosquito data.
Thus, at the conclusion of this work the PIs will have developed, parameterized, and validated the first
multispecies, multiannual, and adaptable models to predict WNV transmission across time and space."
11059703,"Emerging diseases are a growing global problem, and wildlife pathogens
are the principal source of disease. Human encroachment and climate change are increasing interactions
between wildlife and human communities, leading to greater zoonotic and epizootic spillover. The genetic
similarity of humans and non-human primates (NHPs) provides an opportunity for viruses to impact both
human and animal populations, especially in areas where contact is continuing to increase. Notable
knowledge gaps persist concerning the dynamics and likely routes of viral transmission within such
heterogeneous natural environments. Here, we examine a model pathogen, adenovirus (AdV), common to
humans, NHPs, and many other hosts and sources, to determine and model transmission routes in an
interconnected biodiversity hotspot in East Africa. We will apply next-generation DNA sequencing,
combined with demographic data and advanced phylogenetic analysis techniques, to identify likely
transmission pathways and to model host factors and interactions affecting viral transmission. Our four
main objectives are to: 1) Obtain fine-grained, longitudinal surveillance data on AdV from wild NHPs,
domestic animals, flies, ticks, dung beetles, water, and soil in a natural, heterogeneous spillover hotspot;
2) Apply advanced phylogenetic and bioinformatics tools to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for
the presence, abundance, variation and routes of transmission of AdV within and among hosts and
environs; 3) Identify source factors impacting viral transmission, e.g., host or source type, proximity,
density, other viruses and pathogens, host evolutionary relationships; 4) Develop prediction models of
how factors (e.g., host species,, phylogeny, proximity, source) influence viral transmission routes, with the
ultimate aim to inform mitigation efforts regarding disease transmission for the benefit of human and
animal health. By focusing on a common, prevalent virus like AdV, we can identify, quantify, model, and
ultimately predict key aspects of viral transmission and the factors affecting spillover in complex natural
environments, which will be applicable for understanding and preventing disease transmission more
broadly. In addition, this research builds capacity and supports broader African and U.S. genomic and
biostatistics training. The knowledge gained will be instrumental for policy decision-making to prevent and
mitigate zoonotic and anthroponotic disease outbreaks and improving quality of life with conservation and
public health benefits."
11059728,"Few studies have characterized disease ecology questions for pathogens with robust environmental
stages that cross ecosystem boundaries. In recent decades, terrestrially derived protozoan infections have
been increasingly reported in marine mammals. Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona are common
pathogens in southern sea otters, but their definitive hosts are terrestrial (felids and opossums,
respectively). En route from their terrestrial definitive hosts to a marine animal, parasite stages are subject
to diverse environmental forces that determine whether they are effectively mobilized and sufficiently
viable to infect a marine host. Intriguingly, we found that the diversity of protozoa genotypes in sea otters,
including virulent strains, does not reflect parasite diversity in terrestrial hosts. We hypothesize that (i)
environmental forces drive selection of virulent protozoan strains in marine ecosystems; and (ii) virulent
parasite strains accumulate and persist in submarine vegetated habitats. Our objectives will generate
novel and diverse datasets for an integrative Bayesian modeling approach to test how land-sea
environmental forces shape the distribution, population structure and selection of virulent parasites in
coastal ecosystems. Objectives are designed to answer two questions: Q1: How do environmental forces
across land-sea habitats affect the genetic distribution, transport and survival of T. gondii and S. neurona in
the nearshore? And Q2: Are submarine vegetated habitats (kelp and seagrass) hot spots for transmission
of virulent pathogens for sea otters? By integrating field, genomics, stable isotope analysis and modeling
approaches across land-sea boundaries, this research will provide a new framework to understand how
habitat and climate dynamics shape the ecology of virulent pathogens in marine environments. Focusing
on kelp and seagrasses has the potential to yield transformative insight on infectious disease transmission
in the coastal ocean, with broad implications for diverse host-pathogen systems. Our fully mechanistic
model includes numerous ecological processes and incorporates the previously unrecognized importance
of submarine vegetation in concentrating pathogens and mediating predator-prey interactions that
determine marine host infection patterns. Results will thus represent a fundamental advance in our current
understanding of infectious diseases that cross coastal boundaries."
11060173,"Rationale. An increased incidence of respiratory complaints has been identified in Veterans of the Gulf War
(GW) [and post-9/11 conflicts. An inhalational injury is suspected given numerous potential exposures to airway
toxins. A landmark study (1) in 2011 described a cohort of post-9/11 soldiers with unexplained dyspnea and
impaired exercise tolerance that underwent surgical lung biopsy; findings showed evidence of chronic
inflammation surrounding thickened fibrotic bronchioles referred to as deployment related chronic bronchiolitis
(DR-CB) in this proposal. We performed a preliminary analysis of chest CT scans previously obtained on a
subset of these soldiers using parametric response mapping (PRM), a recently-developed CT analytic technique
that measures differential lung density between inspiratory and expiratory scans. Here we provide the first
evidence linking the histopathologic features of DR-CB with an abnormal radiographic signature indicative of
functional small airways disease (fSAD). We show that forced oscillation technique (FOT), a pulmonary function
test, may also non-invasively identify small airways disease in deployed Veterans. We provide additional data
demonstrating that key histopathologic features of DR-CB are recapitulated in a transgenic murine model of
inducible, specific, and sustained injury to progenitor club cells located within the airway epithelium. This finding
and additional associational evidence indicate that numerous airway toxins present during deployment mediate
their deleterious effects via a club cell injury pathway. We further implicate an increase in apoptotic club cells
and profibrotic macrophage accumulation in the pathogenesis of chronic bronchiolitis. Our collective data and
proposed studies address an urgent need to better understand, diagnose, and treat DR-CB.]
Hypothesis: [We hypothesize that the histopathologic features of DR-CB in Veterans are manifested as
increased functional small airways disease detectable by PRM and FOT. We further hypothesize that the
histopathologic features of chronic bronchiolitis induced by club cell injury in mice result from increased apoptotic
cell burden which triggers accumulation and profibrotic activation of lung macrophages.]
Aim 1: To determine whether PRM identifies an increase in fSAD as a radiographic surrogate [for the
histopathologic abnormalities that define] DR-CB. In this Aim, we will obtain comprehensive data sets (including
high resolution CT scans) on cohorts of GW and Post-9/11 Veterans that underwent clinically-indicated
evaluations for unexplained dyspnea at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the New Jersey War
Related Illness and Injury Study Center. We will first quantify PRM classifications in Veterans with
histopathologic evidence of DR-CB and identify a predictive threshold of PRMfSAD that may aid in the diagnosis
of this condition (Aim 1a). We will then use this threshold to compare cohorts of non-biopsied Gulf War and
Post-9/11 Veterans for radiographic evidence of DR-CB (Aim 1b) and assess relationships between PRMfSAD
and FOT (Aim 1c).]
Aim 2: To determine whether [histopathologic features of murine chronic bronchiolitis caused by sustained club
cell injury can be prevented and (or) ameliorated by disrupting profibrotic macrophage responses to apoptotic
cells. Using our murine model, we will first identify relationships between club cell injury, apoptotic cell burden,
oxidative stress, and lung macrophage phenotype (Aim 2a) and thereafter determine whether CD36 blockade
(Aim 2b) or azithromycin (Aim 2c) can prevent and (or) resolve chronic bronchiolitis in mice.]
Benefit to Veterans: [The application of PRM and FOT technology will significantly improve our ability to safely
diagnose DR-CB and thus advance assessment of its prevalence amongst deployed Veterans, including those
with Gulf War Veterans Illness. Our focused investigation on club cell injury will enhance our understanding of
DR-CB pathogenesis in response to numerous respiratory hazards and expedite the development of
preventative or active treatments for this debilitating condition.]"
11060174,"PTE (posttraumatic epilepsy) has been identified by the VA as a priority area for
research. Current medical therapy for this condition is inadequate. No anticonvulsant has yet
been demonstrated to be specifically effective against PTE. The animal model used for
screening anticonvulsants (AEDs) greatly influences which compounds are identified. One
consequence is that standard animal models seem to consistently identify compounds with
similar actions. Since there is no good PTE animal model, AEDs especially effective for PTE
have not been identified. Evidence of the benefits of novel animal models is the identification of
levetiracetam (Keppra), currently the most prescribe drug for epilepsy. The more standard
animal models had failed to identify its antiepileptic activity. Current PTE animal models such as
lateral fluid percussion and controlled cortical impact are not practical for screening AEDs
because the timing of seizures cannot be controlled.
 We have developed a model of penetration injury induced epilepsy. It is a variation on the
theme of Dave Prince’s partial cortical isolation PTE model. The current model solves two critical
weakness of the cortical undercutting model by utilizing the simpler anatomy of the
hippocampus. First, sectioning the Schaffer Collateral that connect the CA3 and CA1 region of
the rat hippocampus can create a region that predominantly contains reactive presynaptic
changes (i.e. aberrant synaptic reorganization) and a region that contain postsynaptic changes
(deafferentation induced dendritic hyperexcitability). This segregation of reactive mechanisms
cannot be achieved in the cortex. Consequently, it makes it possible to more easily dissect the
underlying complex mechanisms of PTE. Secondly, sectioning of the Schaffer Collateral does
NOT block the spread of seizure from the seizure focus, as is the case with the cortical
undercutting model. Thus, behavioral seizures can be observed. A third advantage from a drug
discovery perspective is that, similar to the kindling model, seizures can be reliably evoked by a
weak triggering electrical stimulus. This is operationally important for drug screening. One
cannot wait for a seizure to occur when screening drugs. A useful animal model has to produce
seizures on demand. In preliminary studies we have gathered compelling evidence that this
novel PTE animal model can reliably produce behavioral and electrographic limbic seizures on
demand.
 At this moment a compelling and unusual opportunity exists for a successful rational drug
development. A novel therapeutic target for PTE, dendritic SK2 channels, has been identified. A
novel animal model of PTE possessing the latter dysfunction has been developed. And a class of
SK2 enhancers that can reverse that dysfunction has been discovered. We seek to make the
most from the confluence of these discoveries and the opportunity they offer."

The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) has experienced dramatic change over the last five
years. To list just a few of the many examples: AoURP conducted multiple retention eligible
campaigns (e.g., mental health campaign), began distributing genetic results to participants,
initiated the first ancillary study (Nutrition for Precision Health), and made available the Research
Workbench to scientists. Throughout the many changes that have occurred over the years, the
most challenging was the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic which disrupted every facet of society and
impacted how AoURP's partnering institutions functioned. But with change comes opportunity,
and opportunity is possible for organizations that are highly adaptable and innovative. This
includes the All of Us Wisconsin Consortium (AoU-WI).
AoU-WI was one of the last RMCs to join the national program. As time progressed, AoUWI
matured, strengthened close collaborations across WI and nation, and developed diverse
strategies in engagement, enrollment, and retention. The diversity at all levels of AoU-WI is
something we are most proud of and has allowed our program to flourish in the ever-changing
AoURP. To maintain AoU-WI's momentum, we will leverage lessons learned from the last five
years. AoU-WI will constantly reassess, modify, and diversify its strategies to ensure AoURP is
available to all. Continued diversity in our program will be essential as AoURP persistently
changes over the next five years.
In this application, we will describe how AoU-WI will not only maintain successful activities
that has allowed our program to be leaders in engagement, enrollment, and retention, but how we
intend to innovate. We will conduct outreach and engagement activities to promote the enrollment
of communities who are historically underrepresented in biomedical research (Aim 1). AoU-WI
will also engage, enroll, and retain participants who reflect the rich diversity of the US (Aim 2).
This will be done with both adults and pediatrics (Aim3) while ensuring participants have access
to technology for study activities (Aim 4). Lastly, AoU-WI will engage and collaborate with health
care providers serving communities that are historically underrepresented in biomedical research
to facilitate enrollment and retention (Aim5). We will do this by expanding the AoU-WI
consortium to include Advocate Aurora Health, the ninth largest not-for-profit integrated
healthcare system in the U.S.
By successfully achieving these aims, AoU-WI ensures our continuous contribution to the
mission of ""accelerating health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized
prevention, treatment, and care for all of us."""

most challenging was the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic which disrupted every facet of society and
impacted how AoURP's partnering institutions functioned. But with change comes opportunity,
and opportunity is possible for organizations that are highly adaptable and innovative. This
includes the All of Us Wisconsin Consortium (AoU-WI).
AoU-WI was one of the last RMCs to join the national program. As time progressed, AoUWI
matured, strengthened close collaborations across WI and nation, and developed diverse
strategies in engagement, enrollment, and retention. The diversity at all levels of AoU-WI is
something we are most proud of and has allowed our program to flourish in the ever-changing
AoURP. To maintain AoU-WI's momentum, we will leverage lessons learned from the last five
years. AoU-WI will constantly reassess, modify, and diversify its strategies to ensure AoURP is
available to all. Continued diversity in our program will be essential as AoURP persistently
changes over the next five years.
In this application, we will describe how AoU-WI will not only maintain successful activities
that has allowed our program to be leaders in engagement, enrollment, and retention, but how we
intend to innovate. We will conduct outreach and engagement activities to promote the enrollment
of communities who are historically underrepresented in biomedical research (Aim 1). AoU-WI
will also engage, enroll, and retain participants who reflect the rich diversity of the US (Aim 2).
This will be done with both adults and pediatrics (Aim3) while ensuring participants have access
to technology for study activities (Aim 4). Lastly, AoU-WI will engage and collaborate with health
care providers serving communities that are historically underrepresented in biomedical research
to facilitate enrollment and retention (Aim5). We will do this by expanding the AoU-WI
consortium to include Advocate Aurora Health, the ninth largest not-for-profit integrated
healthcare system in the U.S.
By successfully achieving these aims, AoU-WI ensures our continuous contribution to the
mission of ""accelerating health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized
prevention, treatment, and care for all of us."""

All of Us Pennsylvania (AOU PA) embraces research equity as a fundamental principal and
prioritizes engagement and enrollment of diverse participants by bringing the All of Us Research
Program to underrepresented and disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations throughout the
Commonwealth. As the first site to launch and enroll participants, the AOU PA Program brings 7
years of experience, deep community partnerships, data-driven operations, robust infrastructure,
lessons learned, and dedicated staffing to accelerate progress on achieving the enrollment of one
million diverse participants across the United States.
We have engaged communities and enrolled paiticipants in 38 of the 67 counties in PA. As of
October 10, 2023, we enrolled 41,558 Core participants (8.5% of the national cohort), 72% of
whom are from underrepresented backgrounds in research.
New for AOU PA 2.0 will be the addition of community-based ambassadors - our AOU PA
Navigators - and partner organizations - our Community Research Hubs. Navigators and Hubs
will represent their communities on our Community Advisory Board, help develop messaging,
promote and host engagement and enrollment activities, and directly communicate through
personal connections with their friends and neighbors the value of All of Us.
Our long-term objective for AOU PA 2.0 is to maintain our successful operations and to
establish multiple AOU PA Navigators and Community Research Hubs who can operate
independently in their communities with the support of the AOU PA Platform. They will focus
on engaging and retaining participants with disabilities and participants who are from primarily
Black and Hispanic-Latino communities across PA, with new initiatives in the Philadelphia and
Harrisburg regions. At the same time, we will maintain current AOU PA enrollment activities in
western and central PA, including those in rural communities.
Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Conduct outreach and engagement activities designed in equitable
partnership with members of the communities of interest in which engagement and enrollment
will occur; and Aim 2. Engage, enroll, and retain participants from populations who are
historically underrepresented in biomedical research.
We will learn from members of diverse communities how All of Us can best establish and
communicate its trustworthiness and research reciprocity using human-centered design, which
emphasizes human perspective and empathy at every stage of a design process. We bring
community members together in Engagement Studios that provide a safe space, respectful
environment, and inclusive approach for co-creating messages and engagement strategies.
We will expand our current Engagement Team to include members from marginalized groups
who share lived experiences with the communities with whom we partner and the Engagement
Team at the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL), which works to ensure that
individuals with disabilities from diverse backgrounds can participate in and contribute to
assistive technology research. Other partnerships include the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary,
several Black churches throughout the state, Casa San Jose, and independent community
pharmacies.
Our approach will ramp up AOU PA activities in new strategically selected racially and
ethnically diverse locations throughout Pennsylvania through personal engagement while
expanding our current Enrollment activities in western PA."

The All of Us Southern Network (AoUSN) has been enrolling in the All of Us Research Program 
since 2018. It consists of sites in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, led by a team at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The Network motivated by the idea that All of Us
represents a unique opportunity to ensure that advances in precision medicine will benefit all 
people, and that there are large populations in our region who have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Our participating sites have extensive experience in earning 
trust and engaging individuals throughout the region, and we are well positioned to ensure that 
they are included in the All of Us Research Program. In addition to UAB, participating sites 
include UAB branch campuses in Huntsville, Selma, and Montgomery, AL; Cooper Green 
Mercy Health Services Authority in Birmingham; University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa; 
University of South Alabama in Mobile; University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, 
MS; Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) and Tulane University in 
New Orleans, LA. Two of these sites, UAB, and LSUHSC, are also active in the Nutrition for 
Precision Health program. Dr. Stephen Sodeke from Tuskegee University serves as a Bioethics 
Consultant. The AoUSN has been a leader nationally in enrollment of individuals underrepresented in biomedical research, especially in terms of race, geography, and income. We were
highly successful in enrollments pre-COVID-19, though it took some time for the Network to
recover full capacity when enrollments resumed. The AoUSN is currently functioning in an 
extension phase from July 2023 - February 2024. During this time, it has consistently exceeded 
recruitment goals, reflecting in part the initiation of multiple innovations that will continue to 
expand through the funding period of the new OTA. These include: inpatient enrollment at UAB 
and several collaborating sites; establishment of a new site affiliated with UAB in Dothan, AL; 
opening “pop-up” enrollment sites throughout the region; use of several mobile clinical research 
units to reach participants in rural areas; use of Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) 
to facilitate retention; development of a relationship with Lakeshore Foundation in Birmingham, 
AL to engage and enroll persons with disabilities. We expect to continue and expand upon these 
innovations in the next five years. Inpatient enrollment has proved to be especially productive 
and efficient in terms of staff resources and will be expanded at UAB and at partner sites that 
have inpatient units. Our experience in setting up a new site in Dothan, AL prepares us to 
establish additional sites in larger cities in our region. We currently have four mobile units, 
including one exclusively dedicated to All of Us, and have another on order that will be dedicated 
to enrollment in rural areas of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. We have a new engagement 
lead (due to the untimely death of Dr. Shauntice Allen, our former Engagement Lead), Dr. Dina 
Avery, who has extensive connections with community leaders in our region and will work in an 
integrated manner with our outreach and enrollment teams to facilitate our ability to enroll 
participants in new areas. We have several active pilots intended to improve our ability to retain 
participants, including use of retention navigators and providing financial incentives for 
retention. Each of the AoUSN sites is prepared to enroll children (including four with affiliated 
dedicated children’s hospitals) and will support participant reassessments once these components 
are launched. In conclusion, the AoUSN remains committed to the principles of the All of Us
Research Program, and especially its goal of partnering with diverse communities to ensure 
broad inclusion in the program. Precision medicine is a major theme in UAB and our affiliated 
institutions, and we see All of Us as a key opportunity to engage individuals from under-served 
communities to ensure that the benefits of precision medicine are widely available in our 
community."

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles are at the core of the HEALthy Brain and Child Development
(HBCD) Study. While some DEI initiatives have been implemented in HBCD, we propose an expansion of our
efforts that would create a central leadership structure and strategic plan for DEI. Similarly, recruitment and
retention of an appropriately representative sample of diverse families is essential to the success of HBCD.
However, a dedicated leadership team to monitor for and intervene on these key study metrics is needed. There
is a need and an important opportunity to develop strong leadership teams to address both DEI and recruitment
and retention in the HBCD Study in order to meet study objectives. This supplement is designed to enact a
comprehensive plan to address both DEI and recruitment and retention monitoring within HBCD. The supplement
will provide support for four key components of such a plan: 1) New leadership within the Administrative Core of
HBCD with DEI expertise and administrative support for promotion of DEI efforts, 2) Working Group engagement
to carry out DEI strategic plans, 3) New leadership within the Administrative Core of HBCD to oversee and
coordinate recruitment and retention efforts, 4) Recruitment and Retention Monitoring efforts to provide in-depth
analysis and responsive interventions to ensure study targets are being met."

Dose dumping, which is defined as ‘‘unintended, rapid drug release in a short period of time of the entire amount
or a significant fraction of the drug contained in a modified release dosage form’’ can have dangerous effects.
Currently, the FDA recommends to assess the risk of alcohol-induced dose dumping for opioid and non-opioid
drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as metoprolol succinate (β-blocker) and venlafaxine HCl
(antidepressant). Especially, prolonged-release formulations, which offer a reduced dosing frequency and a
prolonged therapeutic effect due to higher drug amounts, are of specific interest. If the opioid drugs-containing
dosage form is consumed with ethanol, the drug release can increase immediately, resulting in an overdose and
leading to respiratory depression followed by hypoxia and even death. Regarding non-opioid drugs, alcohol might
enhance sedation (through synergistic interactions), decrease in motoric skills and may lead to orthostatic
hypotension. However, not many research studies have been reported in the literature on alcohol-induced dose
dumping. It is important to understand effect of formulation, excipients and manufacturing method on the
vulnerability of modified released formulation to dose dumping by alcohol. Ideally, the modified release
formulation should be rugged, not vulnerable to alcohol-induced dose dumping for safety and efficacy points of
view. The objectives of this project are to mechanistically and systemically understand the effect of formulation
composition, formulation design, excipients properties, manufacturing methods and processes parameters on
alcohol-induced dose dumping. The team has extensive experience on alcohol-induced dose dumping, abuse
deterrent, and meth-deterrent formulations development, evaluation of formulation vulnerability to abuse and
dose dumping, understanding and development of metrics for comparison and evaluation of abuse deterrence
and alcohol-induced dose dumping properties, and classification of formulation vulnerability and ruggedness to
abuse and dose dumping at DPQR (Division of product Quality and Research at FDA). Following are the specific
aims of the proposal: Aim I: Mechanistically understand the effect of drug-related factors on alcohol-induced
dose dumping from extended release formulations; Aim II: Mechanistically understand the effect of formulation-
related (composition and design) factors on alcohol-induced dose dumping from extended release formulations;
and Aim III: Mechanistically understand the effect of manufacturing method and process-related factors on
alcohol-induced dose dumping from extended release formulations. This proposal focusses on fundamental
understanding of excipients properties, manufacturing methods and process parameters that may contribute
vulnerability to dose dumping due to alcohol. This basic understanding about the alcohol-induced dose dumping
will help the agency in framing the policy regarding vulnerability and ruggedness of a formulation. Outcome will
be disseminated in the public domain, which can be utilized by industry, academia and regulatory agency."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-028”. Cancer presents a significant burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with Africa facing
a substantial share of this challenge. The Cancer-HIV Care Assistance and Monitoring using Peers Study
(CHAMPS) aims to address the pressing public health issue of cancer among people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWH) by exploring the integration of cancer care into HIV care settings using peer support from expert
clients in Botswana, a low-resource country grappling with both HIV/AIDS and cancer burdens. Aim 1 will
investigates barriers and facilitators in cancer care cascade through a mixed-methods approach targeting
PLWH co-diagnosed with cancer and healthcare providers from public oncology centers and co-located
Infectious Disease Control Centers (IDCC). Aim 2 will assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating
expert client support for cancer care cascade within the IDCCs. Overall, the proposed research will: 1) inform
the development of an R01 grant application for a randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of
integrating expert client support for cancer care among PLWH in Botswana and 2) provide mentorship and
career development for Dr. Lillian Okui, MD, MPH, an early-stage low- and middle-income country investigator
(ESLI) to become an independent investigator in cancer implementation science. Her mentorship team will be
led by a highly experienced primary mentor (see Letter of Mentorship Support) and co-mentors who bring
expertise in implementation science, clinical HIV and cancer care, epidemiology, and qualitative research. Her
career development includes developing advanced research methodologies in design, and analytic techniques
for cancer research, receiving training in implementation science, enhancing publication and presentation
skills, expanding professional networks, and gaining skills in grant writing. Lastly, the proposed global cancer
research is aligned with mission of the Botswana Ministry of Health, the LMIC institution, and the sponsoring
institution, the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Greenebaum
Comprehensive Cancer Center (see Letters of Institutional Support)."

Epidemiological studies have reported a strong positive association between traffic-related air pollution (TRAP)
and risk of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).
Since human exposure to TRAP will continue to increase as a result of expanding global industrialization and
urbanization, there is an urgent need to identify which components in TRAP endanger the human brain, and to
identify how TRAP promotes neurodegenerative disease. The work described in this Diversity supplement will
address these data gaps by leveraging a novel in vitro neuron-astrocyte-microglia triculture model that more
faithfully recapitulates in vivo neuroinflammatory responses than standard neuron monocultures or neuron-
astrocyte co-cultures to test the hypothesis that TRAP-derived fine particulate matter (PM2.5) interacts directly
with microglia in the brain to promote AD-relevant pathology. The scientific premise for this hypothesis includes
experimental evidence previously reported by our research team demonstrating that chronic exposure to ambient
TRAP collected from a heavily-trafficked tunnel in Northern California and delivered unchanged in real-time to
rats in an adjacent vivarium: (1) decreased the time-to onset and increased the magnitude of AD/ADRD-relevant
phenotypes, including neuron cell loss in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus; (2) TRAP promoted microglial
activation, but had no effect on astrogliosis as determined by quantitative immunohistochemical analyses of IBA-
1/CD68 and GFAP expression; and (3) significantly increased the number of particles in the ultrafine PM size
range present in the hippocampus of TRAP-exposed animals relative to filtered air controls. The research goals
of this Diversity supplement are to (1) compare the neurotoxicity of TRAP-derived PM2.5 vs. TRAP-derived
soluble gases in the triculture model; (2) determine whether microglia mediate the neurotoxic effects of TRAP-
derived PM; and (3) assess the influence of sex and genotype on microglia response to TRAP. This research is
complementary to and extends the research described in the parent grant, which is focused on examining the
influence of chronic exposure to different sources of TRAP vehicular emissions on AD-relevant pathology in an
animal model and examining the role of the lung-brain axis in mediating the effects of TRAP on the brain. The
training goals of this Diversity supplement include: (1) develop the trainee’s knowledge and technical skill set to
enable them to successfully conduct research on environmental influences on neurodegenerative disease; (2)
guide the trainee’s research activity to ensure the generation of data needed to support their preparation of a
competitive F31 application and advance to candidacy; (3) enhance the trainee’s professional skills; and (4)
actively work with the trainee to build their professional networks to enhance their likelihood of transitioning to
an independent career in academic research."
11078947,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer, a preventable cancer of disparities, is the primary cause of cancer death for women in
Nicaragua. The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted an elimination strategy for cervical cancer within the
next 100 years, and outlined specific targets to meet by 2030: vaccination (90% of girls before age 15);
screening/early detection (70% of women get a high-quality screen by 35 and again at 45); and treatment (90%
of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions treated). As the majority of the burden of cervical cancer exists in low
and middle income countries (LMICs), significant research into the development, implementation, and cost-
effectiveness of community-based cervical cancer screening models using HPV primary screening has
developed a strong evidence-base for the acceptability and feasibility of this modality. However, significant
geographic variability exists in successfully improving patient health outcomes and preventing cervical cancer,
particularly in rural and remote geographic areas. In Nicaragua, significant intra-country variability exists in terms
of yearly participation in cervical cancer screening by eligible women, and likelihood of lifetime screening,
depending on geographic region. There is a demonstrated need for culturally-tailored, regionally specific
innovations in evidence-based HPV primary cervical screening programs. Based on a successful pilot study
enrolling nearly 2,000 women in Bluefields, Nicaragua, researchers have identified the unique role mHealth
(mobile health) interventions may play in improving health outcomes when integrated into an HPV primary
screening program. Innovations presented herein include the development of a mHealth platform that combines
a patient-centered mobile application (app) with a provider-focused portal, as well as integration of the provider-
focused portal with the National Cervical Cancer Surveillance System (SIVIPCAN). Through developing this
culturally-tailored, regionally appropriate mHealth intervention for women and healthcare providers (R21 phase)
and then pilot testing the impact of this intervention when integrated into a community-based HPV-based primary
cervical cancer screening program (R33 phase), this study will provide important evidence relative to the
potential for novel mHealth interventions to improve cervical cancer screening follow-up and treatment, with a
focus on rural and remote settings, often the hardest geographic regions in which to improve health outcomes."
11078948,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malaria is one of the most serious public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. School-age children are most
commonly infected with malaria parasites with an estimated 200 million at risk. Malaria screening for school-
age children in endemic countries is critical in two aspects: malaria transmission and educational performance
(human capital investment). Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-based interventions have shown to be
effective, but mass screening with malaria RDTs on a routine basis is expensive and impractical. As a result,
school-age children are often excluded. In this respect, risk stratification (prescreening) for malaria RDTs can
play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of malaria. We hypothesize that a combination of blood
hemoglobin level and acute undifferentiated febrile illness assessments can risk-stratify school-age children
who will benefit from malaria RDTs and avoid unnecessary RDTs. Malaria infections in school-age children are
strongly associated with anemia. Thus, noninvasive blood hemoglobin level readings can be highly beneficial
for identifying asymptomatic (undetected) afebrile malaria infections. We will take advantage of our recently
developed mHealth method that can reliably predict blood hemoglobin levels from digital photographs of the
inner eyelid taken by a low-end smartphone. In Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will perfect an mHealth blood
hemoglobin computation algorithm applied to school-age children (6 to 15 years of age) in Rwanda. The
proposed machine learning approach will hybridize deep learning and statistical learning to accurately and
precisely measure blood hemoglobin content among school-age children using an unmodified smartphone. In
Aim 2 (R33 phase), we will develop an mHealth risk-stratification model to determine the need of malaria RDTs
among school-age children. We will investigate the added value of mHealth blood hemoglobin assessments in
identifying patients who will benefit from malaria RDTs and will need confirmatory malaria diagnosis. We will
further formulate an advanced risk-stratification model that can forecast molecular test-confirmed malaria. In
Aim 3 (R33 phase), we will implement an mHealth application integrating malaria risk stratification with the
existing electronic health record (EHR) system. We will incorporate the mHealth technology into an Android-
based EHR-integrated mobile application for community health workers (CHWs) and health facilities in our
study settings. We will also include a digital reporting platform to replace paper-based patient data collection
for CHWs and allow for automatic transmission into the currently used EHR system in our study settings. After
successful completion, we expect to improve malaria diagnosis and management among school-age children,
by empowering CHWs and health facilities with less hardware-dependent mHealth technologies. The proposed
data-driven and connected mHealth technologies can maximize the nationwide scale-up of cost-effective
malaria diagnosis and management in Rwanda, potentially offering mobility, simplicity, and affordability for
rapid and scalable adaptation in other resources-limited settings."
11079336,"The project goal is to understand how age-associated changes to the lymph nodes contribute to decreased
survival of naïve T cells, a hallmark of immune aging. Naïve T cells are essential for resolving infections
caused by newly encountered pathogens, but their number and frequency within the T cell population
decrease dramatically with age. This contributes to reduced magnitude and delayed timing of the aged immune
response against infectious disease. Naïve T cell survival requires constant signaling from the tissue
environment, and it has been well-supported that the aged environment is defective in its ability to maintain
naïve T cell homeostasis. Naïve T cells primarily interact with the tissues of the lymph nodes, organized tissue
compartments strategically located throughout the body that serve as coordination centers for the immune
response. Broad changes to the size and structure of the lymph nodes have been described with age, for both
mice and humans; however, the mechanisms driving these changes, and how they impact naïve T cells, are
unknown. Our data have revealed changes with age to the lymph node stromal cell type known as the
fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC). Naïve T cells adhere to FRCs and crawl along the FRC network in order to
navigate the lymph nodes. FRCs differentiate in situ in a process that requires continuous lymphotoxin-beta
(LTβ) signaling. Mature FRCs express homeostatic cytokines that are essential for naive T cell survival and
chemokines that promote interactions and motility within the lymph nodes. Homeostatic chemokines such as
CCL21 have well-appreciated roles in promoting naïve T cell recruitment to and migration within the lymph
nodes, but how their expression and distribution are impacted by age is not clear. In our preliminary work,
we determined that lymph node stromal expression of Ltbr (lymphotoxin-beta receptor) and Ccl21 were
significantly decreased with age. We also found evidence that FRC differentiation is impaired with age, in that
early FRC precursors were decreased in frequency, and that there was an accumulation intermediate FRC
precursors. The perturbation to FRC precursors was correlated to decreased expression of LTBR,
suggesting that aged FRC precursors were unable to receive the LTβ signals necessary to complete
maturation. We hypothesize that with impaired FRC differentiation, the organization of the FRC network and
its expression of homeostatic chemokines is impaired with age, which inhibits the interactions necessary
for naïve T cell survival. In this project we will determine the role of LTβ signaling in FRC decline with age (Aim
1), and whether altering the architecture of the lymph node microenvironment contributes to decreased naïve T
cell survival (Aim 2). Our experimental approach uses live-cell 2-photon microscopy, which enables us to
visualize the interaction of naïve T cells with FRCs in real time within intact tissues. The completion of the
project will support a mechanism by which the aged tissue microenvironment drives the attrition of naïve T
cells. Establishing this link can lead to development of therapeutics to restore the aged lymph node stroma to
promote the survival and function of naïve T cells in the elderly."
11114128,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The opioid crisis has driven home the need for new, non-addictive analgesics to treat both severe acute and
chronic pain. Over the past 25 years, the search for such novel analgesics has had only a few successes and
many failures. There are two drawbacks of modern analgesic screening that we aim to correct with our screening
assay. First, screening for novel analgesics typically relies on a biochemical readout that is readily amenable to
high throughput screening (HTS). While such an approach has advantages (e.g., speed), it does not account for
the complexity and heterogeneity of nociceptor sensory neuron biology. Second, many new analgesic targets
and efficacy studies from HTS rely on rodent behavior and cellular physiology. For clear ethical reasons, rodent
efficacy studies have made complete sense, and yet, the differences between homo sapiens and murine
organisms have led to a failure to translate exciting preclinical targets to human pain. The mechanisms for these
failures are now being illuminated as multiple research groups, including our own, have begun to study sensory
neuron physiology and pharmacology in primary human dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Differences in expression of
“standard” nociceptor markers between mice, rats, and humans illustrate the importance of moving into human
cells as early as possible in the development of novel analgesics. In this proposal, we address both issues above
by performing screening of natural product fractions for their ability to reduce hyperexcitability in human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived nociceptors. In the past, the promise of derived nociceptors has fallen short of true
human nociceptor replication. Based on our preliminary and published data, we believe that our cells, RealDRGs,
truly are “nociceptors.” In this proposal, we will combine this abundant, replicable, and reliable source of human
“nociceptors” with cutting-edge multi-electrode array (MEA) technology to screen natural product fractions for
analgesic-like effects. Over the last several years, we have used mouse DRGs with MEAs to show proof-of-
concept (PoC) analgesic screening including documenting and validating a Z’-factor assay quality assessment
process. We will use the R61 portion to determine (1) the optimal stable baseline after plating of RealDRGs to
estimate the active electrode yield, (2) the stability in firing rate after exogenous sensitization, (3) the Z’ factor,
and (4) PoC screening of known nociceptor inhibitors. Upon reaching our quantitative milestones, we will then
progress in the R33 phase to (1) screen natural product fractions from the National Cancer Institute with (2) final
testing of subfractions in RealDRGs and in human primary DRGs."
11114186,"Summary
Excitation/inhibition imbalance is considered a major factor leading to cognitive impairment and social
interaction deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), yet the cellular mechanisms
underlying this imbalance are not fully established. Using subchronic phencyclidine (scPCP)-treated mice, a
pharmacological model of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, we discovered that GABAA
function shifts from inhibitory to excitatory in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex of scPCP mice.
We further found that this shift is caused by the selective enhancement of the expression of the chloride
transporter NKCC1, and that NKCC1 antagonism using the NKKC1 inhibitor bumetanide completely restores
the GABAA current reversal potential to the control values. Importantly, we also showed that in-vivo treatment
with bumetanide (IP or local cortical infusion) rescues cognitive performance in scPCP mice. Our preliminary
data further validate these results, showing that bumetanide rescues cognitive performance in male 16p11.2
duplication mice, a genetic model relevant for schizophrenia. We hypothesize that depolarizing GABAA
signaling in the mPFC represents a convergent pathogenic mechanism causing impaired cognition across
multiple genetic models relevant to schizophrenia and that bumetanide treatment may be effective across all
these models. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of three etiologically different genetic mouse
models reflecting variable genetic risk for schizophrenia: a copy number variant model (16p11.2 duplication), a
rare variants model (TRIO+/-), and a common variant model (Cacna1C+/-). These models were developed to
mimic genetic conditions known to significantly increase the incidence of psychiatric disorders including
schizophrenia in humans and show numerous deficits in PFC-specific cognitive tasks such as working memory
and reversal learning. In Aim 1 we will use perforated patch recordings in acute cortical slices to determine the
reversal potential of the GABAA current in pyramidal cells of the mPFC, and quantitative in situ hybridization to
quantify expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 transcripts in mPFC from male and female mice. In Aim 2 we will use
behavioral assessment of wild-type mice in which mPFC NKCC1/KCC2 is increased using pharmacologic or
genetic tools to test the hypothesis that increased mPFC NKCC1/KCC2 is a condition sufficient to cause
cognitive impairment, even in the absence of other cellular dysfunctions. We will also the effects of this
manipulation on mPFC gene expression and morphology. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the behavioral
effects of NKCC1 inhibition in our three disease models. We will test the effects of acute and chronic treatment
with bumetanide, as well as of selective genetic alteration of the NKCC1/KCC2 ratio in the mPFC of these
mice, on several cognitive tests. We will also test the alternative hypothesis that bumetanide acts on glia rather
than neuronal cells. Successful completion of our experiments may have important translational relevance as
bumetanide is an FDA-approved drug and thus could be immediately tested in clinical trials."
11051774,"Alternative treatment approaches are urgently needed to improve quantity and quality of life of patients
with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibition
has yielded auspicious results in many cancers, including lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and
lymphoma amongst several others. The frequency of tumor-specific somatic mutations and hence neoantigen
formation strongly predicts for objective response to checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Prostate cancer is typified by
a relatively low mutational burden, so it is not surprising CPIs for mCRPC are largely ineffective, although
occasional responses have been observed. Over the last few years, mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and
biallelic inactivation of CDK12 (CDK12-/-) have been observed in a small subset of mCRPC patients. Importantly,
these genetic lesions have been associated with increased mutational burden due to increased point mutations
in the case of dMMR and heightened formation of focal tandem duplications in the case of CDK12-/-. Accordingly,
dMMR or CDK12-/- tumors are expected to be sensitive to CPIs.
 The frequency of dMMR has been underestimated due to poor sensitivity of detection assays, which can
fail to detect allelic inactivation of MMR genes. Moreover, neither the frequency of dMMR or CDK12-/- nor the
response to checkpoint inhibition or dMMR or CDK12-/- tumors has been studied amongst Veterans. The
relevance of this knowledge gap amongst Veterans is highlighted by key demographic differences in Veterans
compared to the US population at large, which could in principle affect the frequencies of dMMR and CDK12-/-
as well as response to checkpoint inhibition. Using a sensitive next generation sequencing platform and
bioanalytic tool to detect microsatellite instability, a surrogate for dMMR, we predict that we can detect dMMR or
CDK12-/- in at least 15% of Veterans. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Veterans with dMMR or CDK12-/- will
exhibit a high response rate to checkpoint inhibition. We propose three aims:
1. Identify the frequency of dMMR and CDK12-/- as determined by NGS and a sensitive analytic tool for MSI
 detection amongst Veterans with mCRPC. The MSI bioanalysis, known as mSINGS (microsatellite instability
 by next generation sequencing), as well as targeted gene sequencing inclusive of CDK12 are built-in
 components of OncoPlex, one of the CLIA-certified NGS platforms being implemented within the VA
 Precision Oncology Program Cancer of the Prostate (POPCAP) network.
2. Perform an open label phase 2 clinical trial of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 CPI, to determine the efficacy of
 pembrolizumab amongst dMMR and CDK12-/- mCRPC Veterans who have received prior AR signaling
 ≥
 inhibitors. The primary endpoint will be response rate, defined as a composite of: objective response rate by
 iRECIST 1.1, PSA50 at 12 weeks, radiographic progression free survival at 6 months.
3. Perform exploratory analyses to identify biomarkers of response and resistance to pembrolizumab in dMMR
 and CDK12-/- mCRPC Veterans. For this purpose, we will acquire baseline and at-progression biopsies of
 metastases as well as serial blood samples to investigate genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune
 factors that contribute to response.
This study will result in enhanced understanding of the biology of mCRPCs amongst Veterans and the
identification of Veterans who respond to checkpoint inhibition, thereby benefiting from potentially life extending
therapy. In addition, exploratory/correlative analyses could identify molecular targets, the modulation of which
could potentiate the anti-tumor effects of checkpoint inhibition.."

This COBRE aims to build a program for supporting excellence and innovation in research addressing sleep, 
circadian rhythms (CR), and mental health. Resources that bridge sleep and CR science and pediatric mental 
health research are limited, and opportunities for research training in these areas lack a coordinated system to 
link these important and interconnected constructs. The overall objective of the Pediatric Biopsychological 
Core (PBC) is to address this gap by connecting promising researchers to experienced mentors and creating a 
supportive infrastructure for enhancing research that includes evidence-based assessment of mental health, 
sleep, and the collection of biospecimens. To support this overarching goal, the PBC aims to 1) develop a 
culture of excellence by coordinating the administration of evidence-based assessment measures and 
practices; 2) provide resources for data collection, management, and analysis and the use of technology- 
based resources in the study of biopsychological factors in the context of sleep and circadian rhythms; and 3) 
provide resources for collection, storage, and processing of biospecimens. The PBC will offer Project Leaders 
individualized guidance for assessments of pediatric biopsychological. The Core will also enhance diversity in 
research by offering culturally sensitive measures and resources to promote inclusion. The PBC will also 
support Project Leaders in using rigorous data management procedures in accordance with current best 
practice and open science guidelines. The Core will also maintain a secure, HIPAA-compliant database to 
store multimodal and intensive data streams that will include shared assessment batteries as a resource for 
current and future research. The long-term goals of the Core are to 1) develop a sustainable resource for 
pediatric psychological assessment and biospecimens to enhance and promote high-quality research at 
Bradley Hospital; 2) provide resources for the management and analysis of these data; and 3) consistent with 
NIH priorities, develop a combined, centralized database with an eye towards data harmonization. 
Achievement of these aims will result in enhanced research infrastructure by providing a measurement 
resource that can help researchers integrate the demands of clinical care with the common domains 
articulated in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. Having a center of excellence focused 
on measurement will greatly facilitate the research of COBRE-affiliated projects as well as research across the 
hospital and other Rhode Island facilities by helping to harmonize the assessment of common domains across 
clinical care and research projects. This COBRE will ensure that Bradley Hospital continues to be a state-wide 
and national leader in both research and care of children and adolescents with sleep and mental health 
concerns."
10804714,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY 
 The Administrative Core (AdminCore) of the Bradley COBRE Centre on Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in 
Child and Adolescent Mental Health will be based at the Emma Pendleton Bradley Hospital. This center of 
excellence aims to build a comprehensive and sustainable resource to support the growth of research in the 
sleep/circadian/pediatric mental health domains while providing mentorship of junior Project Leaders for 
research and for transitioning to independent scientific careers with external funding. The AdminCore serves 
as the primary organizational and administrative heart of the Center and its activities, facilitating all aims and 
components. The structure of the Core includes an Executive Leadership Team, a Local Guidance Group, and 
an External Advisory Committee, in addition to the AdminCore, a Pediatric Biopsychology Core, a Sleep and 
Circadian Methods Core, along with projects proposed by 4 outstanding young investigators. The AdminCore 
will (1) establish and maintain the leadership teams providing advisory and oversight roles; (2) develop and 
implement structured review of mentors and project leaders; (3) implement programs and activities for training, 
including a summer apprenticeship program, support for trainees and project leaders to attend the annual 
SLEEP conference, and an annual retreat colloquium; (4) manage the Pilot Project Program, which is funded 
through contributions from Bradley Hospital, Lifespan Corporation, and the AdminCore, including solicitation 
and selection of applications; (5) develop and implement a plan with the External Advisory Committee for 
structured evaluation of the Center. A major goal of the Center’s leadership is to work toward inclusion and 
diversity of its leaders and advisors, mentors, investigators, and research participants. The burden of 
psychiatric illnesses, behavioral disturbances, and neurodevelopmental disorders on children, adolescents, 
and their families is immense, and the sleep disruptions that travel with and may lead to such maladies 
exacerbate the challenges. Starting from it’s founding as the first pediatric psychiatric hospital in the United 
States, Bradley Hospital continues to provide world-class care for pediatric mental disorders in all their forms 
and has excellent clinicians, clinical scientists, and clinical services. This environment provides fertile ground 
for cultivating researchers who can work on connections to sleep and circadian rhythms. The promise of this 
COBRE Center as a preeminent center of biomedical research excellence is strong, and the most important, 
special, and notable aspect of this proposed center is the vulnerable young people whose health and wellbeing 
are at the heart of our work."
10804731,"Project Summary/Abstract 
The goal of the COBRE Center on Sleep and circadian rhythms in child and adolescent mental health is 
to build a center that will help bridge the gap between sleep and circadian science and child and adolescent 
mental health. The objective of the Sleep and Circadian Methods (SCM) Core is to support Project Leaders 
and Center investigators in the appropriate use of sleep and circadian methods across the research process. 
Sleep and circadian data are complex and multimodal, requiring specialized expertise to select, acquire, score, 
analyze and interpret. The SCM Core will provide this expertise to support junior investigators in all aspects of 
the research process starting at study design moving through data acquisition and quality control to data 
processing and ending at analysis and interpretation. The core will support investigators in three major 
domains. First, the SCM core will assist in the selection, acquisition, scoring, analysis, and interpretation of 
sleep and circadian measures. This assistance will be through curation of a resource library (e.g., 
recommended readings, research protocols, guides, scoring instructions, analytic syntax), provision of expert 
consultation, and direct assistance using time from trained technicians and research apprentices. Second, the 
core will coordinate access to facilities, instrumentation, software, and database resources required for 
acquisition, storage, and scoring of sleep and circadian data. This coordination will enable the COBRE- 
affiliated projects to utilize finite resources such as beds in the Bradley Sleep Laboratory. Finally, the core will 
provide training in current best-practices and help identify innovative methods, measurement and analytic 
approaches to sleep and circadian science suitable for pediatric mental health populations. Through these 
services, the SCM core will greatly enhance the reach of the Bradley Sleep Laboratory's specialized 
infrastructure and expertise, which to date have only been available to those directly employed by the 
laboratory. The Long-term goal is to integrate pediatric sleep and circadian methods into Bradley Hospital 
infrastructure thus providing an enduring resource that will support research addressing the interplay between 
mental health, development, sleep, and circadian rhythms."

Proteomics analysis of URECA nasal secretions.
Rationale. The URECA 14-17 year time point includes collection of nasal secretions by nasosorption to
complement information that will be gained by analyzing nasal cell RNA and DNA. Analysis of nasal specimens
collected at 11 year of age indicates that children with allergic asthma or chronic rhinitis have distinct
differences in nasal epithelial cell gene expression that include increased expression of T2 genes and reduced
expression of an array of other immune response genes. For example, children with a history of chronic rhinitis
beginning in early life have downregulation of a network of genes including canonical antiviral genes (STAT1,
IRF1) but also genes involved in other innate immune responses (e.g., GSMA, CCL5) and adaptive immune
responses (HLA-DRA, CD4, CD19). Notably, there is a strong negative correlation between the upregulated T2
cluster and the downregulation of other immune response genes. These findings suggest that T2 inflammation
can suppress a variety of mucosal immune responses, including antiviral, antibacterial, and innate and
adaptive responses.
Preliminary data. To further explore the hypothesis that airway
mucosal immunity is depressed in children with allergic rhinitis, we
have analyzed nasal secretions from children enrolled in the
Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST study). Nasal secretions were
obtained by “nasal blow” from 9 y/o children who were sensitized to
aeroallergens and reported at least moderate nasal symptoms, and
an equal number of children with neither symptoms nor sensitization
(10 per group). The nasal samples were tested for immunoglobulin
content by multiplex ELISA (Milliplex, Millipore). IgE values were low
at the threshold of detection for this assay (40% undetectable), and
not significantly different between the groups (geomean 6 vs. 3
ng/mL, allergic vs. nonallergic respectively, ns). However, children with
allergic rhinitis had generally lower immunoglobulin levels than the
normal controls (Figure). However, there were significant differences
Figure _. Immunoglobulin levels in nasal
secretions from allergic and nonallergic
children. Geometric means +/- SD.
(p<0.05) in other immunoglobulins in nasal secretions including IgM (48 vs. 11 pg/mL), IgG2 (1365 vs. 196
pg/mL) and IgA (124 vs. 23 ng/mL). These findings suggest that allergic rhinitis is associated with reduced
immunoglobulins in nasal secretions, and that this could be related to greater susceptibility to both viral and
bacterial infections.
Experimental design. We proposal to conduct a pilot study with 12 samples of nasal secretions (nasosorption)
from URECA children with allergic rhinitis (aeroallergen sensitization and nasal symptoms) and 12 samples
from children with neither allergy nor allergic sensitization. We will use mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS, UW
A.I.C. Mass Spectrometry Facility) to identify proteins in the secretions. Samples of nasal secretions are stored
in PBS, and we will extract with acetone and analyze protein content. Between-group comparisons will be used
to identify differentially expressed proteins. We will verify differences in protein content by analyzing the
remaining specimens (~300) with multiplex ELISA using custom panels targeting differentially expressed
proteins (Milliplex). Analyzing the entire group of specimens will enable differences in protein expression to be
compared across rhinitis and asthma phenotypes.
Anticipated results and interpretation. We anticipate that respiratory allergy will be associated with reduction in
critical proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. These include IgA and other
immunoglobulins, granzyme A, and complement factors. If confirmed, these observations could help to explain
higher risk of infections (e.g., viral illnesses, sinusitis) in children with respiratory allergy, and higher rates of
colonization with bacterial pathogens such as Moraxella catarrhalis and Hemophilus influenzae."

The project will enroll 180 persons with the autosomal dominant gene for Cerebral Autosomal Dominant
Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) to investigate retinal imaging
measures as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and disease monitoring biomarkers for clinical trial readiness.
CADASIL is a rare disease and the most heritable monogenic form of vascular cognitive impairment and
dementia. The research design will allow the examination using the full spectrum of vascular dementia from
presymptomatic gene carriers through dementia. This research is novel from any other in its efforts to study a
single-gene vascular dementia group throughout the life span in an effort to reduce vascular dementia
heterogeneities selecting persons enriched for certain future vascular disease secondary to NOTCH3 gene
mutation. CADASIL has been considered a good single-gene model of small vessel disease and vascular
dementia. By improving our understanding of CADASIL and its progression, we will be better able to
understand the more common sporadic vascular dementias. Since many known neurodegenerative diseases
are determined at autopsy to be mixed dementias with a vascular component, the findings from the proposed
research may also impact the large cohorts of neurodegeneration in our aging population. We have
established an NIH-funded U.S. multi-site longitudinal natural history study of CADASIL (www.cadasil-
consortium.org). The proposed grant aims to build on this ongoing CADASIL study by adding multifaceted
retinal imaging to investigate as a biomarker in CADASIL. Studying the retina – a region that shares numerous
embryological and anatomical similarities with the brain – will advance our understanding of various
pathologies caused by different NOTCH3 pathogenic variants (PVs). The retina's structural and vascular
features can be demonstrated non-invasively with high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
OCT-angiography (OCT-A). In this project, we will focus on three primary retinal assessments: 1) retinal
capillary bed pathology using OCT-A with measures of vessel density (VD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ)
area/effective diameter, vessel tortuosity index (VTI); 2) retinal arteriolar changes using spectral domain (SD)
OCT with measures of mean wall thickness (MWT) and lumen diameter (LD) of the superior temporal retinal
arteriole; and 3) inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness as a measure of synaptic injury. At the conclusion of this
research, data will be available to determine the strength of each potential measure as a biomarker for clinical
trials in neurodegenerative diseases with cerebrovasculopathies. Findings will facilitate determination of the
contexts of use for non-invasive, low-cost retinal imaging biomarkers."

11081892,"Project Summary
The myocardium relies on a continuous supply of oxygen from a complex system of blood vessels that make
up the coronary circulation. Despite its importance, the coronary circulation and how its flow is regulated are
not fully understood. To facilitate insights into the functioning of this complex physiological system, various
computational models have been developed to study a variety of characteristics of coronary flow, providing a
unique framework to integrate physiological and mechanical processes across different scales. The study of
coronary flow requires detailed knowledge of its network structure, from the large epicardial vessels, down to
the capillaries, and across the myocardium (from the epicardium to the endocardium). Most studies thus far
have relied on direct morphometric characterization of the larger coronary arteries (e.g., Kassab’s studies on
swine heart’s from nearly two decades ago), and on physics-based assumptions to generate volume-filling
microvascular networks. However, the structural design of the coronary microvasculature is non-trivial with
numerous elements influencing its form. Imaging the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the coronary
microvasculature with modern imaging techniques can facilitate insights into its function, structure, and
pathophysiology. In this proposal, I aim to conduct high-resolution imaging of a swine heart to perform
quantitative analysis of its coronary vascular morphometry across spatial scales. In Aim 1, I will define a tissue
clearing and vascular imaging protocol. To achieve this, I will optimize optical tissue clearing techniques to
render myocardial tissue homogeneously transparent using tailored treatments with hydrophilic chemical
cocktails (i.e. CUBIC reagents) for tissue delipidation, decoloring, and refractive index matching in combination
with fluorescent labeling of endothelial cells with tomato lectin and casting of the vasculature with dextrin-
rhodamine. Optimization of our approach will be accomplished in mice hearts, facilitating iterations, guiding its
application to larger swine hearts. Sub-micron vascular details will be captured over large tissue volumes using
episcopic techniques with a laser scanning confocal microscopy. In Aim 2, I will characterize the network
structure of the coronary microvasculature and identify adaptations in the setting of obesity. In order to study
the network structure, I will develop methods to segment the vasculature by creating toolkits that correct for
image artifacts, filter to enhance vessel-like structures, binarize and segment vessels, perform skeletonization
to preserve network topology, and merge vessel graphs. Custom analyses will be performed on merged vessel
graphs to quantify its morphology and topology. Using a clinically relevant metabolic syndrome model in
Ossabaw swine, I will then compare the microvasculature among lean and obese swine for quantitative
differences in morphology and topology. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical insight
into the role of structural adaptations of the coronary microcirculation in disease states such as obesity and will
propel further coronary flow modeling by providing detailed anatomic data of the coronary microvasculature."
11081894,"Black-White coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) disparities persist in the US despite decades
of research and national public health campaigns. The role of social determinants of health (SDH) like struc-
tural racism in health disparities has been studied in only 1% of published work. Few studies of SDH have
taken a life course perspective related to risk of CHD and HF. The ability to recover after the stress of an acute
health event, or resilience, is an important patient-centered outcome, but the influence of SDH on resilience is
unknown. Few past studies have examined both structural and intermediary SDH in the World Health Organi-
zation’s (WHO) Commission on SDH (WHOCSD) conceptual framework in a longitudinal national sample with
rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF endpoints, which is one of the aims of this proposal. We propose a series
of studies to fill these gaps, while also providing rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF events and causes of
death to a host of investigators interested in using these data (to date, over 500 have used these data). We
build on a track record of mentoring to propose a formal year-long career development program for early-stage
investigators (ESI), especially underrepresented minorities (URM). The specific aims of this proposal are to:
(Aim 1) conduct studies examining underlying mechanisms of health disparities, guided by the WHOCSD con-
ceptual framework, in three thematic areas: a) the incidence and recurrence of CHD; b) the incidence and re-
currence of HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction; c) reserve and resilience
after an incident or recurrent CHD or HF event. (Aim 2) To continue to adjudicate CHD events, HF hospitaliza-
tions, and causes of death to support a wide range of studies by investigators beyond our group, and to link the
cohort with Medicare data to support investigators conducting health services utilization studies. (Aim 3) To
support the development of researchers in CVD health equity, especially URMs, through a new mentored re-
search program for a cohort of ESIs, including analytic and statistical support and an annual 2-day Health Eq-
uity Research Summer Institute of presentations, training, mock study section, and networking. ESIs will gradu-
ate with specific competencies in CVD health equity research. The proposed grant will inform policy, advocacy,
and the design of interventions by generating new evidence on which SDH and disparities in health services
lead to population-level disparities in incident and recurrent CHD and HF, and on resilience in recovery after a
CHD or HF event. Our multidisciplinary team includes epidemiologists, sociologists, health services research-
ers, biostatisticians, clinicians, and a participant Advisory Board, assuring rigor and relevance of the proposed
research. Continued funding for the REGARDS-MI infrastructure will support a host of additional studies led by
an expanding group of investigators. Funding will also expand the cadre of researchers dedicated to discover-
ing strategies to achieve health equity for all US adults, a goal supported by NHLBI, the National Academy of
Sciences, the CDC, the American Heart Association, and all major professional societies in the US."

11052115,"Bupe by the Book: Developing and Testing a Tele-buprenorphine Intervention in Public
 Libraries with Unstably Housed Persons with Opioid Use Disorder
Abstract
 Public libraries nationwide are experiencing an on-premise opioid overdose crisis. Buprenorphine
“bupe” is a highly effective medical treatment for OUD, but many unstably housed persons at
libraries lack access to bupe due to structural barriers. “Bupe by the Book” (BBB), in collaboration with
our established local partners, San Diego Public Libraries and Father Joe's Village Health Center (FJV),
would innovatively adapt FJV's already successful same-day, free low barrier tele-bupe treatment to
library settings. By testing tele-bupe uptake and retention in libraries, this study will inform how
individuals can receive bupe care in innovative low-barrier ways, potentially changing the landscape
radically for implementing bupe. Our three aims are:
 1) Develop and refine “Bupe by the Book” (BBB) within the Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM): Through focus groups and intervention mapping techniques, we will: a) assess the perceptions
of stakeholders such as local residents with children who use the library, library staff, tele-bupe
providers, and persons with OUD about BBB's potential, b) develop a plan with stakeholder input, and c)
identify modifiable barriers to implementation.
 2) Determine the feasibility of BBB and measure treatment uptake and adherence: We will
conduct a 12-week pilot 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n=40). Study staff will recruit library
patrons and randomize them to weekly tele-bupe at the library or in-person clinic control arms. A health
provider will then screen participants for eligibility for same-day bupe induction. BBB's effects on bupe
induction and adherence to prescribed doses will be based on self-reported measures at 1-,2-,4-,8-,12-
week follow-ups with study staff, and weekly urinary drug screenings and prescription pickups. We
hypothesize that tele-bupe in the library vs. the control group will have higher uptake and longer
adherence to treatment. This pilot will provide estimates of uptake and adherence for the design of a
larger trial of the intervention's efficacy.
 3) Evaluate the acceptability of BBB and identify program components that could be improved
to enhance adherence and patient satisfaction. We will conduct structured interviews with BBB
patients, health providers, and library staff to gain insight into the patients' experiences with BBB
compared to in-person clinic-based bupe treatment.
 By utilizing multiple library sites, we will render tele-bupe reproducible for other libraries nationwide
facing opioid overdoses and pave the foundation for a larger RCT in a subsequent R01 to evaluate the
efficacy of utilizing public settings to treat substance use disorders and reduce opioid-related deaths."
11072363,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. Aging is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
leading to clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and increased risk for hematologic malignancies. This supplement project,
led by Dr. Peter van Galen in collaboration with Drs. Jennifer Trowbridge and Ross Levine, focuses on the role
of stem cell heterogeneity and inflammation in the clonal expansion of HSCs during aging. The long-term goal
is to promote healthy aging of the blood system based on a molecular understanding of HSC biology. The
objective of this application is to determine if inflammatory HSCs link aging to clonal expansion. The central
hypothesis is that inflammatory HSCs increase with age and provide a reservoir for the clonal expansion of
DNMT3A-mutated HSCs, and that the inflammatory HSC subset shares properties between humans and mice.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Quantify the emergence of clonal
inflammatory HSC populations with age, 2) Inflammatory HSCs as a reservoir for DNMT3A-mutated clonal
expansion, and 3) Define the conserved inflammatory HSC state by integrating mouse and human data. This
work will involve comprehensive studies using cutting-edge single-cell technologies and a biobank of bone
marrow samples established in the Van Galen lab. The analysis will encompass three age cohorts (young,
middle-aged, and aged) and DNMT3A-mutated CH subjects. In addition, we will use advanced bioinformatics to
dissect the concordance of HSC heterogeneity between mouse and human systems, focusing on the
inflammatory HSC state. The research is innovative because it integrates HSC heterogeneity and clonal
expansion, incorporating the aging-associated expansion of inflammatory HSCs to explain the fitness advantage
conferred by DNMT3A mutations using a multidisciplinary approach that combines molecular biology, genetics,
and bioinformatics. It extends beyond the current understanding by focusing on the interplay between DNMT3A
mutations and inflammation, providing insights into the selective pressures that drive the clonal evolution of
HSCs with age. The significance of this research lies in its potential to identify novel molecular mechanisms
underlying age-associated hematologic diseases and to uncover new therapeutic targets. By deciphering the
complex interactions between epigenetic dysregulation, inflammatory signaling, and aging, this project aims to
pave the way for interventions that could mitigate the risk of hematologic malignancies in the aging population,
ultimately improving health outcomes and quality of life."
11070135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Working-aged American adults spend large portions of their days engaged in work—a major social determinant
of health. The growth of non-standard work arrangements in the United States has had detrimental impacts on
the health and well-being of workers. These evolving arrangements are defined as Emergent Work (EW), or
contemporary work that is outside of traditional full-time employment, expected to end, lacking an implicit or
explicit contract, and/or precarious. Because minoritized workers disproportionately comprise workers in EW,
the national trend towards EW may also exacerbate health disparities. Developing a nuanced understanding of
EW and its relationship to health, well-being, and health disparities is essential for improving population health
in the United States. Toward this end, this project includes a comprehensive training plan and integrative
investigation of EW in California, a state at the forefront of this labor market trend. The project PI is a postdoctoral
research associate in the University of Southern California’s Chan Division of Occupational Science and
Occupational Therapy. The PI will work with a mentorship team of worker health and methods experts to
complete a multi-method study of the state-wide California Work and Health Survey, a comprehensive study of
work and health factors in 4,104 workers from the California labor force. Aim 1 will identify latent classes of EW
among workers aligned with contemporary work arrangements. Aim 2 will characterize contemporary EW based
on worker demographics, health, and well-being. Aim 3 will examine workers’ lived experiences of participation
in EW relative to health and well-being. Completing these scientific aims will contribute to a comprehensive
understanding of objective and subjective factors influencing health and well-being in EW and provide insight
into personal factors informing the relationships between EW and potential health disparities. Concurrent didactic,
project-based, and professional development activities will complement mentorship and pursuit of these three
aims. Specifically, training in data science and survey analysis methods will support the completion of Aims 1
and 2, and instruction in qualitative methods will support the completion of Aim 3. Coursework will be completed
to advance understanding of work as a social determinant of health and research methods, and efforts will be
directed toward professional development and dissemination. These integrative experiences with a mentored
research project and a comprehensive training plan will launch the PI’s career as a junior scientist interested in
understanding social determinants of health in workers and addressing worker health disparities. This project
aligns with the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparity’s research concept about the role of
work in health disparities in the United States, as well as the Healthy People 2030 initiative’s focus on the work
and the workplace as community-level social determinants of health."
11086521,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT OF PARENT GRANT
 Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more
susceptible to the long-term consequences of nicotine exposure. Clinical evidence has revealed that stress
produced by nicotine withdrawal can be intensified by fluctuations in gonadal hormones in women, although the
underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Thus, there is a critical need to determine the mechanisms by which
stress systems enhance withdrawal severity in females versus males, and the influence of ovarian hormones on
these measures in adult females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then the challenges of reducing nicotine use
and developing specialized medications for females will remain largely insurmountable. The long-term goal of
our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate nicotine use among different clinical populations
that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms
that promote withdrawal from chronic nicotine vapor inhalation. Recent work in male rodents has revealed that
nicotine withdrawal is modulated in the medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN) pathway. Our
central hypothesis is that sex differences in withdrawal are modulated in the local circuits of the IPN, where
stress and ovarian hormones modulate withdrawal severity in females. Specifically, our mechanistic
hypothesis is that females experience greater inhibitory tone in the IPN via local interneurons that release the
inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These GABA interneurons express type 1
receptors for the stress peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRFR1). We posit that chronic nicotine produces
a greater enhancement of CRF production and CRFR1 receptor expression which further promotes GABAergic
inhibitory tone in the IPN of females. The rationale for the proposed research is that its successful completion is
likely to contribute to a mechanistic framework for the development of new cessation strategies, particularly for
women. Guided by strong preliminary data, the following specific aims were designed to: 1) identify the
mechanisms by which the IPN controls nicotine withdrawal in females and males and 2) determine the effects of
ovarian hormones on IPN-modulated nicotine withdrawal in females. The proposed studies constitute a multi-
disciplinary approach involving tract tracing, behavior, immunocytochemistry, neurochemistry, and gene-transfer
technology to compare sex differences (Aim 1) and the influence of ovarian hormones (Aim 2) on withdrawal
severity and inhibitory tone in the IPN. The proposed work is innovative because it combines state-of-the-art
methods to unveil the mechanisms by which inhibitory tone in the IPN modulates withdrawal in a sex- and
hormone-dependent manner. The proposed research is significant because the results are expected to inform
the development of future interventions that will selectively target the underlying mechanisms of withdrawal.
Ultimately, the results of our research continuum are expected to contribute meaningfully to the design of
precision therapeutics that will reduce health disparities produced by chronic nicotine use, particularly in women."

11052046,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the leading cause of noninfectious inflammatory 
brain disorders in persons younger than 30 years of age. It manifests with confusion, psychosis, and seizures 
that may require pharmacologically-induced coma. The most debilitating complication of anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis is permanent cognitive failure that occurs in the absence of structural changes on brain imaging or 
histopathological evidence of tissue loss; the pathophysiology of encephalopathy remains unclear. Memory 
difficulties contribute to poor quality of life in recovering patients; therefore, identifying mechanisms underlying 
the loss of cognitive function in autoimmune encephalitis will allow to develop strategies for attenuation and 
reversal of these deficits. Emerging literature from animal studies has demonstrated that normal proliferation of 
the adult neurogenic stem cells (NSC) in the hippocampus is reduced during prolonged chemically-induced 
seizures and spontaneous seizures in Alzheimer’s disease models, and the disruption of neurogenesis occurs 
in parallel with memory decline. Further, attenuation of seizures resulted in restoration of neurogenesis and 
reversal of memory deficits. We developed a mouse model of autoimmune seizures and showed that mice 
develop seizures and memory disturbances during the passive transfer of anti-NMDAR antibodies from 
patients. Further, we showed that hippocampal inflammation in encephalitis contributes to the development of 
memory deficits; however, the role of neurogenesis in the development of cognitive deficits has not been 
explored. This application’s aims are to combine the histological, imaging, and behavioral data to determine 
how autoimmune seizures and inflammation affect the proliferation of the hippocampal NSCs in anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis. Our first aim is to quantify the cell-specific changes in NSC pool during the sustained exposure to 
anti-NMDAR antibodies in our mouse model using immunohistochemical phenotypic markers of neuroprogenitor 
cells and stereological analyses (Aim 1a). We will then visualize and quantify the temporal changes in the 
hippocampal NSC pool using in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 3’-deoxy-3’-[18F] fluoro- 
L-thymidine (Aim 1b) and assess the corresponding memory changes using hippocampal-specific behavioral 
tests (Aim 1c). Under the second arm, we will visualize the patterns of regional inflammation in the hippocampus 
using radiolabeled translocator protein (TSPO)-PET and establish how the extent of the abnormalities on 
the brain imaging relates to the memory and learning functions in mice (Aim 2a). With the goal of developing 
new therapeutic strategies aimed to attenuate cognitive loss in autoimmune encephalitis, we will determine if 
administration of anakinra, an interleulkin-1 receptor antagonist previously shown to decrease hippocampal 
inflammation and restore memory in mice, also reverses an aberrant neurogenesis in seizures (Aim 2b). This 
successful completion of the project will address a critical gap in understanding the cellular mechanisms of 
chronic memory loss in autoimmune encephalitis and will lead to the discovery of new targeted interventions."
11082793,"Program Summary
Our laboratory received continuous NIGMS funding since 2004 that allowed us to make substantial
advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of the dynamic contacts between neighboring cells
(adherens junctions) and between cells and the extracellular matrix (focal adhesions structures). In
addition to holding animal cells together, these cell junctions communicate signals and control the stress
placed upon cells.
Over the past 16 years, we contributed important mechanistic discoveries toward an understanding of
• how the cell-cell junctions connect cells in tissues to regulate tissue homeostasis that is crucial to
 providing the tissue barrier of epithelia, as well as cell migration and proliferation; and
• how cell junctions initiate and maintain cell adhesion while regulating the organization of the underlying
 actin cytoskeleton by establishing a center for cell signaling and gene transcript regulation.
We discovered how talin activates vinculin to stabilize focal adhesions and thereby suppress cell
migration. Our high-resolution vinculin crystal structures, which we confirmed biochemically and in live
cells, showed the auto-inhibitory intramolecular interactions that inactivate vinculin and thereby prevent
vinculin from binding to the actin cytoskeleton.
We also provided important insights into cell-cell junctions. Our high-resolution crystal and cryogenic
electron microscopy structures of a-catenin, a crucial mediator of intercellular adhesions, revealed the
mechanistic roles that its quaternary structures play in cell-cell adhesion and the formation of the dynamic
link to the actin cytoskeleton. Significantly, our discoveries led to mechano-transduction studies of cell-cell
and cell-matrix junctions on how cells sense and transmit forces.
We recently discovered how lipid binding to vinculin, its cardiac isoform metavinculin, and to talin regulates
focal adhesion turnover. This knowledge and expertise are the foundation for further discoveries that will
additionally focus on the understudied role of the plasma membrane in cell adhesion.
In the long run, we hope to fully understand cell adhesion by attaining a near-atomic structure of a
“synthetic” cell junction. The regulation and dysregulation of cell junctions are fundamental to many
biological processes such as development and cancer. Therefore, our proposed studies have both basic
and potentially translational significance.
The progress of our proposal relies heavily on obtaining purified proteins for structural and biochemical
studies. We purchased our FPLCs over 20 years ago that are no longer functioning fully. The AKTA pure
25m system would be a two decades upgrade and provide exponentially faster progress on R35

11082798,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research: Lower respiratory infections such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are the leading cause
of infection-related deaths worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that adverse long-term health outcomes
are more common in CAP survivors compared with patients hospitalized for other reasons, challenging the
concept of CAP as solely an acute disease. The mechanisms underlying adverse long-term CAP sequelae are
unknown, although dysregulation of the host immune response during acute infection has been postulated to
be a contributing factor. Moreover, the clinical and biological heterogeneity of CAP serves as a major barrier to
identification of individualized and targeted therapies, which may impede prevention of adverse long-term
outcomes. In Thailand, the burden of CAP is high and in the northeastern region of the country the Gram-
negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the most common and deadly etiology. Studying CAP due to
this single pathogen (Bp-CAP) may help to disentangle CAP heterogeneity and host-mediated determinants of
long-term outcomes. Utilizing a uniquely large multicenter prospective cohort of patients hospitalized with Bp-
CAP in Northeast Thailand, Dr. Coston will address the following Aims: (1) Determine if admission CAP
severity is associated with adverse outcomes after discharge; (2) Identify pro-inflammatory cytokines
associated with adverse outcomes after discharge; (3) Identify novel subgroups of Bp-CAP by applying
clustering strategies to routinely collected clinical and laboratory data. The proposed work will yield insight into
determinants of long-term outcomes and heterogeneity in Bp-CAP, which could facilitate identification of
modifiable factors and host-focused tailored therapeutics in the future. Such findings may be generalizable to
other CAP etiologies and are an important area of future study.
Candidate/Environment: The candidate, Dr. Coston, is a promising junior investigator who is beginning his
career as a clinical-translational physician-scientist focused on the global threats pneumonia and severe
infections. He has assembled a team of accomplished faculty to provide him with mentorship and training
throughout the award. He will avail of the University of Washington’s rich academic environment, pulmonary
and global health expertise, and track record of training successful physician-scientists in pulmonary and
critical care medicine. Through the proposed research, he will develop fundamental skills for analysis of
longitudinal cohort data, cluster analysis, study of biomarkers in the host response to infection, and ethical
conduct of research in global settings. The research and training proposed in this project will further Dr.
Coston’s development as a physician-scientist and will prepare him to compete successfully for a K23 career

11082723,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a public health crisis in the US
marked by growing racial disparities, with African Americans (AAs) two to three times more likely to be
diagnosed than non-Hispanic Whites. Efforts to identify modifiable earlier-life risk and protective factors
for known midlife risk factors for poor cognitive outcomes in later life are needed to protect the health of
middle-aged and older AAs. We propose to prospectively examine trajectories of stress exposures from
childhood to early midlife as predictors of known midlife risk factors for subsequent AD/ADRD in two
primarily (~66%) AA cohorts that are now ages 41-45 and have been followed repeatedly from age 6 to
age 32 (2009-2011) by the Johns Hopkins Prevention Intervention Research Center (PIRC). Relevant
individual- and community-levels stress exposures that occur from early life to middle adulthood
include: 1) adverse life circumstances (i.e., extreme poverty, residential instability, crime, incarceration,
racial discrimination, traumatic events); 2) mental disorders and their symptoms; and 3) poor sleep
(e.g., abnormal duration, fragmentation). Additionally, these stress exposures have been linked to other
risk factors for AD/ADRD, including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, by which AAs are
disproportionately affected. We aim to determine the extent to which ~35-year trajectories of stress
exposures are associated with estimated midlife risk for later-life AD/ADRD, physiological aging
(telomere length, p16, methylation age), epigenetic modification, and inflammation, and cognitive
performance-all measured in early midlife-and if these associations are moderated by sex, race, and
AD/ADRD risk genes. We will also explore how the timing of exposures in the life-course affects these
associations, and if other potential moderators (e.g., childhood academic achievement,
educational/occupational attainment, alcohol/drug use, conduct problems, social support, perceived
control) affect these associations. We will further explore effects of two early-life (ages 6-8) PIRC
interventions on midlife study outcomes. To accomplish this, 1,150 PIRC participants will complete two
in-home interviews including a cognitive battery and actigraphic sleep assessments, and we will collect
biospecimens for genetic and epigenetic material and physiological aging measures. This study is a
rare opportunity to clarify links of earlier-life stress exposures with estimated midlife dementia risk,
identify vulnerable subgroups for targeted AD/ADRD prevention, elucidate the role of social inequities in
determining racial disparities in AD dementia, and establish a midlife cognitive baseline for future
follow-up of these unusually well-characterized longitudinal, primarily AA cohorts."
11087194,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Trachoma programs have been enormously successful, but they fell short of their goal of Global
Elimination of Trachoma by 2020. Nearly one third of endemic districts still had not met the threshold for control.
Why?
 One reason may be that the 2020 goals were set long before sufficient evidence was available. In the
original grant period, we used program surveys to forecast the distribution of active trachoma worldwide. We
also used NEI clinical trial data to better define the relationship between clinical activity and actual chlamydial
infection. New clinical, infection, and serology data will now enable more precise estimates. In carrying out the
aims of this current proposal, we will use these enriched information sources to forecast which districts will
achieve control under current efforts.
 A second factor is that the trachoma intervention guidelines have essentially been “one size fits all”. Here,
we propose to assess the enhanced interventions necessary to achieve control in hotspots where current efforts
are not sufficient for trachoma control.
 Finally, the WHO plan acknowledged that resurgence may happen. In the original grant period, we
demonstrated that surveys of trachoma prevalence sometimes switched from supporting control to questioning
control. In this current proposal we propose to model resurgence so that surveillance of resurgence can be
improved.
 In summary, we propose: (a) real-time open-access forecasts that set realistic interim and elimination
goals to help keep our specific collaborating stakeholder's programs on track; (b) models for better targeting hot
spots with enhanced interventions to accelerate success; (c) models for rational surveillance for resurgence to
maintain control once success has been declared."

As legalization of cannabis, whether for recreational or medical use, rapidly spreads in the United States, it is
acutely necessary to study it. Environmental factors play a role in the development of cannabis use disorder
(CanUD), but less is known about the genetic basis of the risk for developing CanUD, its short- and long-term
effects, the individual's response to cannabis derivatives such as cannabidiol (CBD), and the individual's
response to new treatments for CanUD. Because people of many different ancestries use cannabis, genetic
analyses must include non-European populations, including African ancestry, East Asian, and admixed
American (Latino). Our group published the first genomewide association study (GWAS) of CanUD with
genomewide significant results and the most powerful GWAS (Levey et al Nat Genet 2023), but more work
needs to be done. The parent grant, Genetics of Cannabis Use and Cannabinoid Response in Humans, will
study, among other things, the genetic interplay of CanUD and schizophrenia (SCZ), which have long been
understood to be clinically correlated; preliminary genetics studies have also shown bidirectional causality
between the two; and PRS of those traits with respect to THC infusion. This supplement proposes to study the
genetic interplay of CanUD and major depressive disorder (MDD), which is more common than SCZ (lifetime
prevalence 20% in the U.S. vs. 1-2% for SCZ) but highly morbid, with an estimated $24 billion in lost
productivity per year in the U.S. Our group also conducted a well-powered GWAS of MDD. Genetic findings,
however, need to be put into biological and ultimately clinical context. For this reason, this supplement
proposes a translational research program built on that of the parent grant, in which results of GWAS and post-
GWAS analyses are used to generate polygenic risk scores for CanUD and MDD, which then are used to
predict facets of the acute response to THC, CBD, and CanUD treatments in the lab. The work will be divided
between two experienced and productive research groups: Dr. Gelernter's for genetic analyses and Dr.
D'Souza's for human laboratory studies (HLS) of cannabinoid pharmacology. This will result in 1) better
understanding of genetic variants that influence both MDD and CanUD risk, 2) in non-European and European
populations, 3) with translation to HLS of THC, CBD, and THC treatment administration, to better understand
the acute response and long-term risk for addiction, and 4) the potential for a better understanding of the
influence of genetic factors on response to new treatments for CanUD and neuropathic pain."

Vegetable intake can contribute to many health benefits; however, the bitter taste of vegetables creates a
barrier to consuming a healthful diet. Therefore, to increase consumption of healthy foods, it is of utmost
importance to investigate factors that influence the consumption of healthy, nutritionally valuable foods. There
have been generations of work examining how to increase acceptance of vegetables, and to increase
vegetable “liking.” The most common, and successful, technique used in children to increase the acceptability
of novel or bitter foods is repeated exposure (RE). In adult rodent models, we have also shown RE to a bitter
diet increases acceptance of the bitter food. Our findings demonstrate that salivary proteins (SPs) mediate this
change in taste-driven responding to a bitter stimulus in rodent models. Human literature has alluded to the
idea that early-life interventions such as repeated exposure during infancy or toddlerhood can alter food
preferences into adulthood yet the research supporting this has been limited. In addition, both human and
rodent literature have demonstrated maternal diet has a large impact on offspring food preferences. We plan to
develop a rodent model to address these open questions. AIM 1 will test how vertical transmission of a
bitter maternal diet to offspring during gestation and lactation affects adult offspring response to a
bitter solution. We will examine taste-guided responsivity, two-bottle choice preference and salivary protein
(SP) expression in adult rats that were exposed to experimental diets via amniotic fluid and milk. AIM 2 will
determine the role of RE on the adult responding to sweet, bitter, or fat. We will expose rats to a bitter,
high-fat, or non-bitter control diet as weanling rats for two weeks and measure taste-guided responses and
two-bottle choice preference scores in adulthood. We will collect saliva and compare SP expression of animals
fed on different diets and use general linear models to look for relationships between measures of taste
sensitivity and SP expression. This project will provide a strong platform to enhance the trainee’s behavioral
skills and allow the trainee to master new molecular techniques such as Western Blots, 2-D gel
electrophoresis, and proteomic analyses."

11082898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Age is the major risk factor for most chronic human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neural
stem cells (NSCs) are particularly vulnerable to cellular aging and undergo functional decay in the mature
brain. As a result, adult neurogenesis and its contributions to memory in health and AD are compromised at
early ages. A central goal in regenerative medicine for AD is to determine the factors that rejuvenate
endogenous NSCs and augment cognition. Yet, NSCs are commonly perceived to be a poor target for anti-
aging interventions. A daunting challenge remains for NSC rejuvenation: to restore older NSC proliferation,
increase their numbers, alter NSC fate for neurogenesis and sustain these changes.
 Systems biology offers a potential solution by integrating information from multiple fields. We propose to
develop computational network and pharmacogenomics approaches to prioritize and modulate key age-related
changes for NSC rejuvenation. Our prior work utilized single cell transcriptomics to define molecular cascades
that initiate adult neurogenesis and are compromised during aging. Preliminary data now identifies a new
transition signature that distinguishes quiescent from active NSCs and is altered with age. Our new single cell
pharmacogenomics approach utilizes the transition signature to identify a compound that rejuvenates NSC
function by expanding the NSC pool, increasing neurogenesis and sustaining NSC proliferation. Animal
behavioral studies also demonstrate improved cognition in older mice. Thus, data detailed in this proposal
strongly suggests we can apply combined “omics” approaches to reprogram older NSC function and provide a
new understanding of adult neurogenesis in aging. The mechanisms mediating this NSC reprogramming
remain enigmatic. We will advance the new pharmacogenomics with systems biology techniques in network
connectivity and co-expression to prioritize mechanisms by which NSC aging is reversed (Aim 1), older NSC
function is augmented (Aim 2) and how these changes are sustained (Aim 3).
 Together, this study will reveal evidence of NSC rejuvenation and demonstrate proof-of-principle utility of
new single cell pharmacogenomics and gene networks for enhancing neurogenesis in the aged hippocampus.
These results would provide a paradigm shift in NSC capacity for regeneration, as well as mechanistic insight
into NSC vulnerability to aging, resilience to their decline, and building cognitive reserve."

The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and develop
effective new agents for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and efficient clinical and
laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and
imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the
treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and
adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core-member sites and 21
non-core member sites throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. The network institutions are selected
through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in
pediatric oncology. The PEP-CTN leverages the database infrastructure and resources of the parent
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to
ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical
trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic,
and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of
response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses.
The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into
the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary
efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific
trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies
or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify
associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole
exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including
circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies,
in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors Development of targeted
therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the prospect of more efficacious and less toxic

11083397,"Project Abstract – MAE-WEST SCORE Overall
Women age differently than men across the lifespan, culminating in a female predominance in morbid chronic
diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and
chronic kidney disease. Women also tend to develop multi-organ syndromes (heart-brain, heart-kidney) more
frequently than men. The mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in multi-organ dysfunction remain
poorly understood. Prior work indicates that women exhibit accelerated microvascular aging, a process
implicated in disorders of the heart, brain, and kidney. In this context, systemic inflammation has emerged as a
primary driver of both microvascular dysfunction and the development of these chronic disease states.
Preliminary data from our group indicates that eicosanoids, a diverse group of bioactive lipids that serve as the
upstream mediators of systemic inflammation, can influence endothelial cell function, exhibit sexual dimorphism
in circulating plasma, and are related to certain vascular phenotypes. Given these findings, we hypothesize that
sexual dimorphism in both local and systemic eicosanoid variation contributes to sex differences in microvascular
dysfunction and, in turn, to sex differences in age-related multi-organ disease. Motivated by our early findings
and the critical need to understand the determinants and drivers of sex differences in age-related disease
outcomes, we propose to create the Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids –Women’s Evaluation of Systemic
aging Tenacity (MAE-WEST) Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences.
Leveraging our collective expertise, we plan to advance the understanding of sex-specific molecular drivers of
chronic microvascular and end-organ disease through 3 foundational projects. In Project 1, we will examine
longitudinal variation in circulating eicosanoid levels in relation to age-related alterations in microvascular
function in end-organ (cardiovascular, neurocognitive, renal) disease traits in 2 large community cohorts. In
Project 2, we will prospectively enroll and deeply phenotype a cohort of women and men to assess the relation
of eicosanoids with organ-specific as well as global burden of microvascular disease, as well as their response
to a trial of intensive medical therapy with FDA-approved agents (statins and ACEi/ARB). Finally, in Project 3,
we will study the mechanistic role of sex-specific eicosanoid signaling on human endothelial cell function and on
microvascular function in experimental models of organ-specific disease as well as whole organism aging. As
an integral part of this SCORE, we will establish a Career Enhancement Center that will provide robust training
and mentorship for trainees and junior investigators. Collectively, this highly collaborative and innovative SCORE
aims to transform our understanding of sex differences in microvascular and chronic multi-organ diseases and,
in turn, enable effective interventions through inter-disciplinary science, education, and advocacy.

11087243,"Title: Barriers and facilitators of cancer care and financial burden of cancer care in Kinshasa, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
ABSTRACT
Growing cancer morbidity and mortality is a major public health problem globally, which disproportionality
affects low- and middle-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, cancer incidence has doubled in the past
30 years. Most cancer patients in SSA present at an advanced stage of disease, impacting prognosis and
survival, which may be attributed to significant barriers to access care. HIV and cancer comorbidity is
significant and people living with HIV are less likely to access cancer care. High poverty rates in SSA
countries exacerbate multiple barriers to HIV and cancer care. In most countries, cancer management is
not included in the core health services and most cancer care expenses are paid for out of pocket. To
better understand barriers to and facilitators of cancer care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
financial burden of cancer care and its impact, we leverage the Central Africa International Epidemiology
databases to Evaluate AIDS infrastructures and the ongoing collaboration between Montefiore Einstein
Comprehensive Cancer Center and the DRC’s National Cancer Program (CNLC). Using a mixed method
design, we will collect qualitative data from stakeholders and cancer patients to identify factors associated
with access to and adherence to cancer care and the economic burden of care for patients living with and
without HIV (Aim 1). We will use cognitive interviewing to adapt and validate widely used cost assessment
and quality of life tools for use in Kinshasa. We will use the adapted measures to survey 300 cancer
patients in Kinshasa to determine the financial burden of cancer care and assess its impact on completion
of cancer care cascade and quality of life (Aim 2). The results of this study can have a significant public
health impact in both the DRC and other low-income SSA countries with growing cancer incidence. CNLC
in close coordination with the DRC government is launching a major effort to scale up cancer care in the
DRC and establish new cancer centers. Our results will inform and strengthen this ongoing effort by
providing data to stakeholders to inform optimal design of care and better targeting for equity.
Title: Leveraging Existing Infrastructures and Expertise to Enhance Cancer Control in sub-Saharan
Africa
ABSTRACT
As part of the global socioeconomic transition, many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are
witnessing a shift in cancer profiles, influenced by the adoption of Westernized diets and lifestyles similar to
those seen in high-income nations. While high-income countries have robust cancer surveillance systems,
reliable cancer data is scarce in sub-Saharan Africa, hindering comprehensive understanding of the
disease burden and international comparisons. Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are crucial
tools for gathering this critical information. This supplement proposes to address this critical gap by
establishing PBCRs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Cameroon. Leveraging our
existing infrastructure in these countries through CA-IeDEA and building on our proven expertise from a
successfully implemented cancer registry in Rwanda, this project seeks to fill this critical gap. These
registries will equip governments with crucial data for informed decision-making on cancer control and
enhance international collaboration, fostering knowledge exchange and contributing to global cancer
initiatives. Additionally, this supplement supports the primary aim of the parent grant to evaluate the
adverse clinical outcomes in people living with HIV (PWH), including the increasing cancer burden.
Currently, the lack of cancer tracking significantly limits our understanding of cancer diagnoses and the
overall burden of morbidity and mortality. Developing cancer registration in these three countries will
substantially improve our ability to measure cancer diagnoses and outcomes in CA-IeDEA."
11071134,"Clinically Assessed Risk Factors for a Second ACL Injury Using an Innovative Wearable Sensor
Project Summary
Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer ACL injuries. Approximately 90% of these injured athletes will
undergo an ACL reconstruction at an estimated annual cost of $3 billion. While reconstruction and subsequent
rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to sports, they have a 15-fold increased risk of sustaining a second
ACL injury, a tear of the ACL graft or the contralateral ACL, upon returning to sports. Many patients cleared to
return to sport by their physicians demonstrate residual muscle weakness, as well as asymmetrical movement
and loading patterns. Therefore, we contend that the underlying problem with current clinical return to sport
decision making is the lack of evidence-based load asymmetry assessment methods that can be collected in a
clinical setting. Evidence about the clinical relevance of asymmetry has been collected in research-based motion
capture labs. It is not feasible to include costly and time intensive motion capture data collection in clinical settings.
Despite laboratory-based evidence that asymmetries (landing and muscle strength) increase the risk of a second
ACL injury, these measures are not able to be assessed in clinical settings to determine return to sport readiness.
Our study has the potential to significantly impact post-ACL clinical care by identifying the combination of
traditional clinical and novel clinic-based return to sport measures that identify patients at high risk for a second
ACL injury and achieve our long-term goal of decreasing the number of ACL re-tears through targeted
interventions. Specifically, we propose to evaluate load asymmetry in the clinical setting using a new load-sensing
insole to determine the predictive associations of an innovative set of clinic-based functional load symmetry
measures. We will then develop a prognostic model from a comprehensive set of traditional clinical measures
(clinical characteristics and neuromuscular performance) and the proposed novel clinical assessments
(psychological/ behavioral readiness and functional load symmetry) to predict second ACL injury. We will recruit
240 ACL reconstructed patients for model development and 120 ACL reconstructed patients for external validation
(14-25 years old) who have been released to return to sports. Clinician assessed, patient reported, and load
asymmetry measures will be collected in a clinic-like setting. All patients will complete injury surveillance for 18
months following return to sport (24 months following ACL reconstruction). The goals of this observational
study are to: 1) Assess whether functional load symmetry measures significantly improve predictive accuracy for
a second ACL injury over current standard of care clinical measures used in RTS decisions; and 2) Develop a
prognostic model from a comprehensive set of traditional clinical measures (clinical characteristics and
neuromuscular performance) and novel clinical assessments (psychological/ behavioral readiness and functional
load symmetry) to predict second ACL injury. Study findings will set the stage for future randomized multi-center
studies to determine methods for decreasing the number of second ACL injuries through targeted interventions."

While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the
human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior
remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities,
spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of
present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated
Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to
measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals,
we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively-
parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify
the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop
scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in
establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single-
cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical
challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological
systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to
encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in

 Alcohol abuse is a major health concern with a recently alarming increase in prevalence. Among the various
complications associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most
common and devastating. Mounting evidence supports a central role for inflammation and metabolic dysfunction
in ALD. The long-term goal of this work is to understand the metabolic consequences of liver inflammation on
alcohol consumption and ALD progression, and leverage this insight to develop novel treatment strategies. We
have identified and characterized multiple points of crosstalk between interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a
master regulator of innate immunity, and hepatic metabolism. Our preliminary data show that alcohol-induced
IRF3 suppresses maximal fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression and secretion by the liver. Using a
novel phospho-mimetic mutant of IRF3, we found that transcriptionally active IRF3 abolishes alcohol-induced
FGF21 secretion, while IRF3 deficiency enhances endogenous FGF21 secretion. Although IRF3 itself does not
act as a transcriptional repressor of Fgf21, its metabolic effects are mediated through its transcriptional target,
PLAGL1. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms responsible for IRF3-mediated FGF21
suppression and its impact on alcohol consumption and ALD. Our central hypothesis is that alcohol-induced
IRF3 triggers transcription of PLAGL1, which functions as a novel repressor of Fgf21 expression, ultimately
limiting its secretion. By targeting the IRF3-PLAGL1 inhibitory axis, we can release the brakes on Fgf21
transcription, increase endogenous FGF21 secretion, and enhance its beneficial effects on alcohol consumption
and liver metabolism. In this proposal we will define the impact of IRF3-mediated FGF21 suppression on alcohol
preference, motor impairment and sedation, as well as alcohol-induced steatosis and insulin resistance. Lastly,
we will determine the mechanism by which the IRF3-PLAGL1 inhibitory axis regulates FGF21 levels, and
subsequently alcohol consumption and ALD. Collectively, these studies will greatly advance our understanding
of the metabolic consequences of inflammation on ALD progression. FGF21 is currently in clinical trials for
obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction, and its beneficial role in AUD and ALD is undeniable. This work presents
a critical opportunity to enhance the secretion of endogenous FGF21 in response to metabolic stressors such
as obesity-inducing carbohydrate-rich diets and alcohol consumption."
11052033,"Perforin 2 controls unconventional cytokine release from mucosal APC
Project Summary
How professional antigen presenting cell (APC) populations focally deliver cytokines to T cells for shaping the
pro-inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory status of mucosal tissue remains incompletely understood. In particular,
cytokines that lack N-terminal peptide sequence such as the IL-1 family cytokine IL-33 can't access conventional
protein secretion pathways, which has led to the prevailing view that cell death is responsible for IL-33 release.
This project is built upon an exciting set of preliminary data demonstrating that mucosal conventional dendritic
cell (cDC) subsets, in both humans and mice, express the transmembrane pore-forming protein Perforin-2, which
at least in mice, facilitates IL-33 secretion. While in human cDC, we find Perforin-2 expression primarily in an
interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) subset indicating the cDC2 lineage, in mouse cDC, we find Perforin-2 in the
CD103+ cDC1 subset known to express the transcription factors Irf8 and Batf3. Irrespective of this lineage
distinction, both human and mouse CD11c+ cells in the respiratory mucosa contain cytoplasmic IL-33 protein.
Our data demonstrate that inhibition of Perforin-2 activity prevents IL-33 release from cDC and inhibits the
proliferative expansion of a poorly understood ST2+GATA3+Foxp3+Treg subset. Given that Perforin-2 has been
shown to also regulate Type 1 IFN signaling through controlling IFNAR responsiveness, we propose an important
regulatory mechanism exists in humans and mice that is dependent upon mucosal APC that express Perforin-2.
This project tests the central hypothesis that APC require Perforin-2 as an inducible plasma membrane
conduit for unconventional cytokine delivery at the mucosal interface. Three specific aims (SA) will be
investigated. SA1 will determine whether Perforin-2+ APC predict Treg subset abundance in sinonasal mucosa
and define the transcriptional landscape of Perforin-2+ APC. SA2 will define the Perforin-2 domains required for
IL-33 release, the diversity of Perforin-2-dependent secreted molecules, and the requisite intracellular trafficking
machinery responsible for Perforin-2 plasma membrane localization during APC-T cell interactions. SA3 will
directly test whether cDC1 and/or cDC2 subsets preferentially use Perforin-2 for driving pathogen-specific T cell
responses in mouse models of respiratory virus or helminth infection. Taken together, this MIST project stands
to uncover a new paradigm for understanding how cDC instruct immunity within the respiratory mucosa."
11048850,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Perinatal substance use in the U.S. has increased over the past two decades, with now over 8% of pregnant
people endorsing recent use of a federally illicit substance (including cannabis, opioids, and cocaine). For
newborns with prenatal substance exposure, multiple care practices during the birth hospitalization require
special consideration: 1) approaches to newborn toxicology testing, 2) monitoring and management for
newborn withdrawal symptoms, 3) counseling about human milk feedings, and 4) psychosocial support for
families. Each of these aspects of care may shape the earliest parenting experiences of families, including their
first interactions with the health system as parents. Given the issues of stigmatization and criminalization that
surround perinatal substance use, the quality of care for substance-exposed newborns varies widely, with
Black families and families living in poverty most likely to experience outcomes like child welfare services
reporting and family separation. Further research is needed to identify hospital care practices that are readily
implemented and that improve healthcare quality and equity for substance-exposed newborns. This will be an
explanatory sequential mixed methods study conducted with the Better Outcomes through Research for
Newborns (BORN) Network. Established by the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) in 2010, BORN is the
first and only national practice-based research network that focuses on birth hospitalization care for healthy
term and late preterm newborns. As a network of over 130 hospitals across 40 states and representing 10% of
all U.S. births, BORN presents an ideal opportunity to study newborn care across diverse practice settings that
span the legal and epidemiologic landscape of perinatal substance use. All study aims will be co-conducted
with EMPOWER (Empowering Mothers, Providers, and Others to Weigh in as Experts in Research), a unique
multi-state collaborative of patient stakeholders with lived experience of perinatal substance use and formal
training in research methods. For Aim 1, we will develop, pilot-test, and disseminate a cross-sectional survey to
all BORN Network hospitals (N=131) to delineate the range of care practices related to newborn toxicology
testing, rooming-in, human milk feeding, and psychosocial supports for families, and we will identify common
patterns of care. In Aim 2, we will retrospectively evaluate associations between hospital practices and patient-
level outcomes among a purposive sample of 15 BORN hospitals (N=1,500 substance-exposed newborns).
We will conduct multilevel regression, adjusting for clinical and contextual confounders, with a focus on
differences by payor status and race. In Aim 3, we will assess the barriers and facilitators to implementing high
quality and equitable care for substance-exposed newborns by conducting qualitative interviews and in-depth
policy review at 6 hospitals. We will integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings from all 3 Aims to develop
a set of recommendations for practices and written policies that can be disseminated for implementation
across U.S. birth hospitals."

Rural Americans currently face a significant health crisis marked by a heightened prevalence of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality in the United States, responsible for one-third of all deaths and
claiming a life every 34 seconds. Although this rural health crisis affects all races and ethnicities, studies suggest
that racial disparities are more pronounced than those seen in urban settings. Therefore, there is a critical need
to comprehend the key drivers behind these health inequities. Limited understanding exists regarding the multi-
level determinants of the elevated burden of poor cardiovascular health in rural areas. Neighborhood
environments, in particular, may serve as critical drivers of CVD inequities in rural areas. Previous research
highlighting the significance of neighborhood environments in driving CVD risk and racial/ethnic disparities in
CVD was conducted in predominately urban areas, leaving approximately 20% of the population understudied.
Furthermore, neighborhoods serve as more than just places of residence. They represent environments that
shape intricate interactions between individuals and historically contingent settings, influencing access to the
social determinants of health associated with CVD risk. Investigating the impact of distinct structural processes of
disinvestment in rural areas, particularly in the southern United States, and their influence on neighborhood
opportunity and vulnerability, with a focus on the racialized nature of these processes potentially leading to CVD
health inequities, is crucial. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal seeks to examine the
neighborhood-level drivers of persistently poor cardiovascular health outcomes and disparities in the
Southeastern region of the United States. It focuses on neighborhood measures of social vulnerability and
disinvestment, representing the adverse impacts of neighborhoods on natural disasters and the disproportionate
disruption of livelihoods. The proposal also addresses neighborhood racial and economic isolation, emphasizing
the critical role of residential segregation. Phase 1 of the proposal will examine the geospatial variation in
disinvestment, social vulnerability, and racial and socioeconomic isolation across 4,108 census tracts in four
states (AL, MS, LA, and KY) and differences by rurality. Phase 2 will leverage data from the Risk Underlying
Rural Areas Longitudinal Study (RURAL; U01 HL146382), which will recruit 4,600 individuals aged 25-64 from 10
rural counties in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta of the US to explore associations between these measures
and CVD risk factors and whether associations are modified by race and socioeconomic position. All in all, this
F31 fellowship will bring together a strong interdisciplinary mentorship team and a rich academic environment at
UC Berkeley School of Public Health to support the applicant in achieving the long-term career goals of
becoming an independent health equity scholar working at the intersection of research and public health practice
to investigate and address the macrosocial drivers of racial/ethnic health inequities. Successful completion of the
study aims will aid in identifying the macrosocial drivers of CVD risk in rural areas."

HIV viral load monitoring has been a key component of medical care and public health for individuals living
with HIV; however, we need better technologies for home-based or point-of-care diagnostics. The overall
objective of this supplemental funding to “The Center for Innovation in Point-of-Care Technologies for
HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases at Northwestern (C-THAN)” is to conduct market research and a
quantitative conjoint analysis for HIV viral load diagnostics in the United States. Our team will also perform
project reviews, participate as viability/steering panel members, and provide expertise to teams developing
novel point-of-care diagnostic technologies for HIV viral load. For the HIV viral load conjoint analysis, we will
create and distribute an internet-based survey whereby we present patients and healthcare providers with
hypothetical test concepts that vary by different test attributes. Hypothetical tests will vary based on specific
attributes such as limit of detection (e.g., 40, 200, 1000 copies per mL), sample collection method (e.g.
venipuncture, fingerstick, microneedle patch), and other attributes. Survey participants will rate each option
based on the likelihood of purchasing and using the test, on a scale from 0 to 100. Then, the relative
preference for each level of a particular attribute is deduced and assigned a utility value. The higher the utility
value, the more preferable the attribute level. From these utilities, the relative importance of each attribute can
be calculated: the bigger the gap between the utility assigned to the least preferred level and the most
preferred level, the more important the attribute. We propose to distribute the survey among 300 patients and
150 healthcare providers in the United States. These research findings will be analyzed, presented to
stakeholders, presented at domestic or international conferences, and eventually published in a peer-reviewed
publication. This research and supplemental support will advance efforts to create innovative diagnostics
for home-based or point-of-care HIV viral load testing."

Over 1 million older (≥65 years) adults with serious illness have major surgery or severe trauma each year.
After surgery or trauma, older seriously ill patients are at risk for increased healthcare use, functional and
cognitive decline, and mortality. National quality guidelines highlight that palliative care focused on aligning
treatments with health goals, improving quality of life, alleviating physical and psychological suffering, and
addressing social needs, should be provided alongside surgical care at all stages of serious illness. Palliative
care for hospitalized seriously ill patients is associated with reduced symptoms and less healthcare utilization
after discharge. Although seriously ill surgical patients benefit from palliative care, they are less likely than
other hospitalized patients to receive it; this is in part due to research gaps that have inhibited implementation
of practical palliative care interventions for older seriously ill surgical patients. Gaps include a dearth of data on
patient-oriented surgical outcomes such as pain, depression, and caregiving that can be targeted by palliative
care, methodological barriers to measuring palliative care delivery in surgical practice, and little understanding
of contextual factors that influence implementation of palliative care in surgery. The proposed study will
address these gaps by providing an innovative and layered examination of the role of palliative care in surgery.
The study has three specific aims. Aim 1 identifies a cohort of seriously ill older surgical patients (≥66y) using
Health and Retirement Study data linked to Medicare claims, and determines the association between direct
targets of palliative care (pain, depression, and caregiving needs) and less proximal benefits (reduced
healthcare utilization) to demonstrate the important role of palliative care in surgery. Aim 2 identifies a
retrospective cohort of older seriously ill surgical patients (≥66y) in a large regional health system and uses
Natural Language Processing in electronic health data linked to Medicare Claims to identify palliative care
processes (goals of care discussions, healthcare proxy documentation, pain and caregiver assessments)
delivered during the surgical episode. The association between palliative care and healthcare utilization in the
year after surgical discharge will be tested. Aim 3 uses qualitative interviews and direct observations to obtain
an in-depth understanding of contextual factors influencing implementation of palliative care processes in the
care of seriously ill older surgical patients (≥65 years). This proposal uses complementary data sources to
assess patient-centered outcomes in older seriously ill surgical patients, uses novel methods to evaluate the
impact of palliative care processes on outcomes, and deeply examines barriers to implementation of
perioperative palliative care in clinical practice. These results will directly inform bedside clinical decisions and
the implementation of targeted palliative care interventions to improve care for seriously ill older surgical
patients."

Aging is associated with persistent levels of inflammation, which is also a hallmark of HIV infection. The effects
of aging are particularly important to the population of people living with HIV (PLWH), as the overall cohort of
infected individuals is getting older, with over 4 million over the age of 50. The reported effects of aging seen in
HIV patients are increased co-morbidities, frailty, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, increased immune
inflammation, and increased senescence, which led researchers to believe that HIV infection leads to a form of
early aging. Though, the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) allowed the disease to be medically
manageable, however, strict lifelong adherence to daily drug regimens is required. Though daily combinatorial
ART intake keeps HIV-1 at bay in tissue reservoirs, replication-competent integrated proviral DNA can persist
for decades as HIV-1 infected cells have an average half-life close to 44 months and could be responsible for
accelerated aging. Also, despite all cART’s achievements, it’s poor penetrance across the blood-brain barrier
leads to continuous low-level viral replication in the central nervous system (CNS) could be the cause of
premature aging in PLWH. Thus, deciphering how much ART-mediated viral suppression affects aging and the
brain immune homeostasis will provide clue to understand the mechanism involved in accelerated aging in
PLWH and ultimately its therapeutic targeting. Defining the consequence of latent HIV-1 burden in the human
brain during progressive aging is limited by sample access. We plan to answer this above question by deploying
a small animal model of HIV-1 disease (NSG-humanized mice). Recently we employed NSG-humanized mice
and demonstrated recovery of latent viruses from whole brain cells. Based on these findings and new preliminary
data, we now propose to study progressive aging associated changes during HIV-infection in a long-term
immune reconstituted humanized mouse model. How much HIV-1 latency and cART contribute to premature
aging (we termed as LAAGING) and functional neuro-immune interaction at molecular and behavioral level will
be answered. By employing the proposed animal model under highly suppressive cART treatment, the brain
cells carrying the latent HIV-1 will be evaluated and characterized by transcriptomics and metabolic profiling.
This will be followed by measurement of axonal fiber integrity using diffusion tensor imaging and behavior
analysis to look for brain functional deficits during progressive aging. The outcome of the project will provide
valuable information for the identification of new biomarkers of aging, assessment and monitoring of combination
therapies for elimination of virus and its associated neuroinflammation in the CNS. Data from these ART-
suppressed humanized mice brain studies will also provide the first-hand evidence of the existence of neuro-
immune crosstalk both within and outside of CNS during progressive aging and molecular pathways being
affected during HIV-latency and will help in future therapeutic targeting of CNS reservoirs in infected patients."

Chronic liver diseases are a collection of disorders that result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
The overwhelming burden of these diseases results in the liver being the second most transplanted organ. As
a result of a dramatic rise in the incidence of obesity and alcohol consumption, the rate of liver transplantation
continues to climb world-wide. Despite the significant impact of chronic liver disease on society, there are no
effective therapies to ameliorate disease outside of lifestyle modification and liver transplantation. Thus, a
more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms that drive the progression of chronic liver disease is required
to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our previous publication demonstrated a significant
accumulation of T lymphocytes in the liver of individuals with Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced
cirrhosis. However, the precise role of T cells in the progression of NASH has yet to be firmly established. The
preliminary studies presented in this application have identified a yet to be appreciated role for T cell activation
and clonal expansion during NASH. In this application we demonstrate that T cell clonal expansion is a
common event in both humans with NASH-induced cirrhosis and mice with NASH. These are the first studies
to identify T cell clonal expansions in the liver of humans and/or mice with NASH and link T cell activation and
function with NASH pathology. However, the exact antigenic cause of T cell activation or if these T cells are
inducing or suppressing disease progression is unknown. The studies in this application aim to answer these
two fundamental questions by defining (1) the timing of T cell clonal expansion in the liver during the
progression of NASH, (2) the antigens recognized by clonally expanded T cells, (3) the antigen presenting cell
(APC) that drives T cell clonal expansion, and (4) if eliminating T cell clonal expansion through depletion of
clonally expanded T cells or the APCs presenting antigens to these T cells results in prevention and/or
resolution of disease. Completion of these studies will provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of the
pathogenesis of NASH and will generate the tools necessary to define the role of T cells in the progression of
other chronic liver diseases."

Telomere length is considered a good biomarker of organismal and cellular aging. Telomeres get progressively
shorter with each cell division and rates of cellular turnover vary from cell type to cell type and tissue to tissue.
When telomeres become critically short, cells arrest their proliferation and go into senescence resulting in
tissue dysfunction. Telomere length and the rate of telomere shortening shows a great deal of interindividual
variability and is dependent on many factors including genetics, age, environment, and lifestyle. Several age-
related diseases have been associated with telomere shortening including pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, liver
fibrosis, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, myocardial
hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, chronic kidney disease, kidney fibrosis,
osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. The effect of genetics on telomere length has been estimated to be 35-85%
and at least 17 genes have been reported to regulate telomere length and cause telomere biology disorders
(TBD) when disrupted (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TINF2, WRAP53, CTC1, RTEL1, PARN, ACD,
POT1, NAF1, STN1, ZCCHC8, RPA1, and DCLRE1B). These genes do not explain all cases of TBD and more
telomere length regulators have yet to be characterized. Our proposal is in response to NOT-AG-23-020, which
is meant “to encourage the use of existing cohorts and datasets for well-focused secondary analyses” to
address critical questions in aging research. We have designed our proposal to harness the unique large data
resources at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and
BioVU, and the large public data resources (GTEx consortium, All of Us, and the UK Biobank). We will
reanalyze these datasets, combining multi-omics modeling and phenome-scale interrogation, to identify new
genes and variants responsible for telomere shortening, telomere disease risk, premature aging, and their
phenome-wide consequences. By re-analyzing large data sets already at our disposal, we will be able to
identify novel genes and variants responsible for the telomere shortening and provide a more complete picture
of the role of aberrant telomere length and dysfunctional telomere maintenance in pathophysiological
processes. A better understanding of the genetic and biological drivers of telomere shortening may provide
insights into disease risk, earlier diagnosis, and new kinds of therapies. Our Aims are to: 1) Determine the
genetic basis of telomere shortening in diverse tissues, 2) Determine the phenome-wide consequences of
telomere length using large-scale biobanks, 3) Identify disease causing variants (DVs) in novel genes
associated with Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD)"
11081475,"Neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, and Lewy body dementia, are caused by abnormalities in proteostasis and
accumulation of misfolded prion-like proteins in the brain. Mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat
kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene result in diverse neuropathology, including tauopathy, synucleinopathy,
TDP-43 proteinopathy, and AD pathology. Patients with LRRK2 mutations frequently develop
clinical dementia, and nearly half of patients with LRRK2-driven neurodegeneration develop tau
or other pathology instead of synucleinopathy. LRRK2 is therefore a key regulator controlling
protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, and defining the mechanisms by which LRRK2
mutations drive such varied prion-like pathology may lead to novel targeted therapeutics. The
proposed study aims to characterize the proteostatic mechanisms upstream and downstream of
LRRK2 using patient-derived neurons and rare postmortem LRRK2 patient brain tissue. The
study has three goals. First, to define the role of LRRK2’s subcellular localization in its cellular
functions and degradation, with a particular focus on LRRK2 microtubule association and
endolysosomal activation. Second, to test the extent to which newly identified LRRK2 protein
degradation pathways rescue neurotoxicity in patient-derived aged neurons and other disease
relevant systems. Third, to define the mechanisms by which LRRK2 mutations can drive both
synucleinopathy and tauopathy using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), detailed
neuropathology, and cell-type specific transcriptomics on a rare cohort of LRRK2 patient brain
tissues. Overall, these studies should begin to define the mechanisms by which LRRK2 drives
myriad neuropathology and provide insight into the relevance of LRRK2 as a therapeutic target
for tauopathies."

biofluid markers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases in Colombia,
integrating them into routine clinical practice and research studies. Our focus is on

to support the biofluid markers core in Colombia and the broader Latin American region,
because Antioquia and rest of Colombia are in a privileged situation by unique and/or bigger

installation until the next may 13th-14th, and we will have the training on may 21-24 2024 for
standardizing and validating the reproducibility of biofluid markers in the study population.
Therefore, we will need a year more with administrative supplements to successfully
complete the research project activities and to obtain the full productivity at the end of the

application. Because there is a need to realize the analyze of serum by SIMOA, to complete
and to increase the ns by lipidome using MS; further stratify clinical histories, compare, and
validate the sensitivity and robustness of biomarker detection, and establish cut-offs in our
local site. This is crucial for collaboration and the development of new clinical research
aimed at the prognostic and primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease and other
neurodegenerations.
Our current focus involves utilizing blood tests to streamline the identification of Alzheimer's
and other neurodegenerative diseases' fluid biomarkers in a faster and more cost-effective
manner in Colombia and in the LATAM region. Under our ongoing initiative,
1R21AG079574-01, we are conducting installation, standardization, comparison of
preliminary analyses with high-sensitivity detection of biofluid markers using SIMOA-
Quanterix with lipidome profile. However, we need to continue for complete our analysis
categorized by genotype (PS1 variants and APOE isoforms), sex, and age range (8-12, 13-
19, 20-30, 30-40, and older 41yo symptomatic and asymptomatic). This approach will
validate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of our measurements, establishing a
transversal paired correlation with a lipidome profile as the basis for understanding the
etiopathogenesis and looking for the specific targeting for primary prevention.
We need to achieve robustness of our results; because the preliminary ones suggest the
novelty finding that lipidome signature is earlier and sensible to discriminate between
carriers and non-carriers’ population both in men and women at eight years old, respect to
protein biofluid markers showed over 20 yo.
Importantly, higher baseline P-tau217 levels predicted subsequent elevations in in vivo
amyloid and tau pathology, as well as memory decline over time in carriers. These findings
strengthen the case for plasma P-tau217 as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and
prognostic biomarker for AD, with implications for clinical practice and trials. That
complementary to the future prodromal lipid signature will guide earlier and more sensible
biofluid marker detection for pronostic, diagnostic, health care, primary prevention and
treatments.
 The Colombian team, led by Drs. Lopera (Coinvestigator) and Cardona (PI), will establish
SIMOA technology, creating the necessary infrastructure for a reference center capable of
detecting and quantifying blood biomarkers, considering the privilege and enrichment
genetic cases of neurodegenerative diseases in the LATAM region. This collaborative effort
with Dr. Estela Area-Gomez (coinvestigator) from Columbia University (also from the CIB-
CSIC,Spain) and Dr Yakeel Quiroz as significant collaborator in the MGH, we will explore
new biomarkers suggested by lipidome analysis, building expertise in advanced methods at

Identification of genes responsible for genetic disease, analysis of their pathogenic mechanisms, and
development of compensatory interventions constitute major goals of human genetics research. Identification of
modifier genes and gene interaction can identify additional targets for intervention beyond the causal gene.
Genetic or pharmacological targeting of modifiers may provide more effective avenues for treatment. We have
focused on disorders with impaired function of ion channels and transporters that are localized in the membrane
of the lysosome. Regulation of lysosomal ion transport is important to maintenance of acidic pH and osmolarity
of the lysosome, as well as cytoplasmic ion concentration. During the current period, we evaluated modifiers of
the phosphatase FIG4 that functions in biosynthesis of the signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2. Through genome-wide
screens we identified the lysosomal co-transporter SLC12A9 as a modifier of FIG4 and the cause of a novel
lysosomal disorder with neurological and skeletal defects. The PI(3,5)P2 regulated ion transporters are
'druggable targets' for development of therapy for PI(3,5)P2 deficiency disorders. We found that CLCN7 and
PIP4K2C can compensate for FIG4 deficiency, based on their molecular functions. During the requested
termination year, we will further define the pathogenic mechanisms of SLC12A9 transporter defects and
interventions for the human disorder, and evaluate overexpression of PIKFYVE in Fig4 null mice using Crispr-a
as potential genetic therapy for PI(3,5)P2 deficiency disorders. We will functionally characterize a recurrent FIG4
mutation in two patients with ALS. We will also distribute the mutant mouse lines that have been generated and
publish the final papers from this long-running project. Together these aims extend our continuing studies of
lysosome function and neurological disease."
11087350,"The inability to maintain abstinence is a trademark of addiction yet effective maintenance therapies 
remain elusive. Women may face unique issues with substance abuse treatment, as research indicates 
that psychological and biological responses to drugs of abuse differ in women compared to men. Women 
tend to show greater drug dependence, progress more quickly from casual drug use to dependence, have 
greater difficulty quitting, and have shorter periods of abstinence than men. These effects have been 
similarly observed in female animal models. Thus, understanding circuit and molecular signatures that 
drive increased drug-seeking among females is critical to the development of effective SUDs therapies. 
We have developed a novel behavioral model termed the seeking-persistence paradigm (SPP) that was 
adapted from standard drug abstinence paradigms. The seeking-persistence paradigm is used to 
investigate the influence of intervention during initial abstinence on long-term drug-seeking behaviors. 
Indeed, cocaine-seeking during initial abstinence strongly correlates with seeking after drug-abstinence. 
These results reflect clinical studies indicating that craving during initial abstinence predicts relapse rates. 
We have previously identified that the dorsal hippocampus is a crucial target for sex-specific modulation of 
cocaine-seeking on ED1. Prior reports show projections from the dorsal hippocampus selectively 
modulate memory strengthening or facilitate extinction, dependent on whether they terminate in the 
prelimbic cortex, or infralimbic cortex, respectively. Our preliminary data suggest that sexually-divergent 
projections of the dHPC to prelimbic and infralimbic cortical areas may underlie sex differences in 
persistent cocaine seeking during extinction. Herein, we will test the hypothesis that 
hippocampal-prelimbic cortex neurocircuitry drives the behavioral expression of cocaine memory 
strengthening in female rats (Aim 1), and hippocampal infralimbic cortex neurocircuitry drives the 
behavioral expression of cocaine memory extinction in male rats (Aim 2). In each aim, we will combine 
chemogenetic (DREADDs), and functional genomic methods (viral tracing, RNA-sequencing, and 
single-cell RNA-sequencing), to ultimately provide key information on the impact of context-induced 
cocaine seeking behavior on relapse risk through the novel analysis of the contribution of memory 
systems (dHPC ->PL, dHPC-> IL) and sex differences therein."

collaboration between the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the
University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) will capitalize on the strengths of each
institution in developing and maintaining inclusive programs to encourage diversity in the
biomedical research workforce and developing NIH-funded faculty from junior investigators,
respectively. The role of the Administrative Core is to ensure the program activities are effective
and well-integrated across both institutions through collaboration with the Faculty Development
and Evaluation Cores, oversee sound fiscal management through a team-based plan that will
ensure strategic deployment of resources, recruit a diverse cohort of new faculty by capitalizing
on a series of novel activities that will transform search and recruitment practices at both
institutions, and implement new institutional policies and procedures that codify the importance
of a diverse faculty and provide an embracing infrastructure that leads to sustainable
institutional change.
The Administrative Core will span both institutions and will be directed by the PIs and Co-Core
Leaders, Drs. Kaper and LaCourse, and Co-Directors, Dr. Prasad and Ms. Johnson. Additional
oversight and guidance will be provided by the Program Steering Committee and the Fiscal
Oversight Committee, as well as the Internal and External Advisory Boards."
11067722,"Project Summary: Genome-wide association studies demonstrate that the top genes associated with
increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, inferring
lipid dysregulation is pathological. In particular, APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk for late-onset AD.
Individuals of European ancestry carrying two copies of the APOE4 allele have a sixteen-fold increase in AD risk
compared to a similar individual carrying two copies of the APOE3 allele. APOE is the primary cholesterol and
lipid transporter in the brain. Studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) show that APOE4 alters
cholesterol and lipid homeostasis across multiple cell types; however, its effects are especially pronounced in
oligodendrocytes—myelinating cells that insulate and protect neurons. Histological and lipidomic profiling of
human post-mortem brains and animal models shows impaired cholesterol transport and vast lipid deposits in
APOE4-expressing oligodendrocytes. This aberrant accumulation of lipids impairs myelination, impedes amyloid
plaque clearance, and increases neuroinflammation. Despite the central role of APOE4 and lipid metabolism
in AD, no therapeutics target APOE4 or aberrant lipid accumulation. MCM6 Therapeutics’ Chief Science
Advisor, Dr. Joel Blanchard, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.
Sinai, has developed a drug discovery pipeline that models APOE4 lipid accumulation in human
oligodendrocytes. In a small proof-of-concept screen, we discovered two mechanistically distinct drugs,
rosiglitazone and cyclodextrin, both reduce lipid deposits in APOE4 oligodendrocytes. This reduction in
intracellular lipid accumulation restored myelination in an in vitro neuron co-culture assay and improved learning
and memory in APOE4 transgenic mice. We will further optimize and apply this high-content screening
pipeline to identify therapeutics that reduce aberrant cholesterol and lipid accumulation in human
APOE4 oligodendrocytes. Aim 1, we will adapt our screening assay to 384-well plates, and perform a targeted
screen of ~2,500 lipid modifying compounds. Our high-content image analysis platform will be conducted in
collaboration with PhenoVista. We expect the focused screening approach in Aim 1 will generate early leads and
targets that we will validate and expand on with structure-activity-relationship studies. Aim 2 we will perform a
large unbiased screen of 30,000 compounds. Hits from Aims 1 and 2 will be validated via dose titration, and
identity will be confirmed by re-ordering and MS analysis. We will perform off-target analysis, functional validation
(in vitro myelination), and neurotoxicity assays in iPSC-derived human brain tissue. Through rigorous in vitro
validation of efficacy, selectivity, and neurotoxicity, we will select 3-10 lead compounds for future evaluation in
our established APOE4 humanized mouse models through extensive histological and behavioral assays,
delivering first-in-class lead compounds that restore APOE4 brain lipid homeostasis, opening new therapeutic
opportunities in AD."

The promise of genomic medicine to transform healthcare and improve health will not be fully realized
until discoveries become relevant to and available for use by diverse populations and their clinicians.
As part of the IGNITE II network, we are implementing two prospective randomized pragmatic
genotype-guided clinical trials (GUARDD-US and ADOPT-PGx) to determine the impact of
implementing genetic testing on hypertension, depression, and pain therapies. This administrative
supplement request is to extend the implementation timeline for these two pragmatic clinical trials by
an additional 12 months with cost to allow for completion of GUARDD-US and ADOPT PGx data

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human cancers. Standard GBM treatments, such as radiation
(RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), exhibit poor efficacy with a lack of a durable response. These agents promote
oxidative stress in cancer cells, which is a known metabolic liability of GBM. However, the efficacy of these
treatments is limited by neurotoxicity and upregulation of tumor escape pathways that detoxify reactive oxygen
species. There is an urgent need for new pharmacological agents that effectively target the redox stress
pathway in GBM cells while sparing adjacent normal tissue. My long-term goal is to become an independent
physician-scientist neuro-oncologist focused on improving GBM therapy. In this proposal, I use my discovery
of a cysteine susceptibility pathway in glioma, whereby cysteine-promoting compounds induce glucose
dependence, mitochondrial toxicity, and H2O2 production, to define the mechanism and functional relevance
of this pathway in pre-clinical models. I will test the central hypothesis that high levels of intracellular cysteine
induce glucose dependence in glioma, and the combination of cysteine compounds with ROS-promoting
treatments is an effective strategy to improve survival in mouse models of GBM. I will identify the metabolic
flux pathways altered by cysteine in glioma (Aim 1a) and determine the role of mitochondrial electron transport
chain flux (Aim 1b) and hypoxia and glycolytic flux (Aim 1c) in contributing to cysteine-mediated glucose
dependence. Using mouse models of GBM, I will test the efficacy of cysteine compounds in combination with
ROS-promoting interventions (RT, TMZ, and the glucose-lowering ketogenic diet) on GBM metabolism, growth,
and survival, using 18F-fluoropropyl-homocysteine positron emission tomography as a biomarker for cysteine
metabolism (Aim 2a). I will determine the effects of H2O2 modulation on cytotoxicity of cysteine compounds
and ROS-promoting interventions (Aim 2b) in vivo. These aims will create a new paradigm that uses two
synergistic metabolic therapies that can be rapidly translated into early-phase clinical trials in GBM. I am an
Assistant Professor in Neurology within the Division of Neuro-Oncology at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), and
I have outlined a 5-year plan that expands on my background studying GBM metabolism. I have an outstanding
mentor, Dr. Lewis Cantley, who is an expert in tumor metabolism and has enabled translation of his work and
mentees’ work to clinical development. My career advisory committee includes Drs. Lewis Cantley (primary
mentor), Navdeep Chandel, Pedro Lowenstein, Naga Vara Kishore Pillarsetty, Howard Fine, and Matthew
Fink. They are internationally recognized experts in science and medicine and will provide mentorship and
support to attain scientific independence. I will also have unparalleled institutional support from WCM, which
is at the forefront of precision medicine in cancer and is heavily invested in career development for junior
physician-scientists. This research and training environment will enable me to achieve my goals of securing
NIH R01 funding in the future.

11081972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need to better understand the epidemiology of HIV acquisition in the United States (US),
particularly among cisgender gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), one of the key
populations essential to target for End the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiatives. In direct response to RFA-AI-21-018,
this study will use innovative technology to recruit and retain a large cohort of high-risk, HIV-negative young
men who have sex with men (YMSM) focusing on racial/ethnic minority YMSM and high HIV prevalence
geographic areas (known as “hot spots”). Furthermore, we will leverage this cohort to conduct a large-scale
clinical trial while maintaining the standard of care control arm as a longitudinal observational cohort for
epidemiologic analyses. Our study team is uniquely positioned and has all the relevant expertise to conduct
this study having successfully recruited and retained more than 12,000 YMSM in a full range of research
studies across the HIV continuum (e.g., epidemiology, intervention development, mHealth, PrEP, clinical trials,
innovative geospatial methods). We have had specific success conducting prevention research with YMSM
(17-25 years), including racially and ethnically diverse YMSM, our target demographic group. Further, we have
previously leveraged advanced social media advertising techniques and used innovative geospatial analytics
to target/study “communities within communities”, reaching hard-to-reach YMSM from diverse geographic
areas (e.g., rural zip codes, U.S. tribal lands, etc.) and young ages (e.g., YMSM 13-18 years of age). We will
harness innovative technology to recruit, during 36-months of enrollment, and then retain a large cohort (N =
5,000) of 17-25 year old YMSM, the majority being Black and Latino, who are at high-risk of HIV transmission
(e.g., history of condomless anal sex) and follow them every 6 months thereafter. We will conduct an entirely
virtual, digital clinical trial (Specific Aim #1) testing whether MyPEEPS Mobile (an evidence-based mHealth HIV
prevention intervention) reduces HIV incidence among HIV-negative YMSM (17-25 years old) looking at the
influence of theory-driven social, ecological, and geospatial factors on intervention uptake and efficacy
inclusive of measures that align with traditional models of behavior change such as the Information Motivation
Behavior Model. A social-ecological theoretical framework will also guide the analysis of the longitudinal
observational cohort study (Specific Aim #2) of the 2,500 control arm participants to assess individual, network,
geospatial, and public policy correlates of HIV risk and health seeking behaviors (e.g., PrEP uptake) comparing
individuals who become HIV-positive to those who do not. Intervention Implications. The findings from this
research will have important real-world implications for research and practice. For example, understanding how
individual, network, geospatial, and public policy factors correlate with HIV incidence and moderate
intervention effects will help inform how and where interventions should be delivered."

Women with racial and ethnic minority identities, specifically Hispanic and Black women exhibit suboptimal
physical activity-related behaviors and are disproportionately burdened by obesity and physical-activity related
chronic diseases. Mothers often report too many responsibilities and prioritizing their children’s needs and
extracurricular activities as barriers to engaging in more physical activity. The proposed study builds on our
team’s previous work adapting an evidence-based theory guided physical activity intervention and pilot testing
it in a community setting mothers regularly spend time for their children’s extracurricular activities,
circumventing this barrier. This innovative intervention, named Moms on the Move, is the first of its kind and
additionally circumvents access, transportation, and childcare barriers, which are also commonly cited,
especially by low-income and racial and ethnic minority mothers. Given results from our pilot study
demonstrating feasibility and acceptability, we aim to conduct a fully powered cluster randomized trial with a
waitlist control of the Moms on the Move intervention. We will partner with eight youth football and
cheerleading organiza�ons that predominantly serve low-income Hispanic and Black families to carry out the
study. Our primary aim is to test the efficacy of the intervention for increasing moderate to vigorous physical
activity. We will also test the efficacy of the intervention for physical activity maintenance and examine
mediators and moderators of efficacy as exploratory aims. If found to be effective in increasing physical activity,
the intervention has the potential for widespread dissemination. This study, along with the diversity statement
and Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) demonstrate the PI’s commitment to Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA)."
11052058,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malignant brain tumors are aggressive cancers that have high proliferative rates with much higher
energy requirements and high mortality rates. Despite intense clinical and drug development
efforts in the last two decades, there has been no improvement in survival. To support the
abnormal growth commonly seen in tumors, the cancer cells have altered their metabolism
compared to normal cells in healthy tissues. Most of the knowledge to date on cancer metabolism
is derived from cultured cell lines. Probing metabolism in intact tumors will be critical to understand
how the tumor cells grow in a patient under the complex biological tumor environment. From our
pilot study involving a small number of patients, we have demonstrated that gliomas and brain
metastases have the capacity to oxidize acetate in the citric acid cycle to meet their bioenergetic
requirements, and glucose and acetate together contribute up to 63.0% of the total acetyl-CoA
pool in these tumors. The remaining acetyl-CoA that provides carbon sources for biomolecular
synthesis, must be derived from other nutrients. The following are the goals of this proposal: (1)
determine if acetate and ketone body (beta hydroxybutyrate, BHB) utilization is a common
property of all gliomas or specifically linked to high grade GBMs (2) examine whether acetate and
BHB provide carbons for 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) synthesis in IDH mutated glioma patients (3)
preclinical testing of the effects of small molecule inhibitors of acetate and BHB, in freshly resected
tumor tissue slices. We have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved clinical protocol to infuse
non-toxic and non-radioactive 13C-enriched acetate in patients who will be undergoing surgical
removal of a brain tumor. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry of these surgically resected tumor tissues, we will investigate the above described
aims on energy metabolism of primary brain tumors. The attractiveness of this technology is that
no radioactivity is involved. We anticipate that the outcome of this study will generate a detailed
understanding of in vivo utilization of acetate and ketone body in brain tumor patients. This
knowledge will lead to identification of key metabolic targets that may be further exploited for the
development of new therapies. Additionally, it may identify novel biomarkers which may be helpful
in designing non-invasive in vivo MRI methods to track acetate utilization by tumors for diagnostic
purposes."

A diverse faculty body enhances scientific discovery. Despite efforts to increase diversity, women, persons with
disabilities, and individuals from certain racial /ethnic groups remain underrepresented in the biomedical workforce.
Diversifying biomedicalresearch faculty is an ongoing challenge and a high-priority need. There are also barriers
to retention of underrepresented faculty and success which can include a lack of clarity around promotion criteria,
effective mentorship and formalfaculty development programs as well as perceptions of unwelcoming institutional
cultures and a lack of inclusivity. Thus, multiple evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance faculty
diversity, success and inclusion. Cluster hiring at academic institutions is an effective strategy for enhancing
faculty diversity. This strategy coupled with formal structured faculty mentorship, research and career
development programs improvefaculty competencies, enable success and can impact organizational culture.
Transforming institutional culture requires organized programs led by experienced faculty, administrators, staff,
and institutional leaders, with a shared vision of enhancing faculty diversity and inclusion. Such programs also
require institutional support and resources to ensure sustainability. The overall goal of the University of California,
San Diego (UCSD) Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Administrative Core
is to provide strategic leadership, management, and administrative oversight to support the UCSD FIRST Cohort
Program’s evidence-based strategies to recruit twelve new faculty, enhance FIRST participants’ academic
advancement, research success, and inclusive institutional excellence. We hypothesize that cluster hires within
four areas of institutionalresearch strength, neurosciences, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease
and immunology, will provide affinity groups as the nidus of inclusive excellence. Immersion in structured
programs organized by theFaculty Development Core will provide direction in academic promotion resulting in
enhanced retention and academic success. We propose four specific aims: Aim 1. Provide management and
coordination to support theadministrative, communication, and fiscal components of the FIRST Cohort Program,
Aim 2. Establish and implement protocols for search, recruitment, and hiring of FIRST Cohort, Aim 3. Promote
FIRST cohort faculty impactful research productivity to meet retention expectations and Aim 4. Implement
strategic plan to foster institutional inclusive excellence and culture transformation. Working with the Evaluation
Core, the AdministrativeCore will leverage existing data on faculty perceptions of the research environment and
faculty development to establish metrics for the “baseline” and successful cultural transformation. These aims
will promote UCSD culture change towards inclusive excellence by using evidence-based strategies to enhance
underrepresented faculty academic advancement, research and career development, integration and
implementation of system-wide structured faculty development programs to enhance inclusivity."
11072955,"Background: Mental health providers (MHPs), who are ""mission critical"" for the VHA, report the second
highest level of burnout after primary care physicians. MHP burnout may be associated with negative system-
level factors (organizational climate, workgroup perceptions, and supervisory behaviors), provider experiences
(engagement, satisfaction, and turnover) and patient outcomes (access to, continuity of, experience of care).
VHA has yet to conduct a systematic facility-level study identifying predictors and consequences of MHP
burnout. This study will address HSR&D priorities focused on health care systems change, the impact of
organizational and provider factors associated with quality of care for Veterans, and improving employee
engagement. Objectives: This pre-implementation study aims to characterize variation in MHP burnout by
facility over time, identifying workplace characteristics and practices of high performing facilities that can be
translated for potential implementation at facilities with room for improvement. Aim 1: to examine facility-
level predictors and consequences of VHA MHP burnout; Aim 2: to understand VHA MHP leadership and
front-line provider perspectives regarding factors that protect against or exacerbate burnout in facilities with
differing levels of burnout; and Aim 3: to identify context-sensitive strategies for facilities to successfully
reduce VHA MHP burnout. Methods: Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods study, a two-phase
design with quantitative data collection and analysis followed by qualitative data collection and analysis, and
subsequent integration, we will evaluate factors that influence MHP burnout and their effects on patient
outcomes. We will compile annual survey data on workplace conditions and annual staffing and productivity
data between FY2014 and FY2018 to assess same and subsequent year provider and patient outcomes
reflecting provider and patient experiences. The All Employee Survey (AES) is an annual organizational census
of workplace perceptions and satisfaction. The Mental Health Provider Survey (MHPS) is an annual survey to
assess MHP perceptions about access to and quality of mental health care, and job satisfaction. The Mental
Health Outpatient Clinical method tracks MHP inpatient and outpatient clinical hours and productivity. We
will examine MHP job satisfaction and patient experience metrics using the Strategic Analytics for
Improvement and Learning (SAIL) Mental Health domain, the VHA's quality monitoring system. Facility
complexity level is measured using a five level indicator based on patient risk, number of specialists, volume,
and level of teaching and research, including mental health program characteristics. By linking these data
sources, we will quantify predictors of burnout and the impact of burnout on patient outcomes. We will
conduct interviews with mental health facility leadership and front-line MHPs, intentionally sampled using
facility-level MHP burnout. We will create a joint display to interpret quantitative and qualitative findings on
predictors and patient outcomes associated with burnout in light of facility context and any strategies used to
address burnout. We will present our findings to an expert panel of operational partners, VA clinicians,
administrators, policy leaders, and experts. The panel will select context-sensitive best practices to share with
facilities to address MHP burnout and recommend potential interventions. Finally, we will reengage facilities
that participated in Aim 2 and conduct focus groups and share results presented in feedback reports. We will
broadly disseminate findings, which will support the development of actionable policies and approaches to
addressing MHP burnout. Anticipated impacts on Veterans' health and next steps: This study will
assist in future developing and testing interventions with VHA partners to improve MHP burnout and
employee engagement. Decreased MHP burnout could improve quality of care, wait times, and lost revenues
due to staff attrition. Our findings could be of clinical and financial value to VHA, its providers, and patients.
Our work will contribute to broad VHA care improvements, and will generate new insights for care delivery."
11082780,"Project Summary
A priority in infectious disease research is to identify the genes that increase an individual’s resistance
to a given infection. Variation in resistance clearly has a strong genetic basis, making it seemingly an
ideal trait for identifying causal loci. Yet, genomic surveys have identified relatively few genes that
consistently explain variation in disease outcomes in humans. A primary explanation for this gap is
context-dependence: a gene may underlie parasite resistance at low but not high doses, or against one
parasite strain but not others. This hypothesis argues that we cannot reliably detect the genes that
matter for resistance without accounting for the genetic and environmental context in which hosts
encounter their parasites. Ongoing projects associated with my parent award are addressing this need
by characterizing genetic variation for parasite resistance across contexts using diverse host and
parasite genotypes sampled from nature. Our powerful model system - the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans and its natural microsporidian parasites in the genus Nematocida – allows us to conduct highly
controlled and replicated experiments across multiple contexts. We apply high-throughput
phenotyping, experimental evolution, and experimental epidemiology to 1) characterize genetic
variation in parasite resistance in natural populations, 2) evaluate the impact of parasite genotype on
the expression of this genetic variation, and 3) examine the sensitivity of resistance genes to relevant
environmental variables. Our efforts identified dose – the number of parasites a host encounters - as a
major driver of the expression of genetic variation for resistance. We have designed key follow-up
experiments to characterize the dose-dependency of resistance across host genotypes, and these
experiments require precise estimates of parasite abundance within hosts and in their surrounding
environment. Accordingly, I am requesting a supplement to this parent award to purchase a QIAcuity
instrument for digital PCR to increase our precision, replication, and range of sample types for these
experiments. This equipment will directly augment the impact of our projects on the scientific
community and provide long-term support to my research program and department."

11081576,"We recently identified the contribution of hypothalamic MC4R in regulating blood glucose levels by influencing glycosuria through epinephrine and renal GLUT2. Moreover, we have demonstrated previously that diabetes decreases the hypothalamic Mc4r expression that consequently leads to defective counterregulatory response (CRR) to glucose deficits in mice. The molecular and integrative mechanisms underlying these clinically significant observations remain unknown. Specifically, how does hypothalamic MC4R regulates plasma epinephrine levels? Does a neural crosstalk between the hypothalamic MC4R and kidney GLUT2 coordinate the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis via epinephrine? In our Preliminary Studies, we observed that MC4R restoration selectively in the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons normalized plasma epinephrine levels in otherwise MC4R-deficient mice, indicating the role of MC4R- expressing CRH neurons in regulating plasma epinephrine levels. Unexpectedly, kidney-specific Glut2 knockout mice are protected from diabetes-mediated defective CRR to hypoglycemia and the mice show increased Mc4r and Crh mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, suggesting the influence of renal GLUT2 on the hypothalamic melanocortin system. Our Preliminary Data also indicate the contribution of renal, but not liver, gluconeogenesis toward restoration of normal blood glucose levels following hypoglycemia in the kidney-specific Glut2 knockout mice. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that hypothalamic MC4R-expressing CRH neurons are activated by the afferent renal nerves in response to glucose deficits to enhance plasma epinephrine, which in turn increases renal gluconeogenesis and restores blood glucose levels. Moreover, elevated kidney GLUT2 levels in diabetes compromises this activation of MC4R-expressing CRH neurons to impair counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia. We will test the hypotheses with the following Aims, Aim1: Determine the role of hypothalamic MC4R-expressing CRH neurons in integrating signals from renal afferent nerves to increase plasma epinephrine in response to hypoglycemia. Aim2: Identify the molecular and integrative (central versus peripheral) mechanisms – chronically elevated renal GLUT2, decreased renal afferent nerve activity, and/or blunted activation of hypothalamic MC4R-expressing CRH neurons - through which diabetes compromises the body’s ability to defend against hypoglycemia. Aim3: Establish the contribution of renal gluconeogenesis as a source of glucose to defend against hypoglycemia and identify the renal adrenergic receptors through which epinephrine increases glucose reabsorption and renal gluconeogenesis. Altogether, this project will likely identify a novel neuroendocrine circuit underlying the crosstalk between the hypothalamus, kidney and adrenal gland to coordinate systemic glucose homeostasis. This integrative circuit will probably inform the molecular basis of how diabetes compromises the body’s ability to increase plasma epinephrine in the face of glucose deficits leading to hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, a life- threatening condition in patients with type 1 or late-stage type 2 diabetes."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, and there is a critical need to determine
underlying mechanisms and develop novel therapies for treatment. Small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs)
are evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNAs that guide biochemical modification on specific nucleotides such
as pseudouridylation (Ψ) and 2′-O-ribose methylation (2′-OMe). These modifications are essential in the post-
transcriptional changes and functions of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNA). Recent studies highlight a
crucial role of scaRNA in preserving spliceosome fidelity and cardiac development; however, the role of scaRNAs
in acute cardiac injury and its repair has not been established.
This
proposal aims to determine scaRNA’s role
in cardiovascular processes in a mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model that could develop new tools for treating
MI. Our central hypothesis is that overexpression of scaRNA18 in the post-MI heart promotes positive cardiac
remodeling by inducing therapeutic angiogenesis via 2′-OMe of U4 snRNA and regulating Wilms tumor1 (WT1)
expression, thereby conferring cardioprotection and improving cardiac function. Our preliminary data
demonstrates 1) decreased scaRNA18 expression in post-MI mouse hearts using unbiased small RNA
sequencing, 2) scaRNA18 expression exclusively downregulated in isolated cardiac endothelial cells (EC) in
post-MI mouse hearts, 3) scaRNA18 knockdown (KD) impairs tube formation and induces apoptosis in mouse
cardiac ECs without induced stress, 4) scaRNA18 overexpression enhances EC angiogenesis and inhibits
stress-induced EC apoptosis in vitro, 5) scaRNA18-overexpressing cardiac EC extracellular vesicles protect
iPSC-cardiomyocyte cell death via angiogenic proteins, 6) 2’-O-methylation levels were reduced in MI hearts
and in cardiac ECs from scaRNA18 KD mice, 7) mutant scaRNA18 lacking binding sites to guide 2′-OMe on U4
snRNA induces EC cell apoptosis without induced stress, 8) unbiased mass spectrometry results revealed that
scaRNA18 reduces WT1 expression levels in scaRNA18 KD cardiac ECs, 9) WT-1 KD in the presence of
scaRNA18 overexpression nullified scaRNA18 mediated EC survival effects, and 10) overexpression of
scaRNA18 by VE-cadherin-driven AAV9 reduces infarct size after ex vivo cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury
and improves cardiac function post-MI mice (in vivo). The hypothesis that scaRNA18 is a critical component in
cardiac function and repair will be tested in the following three specific aims: in Aim 1, we will define the role of
scaRNA18 in cardiac EC function and cardiomyocyte survival; in Aim 2, we will determine the molecular
mechanisms by which scaRNA18 regulates cardiac EC function and cardiomyocyte survival, and in Aim 3 we
will use post-MI mice to demonstrate the critical role of scaRNA18 in myocardial injury repair. The proposed
studies could establish scaRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for MI."

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes to renew a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in
the Basic Biology of Aging focused on comparative bioenergetics and aging. Energetics is comprehensively
defined for this purpose as the study of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the acquisition,
storage, and utilization of metabolizable energy. Comparative energetics is the study of metabolic processes at
multiple scales and across multiple species, in this case as it relates to health and aging. Nearly a century of
aging research has reinforced the link between energetics and aging. In modern terms, this link is reified as
dysregulated mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and nutrient responsiveness. The twin objectives of
the Center will be to 1) explore in greater depth and detail than previously possible the complex relationship
among cellular and organismal energetics and their relationship to whole organisms' energetics, health, and
aging, and 2) provide quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies and novel methodologies in the assessment
and analysis of bioenergetics to the geroscience community at large. In pursuit of these objectives, we will
continue to provide three Research Cores. 1) The Comparative Organismal Energetics Core (a.k.a.
Organismal Core) will provide expertise and cutting-edge instruction and methodology for determining
complete whole-animal energy balance (intake, assimilation, and expenditure) and body composition, including
regional distribution of white and brown adipose tissue, in living animals of various species, including worms,
flies, fish, mice, or other mammals, under diverse temperature or activity regimes. 2) The Comparative
Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core (a.k.a. Mitometabolism Core) will provide integrated, quantitative
mitochondrial functional analysis at the level of the organelle, cell, or tissue for both traditional and emerging
animal models, including targeted metabolomics, assessment of mitophagy, and oxidative stress.
Mitochondrial-nuclear exchange models also will be available to enable experiments that evaluate the
contribution of mtDNA variation to bioenergetics. 3) The Comparative Data Analytics Core (a.k.a. Analytics
Core) will provide innovative analytic approaches to data sets linking comparative energetics to organismal
health and longevity.
 With these Research Cores plus the Administrative Program Enrichment Core (Admin Core) and Research
Development Core (RDC), we aim to: 1) facilitate hypothesis-driven research and leverage these technologies
into new projects, interactions, and collaborations nationwide in basic aging research; 2) foster meaningful
novel interactions among investigators within UAB and across the region and country; and 3) provide
resources, education, training, and direction to junior investigators through the intellectual resources and
research infrastructure the Center will develop."

Despite being one of the largest and fastest-growing demographics in the United States (US), Latinx persons
experience striking health disparities, particularly in terms of hazardous drinking and co-occurring clinical
anxiety. No interventions to date have targeted hazardous drinking in the context of clinical anxiety among
Latinx persons. The current R01 proposal builds upon our past work by developing a brief, single-session,
computer-based, personalized feedback intervention (PFI) designed to enhance knowledge regarding adverse
anxiety-alcohol interrelations, increase motivation and intention to reduce hazardous drinking, and reduce
positive attitudes and intentions regarding the use of alcohol for anxiety. Specifically, we propose to develop a
low-cost, highly disseminatable, integrated PFI for Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety (AA-PFI 1.0)
that will be implemented and tested for effectiveness in community-based health clinics. Our approach will
follow a staged model consistent with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for developing and
standardizing behavioral interventions. Phase IA activities will involve collecting qualitative and quantitative
feedback from three iterative focus groups (N = 21) to refine intervention content and evaluate treatment
acceptability and feasibility. Phase IB activities will include a rigorous randomized clinical trial designed to
compare the effectiveness of AA-PFI 2.0 to a control PFI (C-PFI) among a sample of 250 Latinx hazardous
drinkers with clinical anxiety who receive care within community-based health clinics. This study represents an
important and pivotal step in the larger landscape of translating basic research to more efficacious strategies
for reducing hazardous drinking in underserved populations with biobehavioral comorbidities. The proposed
research project supports the 2017-2021 strategic plan of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (NIAAA) by advancing research in two of the key areas. First, the current proposal has the end goal
of improving strategies to prevent alcohol misuse, alcohol use disorder, and alcohol-related consequences
among an ‘at-risk’ population for these conditions (goal 3). Second, it enhances the public health impact of
NIAAA-supported research by focusing on one of the fastest-growing and largest demographics in the US who
demonstrate disparities in hazardous drinking (goal 5). The current application aligns with the goals of RFA-
AA-21-001 by proposing to examine the effectiveness of a low cost, highly disseminatable, personalized,
culturally adapted PFI for Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety within community-based health clinics.
Given the collective public health impact of concurrent anxiety and alcohol use, we believe the proposed study
will yield findings that enhance scientific knowledge, advance our understanding of mechanisms in anxiety-
alcohol use relations, and inform the development of novel treatments for hazardous drinkers with clinical
anxiety that are adaptable and easily implemented across a variety of healthcare settings."

pathological use of cocaine and other psychostimulants accounts for a significant proportion of morbidity and

are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorders. In treating patients with stimulant use
disorder, the largest hurdle to overcome is in preventing drug relapse. In recent years there has been a
growing understanding that a number of systems outside of the brain can play a critical role in shaping brain
and behavior. Among these is the resident population of bacteria in the intestinal tract – collectively referred to
as the gut microbiome. Extensive research now demonstrates that changes in the gut microbiome play a
critical role in both normal brain function, as well as in the development of pathological states. In our own lab
we have previously published that acute depletion of the microbiome can alter the rewarding effects of cocaine
and affect gene expression changes in the brain. More recently, we have begun investigating how depleting
the microbiome with antibiotics affects the persistence of behavioral and brain gene expression changes in
animal models of relapse. We find that animals that lack a complex microbiome have increased cocaine
seeking behaviors after a prolonged period of abstinence. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analyses
demonstrate that these animals have robust changes in gene expression in important striatal gene networks
that affect synaptic plasticity and behavior. Additional analyses demonstrate epigenetic changes in chromatin
structure. Importantly, behavioral and molecular effects of microbiome depletion can be largely reversed by
replenishment of specific bacterially derived small molecules. In this grant we will work in two comprehensive
Aims to clarify the specificity and mechanisms of these effects and will work to further targeting the gut
microbiome and its molecular byproducts. Aim 1 will define temporal specificity of microbiome depletion effects
on drug seeking behaviors with targeted microbiome depletions and reconstitutions at different phases of
behavior. Behavioral studies will be coupled with molecular analyses of synaptic plasticity related
transcriptional and epigenetic effects. Additional analyses of microbiome composition will define bacterial
populations associated with increased drug seeking. Aim 2 will further clarify the role of individual microbiome-
derived small molecules in driving these behavioral and molecular changes. These studies will provide critical
mechanistic insight into gut-brain signaling in a model of cocaine use disorder and will lay the foundation for
tractable translational research going forward."
11087237,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
While artificial saliva products are available in the market, they need to replicate natural saliva's
essential protective roles in maintaining a healthy oral environment. One of the primary reasons saliva
is so beneficial is the presence of mucins, a densely glycosylated protein found in this biological fluid.
Mucins in saliva serve multiple purposes: they provide lubrication during chewing and swallowing,
create a protective shield against harmful acids from food and microbes, and play a pivotal role in
maintaining the balance of the oral microbiome. However, mucins' intricate structures and functions
still need to be fully understood. Factors such as the length of the mucin backbone, the repetitive
nature of its peptide subunits, the specific types of glycan side chains attached, the density of its
glycosylation, and the extent of its crosslinking all potentially influence the role of mucins in saliva.
Given the pressing need for more effective artificial saliva – ideally containing mucin analogs – this
project aims to create advanced mucin substitutes. This will be achieved through a cycle of informed
synthesis based on testing results. The ultimate vision is to custom-design and produce artificial
mucins that closely emulate the physiological functions of their natural counterparts found in human
saliva. To achieve this, the project has set specific objectives: (1) Craft artificial mucins that mirror the
physicochemical properties of natural salivary mucins, (2) design these mucins to offer protection
against tooth demineralization, and (3) fine-tune the glycosylation patterns of these artificial mucins to
ensure they interact optimally with the oral microbiome. The anticipated outcomes of this endeavor
are manifold. Firstly, by incorporating these tailor-made mucin analogs into enhanced artificial saliva
formulations, we can offer relief to patients afflicted with dry mouth disease. Furthermore, the insights
garnered from this research can pave the way for designing artificial mucins suitable for other mucosal
areas impacted by dryness. Lastly, these mucin-inspired therapeutics could serve as targeted
modulators or scavenger molecules, intervening with microbial colonization in the human mouth and
ensuring a healthy oral environment."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not infect neurons, yet dendritic simplification and loss of synapses
are still seen in a subset of people living with HIV, despite antiretroviral therapies. HIV can also cause
neurocognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, a constellation of clinical signs grouped under a disease
termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Nevertheless, the underlying causes of the pathological
alterations observed in these individuals are poorly comprehended. Viral proteins, including the envelope protein
gp120, have emerged as leading candidates to explain HIV-mediated neurotoxicity, though the mechanisms
remain unclear. Experimental evidence has shown that gp120 is endocytosed into neurons and is transported
within the axon to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it causes a dysfunction of endoproteases such as furin,
among others. Furin is crucial for the processing of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to mature
BDNF. proBDNF activates the neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), which has been shown to promote the loss
of synapses. In the previous grant cycle, we have shown that the removal of one allele of p75NTR rescues the
loss of dendritic synapses seen in gp120 transgenic mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that HIV, through gp120,
damages p75NTR positive synapses, thus driving synapto-dendritic degeneration observed in HAND. However,
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how gp120, through p75NTR, damages synapses remain under
investigation. This application proposes a comprehensive set of experiments to test the main hypothesis. In
particular (Aim 1), we will utilize gp120 transgenic mice crossed with p75NTR-/- mice to investigate the molecular
mechanisms whereby activation of p75NTR by gp120-induced proBDNF leads to neuronal degeneration.
Because p75NTR plays a role in amyloid beta (Ab) processing, we will test the hypothesis that the loss of synapses
in HAND is due to Ab accumulation. In Aim 2, we will confirm that gp120 impairs the function of the ER by
carrying out a comprehensive analysis of ER stress in both gp120 transgenic mice and cortical neuronal cultures.
In Aim 3, we will use HIV negative and HIV positive human samples, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to
establish whether the presence of gp120 in human brains correlates with the degree of neurocognitive
impairments. We will determine the levels of gp120, markers of neuronal damage (e.g. microtubule associated
protein-2), inflammation, and levels of Ab in different subgroups of HAND subjects. Particular attention will be
paid to HAND subjects with APOE alleles that are considered neuroprotective (e.g. e2) or risk factors (e4). We
expect to provide new significant data on the role of p75NTR in HIV-mediated synaptic simplification. Knowledge
into the diverse role of p75NTR in HAND and other neurodegenerative diseases is likely to provide a better
understanding of these diseases and elucidate primary and adjuvant p75NTR directed pharmacotherapies."

At last count, sepsis was reported to be the leading cause of death in U.S hospital intensive care units (ICU);
accounting for ~1 in 5 deaths world-wide; its incidence is anticipated to rise as the populations in developed
countries age; and it was the consensus cause of death assigned to those dying from COVID-19 infection. Most
frustrating, is that while we continue to optimize the supportive care for these critically ill patients, we have yet to
see a novel molecular etiology-based therapy make a sustained impact on overall septic morbidity/ mortality.
Excitingly, while working for years on defining numerous defects of components of both adaptive and innate
immune responsiveness induced by shock and/or sepsis, we have uncovered novel role(s) for a number of the
B7-family of cell-associated co-inhibitory receptors, Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 [PD-1], B-/T-
Lymphocyte Attenuator [BTLA], recently, V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation [VISTA,
a.k.a., B7-H5, PD-1H] and their respective cell surface ligands; popularly referred to as checkpoint proteins. In
this competitive renewal of our MIRA program, we propose to continue to push forward the 3 project areas we
brought together previously under the over-arching concept that by understanding the mechanism(s) of
injury/shock and/or sepsis that serve to predispose animals (experimentally) or critically ill/injured
patients to develop morbid outcomes, we can elucidate not only novel prognostic markers of patient’s
course, but uncover unique therapeutic targets for their treatment. In the 1st Project area we will determine
how the select expression of PD-1, BTLA or VISTA, on myeloid as opposed to lymphoid cells alters the
development of morbid events associated with sepsis; then, how the expression of ligands for these co-inhibitory
molecules, on leukocytes and/or endothelial/epithelial cells, contribute to the onset of septic liver, intestine and/or
kidney dysfunction. In our 2nd Project area, we will utilize a novel murine model of indirect-acute lung injury
(iALI)(dual insults of hemorrhage shock followed by cecal ligation & puncture [CLP]) to ask how checkpoint
protein expression not only effect the patho-mechanisms driving the development of iALI, but how are these co-
inhibitors alter cell ‘priming’/’innate immune memory’/function by following pulmonary immune/non-immune cell
transcriptomic/epigenomic fate/programing. Finally, (3rd Project) since the neonate possesses a unique/naïve
immune system and is more susceptible to morbid response in the face of infectious challenge; we ask how the
expression of members of the B-7 family of proteins and/or their ligands not only have a comparative impact on
the response to septic insult, but how this alters their microbiota and epigenetic makeup/immune function as
survivors mature? To do this we will interrogate these 3 cogent models of sepsis, shock/sepsis and/or neonatal
sepsis, by applying a combination genetic/Cre-Lox mouse models, adoptive transfer, single cell RNA-seq/ATAC-
seq, 16S microbiota RNA-seq and bisulfite/pyrosequencing to examine these questions/hypotheses along with
select observational clinical studies in the critical ill patient population."
11071583,"This administrative supplement supports the BringBPaL2Me Trial in order to fully meet trial aims. In South
Africa (SA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is managed within primary care clinics (PCCs), where nurses treat
drug-susceptible TB and TB/HIV coinfection with treatment outcomes rivaling the best in the world. A PCC
management strategy offers a more convenient, patient-centered, differentiated model of care that integrates TB
and HIV treatment within the same setting. A diagnosis of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), however, upends
this model, requiring referral to a hospital-based, physician-led outpatient treatment center. Hospital-based,
physician-led models add significant patient-associated costs, with estimates suggesting 81% of RR-TB patients
experience catastrophic costs even in a decentralized outpatient model. There is hope, however, to move RR-TB
care into PCCs and in many settings this involves nurse-led management. The BringBPaL2Me Trial is a multi-
principal investigator, multi-site, cluster randomized, non-inferiority trial (CR-NIT), to compare nurse-led RR-
TB treatment in PCCs to standard of care physician-led RR-TB treatment at district hospitals in the provinces of
KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Gauteng (GP) and Eastern Cape (EC), SA. Clusters include 10 PCCs affiliated with 5
decentralized outpatient programs at RR-TB district hospitals (n=70 clusters). We estimate the need to screen
3,800 RR-TB positive patients to enroll 2,800, or 49 RR-TB participants per PCC cluster. We estimate 60-70%
will be HIV co-infected. The interclass correlation is 0.024 based on our prior CRT enrolling 3,000 patients in
KZN and EC. The non-inferiority margin is set at 5% with the assumption of 90% treatment success in the
physician-led arm. Treatment will include either a 6-month RR-TB regimen (i.e., bedaquiline, pretomanid,
linezolid and levofloxacin, or BPaL-L) or fluroquinolone-resistant TB (i.e., BPaL) regimen. The BringBPaL2Me
primary aim is to conduct a 5-year, analyst and clinical safety review committee blinded, multi-site, CR-NIT to
evaluate 1) treatment outcome; 2) safety; and 3) patient associated catastrophic costs with the following
hypotheses: 1) Outpatient nurse-led treatment in PCCs will be non-inferior to outpatient physician-led treatment
at hospital-based outpatient sites among RR-TB patients, regardless of HIV co-infection, as determined by a
successful treatment outcome [H1]; 2) The proportion of severe adverse events (SAEs) identified will not
significantly differ by blinded, independent review [H2]; 3) Patient associated catastrophic costs (i.e., costs 20%
or more of household income) will be lower in nurse-led treatment [H3]. Our secondary aims include: 1) time to
event analysis for a) RR-TB treatment initiation; b) smear/culture conversion; and, as applicable, c) HIV
treatment initiation; d) HIV viral suppression; and e) AE and SAE symptom resolution; 2) characterization of
provider adherence to guidelines for: a) dosing requirements; b) RR-TB dosing changes based on AE and SAE
events; and c) AE and SAE adjuvant medication management strategy; 3) programmatic cost-effectiveness

Cancer is the second most common cause of death in developed nations, where an estimated 70% of cancers
are attributable to “modifiable” risk factors, including obesity, chronic inflammatory diseases, and poor diet, all
of which have been associated with increased oxidative stress. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with its incidence closely tied to these modifiable factors,
particularly inflammation and metabolic disorders. Of increasing concern is the rise in early-onset CRC
diagnoses in adults younger than 50, who are diagnosed over a decade sooner than the recommended age for
routine screening. Studies have shown individuals who were overweight or obese in childhood are known to be
at a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) later in life. The parent grant focuses on determining the
role of oxidative stress in cancer development, specifically targeting CRC influenced by lifestyle factors like
obesity, chronic inflammation, and poor diet. Using advanced techniques such as whole genome sequencing
(WGS) and computational analyses, the study aims to pinpoint mutational signatures associated with oxidative
stress-induced DNA damage and their correlation with cancer-promoting lifestyle factors.
In this diversity supplement, our central hypothesis is that CRC susceptibility in the context of obesity arises
from somatic mutations occurring in functional loci, such as those located in accessible chromatin regions. We
propose to leverage multi-omic profiling and computational tools to probe the relationship between reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mutational signatures and inflammation-driven cancer risk factors using
datasets from the NIH Common Fund (HuBMAP & GTEx). This supplement aligns with the parent grant's
mission to investigate lifestyle risk factors, oxidative stress, and CRC risk, extending its focus to explore
mutations in open chromatin sites under altered metabolic conditions and studying mutagenesis in colorectal
stem progenitor cells. To elucidate the molecular pathways linking early-life obesity to CRC susceptibility, it is
crucial to model and investigate the effects of hyperglycemic conditions and other mutagens during key
developmental stages. Colonic organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) will provide an
excellent model system for studying CRC development in vitro. By exposing these organoids to mutagenic
agents, we can mimic early-life exposures and assess their impact on mutagenesis and CRC risk. Additionally,
leveraging developmental GTEx data will enable us to map chromatin accessibility across different
developmental staging, allowing us to correlate the timing of mutagenesis and the effect on mutation
accumulation and functional impact. The overarching objective of our study is to comprehend how early-life
obesity and metabolic dysfunction increase susceptibility to mutagenesis leading to CRC development."

While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the
human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior
remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities,
spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of
present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated
Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to
measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals,
we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively-
parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify
the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop
scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in
establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single-
cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical
challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological
systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to
encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in
Genomics and Systems Biology."

The Administrative Core for the Cornell FIRST program will support the hiring and retention of 10 new 
assistant professors from groups underrepresented in their fields, while transforming institutional climate 
into a culture of inclusive excellence. The strength of Cornell’s program is its foundational roots as a 
complex private institution with a public mission, with its founding based on support for diversity, a culture of 
interdisciplinary research, and a track record of catalyzing change at different scales that were 
institutionalized. Given Cornell’s success in establishing programs for the effective development and 
support of early-career faculty, particularly those underrepresented in their fields, Cornell is in an excellent 
position to test the hypothesis that FIRST Cohort faculty will be successful in an environment that 
supports advocacy through sponsorship, consistent and individual-centered mentoring, and 
evidence-based professional development. We further hypothesize that Cornell’s institutional 
culture and scientific excellence will be enhanced with the hiring of a FIRST Cohort of diverse 
faculty. Cornell’s FIRST program features interdisciplinary hiring of faculty underrepresented in their fields, 
across six colleges and 20 departments, with a focus on retention, career development, and evaluation. The 
Administrative Core of the Cornell FIRST program will develop an inclusive FIRST Cohort search 
process that will lead to 10 hires in 3 clusters encompassing quantitative biomedical sciences, infection 
biology and health equity; hire and retain a diverse FIRST cohort of new faculty taking advantage of 
Cornell’s existing interdisciplinary field system approach where faculty are organized by research interest 
rather than by department; and will foster sustainable institutional culture change to support FIRST 
Cohort faculty to enhance their development, retention, progression, and promotion. Here, Cornell 
will accelerate its Belonging at Cornell framework for developing a culture of Inclusive Excellence, using a 
combination of institutional policies that impact hiring, mentoring, promotion and tenure, salary equity, and 
other initiatives aimed at enhancing compositional diversity, retention, and success of our faculty. We 
expect that the Cornell FIRST program will successfully hire, retain, and support 10 new faculty 
underrepresented in their fields, while fostering sustainable institutional culture change. These activities will 
result in increased diversity of the faculty in the biological, biomedical, and health sciences at Cornell, while 
contributing to the diversity of academy, and future generations of the STEM workforce."
11170289,"Recent advances in both mass spectroscopy and next generation sequencing methodology have revealed a new class of 5’ end RNA modification, which resembles the canonical eukaryotic 7-methyl-guanosine cap. These alternative “cap” structures are made up of metabolites such as Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) or Nicotinamide Adenosine Dinucleotide (NAD). The universality of these cap structures suggests that metabolite capping is a fundamental new facet of basic biology and are a novel mechanism for how a cell can fine tune gene expression levels based on metabolic state. To date, all of the work to determine the biological function of these caps has focused on NAD cap structures. However, recent experiments to quantify metabolite RNA caps showed that UDP-GlcNAc capped transcripts are present at higher levels than NAD capped transcripts in metazoans, fungi, bacteria and viruses. Considering the abundance of UDP-sugar capped transcripts, and the important role that these cap species play in cellular processes, it is imperative study the role these “glyco”-RNA caps play both on the function of RNA. To do this, we must first identify the specific transcripts which carry these caps and second, identify proteins that preferentially interact with these UDP-sugar capped transcripts by: 
1. Developing and utilizing a novel method ClickNAz-tag seq, which takes advantage of orthogonally labeling UDP-GlcNAc and UDP MurNAc in E. coli with click-chemistry capable chemical groups, which will be used to pull-down UDP-sugar capped transcripts for identification by RNA-seq. 2. Develop and utilize a method UDP-Sugar capped RNA affinity pulldown (UcRAP), which will utilize a 5’UDP-sugar capped RNA as a probe to pulldown cap interacting proteins from E. coli for identification by tandem mass spectroscopy. 
Developing these tools, knowing which transcripts are UDP-sugar capped, and which proteins interact with these caps, will be instrumental in dissecting the function of UDP-sugar caps on specific transcripts. These studies will inform our follow up studies, which will address: 1. The mechanism of capping, 2. The functional consequence of capping of specific transcripts and 3. When during the cell cycle and why this capping occurs."
11082659,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, is characterized by progressive
loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, leading to irreversible vision loss. Elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor for POAG. Unfortunately, the underlying pathological mechanisms
responsible for IOP-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration still remain unclear. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to delineate the molecular pathways governing IOP-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration and
to develop an effective glaucoma treatment strategy. To this end, we have developed a novel glucocorticoid
(GC)-induced and myocilin-associated mouse models of POAG, replicating human POAG phenotypes.
Importantly, we have identified impaired mitophagy, accumulation of damaged mitochondria and inflammatory
immune cells in the optic nerve of both human and mouse glaucoma. Based upon our preliminary data, we
propose to: 1) examine the effect of IOP on mitophagy impairment and accumulation of damaged mitochondria
using mouse and human POAG, 2) examine the role of impaired mitophagy on glaucomatous neurodegeneration
and, 3) further identify whether enhancing mitophagy alleviates neurodegeneration and prevent RGC loss in
mouse models of POAG. In the mentored phase, I will establish mouse models to study mitophagy in POAG
including mitophagy reporter transgenic Mt-Keima mice, RGC-specific Parkin and ATG5 conditional knockout
mice under the guidance of Dr. Gulab Zode (an expert in chronic ER stress and autophagy in trabecular
meshwork). In collaboration with Dr. Denise Inman (an expert in the field of mitochondrial metabolism), I will
enhance my understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of POAG. The mentored phase will
also be supplemented by training with Dr. Abbot Clark (well-known leading glaucoma expert), who will provide
assistance with human tissues as well as an additional training for my independent career. Furthermore, regular
meetings with Dr. Paula Gregory who has tremendous experience in assisting young investigators will help me
to develop independent career. During the independent phase, we will examine role of mitophagy on
inflammatory neurodegeneration and determine whether inducing mitophagy (Urolithin A/Actinonin/Metformin/
Parkin overexpression) rescues GC or myocilin-associated POAG. Additionally, during the mentored phase, I
will be having regular meetings with my advisory committee, attend scientific conferences, and continue my
career development. I am in the ideal environment for the proposed research and for my career development as
Dr. Zode has an established state-of-the-art facilities at the North Texas Eye Research Institute, and
collaborations with renowned scientists, Dr. Val Sheffield, Dr. John Hulleman and Dr. Kevin Park. This will help
me to set-up good collaborations, learn new techniques, and build an independent research laboratory at a well-
established academic institution."
11082927,"Project Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide1. For the vast majority
of patients, AD is sporadic, with no known etiology other than advanced age. The field of neuroscience has
understandably focused on cell intrinsic properties of neuronal cells as the basis for neurodegenerative
diseases, such as AD. However, about half of the cells in the brain are glial cells with ~15% of cells in the brain
accounted for by microglia2. Microglia are specialized macrophages of the central nervous system that help to
clear debris, pathogens, and neuronal synapses. Under homeostatic conditions, microglia provide support to
neurons, while under pathological conditions, microglia often prune synapses excessively, activate astrocytes,
increase inflammation, and reduce support to neurons3. Currently, a mechanistic understanding of microglia in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is unclear. To advance the scientific goals of aim 4, this project will study metabolic
neuron-microglia interactions in three-dimensional multicellular cultures. This project will test the hypothesis
that aberrant neuronal PKM2 challenges neuron-glia coupling, and that the microglial capacity to prune and
respond to inflammatory stimuli is influenced by their APOE (Apolipoprotein E) haplotype. The original proposal
indicated that astrocyte activation may be lacking in the absence of microglia to properly activate them. Since,
significant advances have been made in the Gage lab to address this issue through the incorporation of
microglia into organoids (In press, Cell. May 2023), which will complement the microcarrier data and provide a
separate piece of evidence. Metabolic changes in glia by APOE haplotype is well documented4,5, but the
impact on neurons is less clear. It is unknown how APOE ε4 allele influences AD onset and progression or how
APOE ε2 allele provides protection6. This lab has recently acquired commercially available human isogenic
iPSC lines that have been genetically altered to represent each APOE haplotype. Microglia will be generated
from each of these lines as previously described7 and cultured in multi-cell microcarriers and organoids.
Preliminary data from this lab suggests that microglia with APOE4/4 have AD related metabolic defects
associated with lipid metabolism, lysosomal and mitochondrial function. The goal of this project is to analyze
the transcriptome and functionality of microglia with different APOE haplotypes. By employing single cell RNA
sequencing, this project will identify differences in gene expression on a cell-type basis, between these groups.
These data will contribute to the overall proposal and reveal specific genes involved implicated in AD and age-
related lysosomal function and metabolism are downregulated by APOE. Through this mechanism, APOE4
microglia may actively contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, rather than solely reacting to AD pathogenesis.
The hypothesis of this project is that APOE4 microglia will exhibit decreased mitophagy and lysosomal
impairment, therefore increasing toxicity within cells, and ultimately impacting the way APOE4/4 microglia can
provide support to neurons, which this project will investigate through the microcarriers and organoid cultures."

 Albeit rare, monogenic causes of complex disorders provide unique opportunities for a deeper
understanding of common diseases. In this application, we seek to study the molecular pathogenesis of novel,
rare, monogenic autoinflammatory disorders. Central clinical presentations of these syndromic patients include
severe skin inflammation, non-specific gastrointestinal inflammation, and aberrant neurologic features.
 Using whole exome sequencing (WES) we have identified fourteen novel, exceedingly rare, inborn
genetic variations in genes with primary functions in innate immunity, specifically cytokine production,
transduction or regulation. These inborn errors of immunity are putative molecular drivers of autoinflammation,
the mechanisms of which we propose to explore in detail.
 Type I Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that signal through the JAK-STAT pathway. Beneficial effects of
IFNs largely concern antiviral defense, but profound detrimental effects to human health can manifest if this
pathway is overactive. Mendelian type I Interferonopathy disorders best exemplify how constitutive
upregulation of IFN-I activity can lead to aberrant immune and neurologic features.
 We have recently identified and reported children presenting type I Interferonopathy features due to
complete loss-of-function mutations in either ISG15 or USP18, which are essential for shutting off the IFN-I
response at the IFN-I receptor. These deficiencies are the first genetic defects affecting the negative regulation
of the IFN-I response. In this proposal we seek to characterize patients with novel, complete or hypomorphic,
mutations in these two genes, but also patients who present with alike syndromes with mutations in genes that
either induce IFN-I or convey the signal downstream of IFN-I and other JAK-STAT engaging cytokines.
 We propose to study these rare patients in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo to determine the molecular,
immunological, and clinical significance of these genes in JAK-STAT pathway regulation, and, by extension,
their function in severe autoinflammatory immune regulation.
 A deeper understanding of the molecular pathophysiology governing these disorders will lay the
groundwork for the development of medicines to better manage persistent inflammatory disorders, rare or
common."

for the review and potential endorsement of such solutions. C-Path has established core competencies in
these areas that allow our collaborations to achieve meaningful impact on unmet drug development needs.
C-Path’s core competencies also function to further their respective fields (e.g., refine data management
practices, develop new analytic and modeling techniques, develop specific COAs, or train future regulatory
scientists) and to create a neutral collaborative environment for experts and stakeholders to address specific
needs in drug development. Over the past 5 years, C-Path has launched new consortia and two extensive
programs in rare and orphan diseases, as well as supporting the qualification of COAs, the fit-for-purpose
endorsement of disease progression models and clinical trial simulation tools, the generation of new data
standards and databases, the creation of a new data and analytics platform, and educational initiatives that
advance regulatory science and model informed drug development. These accomplishments can decrease the
time, resources, and number of patients needed to develop and approve medical products and thus de-risk

11048680,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The brainstem is a complex and early-developing brain region that is responsible for sensory, motor,
autonomic, and critical-for-life functions. The first biology-based hypothesis of autism suggested that the
brainstem's reticular formation was responsible for the behavioral features of autism. However, technological
barriers have prevented the field from reliably characterizing brainstem substructures in vivo. Excitingly,
recent technological advances now allow us to examine the microstructural properties of the brainstem's
individual nuclei and white matter tracts using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. In our original R01, our group
contributed to these technological advances through innovative development and refinement of acquisition
and post-processing techniques that optimize brainstem imaging. We applied these techniques in autistic
children to show how brainstem substructures relate to sensorimotor and core diagnostic features. Yet, the
brainstem is highly connected, and we still do not know how the brainstem contributes to autistic whole-brain
networks. Leveraging the findings of the original R01, the overall scientific premise of this renewal is that
brainstem substructures, as key hubs in whole-brain networks, may hold significant insights into the
neurobiological underpinnings of primary and secondary features of autism. Given the functions of the
brainstem, we hypothesize that the whole-brain connections of key brainstem nuclei will explain variation in
sensorimotor, autonomic, feeding, and core autism features. This hypothesis will be tested through two
specific aims: 1) Determine brainstem-inclusive whole-brain network differences and markers of social and
repetitive behavior features in autistic children compared to non-autistic children. 2) Identify brainstem-
inclusive network associations with sensorimotor and autonomic features in autistic and non-autistic children.
We will perform brainstem-inclusive whole-brain tractography across three datasets: 1) our original R01's
data of brainstem-optimized imaging and measures of sensorimotor and autistic features in 74 autistic and
74 non-autistic children; 2) a new dataset with further brainstem-imaging improvements, feeding, and
respiratory sinus arrhythmia measures in 74 autistic and 74 non-autistic children/youth; and 3) publicly
available core diagnostic and neuroimaging data to which we will apply brainstem-optimized processing. An
innovative Mahalanobis Distance measure and graph theory measures will quantify group and individual
differences in brainstem-inclusive networks. Successful completion of this research will provide a quantitative
characterization of brainstem-inclusive whole-brain networks that will advance the understanding of the
neurobiological basis for core and co-occurring autism features. These contributions will be significant by
paving the way for determining age-appropriate and biology-informed interventions for the prevalent
sensorimotor, feeding, and cardiorespiratory differences of autistic individuals."
11073225,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The University of New Mexico (UNM) is the flagship and largest university in New Mexico, which is one of four
majority-minority states. It is also one of the poorest and most under-resourced states in the nation. New
Mexico has a large Hispanic (49.3%) and American Indian (11%) population. UNM is a Hispanic-Serving
Institution and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity University with over 16,000 undergraduates and 6,000
graduate students. The ethnic/racial diversity of the student population closely reflects that of the state, and
women make up 57.4% of undergraduate and graduate enrollments. UNM has an extraordinary group of NIH-
funded researchers who are internationally renowned for research in neuroscience and data science, each with
great potential to train and elevate the next generation of diverse scientists. Diversifying the biomedical faculty
at UNM will align with NIH’s goal of diversifying the biomedical workforce at all levels in order to accomplish its
mission of discovery and innovation toward improving human health. Furthermore, it will catalyze inclusive
excellence, and provide role models for female and URM trainees and a relatable path toward career
advancement in STEM. Cluster hiring of faculty, which will be new for UNM, appears to be an effective way to
build a faculty cohort and diversify the professoriate. Thus, the UNM FIRST program will implement a cluster
design model of faculty hiring, mentoring, and professional development that is embedded within UNM’s
ongoing commitment to inclusive excellence. Recruitment and hiring strategies designed to promote diversity
and reduce discrimination will be used. Hiring will occur across six departments. Our long-term goal is to
employ a cluster/cohort hiring model that increases the diversity of biomedical faculty at UNM, which in turn will
significantly increase our percentage of URM faculty who are Principal Investigators with NIH funding. The
central hypothesis is that the UNM FIRST program will successfully hire, promote, and retain a diverse faculty
cohort, and the policies/practices resulting from this program, such as the creation of the Institutional
Innovation Implementation Board, will be adopted by UNM and ultimately make significant improvements in
inclusive excellence. The Specific Aims of the UNM FIRST Administrative Core are: to lead the process of
recruiting and hiring the diverse UNM FIRST faculty cohort in the neuroscience and data science areas (AIM
1), to distribute start-up research funding and provide administrative support to the UNM FIRST faculty cohort
to facilitate success in obtaining NIH funding (AIM 2), and to provide ongoing support for UNM faculty,
department chairs, and UNM leadership to implement new innovative campus-wide policies and processes to
increase hiring, promotion, and retention of female and diverse faculty and otherwise lead to a more inclusive
institutional culture (AIM 3). The proposed work is highly significant, given the focus on using evidence-based
approaches to increase diversity among faculty in the areas of neuroscience and data science."

The mission of the St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center (SJCCC) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
(SJCRH) is to advance research and cures for pediatric cancer, the leading cause of disease-related death in
children aged 1 to 14 years. For more than 4 decades, we have pursued this mission with the support of a Cancer
Center Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We remain the only NCI-designated Cancer
Center that is dedicated solely to the research and treatment of pediatric malignancies. As such, we serve as a
national and international resource for health care providers, children with cancer, and their families. Through
the support of the American Lebanese and Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a separate organization whose
sole purpose is to raise money in support of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), we receive robust
institutional support. A total of 75% percent of institutional space and annual budget are invested in the SJCCC.
We propose 5 multidisciplinary research Programs that are organized with the specific intent of translating basic
science discoveries into curative therapies for children with cancer, while minimizing long-term side effects: our
Cancer Biology Program (CBP), which embeds basic cancer research within the heart of the SJCCC, facilitating
direct interaction with the disease-oriented Programs and the major laboratory resources in the Center; our 3
disease-oriented Programs, focused on innovative translational and clinical research in Developmental Biology
and Solid Tumors (DBSTP), Hematological Malignancies (HMP), and Neurobiology and Brain Tumors (NBTP);
and our Cancer Control and Survivorship Program (CCSP), which strives to translate discoveries into effective
strategies to avert or mitigate treatment-related complications and improve the quality of life for survivors of
pediatric cancer. Research by our 114 members is supported by 9 Shared Resources, 1 developing Shared
Resource, and an extraordinary clinical research infrastructure. During the previous funding period, a new
Director was recruited and a new 8-goal strategic plan was launched for the SJCCC. A total of 32,522 clinical
trial enrollments occurred at the Center during the current funding period, of which 60% were to SJCCC
investigator-initiated studies. External peer-reviewed trials, many which are SJCCC member-led, accounted for
another 38% of enrollments. In the last 12 months we were supported by $34.3 million (direct cost) in extramural
funding ($30.3.5 million peer-reviewed; $3.9 million non–peer-reviewed). Since the prior renewal, SJCCC
members published more than 2,100 manuscripts, which includes a marked increase in publications in the
highest-level journals. Our campus has grown in size by 23% and SJCRH and ALSAC have committed to more
than $150 million in new investment to support the SJCCC strategic plan. Despite strategically reducing our
membership by 27% to more tightly focus on cancer research and our strategic plan, NCI funding has increased
by 9.3%, other NIH funding by 9.5%, and our other peer-reviewed funding has increased by 34%."
11072729,"The aim of our multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train predoctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  Our program is shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation and recruits from an excellent pool of ~60 MD fellows and 55-75 PhD students each year. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, algorithm development, cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program’s core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences.  In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience, Medicine and Statistics, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, oral presentations, and laboratory management, (6) new to the program will be a dedicated statistician and expert guest speakers leading intensive didactic seminars on quantitative tools and approaches, experimental design, and statistical methodology, and (7) all journal clubs, workshops and one-on-one mentoring will have time devoted to promoting quantitative literacy and thinking to address issues in research.  The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine, Neuroscience and Statistics all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn’s Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics."

Several studies have found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with the
development and progression of both Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), possibly through infection of
beta cells, increased insulin resistance, increased inflammation and fibrosis, and other biological processes.
The proposed study will take advantage of robust existing infrastructure to rapidly identify, recruit, and retain
diverse cohorts of English and Spanish speaking pediatric and adult patients with recently diagnosed T1D or
T2D. The study will include 1600 study participants diagnosed with diabetes in the last 3 months, who have
had a known COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days and those with recent diagnosis of diabetes and no
known COVID-19 infection in the past year. The study will leverage PCORnet, a unique national network of
over 60 health systems with electronic health record (EHR) data on over 80 million patients and a track record
for successful study recruitment. We will query EHR records to swiftly identify potential study subjects with
recent diagnosis of diabetes and contact them via patient portals, telephone, face-to-face encounters, and
other approaches. We will also leverage the T1D Exchange (T1DX), a national network of 54 diabetes centers
and an online patient registry of 17,000 individuals with T1D. Consented participants will partake in regular
web/mobile or telephone surveys leveraging a previously developed REDCap/Twilio platform. Participants will
also come to sites for regular serological testing, and a subsample will participate in more robust testing of
glucose tolerance, biomarkers, and vascular function. This data will be supplemented by longitudinal EHR data
from participating sites and across PCORnet. Participants will be followed for 2 years. Aim 1 will examine if
patients with recent T2D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and increased insulin resistance than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 2 will examine if
patients with recent T1D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and more rapid reduction in beta cell function than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 3 will
evaluate a subset of patients with diabetes to examine if COVID-19 is associated with worse vascular function,
increased inflammation and hypercoagulability. Aim 4 will explore the role of genomic/social/environmental
factors on inflammation and metabolic function. Aim 5 will leverage EHR data to explore the role of COVID-19
and COVID-19 treatments on diabetes development and diabetes-related outcomes across the pandemic. The
study will be led by a team with significant experience related to COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC), obesity and diabetes in children and adults, epidemiological research, informatics, health services
research, genomics, metabolomics, physiology, patient and family engagement and other areas. The proposed
work will provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, that can support
future interventions and public health approaches to improve health."

Despite advances in HIV diagnostics, care and prevention strategies, infection rates among adolescent and young adult
sexual and gender minorities (SGM) continue to rise in the United States (US). There is an urgent need to describe the
epidemiology and trajectories of HIV acquisition in this population and to offer age and culturally appropriate scalable
prevention interventions to those at highest risk of infection in the US. This project will engage and retain young SGM in
an innovative longitudinal cohort, enroll them in a dynamic established digital health retention platform (HMP;
HealthMPowerment), monitor HIV risk and prevention behaviors and explore the socioecological factors that influence
the use of new HIV prevention technologies (UG3 phase), while also allowing targeted testing of novel digital health
interventions (UH3 phase). We will also test the efficacy of expanding the core version of HMP (HMP Basic) by adding
adherence tools (HMP Enhanced) for those who are on PrEP or ART to improve adherence and persistence. In Aim 1,
we will enroll and retain a large (n=6000; 3000/year), diverse cohort of sexually active, SGM adolescents and young
adults, ages 13-34, using innovative digital recruitment, engagement and retention strategies. Over the course of the study,
we will longitudinally characterize the sexual behavior, HIV transmission risk, and PrEP uptake trajectories of SGM
youth utilizing epidemiological trajectory analyses to identify the most effective points of intervention (Aim 2). For Aim
3, we will launch a randomized clinical trial to examine the efficacy of HMP Enhanced to improve PrEP adherence
among HIV-negative youth (n ≥750) and ART adherence among HIV-positive youth (n ≥150) compared to HMP Basic.
Finally, we will maximize the productivity of the cohort by testing new and innovative digital health devices, HIV/STI
diagnostics and interventions, informed by the previous aims as well as emerging NIH prevention priorities (Aim 4). Our
investigative team has decades of experience with recruitment, prevention and care of SGM youth and large-scale
longitudinal cohort studies. This study will capitalize upon productive existing partnerships and digital health expertise to
articulate the drivers of the ongoing HIV epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in the US in order to identify
the most effective, expeditious and scalable strategies to address this ongoing public health crisis."

 Psychedelics are chemicals best known for their ability to induce profound changes in the human
conscious experience. After a several-decade hiatus, research on psychedelics is undergoing a renaissance,
driven by their potential to treat psychiatric disorders with rapid onset and enduring effect. Recent research
reveals that psychedelics can rapidly promote the structural and functional plasticity of synapses, leading to the
conjecture that neural plasticity underlies their long-term therapeutic values. However, the neurobiological
mechanisms remain largely elusive. Our overarching goal is to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms
underlying psychedelics’ long-lasting therapeutic effects. In this proposal, we focus on the classical serotonergic
psychedelic psilocybin and investigate how it rescues the deleterious effects of stress, a major risk factor for
many neuropsychiatric disorders. Our central hypothesis is that psilocybin affects the brain at multiple levels,
from synaptic plasticity to the functional network; although psilocybin only transiently enhances synapse
formation, it permanently alters the synaptic circuit in an experience-dependent manner; the incorporation of new
synapses into the neural circuit is essential for psilocybin’s long-lasting rescue of stress-induced functional and
behavioral deficits. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the acute and enduring effects of psilocybin on the
stressed brain, particularly on the structural reorganization of synaptic circuits, on cortical functional networks,
and on the representation of behavioral variables by cortical neuronal ensembles. Aim 2 determines how the
environmental and behavioral contexts in which psilocybin is administered impact its rescuing effects on the
stressed brain. Aim 3 determines the contribution of psilocybin-induced neuroplasticity, particularly the
stabilization of newly formed dendritic spines, to its rescuing effects on the stressed brain. Overall, these studies
will provide an integrated, mechanistic understanding of psilocybin’s rescuing effects across the organizational
hierarchy of the brain, from molecules and synapses to circuits and functional networks, and lay the foundation
for its clinical application in treating stress-related psychiatric disorders."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10894261,"J. TL1 – TRAINING CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
The overarching goal of the Irving Institute’s NRSA Training Core is to bring together pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees from across the broad spectrum of medicine, the other health sciences, and the basic sciences 
at Columbia University (CU), and prepare them to be leaders of the next generation of clinical and translational 
investigators. The Training Core, designated as a TL1 by NCATS, is founded upon a typical NRSA T32 training 
program, but has unique and innovative features distinguishing it from other T32 programs including the 47 at 
CU. For example, the TL1 is deeply integrated into our overall Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) 
Program hub training and education program, TRANSFORM (Training And Nurturing Scholars For Research 
that is Multidisciplinary), which enables trainees to participate in didactic and experiential programs, including 
programs focused on team-science, alongside scholars in the KL2 and Master’s Degree in Patient Oriented 
Research programs. The Irving Institute’s TL1 also differs from a typical T32 in its disease agnostic approach
to recruitment and enrollment of trainees, and the designed focus on Precision Medicine (PM). As such, the 
program is named TL1-PM. The focus on PM has been stimulated by the CU-wide initiative in PM. Based on 
experiences during the first funding cycle, as well as the evolution of PM programs at CU, the Specific Aims for 
the renewal are: Aim 1. To further develop and refine our innovative TL1-PM education and career development 
program, thereby empowering our scholars and trainees to use the principles of PM to engage in interdisciplinary 
team science across all translational domains, make new discoveries, and be equipped to implement those 
discoveries into clinical practice and patient benefit. This TL1 is innovative in its focus on PM, significant 
coursework and seminars, a structured career development curriculum, and requiring all trainees to take 
externships. In the next five years, new opportunities will be added, including some focused on team and 
implementation science. Less successful programs will be scaled back or ended. Aim 2. To demonstrate the 
effectiveness of existing and new programs through continuous monitoring and assessment for quality 
improvement, using NCATS Common Metrics as well as our local, customized metrics to evaluate the impact of 
our educational programs on research output and the career trajectories of our graduates. Aim 3. To accelerate 
dissemination of the results of novel educational delivery approaches, new methods for assessing trainee 
learning, and best practices for enhancing interdisciplinary team science skills, to our partners at CU, regional 
CTSA Hubs (TriCon), and CTSA Program network throughout the nation."
11078946,"UNAIDS set for 2030 the ambitious 95-95-95 target: diagnosing 95% of all persons living with HIV (PWH),
initiating antiretroviral therapy for 95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral suppression for 95% of those
treated. In Tanzania, a PEPFAR strategy country with an adult HIV prevalence of 4.8%, only 83% of PWH are
aware of their status. More than 200,000 undiagnosed PWH need to test in order to reach the “first 95”.
With the cost-effectiveness of traditional HIV testing approaches declining, we propose to evaluate a novel
application of mobile health (mHealth) technology that leverages the ubiquity of mobile phones and the reach of
social networks to increase rates of HIV testing, especially among higher-risk individuals. Specifically, we will
evaluate the acceptability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of automated, confidential, SMS-based HIV testing
referrals, as a means of ‘nudging’ individuals to test. We hypothesize that an automated, confidential referral
system, developed and deployed in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, will be acceptable to both index clients
and their referrals and that it will be cost-effective for increasing HIV testing rates. Building on existing
relationships with all 25 HIV counseling and testing (HCT) providers in the study area, including 8 HIV care and
treatment centers (CTCs), and using an open-source, low-code, and highly versatile mobile phone-based
appointment reminder and incentive system (mParis), this study will address the following specific aims:
R21 Phase: Aim 1 will conduct qualitative, formative work with (1) HCT providers, (2) HCT clients, (3) PWH who
are in care at CTCs, and (4) social network contacts of HCT and CTC clients, to identify desirable provider- and
client-side characteristics of an SMS-based HIV testing referral system. Aim 2 will adapt our mParis system to
receive phone numbers of HIV testing referrals identified by index clients and autonomously send confidential
HIV testing invitations. Aim 3 will pilot-test the Confidential Social Network Referrals for HIV Testing (CONSORT)
system to collect preliminary data on the system’s acceptability, performance, and potential efficacy.
R33 Phase: Aim 4 will evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of CONSORT in a pragmatic randomized
controlled trial with 400 HCT clients and 200 HIV-infected CTC patients. Arm 1 participants will be offered
confidential SMS referrals and physical invitation cards (“card referrals”) to extend to any of their network
contacts. Arm 2 participants will be offered card referrals alone. The primary outcome will be uptake of HIV
testing. Secondary outcomes include the number of new HIV diagnoses, and the risk correlation within referral
networks. Aim 5 will evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of CONSORT+card referrals vs. card referrals
alone. The study will provide estimates of the acceptability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of an exceptionally
low-cost intervention for increasing the uptake of HIV testing. More broadly it will develop analytic and mHealth
capacity in Tanzania and inform the development of mobile phone-based chain-referral interventions that can
reach key social networks, are transferrable to other technologies, and can be extended beyond HIV testing."

This application is being submitted in response to Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-CA-24-032.
Certain populations have been traditionally underrepresented in cancer research and therefore the benefits of
cancer discoveries are more limited for these populations. Understanding informative variability (heterogeneity)
across individuals is the key to prediction, and therefore to address underrepresentation it is critical to better
understand heterogeneity within underrepresented groups. Cancers occur due to dysfunctional biological
processes. We hypothesize that many important sources of within-group heterogeneity will influence gene
function and biology and will be observed in patterns of gene expression (the transcriptome). Transcriptomes
sum the biological effects of lifestyle, genetics and environmental exposures on gene expression and provide a
molecular platform well-suited to explore tumor heterogeneities that may originate from many different factors.
Further, tumor expression has been shown to have utility for predicting clinical risk and outcomes. Hence,
transcriptomes provide an attractive way to understand both the origins and consequences of tumor
heterogeneity. We will perform characterization of tumor transcriptomes to understand heterogeneity
within three underrepresented populations: cancer patients living in rural areas, those of lower socio-
economic status, and those of Hispanic ethnicity. Deep multi-dimensional characterization will be determined
using the novel SPECTRA method developed by the Camp lab. Multiple independent quantitative
transcriptome variables will be derived that describe gene expression variability within each group. A common
limitation of molecular tumor studies is a paucity of companion epidemiologic data, necessary to identify
potential avenues for intervention and modification of risk. In addition to data collected in the parent study, we
will use record-linkage to the unique and powerful Utah Population Database (UPDB) to add individual- and
area-level epidemiologic variables. For each of the three focus groups, we will construct rich datasets that will
include demographic and lifestyle characteristics, clinical and prognostic variables, sociodemographic metrics,
measures of comorbidity, healthcare access and environmental exposures. We will identify associations
between state-of-the-art transcriptome variables and these elements to determine possible causes and
consequences of tumor heterogeneities observed within each group. Findings from this project will narrow the
knowledge gap by increasing our understanding of within-group tumor heterogeneities and has the potential to
provide new avenues and opportunities to advance equity in cancer prevention, control and outcomes in these
underrepresented populations."

APOL1 negative, we will also conduct a pilot study to test the impact of pharmacogenetic testing on systolic
blood pressure. Secondary outcomes include 6-month systolic blood pressure in chronic kidney disease
patients, medications ordered, renal diagnosis and testing, patient psycho-behavioral outcomes, cost
effectiveness, and the effect of pharmacogenetic-guided hypertension management on systolic blood pressure.
ADOPT-PGx: This randomized pragmatic genotype-guided clinical trial tests the effect of genotype-guided
therapy in three scenarios of patients: acute post-surgical pain, chronic pain, and depression. For each
scenario, participants are randomized to genotype-guided drug therapy versus usual approaches to drug
therapy selection. Changes in patient reported outcomes representing pain and depression control using
standard PROMIS scales define the primary endpoints. Secondary analyses include safety endpoints, changes
in overall well-being, and economic impact represented by differences in healthcare utilization.

11071714,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as abuse or neglect, is a powerful risk factor for
the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adulthood. Girls are more likely to experience multiple forms
of childhood adversity, and as adults, the number of women engaging in alcohol binge drinking has rapidly
increased in recent years, significantly narrowing the historical gender gap in alcohol drinking and AUD
diagnoses. Despite the abundant epidemiological evidence pointing to complex interactions between childhood
adversity, gender/biological sex, and alcohol use in adulthood, the neural mechanisms underlying sex
differences in the effects of early life stress (ELS) on AUD susceptibility remain mostly unknown.
Sensitivity to the motor effects of alcohol, which is known to be modulated by other forms of stress exposure, is
a potentially highly relevant phenotype influencing AUD susceptibility. Mechanistically, the bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis (BNST), a sexually dimorphic and neuropeptide-rich region in the extended amygdala, is
a promising mediator of ELS-enhanced alcohol sensitivity. Specifically, activation of corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the BNST is associated with increased stress and other AUD-associated
behaviors, including anxiety and alcohol binge drinking, suggesting they may also play a role in alcohol
sensitivity. However, it remains unknown exactly how release of the CRF neuropeptide from BNST neurons
relates to BNST neuronal activity and synaptic connectivity. Given the complexity of these distinct mechanisms
regulating neuronal activation, neuronal connectivity patterns, and neuromodulator release, I will dissect the
relative involvement of BNST-CRF neuronal activity, BNST-CRF structural connectivity, and BNST-CRF
neuropeptide signaling in mediating ELS-enhanced alcohol sensitivity. With the goal of defining the
mechanisms by which ELS-enhanced alcohol sensitivity contributes to AUD susceptibility, my aims will
use a combination of behavioral, chemogenetic, viral tracing, and fiber photometry approaches. In the proposed
studies, I will use an established, ethologically relevant model of ELS in mice to test the central
hypothesis that ELS-enhanced alcohol sensitivity is mediated through increased BNST-CRF neuronal
activity, circuit connectivity, and/or neuropeptide release in a sex-specific manner."

The age-related processes that contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, particularly in the prodromal
period, are incompletely understood. Age-related reduction in gut microbiome alpha-diversity is apparent in the
majority of older adults, and is suspected of contributing to brain changes, including the development of
neurodegenerative disease. Our team published the first comprehensive report describing differences in the gut
microbiome observed in AD dementia, including reduced diversity in gut microbiota and altered composition in
people with AD dementia compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, we found that differentially abundant
genera were associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD, even among individuals who were cognitively
unimpaired. Several studies in mouse models of AD indicate that gut microbiota play a role in the development
of AD neuropathology, however to date, the mechanisms underlying these effects are virtually unknown.
Recently it has also become clear that the innate immune response in AD plays a critical role in mediating the
pathology associated with AD; however the interplay between systemic changes and the innate immune
response in AD are not well understood, nor is it known how these factors impact the progression of AD
pathology. Our overarching goal is to determine the extent to which alterations in the composition of gut
microbiome exacerbate and/or accelerate the development of AD pathology. This proposal is based on the
central hypothesis that age-associated gut dysbiosis and inflammation weaken gut barrier function, which in turn
leads to the systemic dissemination of microbial components, driving an immune response and system wide
changes that worsen AD pathology. To test this hypothesis we propose to study well-characterized participants
enrolled in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center as well as conventional and gnotobiotic APPPS1
mice, to address the following specific aims: 1. Determine the longitudinal relationship between gut microbiome
(metagenome), gut inflammation and permeability, and the development of AD pathology in human participants,
and 2. Determine the effects of modifying gut permeability on AD pathology in mice. We expect that alterations
in gut microbiome composition and gut permeability exacerbate AD pathology in humans, and that impairment
of intestinal barrier function and increased gut permeability alters brain homeostasis and exacerbates AD
progression in mouse models of AD. Our research group has been working to determine the role of gut
microbiome in the development of AD pathology for the past 5 years, and we are perfectly poised to address the
proposed aims. We will leverage our expertise in clinical AD, neuroimmunology, and gut microbiology/gnotobiotic
mouse models to successfully carry out the proposed project. Completion of the proposed experiments is
expected to lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AD and related dementias."

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that establishes life-long infection in the
human host. The overarching objective of our work is to define critical virus-host interactions important for virus
replication and latency, which provide targets for antiviral strategies aimed at limiting viral pathogenesis. HCMV
encodes a single DNA polymerase (UL54). As herpesviruses encode their own DNA polymerase, it has been
broadly presumed that they do not require host polymerases for the replication of their genomes. However,
herpesvirus genomes are complex with high-GC content and repeat sequences that constrain the B-family
DNA polymerases, such as UL54. Through our collaborative effort, we demonstrated a striking role for
specialized host translesion polymerases (TLS pols) in HCMV genome replication and stability. TLS pols
function in lesion bypass at the replication fork or in single-stranded DNA gap filling or homology-directed
repair that occurs post-synthesis (behind the fork). TLS pols also maintain fragile site stability during
unperturbed DNA synthesis. TLS pols include the Y-family polymerases eta (η), iota (ι), kappa (κ) and Rev 1,
as well as the error-prone, B-family polymerase zeta (ζ). Strikingly, we found that Y-family TLS pols (η,ι,κ, and
Rev1) and pol ζ are important to maintain HCMV genome stability. Further, our results indicate that pols
η, ι, and κ generate single nucleotide variants across the viral genome. These findings indicate important roles
for host TLS pols in ensuring viral genomic integrity and potentially in generating viral genome diversity. We
also found that depletion of TLS pols differentially impacts viral genome synthesis and replication. Defining
how HCMV maintains genomic stability and the significance of host TLS pols and DNA damage repair (DDR)
pathways on the viral lifecycle is important for understanding mechanisms of virus replication and latency.
Further, exciting new data indicates a role for host TLS pols in the evolution of resistance to nucleoside
antiviral therapies, such as ganciclovir. We hypothesize that HCMV actively recruits TLS pols and coopts
corresponding DDR pathways to maintain genome integrity and regulate viral replication and latency. Aim 1 will
determine the mechanisms by which HCMV recruits host TLS pols and other DDR repair factors to viral
replication compartments and the subdomains in which they function. Aim 2 will define the mechanisms by
which host TLS pols and other DDR repair factors act on viral sequences to ensure genome stability and
contribute to antiviral resistance. Aim 3 will determine the significance of host DDR pathways to viral latency.
These aims are driven by our published work and exciting preliminary data identifying virus-host interactions
that control host TLS pols and DDR pathways. Our multi-PI collaborative work establishes the importance of
host TLS pols for the stability and diversity of viral genomes and would not be possible without the combined
expertise of Drs. Goodrum and Bosco. Further, this study offers the unique possibility of illuminating new
insights into the biology of TLS pols in human cells using the HCMV genome as a model system."

Though thought to serve many important functions in overall tendon function, including facilitating both healing
and adaptation to mechanical load, the true identity and function of the epitenon has remained elusive due to a
lack of genetic markers that specifically target epitenon cells. In preliminary studies, we identified a novel
population of GLAST-lineage (GLASTu') cells in the epitenon that contribute to both tendon healing following
acute injury and tendon adaptation in response to mechanical overload by differentiating into scleraxis (Scx)expressing
tenocytes. Identification of a genetic marker for epitenon cells as well as demonstration of their
capacity for tenogenic differentiation has opened an exciting new avenue of tendon research with the long-term
goal of understanding the role that epitenon cells play in regulating overall tendon homeostasis and to identify
ways to leverage epitenon cell behavior to improve tendon health. During the K99 phase of this award, we
established voluntary wheel running as a tool for modeling adaptive tendon growth in mice and generated
numerous sophisticated genetic mouse models to facilitate the study of how GLASTu"" epitenon progenitors and
Sex-expressing tenocytes coordinate to affect tissue-level adaptation. To further explore this relationship during
R00 phase of this award, the proposed studies build on our prior work to test the central hypothesis that GLAS Tu""
epitenon cells are an indispensable source of tenogenic progenitor cells for tendon adaptation and that signaling
between epitenon cells and tenocytes is critical for the tenogenic response of GLASTLic progenitors. Combining
genetic lineage tracing with integrated spatial/single-cell RNA-sequencing, we will create a comprehensive
spatial and temporal atlas that defines the pathways regulating the coordinated mechanoresponse of epitenon
cells, tenocytes, and GLASTu"" progenitor cells (Aim 1A), To mechanistically test the hypothesis that coordination
between epitenon cells and tenocytes is required for the proper tendon adaptive response to load, we will
inducibly deplete either epitenon cells or tenocytes prior to tendon load in complementary experiments (Aim 1 B)
and assess how disruption of GLASTu, epitenon cell/tenocyte communication affects the overall tendon adaptive
response. Collectively, these data will provide the first comprehensive characterization of epitenon cells and their
function in tendon biology."

Society at large is facing a global “dementia epidemic” that is predicted to intensify with the growing aging
population. Although there is currently no cure for this devastating and pervasive condition, one life experience
shown to protect against the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is that of bilingualism.
Nevertheless, findings regarding bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve are mixed. These mixed
findings may, in part, be attributed to variability in the characterization of the bilingual experience across distinct
sociocultural contexts in addition to the presence of potential confounding variables. Little attention has been
directed towards examining bilingualism factors (e.g., language dominance, proficiency, use and age of
acquisition) that may underly these findings. In addition, limited attention has been directed towards language-
prominent dementia syndromes, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Although speech and language
impairments are ubiquitous features of ADRD, in the case PPA these debilitating deficits manifest as initial,
predominant symptoms. Differential patterns of language decline have been observed in bilingual PPA, with
resilience of the first learned language and parallel decline reported in the literature. However, a nuanced account
establishing patterns of language decline across different linguistic domains has yet to be systematically
examined in PPA. In addition, although positive effects of speech-language intervention are now well
documented in monolingual speakers with PPA, there is a significant gap in the literature examining treatment
optimized for bilingual speakers with PPA. Moreover, the behavioral, neural and bilingual factors associated with
language re-learning have yet to be established in bilingual speakers with PPA. The overall aim of the proposed
research is to establish associations between bilingualism factors and the onset, decline, and treatment response
of Hispanic, bilinguals (Spanish-Catalan) with PPA. In Aim 1, we seek to identify bilingualism factors associated
with a later age of onset in Hispanics with each PPA variant. In Aim 2, we seek to identify the bilingualism factors
associated with differential patterns of language impairment in Hispanics with PPA using metrics derived from
connected speech. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the benefits of tailored speech-language intervention in the largest
behavioral rehabilitation study of bilingual Hispanics with PPA to-date. We will also identify the bilingualism
factors, pre-treatment cognitive-linguistic measures, and brain regions implicated in bilingualism that predict the
magnitude of within-language gains and cross-language transfer effects. In order to accomplish these aims, we
will enroll 90 Hispanic, bilinguals with PPA who will undergo behavioral assessment, MRI, and speech-language
treatment. This proposal will provide needed evidence regarding cognitive reserve and linguistic resilience by
leveraging a large bilingual PPA cohort via an established international collaboration. Outcomes will also provide
crucial knowledge regarding neural mechanisms of language re-learning and will address how specific bilingual
factors influence cognitive reserve and linguistic resilience in language-prominent dementia."
11083189,"We propose to develop as sustainable aging research infrastructure, a new and unique genetically
heterogeneous laboratory rat model that can be used to evaluate putative life- and health-extending
interventions. The rat has numerous advantages over the mouse for interventional aging research including more
human-like physiology and pathophysiology, more cognitive sophistication, and greater genetic diversity
compared with standard mouse strains. Inspired by the UM-HET3 mice used by the Interventions testing
program, our rat model (OKC-HETb/w) will also be populations of genetically heterogeneous F2 descendants of 4
divergent, inbred strains. A significant difference from the UM-HET3 mice, our breeding scheme takes advantage
of the rat’s substantial mitochondrial genomic diversity compared with the mouse to create a population half of
which carries the BN strain mitochondria (OKC-HETb), the other half carries the WKY strain mitochondria (OKC-
HETw). These mitochondrial genomes mimic great human mitochondrial diversity in that they differ at 95
nucleotides involving 11 of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, 5 tRNA’s and both ribosomal subunits. Our
preliminary data show that the OKC-HETb and OKC-HETw rats respond differently to exercise endurance, grip
strength, and responsiveness to 17α-estradiol. As a proof of principle, we will evaluate in the OKC-HETb/w rat an
anti-aging intervention (17α-estradiol) that was previously found to enhance the longevity of male mice only. An
intriguing outcome of our project will be to verify whether or not, this sex-specificity is also seen in our rat model.
In the R21 phase of this project we will produce the OKC-HETb/w rats and (1) characterize energetics-based
health assays at whole animal and cellular levels under standard and stressed (HFD) conditions in both sexes
in both mitochondrial genotypes, (2) determine the dose of 17α-estradiol that will yield blood levels comparable
to those found at effective life-extending doses in the ITP study and the short-term effects of 17α-estradiol on
metabolic parameters in diet-induced obese mice of both sexes, and (3) provide investigators with tissues as
well as young and old OKC-HETb/w. In the R33 phase, we will use the information gained in the R21 phase to:
(1) determine the effect of 17α-estradiol on the longevity and age-related pathology in both sexes and both
mitochondrial genotypes and (2) determine the long-term effects of 17α-estradiol on age-related changes in
metabolic and health parameters, again, in both sexes and both mitochondrial genotypes."

Most cellular behaviors and functions rely on cell signaling. A direct approach to detect this event is to
record cellular electrical potentials that are associated with various ionic kinetics during signal processing. It
has been shown that a wide range of high profile diseases, such as epilepsy, episodic ataxia,
Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's, may result from dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium
channels. Although qualitative knowledge of the motions of these ions has been well studied, a quantitative
understanding is still missing because of the lack of tools that would allow high-spatiotemporal-resolution
sampling of ion motions inside cells. My group is dedicated to developing a soft electronic interface for cells
and tissues. This synthetic electronic interface will have similar mechanical properties to the biology, and
can organically fuse with the target cells and tissues, which will not only result in higher signal to noise ratio
but also longer recording time than conventional rigid and bulky recording systems. This five-year project
aims to develop an innovative cellular interface that is composed of an array of highly sensitive three-
dimensional field effect transistor (FET)-based sensors on a stretchable substrate. We use this innovative
cellular interface to test the hypothesis that ionic kinetics, including the speeds of ionic diffusion through ion
channels in the cell membrane, ion drift driven by ion pumps, and inter-cellular signal propagation, entail
crucial quantitative information associated with disorders of electrogenic cells, such as neurons,
cardiomyocytes, and electrically excitable endocrine cells. The sensors can simultaneously record different
positions of a single cell or among different cells in a cellular network, thus enabling us to measure and
calculate the time- or speed-related kinetic factors of the ions (i.e., the time at which the ions move in or out of
the cell membrane and the speed at which they do, respectively). Also, using an FET design, we can amplify
the recorded signal directly at the targeting location, realizing as much as ten-fold signal amplification.
Furthermore, we can differentiate the specific ionic species that are actively functioning inside and outside
of the cells by coating the surfaces of the FET sensors with phospholipid bilayers that have the corresponding
ion channels, allowing the specific ions to permeate the cell membrane, which would result in a change in
electrical potential that could be recorded by the FET sensors. The information acquired will help gain
new insights in cellular communications, with profound implications for brain sciences, cardiac physiology, and
clinical practices."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant public health issue with substantial psychological and
economic impacts on individuals, families, and communities. A critical gap persists in understanding the
molecular underpinnings of alcohol addiction, particularly in the context of increasing youth binge drinking.
Current treatments are limited, highlighting the need for research into the molecular mechanisms of AUD,
including the role of epigenetic modifications following chronic alcohol exposure, such as those mediated by
acetate via ACSS2 (Mews et al., 2019). This study focuses on the transport pathways of alcohol-derived
acetate into the brain, investigating the role of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The differential
expression of MCT isoforms between neurons and astrocytes also suggests a complex, cell-type-specific role
in AUD, warranting further investigation. This supplementary grant proposal aims to elucidate the role of MCT4
in facilitating the entry of alcohol-derived acetate into the brain, thus contributing to alcohol-induced epigenetic
changes. This research is designed to build upon the foundational discoveries of Mews et al., exploring the
regulation of brain histone acetylation by acetate derived from alcohol metabolism in the liver and its transport
into hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. By exploring alcohol-derived acetate and its transport into neurons,
this research will operate within the scope of the parent grant and complement its objectives while exploring
distinct experimental aims. Additionally, this project will serve as a critical component of Naomi Kassahun’s
training in molecular techniques and independent research towards a F31 grant application, integrating with
her doctoral research objectives and enhancing her development as a future leader in addiction research. This
alignment ensures a comprehensive approach to both advancing AUD research and fostering significant

11083973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Evidence suggests that the prevalence of certain developmental disorders, specifically autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has increased sharply in recent decades.
Recent studies have shown a moderate heritability for neurodevelopmental delays (NDDs), suggesting a
nongenetic component contributing to its etiology. The estimated annual cost of environmentally mediated NDDs
in US children is $18.3 billion. Epidemiologic studies examined prenatal and early childhood exposure to air
pollutants and NDDs, with non-conclusive evidence on the effects of different pollutants, interactions, sensitive
windows of exposure and chemical components of PM2.5. In addition, the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in
these associations is complex. Our overarching goal is to comprehensively investigate the independent and joint
prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3, PM2.5 chemical components and interactions with
temperature on NDDs as well as effect modification by SES. The specific aims of this application are: 1) Quantify
the association prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5, NO2, O3, temperature and NDDs, 2) Examine the
association between prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5 chemical speciation and NDDs, and 3)
Examine pathways and synergistic effects, among environmental exposures and SES on NDDs. We have
established a birth cohort of more than 4 million pregnancies from two population-based databases—the
Medicaid Analytic eXtract and IBM MarketScan—that include rich information on location and individual-level
characteristics. By 8 years of age, 23.9% of publicly insured children and 11.0% of privately insured children
received a diagnosis of 1 or more NDDs. For all pollutants, PM2.5 chemical components and temperature, we
have validated highly resolved daily predictions for the entire continental US. The unique composition of these
two cohorts, allows us to determine the extent to which SES modifies these associations. For our analyses, we
will adjust for a wide range of individual-level characteristics and spatiotemporal covariates. We will estimate
hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals using cox regression, distributed-linear/non-linear lag models,
and we will examine effect modification by infant sex. We will use advanced statistical methods to estimate the
effects of mixtures. Our prior work and data support both the hypothesis for and the feasibility of the proposed
study. The proposed research is innovative because it will be the first study to: 1) investigate associations
between air pollutants, temperature and NDDs on a national scale; 2) use state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models
to assess individual exposures to PM2.5, NO2, O3 and temperature; 3) employ innovative resources of clinical data
by leveraging two large pregnancy cohorts. The proposed research is of great significance because it will guide
decisions and pollutant regulations to protect the health of pregnant women and children, inform heat wave
warning systems, potentially reducing rates of NDDs and subsequent social, financial, and public health burden."
11167961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goals of this proposal are to uncover how pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear speckles are controlled by
the kinase TAO2, and to determine why TAO2 is required for successful Influenza virus (IAV) replication.
Recent work has identified the understudied protein kinase TAO2 as a host factor essential for splicing and
speckle localization of the IAV M RNA. A pool of TAO2 localizes to nuclear speckles and its loss, by
chemical inhibition or protein depletion, alters nuclear speckle composition, splicing and export of IAV M
RNA, and therefore impairs IAV replication. Inhibition of TAO2 also disrupts splicing of a subset of host
mRNAs, without altering bulk host mRNA. These data uncover a new cellular activity for TAO2 and identify
inhibition of TAO2 as a potential approach for controlling IAV infection. Preliminary data suggest that TAO2
interacts with several splicing factors and other RNA binding proteins. The work outlined in this proposal
seeks a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear activities of TAO2 in human cells and the functional
consequence of these activities for host and viral RNA expression. Specifically, a three-pronged approach
will be taken to: (1) characterize functional TAO2 interaction partners and substrates of phosphorylation
amongst nuclear proteins and determine if IAV infection alters these interactions or if TAO2 interacts
directly with any IAV-encoded proteins; (2) define the role of TAO2 in maintaining the integrity of nuclear
speckles and (3) characterize the global impact of TAO2 on the human splicing machinery and the
consequence of this function for alternative splicing. These goals will be achieved through a combination
of genetic manipulation of cells, biochemistry, mass spectrometry and microscopy. Importantly, the
conclusions obtained from these studies will have implications for general mechanisms of RNA splicing
and nuclear speckle formation and function and will further inform the understanding of host requirements
and vulnerabilities for influenza infection."

The objective of this proposal is to create a novel ciliary stent integrated with wirelessly actuated artificial
cilia for treating cilia dysfunction in various diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
Significance: This work is motivated by the prevalence of Central Airway Obstruction (CAO) due to various lung
diseases especially COPD where 53% of the patients developing airway collapse and resulting in excessive
mucus accumulation even with an implanted airway stents. Our objective in this proposal is to create a novel
airway stent that provides the radical support in airway collapse, does not have the issue of tissue in-growth, and
provide the function of transporting mucus with artificial cilia. This approach is clinically innovative because it will
potentially overcome the limitation of existing airway stents by reducing the frequency of bronchoscope operations
and blind suction of conventional silicone airway stents, and reducing the risk of open-surgery due to tissue ingrowth
of conventional metal airway stents. Innovation: Technical innovation comes from 1) a novel artificial
cilia blanket design and fabrication which can transport mucus efficient by mimicking the non-reciprocal motion
and metachronal coordination of biological cilia, and 2) a novel magnetic actuation and control system which can
wirelessly actuate the artificial cilia safely with minimal invasion. Magnetically actuated cilia have been reported
for transporting liquids in microfluidics but has not been designed and integrated on airway stents for treatment
of COPD. Approach: This proposal proposes to create our airway stents with artificial cilia through three specific
aims. Aim 1 involves the design of the magnetically actuated artificial cilia, the integration of the artificial cilia on
existing meshed airway stents, and the magnetic actuation systems. Aim 2 focuses on validation experiments
including experiments of the airway stents with artificial cilia in phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and porcine lungs to
evaluate the mucus pumping performance and overall system functionality. These Aims will be carried out by
a multidisciplinary team of investigators combining expertise in lung surgery, mechanical design and control of
airway stents, and design and control of the stent delivery and remove tools using a flexible bronchoscope. The
goal of this R21 project will be the demonstration of accurate spatial deployment, efficient mucus transporting,
and an-trauma removal of the stent to enhance the treatment of COPD. We hypothesize this R21 project will bring
a potentially curative treatment for COPD to many more patients. Broad impact includes paving the way for an
innovative medical device with minimal invasion, long-term, and out-of-hospital treatment of cilia impairment due
to multiple diseases in multiple organs in the human body. Further research will be initiated on translating the stent
mechanism for various lung diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis and lung cancer. In the long term, this proposed
technology will have a giant potential to clinical trials for patients with cilia dysfunction in general."

Adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYA-HIV), especially minoritized individuals, face the highest
HIV incidence and poorest care outcomes among all age groups of people living with HIV (PWH) in the United
States. Mobility has emerged as a critical driver of these disparities, but research in the US context is limited.
The convergence of younger age and mobility poses a significant challenge to individual and public health
efforts to address care inequities and end the HIV epidemic in the US. Our preliminary work in Tennessee,
which includes Memphis/Shelby County, an End-the-Epidemic priority region, found that PWH change
addresses nearly four times more often than the general population, with higher frequency among AYA-HIV.
Mobile PWH were more likely to be lost from care, and mobility patterns followed recurring spatial pathways
suggesting structural determinants. Our central hypothesis is that social and structural determinants of health
(SSDOH) are associated with distinct mobility phenotypes among AYA-HIV that differentially impact HIV care
outcomes. To build on these critical findings and test this hypothesis, our experienced, multidisciplinary team
will assemble a prospective cohort of 300 AYA-HIV in Tennessee. We will use a mixed-methods approach
integrating robust individual- and population-level geospatial analyses to accomplish three Aims: 1) Determine
patterns of personal mobility and multilevel factors contributing to mobility among AYA-HIV in TN; 2) Evaluate
how personal mobility impacts HIV care outcomes among AYA-HIV; 3) Assess the relationship between
SSDOH on the prevalence and patterns of residential mobility among all AYA-HIV in TN and the role of
mobility as a mediator of the relationship between SSDOH and HIV care outcomes (LTFU, retention and viral
suppression). For Aims 1 and 2, we will a) passively monitor personal mobility of cohort members over 18
months via a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled mobile phone application, b) integrate geospatial
analyses with data-informed in-depth interviews (IDIs) with AYA-HIV exhibiting potentially distinct mobility
patterns (n≤30 every 6 months) to describe mobility phenotypes, and c) utilize qualitative and statistical
methods to describe mobility phenotypes, elucidate factors driving personal mobility and assess the
relationship between mobility phenotypes and HIV care outcomes. For Aim 3, we will use population-level
geospatial methods combined with HIV surveillance and census data from the TN Department of Health to
explore neighborhood-level SSDOH as drivers of residential mobility, and the relationship between mobility and
HIV care outcomes for all AYA-HIV in the state. This pioneering study will provide a rigorous, multilevel
understanding of mobility among AYA-HIV in the US. By elucidating how social and structural factors drive
mobility and its downstream impact on health, we will lay the foundation for developing tailored interventions to
address this critical barrier to ending the HIV epidemic, with implications for other chronic conditions."

While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the
human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior
remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities,
spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of
present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated
Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to

we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively-

the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop
scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in
establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single-
cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical
challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological
systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to
encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in

Plasmodium falciparum strains with resistance to first-line artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) threaten
malaria control and elimination efforts across Africa, where 95% of the world's malaria cases and deaths occur.
Artemisinin resistance is mediated by mutations in the pfkelch13 (K13) gene that have only recently impacted
the region. Concerning K13 mutations have now been confirmed in Africa, including emergence and expansion
of the candidate artemisinin-resistance K13 R622I mutation in the Horn of Africa (HoA). Increasing reports from
the HoA by us and others also indicate that “diagnosis resistant” strains that escape detection by widely used
rapid diagnostic tests due to deletions of the histidine-rich protein 2/3 (pfhrp2/3) genes are now established
across the region. The dual emergence of drug and diagnostic resistance mutations threatens frontline test-
and-treat strategies and may have profound impacts on malaria control. Improved understanding of the
determinants of infection by R622I parasites is needed to inform clinical practice and policy decisions. In
collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, the technical arm of the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of
Health, and leading academic partners, we will conduct surveys of people presenting to health facilities with
falciparum malaria across Ethiopia and achieve the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate risk factors for
infection by artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum, including whether the presence or absence of pfhrp2/3
deletions impacts risk. We will develop a clinical risk tool to help predict who may be infected by an artemisinin-
resistant parasite. Such a tool could be used for targeted implementation of antimalarial treatment options
designed to overcome resistance and prevent its spread, such as triple ACT that employs two partner drugs
alongside an artemisinin derivative. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of K13 R622I on drug resistance
and parasite fitness in pfhrp2/3-deleted and intact parasites. In Aim 3, we will develop a predictive model of the
future spread of artemisinin resistance within and out of the HoA, focusing first on development of data/models
of human and parasite migration and then integrating in vivo data from Aim 1 and in vitro data from Aim 2.
Together, these Aims will improve our understanding of the epidemiology and drivers of emerging artemisinin
resistance in the HoA and produce tools that can be used by malaria programs to identify, predict, and respond
to emerging drug-resistant strains in Africa."

In the U.S., only a minority of those with psychotic disorders receive appropriate care within the first six months during which treatment has its greatest impact. Timely care is particularly rare in rural communities like Maine’s. One potential strategy for addressing the rate-limiting factor of rapid detection in Maine’s rural communities is to collaborate with the relatively high number of rural primary care practices with integrated mental healthcare. Whereas regular screening through primary care has enabled the rapid detection and treatment of many serious physical and even mental health conditions, universal screening for psychosis, a key marker of the most serious mental health concerns, awaits a suitable screening tool and protocol. This proposal aims to develop and collect initial reliability and validity data on two screening tools that show promise for predicting psychosis in adolescent and young adult primary care patients. The first tool will be a short self-report screen selected from a large pool of items written at a 5th grade reading level and pretested for understanding by adolescents and young adults. The second will be developed from the automated analysis of speech connectedness as captured in recorded speech during a standardized speech protocol, a tool which might be able to identify youth for whom self-report is either infeasible or unreliable. We will evaluate the performance of these tools in a primary care sample aged 12-25 to capture both early and peak psychosis onsets. We will evaluate the test-retest agreement of tool scores measured three days apart. We will use the Mini Structured Interview of Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (Mini SIPS) to estimate the tool’s criterion validity in identifying psychotic spectrum symptoms. Using medical record diagnoses and problem lists, we will explore the degree to which each tool identifies individuals with previously unidentified psychotic spectrum symptoms. To evaluate psychometrics by developmental stage, we will recruit 60 adolescents ages 12-17 and 60 young adults ages 18-25. The ultimate goal of this project is to collect preliminary data necessary for designing a large longitudinal predictive validity study in which we can also test measurement invariance related to important sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual data. With these data on predictive validity and measurement invariance, we expect to be able to embed one or more psychosis screening tools into the electronic health record, a critical step for implementing universal screening. We can then test whether screening plus triage and engagement in the primary care setting (e.g., the SEE ME model) can reliably and accurately identify more youth in time to improve real life outcomes for rural youth at highest risk for serious mental health challenges. This two year proposal will establish a committee of stakeholders involved in rural mental health and primary care to advise the study implementation, interpretation of findings, and to guide the design and implementation of early intervention in psychosis within rural Maine communities."

10887727,"Abstract
A long-term goal of my research is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the computational principles,
anatomical substrates, and neural mechanisms of sensorimotor function. Our research is guided by the concept
of internal models, which provides a unified computational framework for investigating the neural basis of
sensorimotor coordination, integration, and learning. Currently, we do not have a comprehensive understanding
of how the brain instantiates internal models. Our broad research objective in to elucidate the functional role of
the ascending cerebello-thalamocortical (Cb-Th-Ctx) and basal ganglia-thalamocortical (Bg-Th-Ctx) pathways
in forming, updating, and using internal models. We will tackle this problem in the nonhuman primate model
using a multidisciplinary and cutting-edge approach that leverages (1) a sensorimotor task with suitable variants
for investigating the neural basis of sensorimotor coordination, integration, and learning, (2) large-scale multi-
region electrophysiology techniques to characterize neural signals with high spatiotemporal resolution across
entire subcortico-cortical pathways, and (3) a mathematically rigorous framework to integrate knowledge across
scales (cells, circuits, areas) and disciplines (systems, computational), and link computational concepts (e.g.,
internal models) to directly measurable neurobiological variables (e.g., firing rates). In the next decade, we will
use this integrative approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of how Cb-Th-Ctx and Bg-Th-Ctx pathways
establish internal models and support adaptive sensorimotor behaviors."
11170192,"ABSTRACT
The lymphatic vasculature is essential for organogenesis and dietary fat absorption and the intestinal villus plays
the leading role in this process. However, the developmental programs governing the formation and organ-level
role of villus lacteals, specialized lymphatic vessels responsible for lipid absorption, remain poorly understood.
We recently discovered that the master left-right transcription factor Pitx2 governs lacteal function through a
non-cell autonomous pathway involving the smooth muscle (SM). Pitx2-derived SM cells secrete growth factors
to guide lymphatic development, forming the muscular-lacteal complex that is essential for lipid transport and
villus maintenance. Pitx2 mutant mice develop abnormal SM and lacteals, and surprisingly shunt dietary lipids
into villus blood capillaries of the portal circulation, the major blood supply to the liver. This causes fatty liver
disease in Pitx2 mutants, the most common human liver disorder. Compared to the villus epithelium, research
on the mesenchyme is scarce, and we lack a sufficient understanding of villus SM origin, assembly alongside
lacteals, self-repair, and how villus SM dysfunction is linked to abnormal fat trafficking. Our research aims to
address these critical gaps in understanding. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how Pitx2 patterns the villus SM
program by studying a fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and its effectors as a potential mechanism. We will
test the hypothesis that intestinal myofibroblasts are the major source of renewal of villus SM crucial to villus
maintenance and repair. In Aim 2, we will define the role of Notch receptor-ligand signaling in SM development,
assembly, and physiology. The focus is on understanding the expression and function of Notch3 and Jag1 in the
villus vasculature and how they mediate cellular interactions between the endothelial and mesenchymal cells.
In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism of gut-derived fatty liver disease in Pitx2 deficient mice. We aim to
understand how lipids gain access to the portal vein in Pitx2 mutants. The potential role of Pitx2 in governing
blood endothelial cell permeability and its contribution to fatty liver disease in mutant mice will also be explored.
This research combines our demonstrated strengths in single-cell analysis, quantitative lineage tracing,
functional assays, imaging, genetic manipulation, and targeted interventions. At the completion of these aims,
our research will uncover how the muscular-lacteal complex is built and repaired through the complex
intercellular interactions within the intestinal villus, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions
targeting lymphatic-related metabolic disorders."
11170240,"A fundamental question in organ formation is how the constituent tissues achieve their correct sizes and
cytoarchitectures. Defects in a single tissue can affect the formation of an entire organ and a classic
example of this is the eye, where disruptions in retinal histogenesis can cause microphthalmia, a severe
ocular anomaly characterized by small, poorly formed eyes and congenital blindness. Mutations in the
Visual System Homeobox 2 (Vsx2) gene cause microphthalmia. A definitive marker of retinal
specification, Vsx2 functions in retinal progenitor cells to define tissue identity. Concurrently, Vsx2 is
required for progenitor proliferation and several aspects of the neurogenic program including the timing
of neurogenesis onset (neurogenic timing), and the fate specification of bipolar cells. Two gaps in our
understanding are the mechanistic interconnectedness of the progenitor properties regulated by Vsx2
and whether progenitors change in how they utilize Vsx2 over the course of histogenesis. To address
these gaps, we generated two new Vsx2 alleles in mice, one with a knock-in reporter/knock-out
configuration and the other for conditional gene inactivation. In the first two aims, we will characterize the
retinal phenotypes of these mutant alleles and determine how they compare to phenotypes caused by a
natural null allele and two missense alleles that correspond to disease-causing mutations in humans.
Conditional gene inactivation will be done with tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox recombination to determine
the temporal windows of Vsx2 utilization in progenitors and test the hypothesis that Vsx2’s control of
retinal identity, neurogenic timing, and proliferation are separable. We also predict that additional roles in
the balanced production of cells in each retinal cell class (neurogenic output) will be unmasked by
temporal inactivation after the start of neurogenesis. In the third aim, we test the hypothesis that retinal
identity control shifts from a Vsx2-dependent to independent state that is epigenetically defined for some
of the earlier targets. In the fourth aim, we will incorporate an ex vivo culture paradigm to test candidate
genes identified in the previous aims for their functional significance in promoting or interfering with
retinal development. Completion of these studies will provide new insights into how Vsx2 orchestrates
retinal progenitor properties and how retinal progenitors drive retinal histogenesis, an essential
component of eye organogenesis."
11069193,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek five years of training and protected time to
enable and expand the work of a newly established independent investigator. The candidate’s laboratory, the
Access to Behavioral Health for All (ABHA) Lab, is supported by a recent R01 (Parent Study; DA037276;
March 2020-2025) that will evaluate the efficacy of a novel digital therapeutic (DTx) for smoking cessation
tailored to patients with serious mental illness. The candidate’s research to date has focused on the
development of DTx using user-centered design research, and the subsequent testing of their efficacy using
clinical trials methodology. However, efficacy trials do not always translate into real-world practice, nor are
tested treatments always adopted by racial and ethnic minorities. This gap is well documented in the
implementation science literature. A recent longitudinal epidemiological survey (N=40,181) showed that while
the smoking rates of Non-Hispanic Whites with serious psychological distress significantly declined over the
last decade, no significant declines occurred among their Black and Latino counterparts. This data accentuates
the critical need to develop DTx that have an equitable population health impact. Therefore, the five years of
protected time provided by this Independent Scientist Award will fundamentally enhance the candidate’s
current program of research by providing formal training and contact with expert collaborators in the following
key areas: (1) health equity and participatory research, (2) implementation science, and (3) DTx’s oversight,
marketing, and dissemination. The award will also support a convergent mixed-methods Ancillary Study based
on the RE-AIM framework, that will examine health equity and implementation science outcomes in the Parent
Study. This Independent Scientist Award will provide the necessary research experience and network of
collaborators to scale up widespread dissemination of DTx addressing the systemic challenges of racial/ethnic
minorities with tobacco use disorder and serious mental illness. Along with the planned collaborations with
national experts in each of the key training domains, this award will establish the conditions to pursue and
maintain this program of research in the future by protecting the candidate’s time from clinical responsibilities.
In the short term, the award will generate preliminary data to inform the design of a large pragmatic trial that
will evaluate equitable dissemination of DTx for smoking cessation in patients with serious mental illness. In
the long term the award will generate a new body of research rigorously examining racial and ethnic inequities
in DTx for addiction treatment, a new model for the equitable implementation and technology transfer of DTx
among racial/ethnic minorities, and mentoring opportunities for diverse junior scientists that will extend the
impact of this work beyond the candidate’s own program of research."
11082544,"Project Summary/Abstract: This supplement to AG072587 seeks funding for an under-represented
minority (URM) graduate student researcher (GSR) to perform additional studies directed toward Aim 1 of the
parent grant and to receive training and mentorship in support of her path to becoming a Ph.D. biomedical
research scientist.
 The parent grant seeks to understand the aggregation of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) to form toxic oligomers
in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through the structural, biophysical, and biological profiling of a diverse group of Aβ
oligomer models and correlation of these models with biogenic Aβ oligomers. My laboratory has developed an
approach to create structurally defined Aβ oligomer models composed of peptide fragments from Aβ constrained
into a β-hairpin. We characterize these oligomer models by X-ray crystallography and then introduce chemical
crosslinks to create covalently stabilized Aβ oligomer models that mimic the crystallographic oligomers. Studying
the crosslinked oligomers then allows detailed correlation between oligomer structure and biophysical and
biological properties.
 Aim 1 of AG072587 seeks to characterize the relationship between Aβ oligomer model structure, assembly,
and biology. In this Aim, we characterize how our Aβ oligomer models interact with neurons and other brain cell
types to shed light on the relationship between Aβ oligomer structure and cellular events that occur in AD. We
also elucidate the relationship between the structures of our Aβ oligomer models and biogenic Aβ oligomers, by
generating polyclonal antibodies against the Aβ oligomer models and then examining the immunoreactivity of
these antibodies with brain protein extract and brain slices from 5XFAD mice.
 Aim 2 of AG072587 seeks to discover new Aβ oligomer models, by creating new Aβ β-hairpin peptides that
contain more of the Aβ peptide sequence and alternate β-strand alignments. We are creating new crosslinked
Aβ oligomer models by identifying key contacts in existing and newly discovered Aβ oligomer models and then
engineering in disulfide bonds to stabilize the oligomers. To characterize the structures and oligomerization
properties of the new Aβ oligomer models that we generate, we are using X-ray crystallography and a variety of
other biophysical experiments. We then characterize biological and immunological properties of these new Aβ
oligomer models as outlined in Aim 1.
 Under the support of the supplement, the URM GSR will develop an approach to allow the creation of mouse
polyclonal antibodies against our Aβ oligomer models in order to amplify the impact of Aim 1, which currently
only uses rabbit polyclonal antibodies. By expanding Aim 1 to mouse polyclonal antibodies, we will lay the
groundwork for creating mouse monoclonal antibodies and their investigation as potential therapies in mouse
models for Alzheimer’s disease. The URM GSR plans to investigate this in a subsequent F31 diversity fellowship."

The goal of this proposal is to implement a novel Research Training in Sensorimotor Neurorehabilitation
program to prepare the next generation of scientists that can address the growing need for neuroscience-
based rehabilitation solutions. Northwestern University has a long and recognized history in the study of motor
control, motor disability and recovery, and neural reorganization; and in training the next generation of
movement and rehabilitation scientists (MRS) through the Northwestern University Interdepartmental
Neuroscience Program (NUIN) PhD program since 2009, with demonstrated success reflected in more than
20 graduates currently leading successful research careers in academia and industry. The proposed program
is built on this research and training record with the mission to train students with clinical and life/applied
science backgrounds and post-doctoral fellows with clinical backgrounds to become rehabilitation scientists in
basic, translational or clinical research. These scientists will have the ability to integrate knowledge from the
various disciplines involved in sensorimotor neurorehabilitation, including neuroscience, engineering and
clinical sciences. The training program will focus on four training goals: 1) to provide a thorough grounding in
the basic neurobiology of sensorimotor function and control, including translation of insights between animal
and human research models; 2) to learn fundamental engineering experimental methods for measurement
and analysis of neuronal and musculoskeletal sensory and motor function; 3) to facilitate knowledge sharing
in the clinical management of individuals with movement disorders between the post-doctoral and pre-doctoral
trainees; and 4) to provide professional development training to support future rehabilitation research career
success. The unique structure of the program, couples training of post-doctoral trainees with clinical expertise
with pre-doctoral trainees focusing on neuroscience. The program is the first of its kind to provide post-doctoral
research training of Doctors of Physical Therapy (DPT), an untapped cohort of prospective scientists that has
emerged in the contemporary age of science-based medicine and evidence-based practice. These DPT
candidates for post-doctoral slots will be drawn from research intensive Physical Therapy Programs across
the United States. Pre-doctoral trainees will be drawn from the NUIN-MRS program. The translational
interdisciplinary nature of the program will allow close interaction between clinical investigators and basic and
applied sciences investigators, providing a unique opportunity for training in translational research. We intend
to support a total of 12 pre-doctoral trainees and 5 post-doctoral trainees with NIH funding for up to two years
each. Additional institutional support is available in the form of tuition and stipend supplements for trainees and
diversity fellowships to support diversity recruiting efforts."
11085596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the tremendous success of the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the persistence of HIV
reservoirs remains as the major obstacle to achieve HIV cure in infants. Current strategies mainly focus on the
peripheral reservoirs; however, their efficacy is limited in the central nerve system (CNS) due to its unique
anatomy. Extensive studies indicate that replication-competent reservoirs persist in the CNS under cART,
causing neurological disorders in 15-55% of HIV+ individuals on cART. This issue is particularly concerning for
infants, whose brains still grow and develop, leading to numerous neurodevelopment consequences and
neurologic diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective treatment to suppress CNS infection in
infants. One promising strategy is the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) directed to HIV-1, which
have demonstrated potential in both viral suppression and reservoir clearance in animal models and clinical trials.
However, the use of bNAbs for the CNS reservoirs is confounded by poor penetration of the blood brain barrier
(BBB). Typically, antibody concentrations in the CNS are extremely low, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels at
~0.1% of those in blood. Our team has developed a novel nanotechnology, which we term nanocapsules, to
encapsulate bNAb molecules within polymer shells, of which the surface contains abundant choline analogues.
Such nanocapsules can effectively deliver bNAbs into the CNS by binding to the choline transporter on the BBB
upon systemic administration, showing promising results in suppressing the virus in the CNS of non-human
primate (NHP) infants.
 Our understanding of CNS infections and associated neuroinflammation during early infection and early
treatment is still limited. Recent advances in molecular biology, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics have
enabled our team to develop methods to track infected cell clones with viral integration sites, revealing the impact
of therapy on clonally expanded virus-infected cells. We are also exploring the use of a library of barcoded
viruses for population-level analysis of infection in latent reservoirs and following HIV rebound.
 In this proposed study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of bNAbs in nanocapsules against CNS infections
and reservoirs, both with and without cART. The success of this study will shed light on the mechanisms
underlying CNS infections in infants and demonstrate the effectiveness of bNAbs with improved CNS delivery in
suppressing CNS and deep tissue infections and reservoirs. The findings could lead to interventions that can be
initiated within the first few weeks of infection, a critical period associated with reduced mortality and slower HIV
progression in infants."
11071792,"Fibrosis, which is the pathologic accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), is one of the
main traits of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and many other muscle pathologies.
Fibrotic ECM differs from healthy ECM in its structural properties, specifically density,
orientation, and cross-linking, often which resulting in a stiffer ECM compared to healthy
muscle. Excessive stiffness of muscle the cause of muscle contractures that are common
in DMD and other neuromuscular disorders. Similarly, we are also interested in the
collagen architecture and structural differences between fibrotic muscle and healthy
muscle. They hypothesis is that these aspects of collagen architecture are disrupted in
fibrosis and responsible for the increase in stiffness, rather than simply the excess
collagen present. The parent R01 investigates how ECM architecture is organized by
FAPs and also directs FAP fate. Aim 3 of the parents R01 investigates how ECM
architecture influences muscle passive mechanical stiffness in coordination with
microdystrophin gene therapy. However, many aspects of ECM architecture may be
dynamically altered with muscle stretch. As in tendon, we would predict that as tissue
undergoes stretch the collagen fibers would align along the direction of stretch and once
straightened contribute largely to passive force. However, integrated muscle mechanics
with detailed muscle architecture that is necessary to understand how dynamic changes
in muscle architecture dictate mechanical properties has not been demonstrated
previously.
This supplement would address that need by leveraging Gabriel’s technical expertise
and equipment available to design a system that is capable of simultaneously measuring
muscle mechanics while imaging muscle ECM architecture. This is an extension of the
parent R01 through the additional of this technical capability, which would allow
investigation of how deformable the ECM architecture is in the fibrotic condition of
muscular dystrophy along with the extent to which microdystrophin gene therapy
recovers matrix dynamic changes. The primary component of ECM architecture that is
anticipated to change with stretch would be collagen alignment and straightness,
however, the level of interactions and fiber diameter may also dynamically shift. The
overall hypothesis is that collagen architecture is dynamically shifted by muscle stretch,
but that these shifts are decreased in dystrophic muscle, and recovered with early
treatment of microdystrophin gene therapy."
11081879,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the subcellular site of secretory and membrane protein synthesis
and performs critical functions in secretory/membrane protein biogenesis and cellular proteostasis. In addition
its established role in secretory/membrane protein synthesis, recent studies examining the mRNA
transcriptomes of cytosolic and ER-bound ribosomes reveal that cytosolic protein transcripts are broadly
represented on the ER, with ribosome footprinting analyses demonstrating translation of cytosolic protein
mRNAs on ER-associated ribosomes. These findings identify an unexpected mRNA transcriptome-wide
function for the ER in proteome expression and reopen fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms
regulating mRNA localization and translation on the ER. Principally, where current models posit that mRNA
localization to the ER is co-translational and signal sequence-dependent, the abundant presence and
translation of cytosolic protein mRNAs on the ER indicates that either alternative and/or multiple pathways
mediate mRNA localization to the ER. As well, and although SRP pathway function in protein translocation is
well established, the question of SRP pathway function in mRNA localization to the ER remains largely
unexplored. Also of significance, the recent findings that a number of translocon-associated proteins, including
Sec61α,β, TRAPα, ribophorin I, and p180, are mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) suggest previously
unappreciated roles for ER resident RBPs in the biology of RNA localization and translation on the ER.
 This proposal merges three primary research themes of our laboratory; SRP pathway function in mRNA
and ribosome localization to the ER; ii) ER-localized translation initiation as a mechanism of localized protein
synthesis, and iii) RNA binding protein function in RNA localization and translational regulation, to address new
questions regarding cellular mechanisms of mRNA and ribosome localization to the ER. Building on the past
decade and a half of our research into RNA localization and translational regulation on the ER, including
founding evidence identifying an mRNA transcriptome-wide role for the ER in cellular proteome expression, the
proposed research will utilize mammalian tissue culture cell systems, gene editing and silencing approaches,
RNA-seq and Ribo-seq transcriptome analyses, HITS-CLiP and PAR-CLIP studies of ER RNA binding proteins
and their RNA interactomes, and biochemical analyses of the subcellular organization of the translation
machinery, to obtain new insights into the cellular organization and regulation of proteome expression. This
research is expected to advance understanding into the systems and pathways governing post-transcriptional
gene expression in the cell. In emphasizing in vivo analyses and native biosynthetic approaches to the study of
RNA and ribosome trafficking dynamics, this research is significant in its efforts to rigorously test existing
paradigms and advance understanding of cellular mechanisms of localized protein synthesis."
11071402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black women have the highest breast cancer death rates among all racial and ethnic groups, with a 40%
higher mortality compared to White women. The burden of breast cancer has surged in the US and in countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean. One-third of South Florida's Black population identifies as Haitian and/or
Afro-Caribbean. Previous studies have shown that Haitian women diagnosed with breast cancer in Haiti fare
significantly worse than Haitian immigrants in Miami, marked by advanced stage and younger age diagnosis,
more ER-negative tumors, and limited access to vital treatments. These findings underscore the significance of
healthcare access and treatment modalities, yet the differences in age and types of tumors suggest potentially
distinct disease pathways as a driver. This raises the question as to whether there are short-term effects of
immigration on breast cancer incidence and biology amongst Haitian women with breast cancer in Haiti and in
Miami. In this proposal, I aim to leverage existing methylation data on the saliva and tumors of Haitians with
breast cancer living in Haiti, living in the US, and of US-born Black women living in the US, to evaluate the
effects of immigration on their methylation profile and subsequent tumor characteristics. Additionally, in our
cohorts of Black women with breast cancer we observe survival disparities between the Afro-Caribbean and
US-born groups. Preliminary analysis of breast cancer outcomes amongst Black patients at the University of
Miami showed that Haitian patients had worse overall survival compared to other Caribbean countries. We
observed similar poor outcomes for USB women compared to other Caribbean immigrants. Haitian immigrants,
as a triple minority group—Black, foreign-born, often speaking Haitian Creole—face unique challenges that
may lead to higher levels of stress and discrimination compared to other Black immigrant groups. In this
proposal, I will leverage access to the African Cancer Genome Registry to assess the association between
perceived stress and discrimination and aggressive tumor characteristics (receptor status, advanced disease)
amongst Black immigrant women in Miami, with country of birth and language as mediators. This study will
uncover the intricate layers of stress and biologic influences (output as epigenetic) shaping the survival odds of
Haitian immigrant women with breast cancer, highlighting their unique challenges within the broader landscape
of Black immigrant health disparities. The interdisciplinary nature of this study will allow me to gain essential
skills for examining health disparities through an intersectional lens, as articulated by the NIMHD research
frameworks."
11082557,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prenatal period is a sensitive and critical time for brain development characterized by waves of neurogenesis,
neuronal migration, and formation of neural networks. In the first and second trimester, microglia are the
dominant immune cells of the brain and participate in a variety of processes essential to brain development,
including secreting neurotropic factors and engulfing apoptotic neural progenitor cells. Fetal microglia
dysfunction can lead to aberrant cortical lamination, resulting in an increased risk of brain pathology. We have
identified numerous ligand-receptor pairs involved in microglia-to-cortex and cortex-to-microglia signaling
predicted to contribute to human fetal microglia function and fetal brain development. We observe concordant
expression of these ligand-receptors pairs in cerebral organoids (COs) and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
microglia with our human fetal data. COs can model early human brain development, but current models lack
the immune component of the brain. Our data suggest that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia co-
cultured with COs (oMGs) capture significant phenotypic characteristics of human fetal microglia. Thus, a
systematic analysis of neural maturation following integration of microglia into COs is the first step in using this
model system to interrogate the molecular mechanisms underlying how neuron-microglia interactions establish
early brain circuitry. This proposal aims to use COs and oMGs to assess how brain environment signals and
corresponding transcription factors contribute to fetal microglia behavior and microglial interaction with neurons
in early fetal development. In Aim 1, completed in the K99 phase, I will test the hypothesis that integration of
microglia into COs results in enhanced neural maturation. Additionally, I will test how perturbation of homeostatic
brain environment signaling in microglia results in microglia dysfunction and altered neuronal subpopulations. In
Aim 2, I will identify transcription factor networks underlying human and mouse microglia behavior throughout
development, at homeostasis and after an inflammatory insult. The goal for Aim 2 is to uncover species-
conserved mechanisms in microglia responses to inflammation for improved therapeutic targeting and murine
modeling and to discover potential human-specific risk factors for disease. Additionally, I will test the hypothesis
that microglial developmental transcriptional factors are re-wired following an inflammatory insult, leading to long-
lasting changes in microglia behavior and disruption of brain circuitry. Studies in Aim 2 will be completed in the
independent phase. My long-term goal is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal-microglia
communication in health and disease as an independent investigator. I have assembled a diverse group of highly
skilled mentors who will ensure that I receive extensive training in neurodevelopment and assessment of neural
circuits. My training will be further enhanced by the unique scientific environment of the UCSD research
community, which is geared towards the development and usage of cutting-edge technology and analytic
methods to assess cellular heterogeneity and dynamic cell-cell interactions in the brain."

 I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases & International Medicine at the University
of Minnesota. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in conducting clinical
trials with nested translational immunology research to further the management of AIDS-related opportunistic
infections of the central nervous system. I am particularly interested in developing the skillset, competence,
and cultural rapport to conduct ethically-sound trials in resource-limited settings in Africa, where the burden of
HIV/AIDS-related CNS infections disproportionately impacts the population.
 Training: This K23 award will provide the mentoring, didactics, and hands-on training to establish an
independent research career. With the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team with expertise in international
clinical trials and immunology involving HIV-related opportunistic neuroinfections, I will: 1) Improve my
knowledge of biostatistical design and analysis, 2) Acquire experience on human immunology principles and
data interpretation to facilitate effective translational research collaborations, and 3) Gain robust education and
mentorship in clinical trial design and execution, particularly as it pertains to infectious diseases in Africa.
 Research: CMV viremia is independently associated with mortality in persons with advanced HIV disease;
however, no recommendations exist for the treatment or prevention of CMV viremia alone. My published data
demonstrated CMV viremia increased the mortality hazard by 3-fold in a cohort with first-episode cryptococcal
meningitis. I hypothesize that CMV viremia exerts a mortality risk that is (1) time-dependent, and (2) associated
with impairment of the host Th1 immune response (e.g. interferon-gamma [IFN-] response). My K23 objective
is to build the skills and preliminary data necessary to design a future randomized clinical trial to test if anti-
CMV therapy might mitigate excess mortality. My K23 Specific Aims are:
 1) Determine if CMV viremia is a time-dependent risk factor for 18-week mortality among Ugandans with
 advanced HIV disease and concomitant cryptococcal meningitis; and
 2) Determine if host Th1 responses are impaired in persons with active CMV viremia compared to CMV non-
 viremic persons among those with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis.
 Deliverables: This study will provide key missing clinical trial design parameters, such as the optimal duration
of an anti-CMV intervention (i.e. informed by CMV viremia duration/persistence and time-dependent mortality
risk) and the appropriate risk criteria for enrollment (i.e. any baseline CMV viremia vs CD4-predicted
cumulative exposure). Further, identifying a plausible immune mechanism (e.g. impaired Th1 responses)
opens the door for improved risk stratification and for future targeted immunomodulatory clinical trials (e.g.
subcutaneous IFN-). A future randomized trial best determines if CMV viremia is a cause of excess mortality."

WINCS International LLC, in partnership with Mayo Clinic, proposes to develop and demonstrate a highly
innovative next-generation clinical instrument together with custom user-friendly display and analysis software.
For the first time, the Multifunctional Apparatus for Voltammetry, Electrophysiology, and Neuromodulation
(MAVEN) will offer wireless voltammetric sensing of multiple neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, and
adenosine) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes. MAVEN can be applied to a broad range of clinical neuroscience
research subjects involving brain neurosurgeries. Alongside these multiple neurochemical sensing capabilities,
the device will be capable of near-simultaneous electrophysiological (e.g., action and local field potentials)
recordings. The main innovation of the MAVEN system is to include state-of-the-art voltammetric techniques to
quantitatively measure both phasic (stimulation-induced) and tonic (resting) concentration levels of
neurochemicals in real-time and near-simultaneously with other recording modalities. This capability is
currently unavailable in clinical neuroscience research. In addition, multiple cyclic square wave voltammetry
(MCSWV) will enable second-to-second quantitative measurements of tonic extracellular levels of dopamine
and serotonin with exceptional spatial resolution, sensitivity, specificity, and minimal tissue disturbance. This
proposal employs our unique combined expertise in neuroscience, electrochemistry, engineering, and software
development to validate this novel clinical research instrument in preparation for its use during intraoperative
clinical neurosurgeries. Also, combining electrophysiology and electrochemical technologies would enable
investigators to probe unexplored links between the abnormal activity of neural elements and the
dopaminergic, serotonergic, purinergic (adenosine) dynamics associated with neuropsychopathologies, such
as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and epilepsy. Our large
animal model (swine) studies emulating existing human intraoperative neurosurgical procedures will provide
essential information to guide and inform the finalization of the MAVEN design for use by the clinical
neuroscience community in future IDE-enabled mechanistic clinical studies.
Our proposal seeks to (1) finalize the development of MAVEN, together with a sophisticated user-friendly
software interface that (2) meets device manufacturing processes, regulatory Design Control, and medical
safety requirements to obtain an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and (3) use a swine
model to develop MAVEN stimulation and recording protocols for use in existing intraoperative neurosurgical
procedures (e.g., deep brain stimulation neurosurgeries and cortical lobectomies). This includes demonstrating
the functionality, versatility, and efficacy of the MAVEN system for future pre-clinical and clinical neuroscience
research."

 There is a fundamental gap in understanding how mutations on P301 of tau cause memory impairment in
fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). One pathological mechanism involves the association of aberrant tau with
ribosomal complexes. However, the consequences of this interaction are unknown. The long-term goal of this
work is to better understand the link between tau P301 mutations and memory impairment in FTD. The objective
of this proposal is to determine the impact of mutant tau on translation. We will use human brain tissues as well
as in vitro and in vivo models to study ribosomes in isolation, translation in cells, and brain pathophysiology in
mice. Our preliminary results substantiate that the association between tau and ribosomal complexes impair
protein synthesis. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that pathological tau inhibits translation of proteins critical
for memory. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the tau-mediated mechanism of
ribosomal dysfunction will aid in the design of therapeutic targets for FTD, which currently afflict a vast amount
of individuals. Our strong preliminary data serves as support for testing the hypotheses that 1) pathological tau
engages with different parts of the ribosome, 2) translational repression is present in various in vivo tau
models. and 3) the ribosomes’ affinity for transcripts, capacity, and efficiency are impaired in human FTD
brains. These aims have the potential of extrinsic merit to be used as screening tools for modulators of ribosomal
function. Our approach is innovative because it incorporates novel assays, which offer excellent sensitivity that
is not achievable by more traditional approaches. This work is significant because it departs from the status quo
by testing a new mechanism in which translation dysfunction mediates tauopathic symptoms. This work is
expected to advance the field by filling the gap in understanding of tau-mediated brain dysfunction. This
knowledge will serve to better characterize the link between tau and memory impairment in order to develop
novel therapeutic strategies."

Project Title: B-Cell Bioinformatics and Analytics for the HVTN Discovery Medicine Program
This proposal outlines the scientific agenda for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Statistical and
Data Management Center (SDMC) to expand our capacity in carrying out B-cell bioinformatics and
analytics work. This effort is aimed at supporting the increasing demands of the rapidly growing HVTN
Discovery Medicine Program which is poised to evaluate more than 15 protocols in the current HVTN
grant cycle.
Given the promising outcome of several broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)-inducing vaccine
immunogens which have demonstrated initial success in eliciting tier 2 heterologous neutralization
antibodies and expanding HIV-1 bnAb precursors, we recognize that it is strategically crucial to evaluate
additional vaccine candidates. These candidates should pair prime and boosting immunogens carefully
selected to optimally mature B-cell responses towards broad neutralization against HIV. To accomplish
this, it is imperative to evaluate and down-select immunogens using assays that provide both cellular-
and molecular-level information about evolution of vaccine-induced B-cell repertoires. Addressing these
needs necessitates the establishment of robust and standardized computational and analytical pipelines
adapted to interrogate B-cell phenotyping (BCP) and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing data.
The HVTN SDMC has made significant progress since 2020 in developing various aspects of the
computational and analytical pipeline that supports its Discovery Medicine Program. However, the
SDMC’s funding has become insufficient to meet the critical strategic requirements of the program,
particularly those needed to expedite the generation of reports and datasets summarizing BCP and BCR
sequencing data to vaccine developers. These reports are critical to accelerate the design and down-
selection of boost immunogens required to continue guiding affinity maturation of vaccine-induced B-
cells toward neutralization against HIV. These reports are also central to quickly guiding programmatic
decisions from the HVTN and NIAID leaderships. This funding shortfall is primarily attributed to the
escalating complexity of research studies, the iterative nature of immunogen designs, the increased
number of studies in the pipeline, and the expectation that summaries and interpretation of these
complex laboratory data should be distributed quickly. Consequently, the HVTN SDMC is seeking
supplemental funding for Fiscal Years (FY) 2024 through 2027 to bolster the success of the HVTN
Discovery Medicine Program."

11084665,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain among the most prominent HIV co-morbidities in the
era of ART-treated HIV infection. Persistent neuroinflammation is a recognized pathogenic feature of HAND, but
the reason(s) for the inflammation persisting after initiation of ART remain incompletely understood. Our recent
studies demonstrated that monocytes exposed to EVs carrying HIV-1 protein Nef (Nef EVs) acquire pro-
inflammatory epigenetic memory that promotes exacerbated responses to inflammatory stimuli when Nef is long
gone. The mechanism of this effect is similar to “trained immunity”, a concept that stipulates that an exposure to
a pathogen may not only trigger an innate immune response in myeloid cells, but also induce long-lasting
metabolic and epigenetic alterations causing innate inflammatory responses to be faster and more robust. We
hypothesize that this effect of Nef may also target brain myeloid cells, microglia, and possibly other brain cells,
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. If contribution of this mechanism is confirmed, that would imply that even
complete elimination of the virus or virus-related pathogenic factors may not be sufficient to fully abolish
neuropathology in HIV-infected individuals, as brain cells will keep their pro-inflammatory status. The following
Specific Aims will be pursued to test this hypothesis. SA1. To characterize epigenetic modifications induced
by HIV and Nef EVs and assess their contribution to neuroinflammation. In this Aim, we will characterize
epigenetic and transcriptional effects of HIV infection and Nef EV treatment in humanized mice. Results of
snATAC-seq in this model will be compared to epigenetic dataset obtained from brains of PLWH. SA2. To
establish how Nef EVs induce epigenetic modifications in brain cells contributing to neuroinflammation.
Here, we will establish the cell type-specific mechanisms of inflammatory modifications induced by Nef EVs. This
study is a continuation of the long-term collaboration between Drs. Bukrinsky and Sviridov, who discovered the
training effect of Nef on myeloid cells. The proposed project is fully consistent with the R21 mechanism, as it
investigates a novel phenomenon and involves high risk high reward studies."
11087332,"ABSTRACT
A central goal of NCI Persistent Poverty Initiative Centers is to understand and address structural factors
driving cancer inequalities in persistent poverty areas. To advance this goal, we need to facilitate access and
build capacity for projects that can examine the impacts of structural and social determinants of health on
cancer with appropriate data sources that are inclusive of diverse populations. Linked SEER-Medicare data is
one of the best sources of data to further work on studying structural and social impacts on cancer, but several
critical barriers exist to its widespread use. SEER-Medicare data does not include very detailed structural and
social information, so this needs to be incorporated through geographic overlay of area deprivation indexes
and measures of structural racism. There is also a complex process for obtaining the data, with a long timeline
for approval of projects, thus making it difficult for fellows and trainees to use the data for projects.
This proposed supplement to our Upstream Research Center is directed towards addressing these barriers, to
facilitate the use of real-world data for informing the best ways to address structural and social determinants of
health for reducing the cancer burden in persistent poverty areas. First, we will create measures of the most
commonly used social deprivation indexes, and area-based measures of structural racism, and make these
measures publicly available with code and documentation for how they are created. Next, we will use new
artificial intelligence approaches to create synthetic versions of SEER-Medicare data, and make this available
to researchers at NCI Persistent Poverty Initiative Centers. We will accomplish these objectives with the
following specific aims:
Aim 1. Create area-level deprivation indexes and measures of persistent poverty to be used as geographic
overlays for SEER-Medicare data.
Aim 2. Create synthetic versions of SEER-Medicare data that include area level deprivation indexes and
measures of structural racism.
Aim 3. Validate the accuracy and utility of SEER-Medicare synthetic data for examining the effects of structural
and social determinants of health on cancer incidence and mortality."
11087293,"Hypertension affects over 85% of adults over 75 years of age and represents one of the few modifiable risk
factors to prevent dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older adults. However, current practice
guidelines for hypertension screening and treatment focus heavily on blood pressure (BP) measurements
obtained in clinic settings. This reliance on brick-and-mortar offices for BP measurement represents a significant
barrier for older adults, who often depend on others for transportation and who are at increased risk of severe
morbidity from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) has shown incredible promise for
more effective and timely BP treatment and control. Furthermore, the current pandemic has catalyzed
widespread adoption of HBPM for hypertension screening and management. However, evidence for this practice
is severely lacking in older adults. In fact, there are virtually no HBPM cohort studies in elderly populations in the
United States. This is particularly concerning as the discordance between clinic and home BP increases with
age, making older adults especially susceptible to harms from either overly aggressive or delayed BP treatment.
In this proposed study, we apply our unique expertise with HBPM and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring to one of the most long-standing and well-respected American cohorts of community-dwelling adults,
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). While ARIC already rigorously measures BP in the clinic
setting via automated devices, our proposal will additionally assess 8 days of HBPM and 24 hours of ambulatory
BP (once every 20 minutes) in 2,142 racially diverse adults over age 80 years, establishing possibly the largest
prospective study of home, ambulatory, and clinic-based BP measurement among older adults in the world. This
proposal is designed to directly inform clinical practice with HBPM by characterizing its measurement
performance (bias and variance), predictiveness with respect to key long-term events (dementia and CVD), and
interpretation (i.e. what a home BP measure equals in terms of BP measured by ABPM or in clinic).
The accomplishment of this proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge related to an increasingly utilized
form of BP measurement, improving access to timely hypertension care by establishing an efficient protocol for
precise BP measurement at home. Moreover, by investing in the digital monitoring platform of the ARIC study,
this proposal will lay the foundation for remote collection of a wide range of detailed, longitudinal, biosensor data
that can be leveraged by many investigators through subsequent ARIC proposals in years to come.
With current trends in BP control worsening among older adults in the United States, there has never been a
greater need for research on innovative technologies to improve access to high quality BP measurement.
Ultimately, our proposal directly answers the call by NHLBI's 2017 expert panel on BP measurement for high
impact research that determines “the role of ABPM and HBPM in the diagnosis…of hypertension” and “the
optimal protocol for using HBPM…to diagnose and assess…hypertension.”"
11071838,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This is a proposed supplement to Dr. Aaron Whiteley’s NIH Director’s New Innovator Award
(DP2AT012346) titled “Deciphering the crosstalk between bacteria and their mammalian hosts”. Bacteria must
defend themselves against the constant threat of bacteriophages (phages) and mobile genetic elements that
seek to parasitize bacterial hosts for their selfish replication and spread. The conflict between bacteria and their
threats has driven the evolution of genes that cooperate to form sophisticated signaling pathways to protect
bacteria; these pathways collectively form the bacterial immune system. Interestingly, a subset of proteins found
in the bacterial immune system are homologous to proteins in the human immune system, which provides a
basis for cross-kingdom signaling, from bacteria to humans. The focus of this supplement is on understanding
the bacterial immune system to improve our understanding and design of probiotic bacteria that might better
survive in the human gut or influence human immune signaling pathways.
 The proposed goals for this supplement are to investigate the prevalence and function of known bacterial
immune pathways in the microbiome and to uncover novel immune pathways that restrict horizontal gene
transfer. In the first Aim, we will investigate the antiphage system CBASS (Cyclic Oligonucleotide Based
Antiphage Signaling Systems) in the context of the human microbiome. CBASS is a potent antiphage system
that is evolutionarily related to the human cGAS-STING antiviral pathway. A defining feature of CBASS systems
is a CD-NTase (cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase) protein, which is homologous to cGAS. Both cGAS and
CD-NTases synthesize cyclic nucleotides that elicit potent immune signaling. In the parent grant, we investigate
how cyclic nucleotides produced by bacteria in the gut may impact mammalian host immune signaling. This aim
synergizes with that work by investigating the abundance of CBASS systems in metagenomes derived from
healthy and disease-related mammalian microbiomes and interrogating their function in heterologous systems.
In the second Aim, we will discover novel aspects of the bacterial immune system that restrict horizontal gene
transfer by screening diverse bacteria using a functional assay. We will then assess the role of these systems in
bacteria from the mammalian microbiome, including estimating their prevalence and disease association in
metagenomes.
 The supplemental aims proposed will illuminate cryptic aspects of antiphage systems, interdomain
signaling, and how bacteria control mobile genetic elements. Further, findings from this work will contribute to
the ultimate development of novel pre- and probiotic complementary therapies that can durably remain within
the human gut microbiome and even promote appropriate immune responses."

1R01GM149073 PARENT GRANT
Cells perform diverse processes, such as cell division, growth, motility, formation of adhesions, and tissue
morphogenesis, under a wide range of mechanical environments. Central to these processes are mechanical
forces, which may come from outside the cell or be generated internally and which are integrated with signaling
pathways to guide the cellular process. The cell’s macromolecular cytoskeletal machinery, including the actin-
based myosin II motors and actin crosslinking proteins, assemble, function and then disassemble in response to
these forces and signaling pathways. This dynamic force-responsive assembly provides self-tuning of the
machinery, leading to natural positive and negative feedback and further allows mechanical inputs to be
converted into signaling outputs. Using Dictyostelium cells, we discovered that many of these components are
pre-assembled in the cytoplasm in the form of mechanoresponsive Contractility Kits (CKs), which allow for highly
efficient responses to force inputs. The CKs include myosin II, cortexillin I, IQGAP1, IQGAP2, plus several other
proteins that we know of. For this application, substantial published and unpublished data motivate the questions
to be answered, and our work extends from Dictyostelium to human proteins and model systems. We begin by
leveraging our suite of experimental and modeling platforms, including a new modeling framework called
SpringSaLaD, which allows for molecularly motivated, particle-based, stochastic simulations of biochemical
processes. Using SpringSaLaD, we are modeling the formation of CKs by drawing upon measured in vivo
concentrations, diffusion constants, and in vivo “apparent” KDs. From this model, we have made an initial list of
predictions about the features of the CKs, which we will test in Dictyostelium. We will also explore the kinetics of
assembly and disassembly of the CKs with and without mechanical force. For assembly, we will determine the
molecular basis for force-dependent assembly of the CKs and nonmuscle myosin II bipolar thick filament (BTF),
using interference scattering mass spectrometry. For disassembly, we will use magnetic tweezers to measure
the compliance within the BTF and then determine how this compliance restricts the activity of the myosin heavy
chain kinase (MHCKC for Dictyostelium and PKCzeta for NMIIB). We have also found that the setpoint of
mechanosensitive accumulation (mechanoaccumulation) by Dictyostelium myosin II and human NMIIB has an
optimum of 20% assembly fraction. Further, NMIIB’s setpoint is cell type- and cell cycle stage-specific. We will
use the framework we have established to determine the consequences of setpoint positioning on cell behavior,
including NMIIB dynamics, cell division, and gene expression. We will incorporate this information into our
computational models for myosin II mechanoaccumulation, expanding the models to include the components of
the CKs. In sum, this research effort, which spans molecular to cellular scales combined with physical theory
development, will decipher key principles and mechanisms of force-dependent cytoskeletal assembly and the
impact on cell behavior."

Our research focuses on microglia, a type of brain cell crucial to understanding and treating several central
nervous system diseases. In our first funding cycle (2014-2019), we developed a technique to remove and
replace microglia using a drug that targets a specific receptor (CSF1R), which has since become a standard
method in neuroscience. This approach has significantly advanced our understanding of microglia and has
shown therapeutic potential in various disease and injury models. In our second funding cycle (2019-2024), we
further explored microglia replacement and discovered several key findings, including a new method of
reprogramming microglia and a novel route for bone marrow-derived cells to enter the brain allowing us to fully
replace the microglial tissue with bone-marrow derived monocytes/myeloid cells. Building on these findings, we
propose three specific aims for our next research phase. First, we will investigate a new method of microglia
recovery that avoids the need for complete microglia removal. This involves temporarily inhibiting CSF1R,
leading to the reprogramming and proliferation of microglia and other brain cells. Second, we will explore the
potential of replacing dysfunctional microglia with functional bone marrow-derived cells as a treatment for
genetic disorders associated with microglia dysfunction. Lastly, we will study the role of peripheral myeloid
cells entering the brain in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Our research aims to deepen our
understanding of microglia biology and explore its therapeutic potential, moving towards more clinically
relevant applications."
11071885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a scalable, user-friendly, continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) system for better diabetes management. IMS has developed the world's smallest
electrochemical analyte sensing platform based on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
using Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This design offers some unique
advantages due to its active digital sensor (compared to passive analog sensors in current leading
CGMs) including extreme miniaturization, on-chip integration of multiple sensors and processing
electronics, improvement in signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (thus improving hypoglycemia accuracy), and
on-chip temperature calibration (improve accuracy, reliability by confirming the sensor is in the tissue,
and performing on-site temperature calibration during sickness, exercise, and sleep). Moreover, the
system uses extremely scalable semiconductor and flexible electronics manufacturing methods,
increasing lot sizes by > 50,000x (simplifying factory calibration) and reducing cost (improving
affordability and broadening usage). The proposed system is named CGM+ since it goes beyond just
glucose monitoring (v1 measures glucose and temperature, v2 will measure glucose, ketones,
temperature, and pH). Hence, the design is highly innovative.
We have demonstrated the function of the CGM+ platform in humans in a First-In-Human (FIH)
feasibility study in Phase II. Recently, we verified the feasibility of system operation for 14 days in a
second human study (ongoing).
Our objective in this CRP grant is to optimize the manufacturing and the quality framework to enable
larger human studies, paving the way towards enabling an FDA IDE for approval trials.
This work is significant as it will catalyze the commercialization of the first CGM+ system capable of
the smallest needle insertion (28-gauge needle) that can work for a long time (>14 days) with factory
calibration (no finger sticks). After the first approval, this system can be extended to include other
analytes (e.g., ketones, insulin, glucagon) without increasing its size, owing to the on-chip integration
of multiple sensors.
The team includes original inventors of the core technology from the California Institute of Technology
(Dr. Nazari, Dr. Rahman, Mr. Sencan), a seasoned and respected researcher in electrochemical sensor
technology (Bill Van Antwerp, former CSO of Medtronic MiniMed), regulatory and IP expert (John
Heithaus, JD), commercialization expert (Mr. Paul Strasma, former CEO of Capillary Biomedical which
was recently acquired by Tandem Diabetes), clinical expert (Dr. Alan Marcus, MD; former Chief Medical
Officer of Medtronic Diabetes), and a biosensors and biomaterials expert (Dr. Natalie Wisniewski, Ph.D.,
former CTO of Profusa, Inc.)."
11070464,"Project Summary: Broad Impact: Hair cells (HCs) are the sensory transduction cells of the auditory and
vestibular systems. When a mechanical stimulus such as sound or linear, gravitational, or angular accelerations
are applied to these hair cells, small microvillus-like, actin-filled protrusions called stereocilia from the apical pole
of the HCs are deflected. This causes filamentous tip link protein complexes at the tips of hair cell called
stereocilia to pull upon and lead to the opening of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel complex. The
opening of MET channels causes an influx of positively charged ions that depolarize the HCs, resulting in a
variety of physiological processes from synaptic transmission to nerve fibers to physical changes in HC length
by a phenomenon known as electromotility.
However, there is a reigning question of the roles of the protein constituent of the tip links and the MET channel
complex is unclear. For example, whether tip links modulate the mechanical stimuli in HCs by acting as dampers,
extra masses, or springs is yet to be discovered. These tip links are composed of four large extracellular peptide
chains – two of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and two of cadherin 23 (CDH23). Due to limitations in heterologous
expression of MET channel complex proteins, MET must be studied in animal models. Recent gene therapy
developments provide a great tool to study one component of tip links: PCDH15. Here, this project seeks to
exploit this novel protein manipulation technique to study the biophysical properties of tip links and the influence
of these properties on the MET channel function. Aim 1: To uncover whether the length of the tip links is important
for MET, MET function of miniaturized PCDH15s with shortened lengths will be compared to that of wild-type-
like tip links. Aim 2: To reveal the role of Ca2+-binding site-mediated flexibility on the hair-cell MET function, tip
links formed by mutant PCDH15s will be compared against wild-type-like tip links using single-cell
electrophysiology. Aim 2.1: Computational simulations that are used to predict protein dynamics will be used to
estimate the flexibility of the tip links when specific Ca2+ binding sites are perturbed. Aim 2.2: MET currents of
different Ca2+-binding-site-perturbed mutant PCDH15s will be measured to reveal the effect of Ca2+-binding at
specific sites on MET. Training: This project aims to forge the applicant into well-rounded auditory neuroscientist.
In pursuit of this goal, the project will teach the applicant inner ear whole-cell hair-cell electrophysiology,
stereocilia bundle deflection, confocal microscopy imaging, animal handling, and in silico methods. Additional
training will provide dedicated time to allow the applicant to grow his network with collaborations across many
different laboratories. Together, this project seeks not only to develop a strong scientist, but also to increase our
collective knowledge on the biophysics underlying the hair-cell mechanotransduction function."
11081599,"Comprehensive Resources for HIV Microbicides and Biomedical Prevention: The development of highly effective HIV prevention strategies, including a preventive vaccine and other non-vaccine biomedical prevention (nBP) products, remains one of the highest priorities for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With current global HIV infection estimates exceeding 33 million people, the development of safe, effective, and acceptable nBP products to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV could play a major role in the worldwide reduction of the estimated 5000 new HIV infections per day. As promising nBP products emerge (e.g., microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agents, and Multipurpose Prevention Technologies (MPT’s), there is a critical need to rapidly and efficiently move these candidates into clinical testing. The scope of work encompasses preclinical activities that range from initial product discovery to those required to support clinical trials and/or product licensure."
10855722,"Project Summary
Local delivery of growth factors has been applied to treat various human diseases. However, many growth factor
delivery systems cannot stably sequester bioactive growth factors for sustained delivery, primarily due to a lack
of high-affinity and high-specificity molecular recognition. This deficiency leads to the rapid release of growth
factors, thereby requiring supraphysiological levels of drug loading and delivery to achieve therapeutic efficacy.
Unfortunately, such a delivery approach has been found to cause high toxicity and even cancer in patients.
Therefore, the objective of this project is to study a novel transformative drug delivery platform based on non-
covalent functionalization with bispecific aptamers. Different from traditional methods requiring co-valent
functionalization, this innovative method does not require alterations to the manufacturing procedures or
properties of existing biomaterials. Furthermore, growth factors can be loaded into off-the-shelf biomaterials
when needed. To achieve the goal, we will: 1) design and evaluate bispecific aptamers; 2) evaluate growth
factor loading and release; and 3) evaluate in vivo growth factor delivery. It is anticipated that bispecific aptamers
can stably attach to delivery systems and sequester growth factors due to high binding affinities and specifities,
allowing for local, sustained growth factor delivery. The success of this project will not only lead to the
development of a technological platform for growth factor delivery, but also transform the way of functionalizing
various materials at different scales in applications such as bioimaging, biosensing, cell engineering, etc."
11083964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As a growing U.S. ethnic minority, Latinx populations have traditionally been studied as a monolith, with the
implicit assumption that individuals migrating from different countries have similar life experiences due to
common language. Additionally, it has been well documented that Indigenous, Black, and Latinx populations
face more adverse health outcomes relative to non-Hispanic whites in the United States. In order to address how
health outcomes vary within Latinx groups, research efforts would benefit from focusing on understanding the
variability of genomic ancestry and life experiences from first and second generation immigrants from a single
country of origin. The purpose of this research project is to integrate traditionally separate methodological
approaches to understanding health outcomes by comprehensively investigating the social, genotypic, and
epigenomic determinants of health within one such heterogeneous immigrant ethnic group.
In the F99 phase of this work, I will identify genotypic and sociocultural factors that are associated with variation
in adverse health outcomes among individuals of Cuban descent living in Miami, Florida. This research work will
be conducted in conjunction with the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a multi-
regional study investigating health outcomes across diverse groups of Hispanics in various locales within the
U.S., with over 16,000 participants registered to date, including over 2,300 individuals of Cuban descent. This
project has collected demographic, sociocultural, family history, health, and genotype data to understand health
disparities within a large ethnic group in the United States. Additionally, I will be collecting novel genomic and
sociocultural data, including data collection via a survey and semi-structured interview, for individuals of Cuban
descent living in Miami, Florida in order to determine if discrimination factors into Latinx health disparities; these
critical data are not available through HCHS/SOL.
In the K00 phase of this work, I will work at the intersection of the social determinants of health and genomics
through training and research within the field of epigenomics. Specifically, I am interested in investigating if there
are differential patterns of methylation across the genome within and among Cuban immigration waves and if
these patterns are associated with differential lived experiences. If we observe differences in methylation
patterns, are they related to adverse health consequences in populations that differentially experience life
stressors associated with varying sociocultural experiences, including experiences of discrimination? Over the
course of my career I plan to continue working with Cuban immigrants and Cuban-Americans,in exploring the
mechanisms by which the social determinants of health are embodied and expressed biologically. I envision
pursuing a postdoctoral position that expands my current genomic skill set into epigenomics and continues to
build upon my doctoral training examining health disparities and the mechanistic factors that may impact adverse
health in marginalized populations through both existing data and primary data collection."
10814984,"Project Summary: This K23 proposal details a comprehensive 4-year training program that will support the candidate's transition toward an independent clinical research career focused on the development and rigorous testing of scalable, technology-enhanced, mind-body interventions for orthopedic and other costly musculoskeletal conditions. In this application, the candidate proposes a significant and innovative proposal that is directly tied with his proposed training and career development goals. Background: Painful nontraumatic degenerative upper extremity conditions are common and risky substance use commonly occurs in these conditions. When these co-occur, there is an increased risk for higher pain and disability, which are challenging to treat. To date, there are no evidence-based interventions focused on adapting to these painful conditions. The Toolkit for Optimal Recovery (TOR) is a brief, live video mind-body program aimed at preventing chronic pain in patients with acute injuries, which is amenable for adaptations for the needs of patients with painful nontraumatic degenerative upper extremity conditions and risky substance use. Specific aims and research design: The proposed study aims to I) identify treatment needs and preferences of adult (18+) patients with non-traumatic painful, upper extremity conditions with risky substance use who seek care in the outpatient orthopedic department, via live video focus groups (N=3 groups; up to N=20 patients) to inform the development of the asynchronous Web-based TIRELESS and study procedures; 2) conduct an open pilot to explore initial feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of Web-TIRELESS and study methods (N=12 patients) using pre/post- tests and exit interviews; 3) conduct a feasibility RCT of Web-TIRELESS vs. Web-MEUC (N=50) to determine 1) feasibility of recruitment, screening, eligibility, enrollment, randomization, and assessment processes, and 2) feasibility and acceptability of the Web-TIRELESS and Web-MEUC. Findings will inform an efficacy trial through the R01 mechanisms.

 The 90+ Study was initiated January 1, 2003 as a population-based sample of oldest-old survivors of
the Leisure World Cohort Study (LWCS, enrollment 1981-1984). With more than 1,800 participants, The 90+
Study is one of the largest and longest studies in the world of dementia, cognitive decline, disability, and frailty
in the oldest-old. People over 90 are the fastest segment of the population and have the greatest public health
impact as the risk of dementia is extraordinarily high in these individuals, reaching a staggering 40% per year
in centenarians. However, many oldest-old maintain superior cognitive performance well into their tenth decade
and beyond (cognitive resilience), often in the presence of neuropathological changes (cognitive resilience in
the presence of pathology). Lifestyle, co-morbid conditions, genetics, and other factors have been implicated in
this cognitive resilience but have not been well studied. In this application, we extend our studies to investigate
cognitive resilience in these remarkable individuals. In Aim 1, we consider early (30 years earlier in the LWCS)
and late (at age 90+) lifestyle and other factors in relation to cognitive resilience. Factors related to the
maintenance of superior cognitive abilities in the presence of pathology are investigated in Aim 2. Taking
advantage of our large cohort of 90+ year-olds in our imaging studies, we prospectively follow individuals
without dementia to estimate incidence of dementia and rates of cognitive decline in relation to MRI and PET
biomarkers in Aim 3. We analyze the role of low levels of multiple neuropathologic changes in the expression
of dementia in Aim 4. Finally, with this application, we will recruit the last living LWCS participants eligible for
our study, and complete ascertainment of all previously established outcomes in The 90+ Study (dementia,
CIND, MCI, frailty, disability, and mortality). With our extensive database, unique large cohort of well-
characterized individuals, extensive and multidisciplinary longitudinal follow-up, and innovative
neuropathological and neuroimaging investigations, we are ideally positioned to do studies of dementia and
resilience in the oldest-old. Identifying factors related to cognitive resilience and dementia, including modifiable
lifestyle factors and imaging biomarkers, would contribute to our understanding of aging in health and disease
and provide potential targets for interventions to promote successful aging."
11083500,"Project Summary/Abstract
Biliary atresia (BA) is an important and perplexing disease of neonates that has eluded major
discoveries of etiology and pathophysiology for decades. Recently, the NIDDK-supported
ChiLDReN network performed exome sequencing on a subset of BA individuals with cardiac and
abdominal laterality features–those with the BA Splenic Malformation (BASM) syndrome in order
to determine if there is a genetic etiology in this group with multi-organ developmental
dysmorphogenesis. Analysis of BASM exome sequences found several participants with
significant mutations in the ciliary gene PKD1L1, a gene associated with cardiac laterality defects,
but not yet linked to biliary tract disease. In order to explore mechanistic consequences to
impaired PKD1L1 signaling in humans, we developed an intrahepatic cholangiocyte-restricted
Pkd1l1Fl/Fl;Afp-Cre (LKO) mouse. Preliminary data indicates that absence of Pkd1l1 in the
developing mouse liver leads not only to early biliary dysmorphology, but an enhanced peribiliary
fibroinflammation at adult ages, moreso in the setting of distal obstruction after bile duct ligation
(BDL). These histologic features strongly mimic those seen in human BA livers. Aim 1 explores
the fibroinflammatory consequences of absent Pkd1l1 signaling in the LKO and other informative
Pkd1l1Fl/Fl cross-bred lines (including one with a human bile acid pool and another that will delete
Pkd1l1 in the entire biliary tree) and response to select bile acid based therapeutic interventions.
Aim 2 explores the delineation of early bile duct dysmorphology in developing prenatal and early
postnatal livers with lineage tracing and multiplexed spatial RNA studies. Finally, Aim 3 is an in
vitro set of experiments with cholangiocyte organoids, polarized Transwell cultures and 3d duct-
on-a-chip studies to define the molecular and signaling consequences in isolated Pkd1l1Fl/Fl and
LKO cholangiocytes. Taken together we anticipate that these 3 Aims will provide first-ever genetic
models of BA poised to discover new cellular and molecular mechanisms of biliary tract reactivity
and damage. In addition, testing of bile acid pathway-based agents in informative Pkd1l1 mouse
models may help provide supportive pre-clinical evidence to address the current paucity of
effective medical therapeutics in BA."
11084587,"The TP53 tumor suppressor is arguably one of the most important genes in cancer, given that it is inactivated 
by somatic mutations in about 50% of human tumors. p53 serves to protect cells in response to numerous 
biological and environmental stresses, such as DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oncogene 
activation. Upon insult, p53 responds rapidly by activating a plethora of cellular responses that inhibit the 
growth of damaged cells, including cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. In addition to mutations, 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TP53 gene can also have a significant impact on p53 function. 
We have shown that a coding region polymorphism at amino acid 47 of p53 (Pro47Ser, hereafter S47), 
causes this protein to have markedly impaired tumor suppressor function. The S47 polymorphism of p53 
(rs1800371) is found in approximately 2% of African Americans. Genetically engineered p53 “S47 mice” are 
prone to spontaneous tumors. Over 30% of these mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most 
common type of liver cancer. We found that S47 cells and mice were defective for their ability to induce 
ferroptosis, an iron and lipid-mediated form of cell death. This ferroptotic defect leads to an increase in iron 
accumulation in cells and tissues. Consistent with these findings, we recently reported that the S47 variant 
of p53 is significantly associated with Iron Overload in African Americans (OR 1.7, p=0.023), a disorder that 
causes iron accumulation and an increased predisposition to liver fibrosis and cancer. Collectively, our data 
suggest that the S47 variant of p53 may be a significant risk factor for liver disease in African Americans. 
The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the S47 variant is impaired for 
p53-mediated tumor suppression in the liver and has a reduced ability to suppress HCC. In Aim 1, we will 
use genetically engineered mouse models and cell lines to determine the impact of the S47 variant of p53 
on the initiation and progression of HCC. In Aim 2, we will use our human WT and S47 CRISPR knock-in 
liver cancer cell lines, and the S47 mouse, to identify personalized therapeutic approaches for S47 individuals 
with HCC. To achieve these goals, we have put in place a strong and collaborative Mentoring Team: (1) Dr. 
Don Rockey, MD; (2) Dr. Paul Monga, MD; and (3) Dr. Natalie Saini, PhD. Each laboratory has unique and 
complementary expertise in fibrosis/cirrhosis, mouse models of HCC, and bioinformatics. We expect to 
reveal the underlying mechanisms by which the S47 variant of p53 leads to increased liver disease risk. We 
also expect to uncover more efficacious therapies for HCC in this population."
11084834,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for >80% of patients with liver cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortalities, both worldwide and in the United States. Recent evidence highlights the involvement of YRDC (YrdC-threonylcarbamoyltransferase domain-containing protein), a tRNA modifying enzyme, in tumor growth via N6-threonylcarbamoylation (t6A) of tRNA in various cancer types, including HCC. Additionally, YRDC has been shown to be overexpressed in different types of cancer and associated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance as well as poor prognosis in HCC patients. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying YRDC overexpression in cancers and its involvement in the regulation of tumor metabolism remain unknown. The objective of our study is to define the mechanisms by which YRDC drives cellular growth and investigate the potential of targeting YRDC in cancers, with a specific focus on HCC. Our preliminary data, employing metabolomic and isotope tracing approaches, have shown that YRDC can act as a novel regulator of one-carbon metabolism and purine synthesis in several cancer cells, including HCC cells. We demonstrate that YRDC depletion reduces flux through one-carbon metabolism, thereby restricting the availability of substrates for the synthesis of de novo purine nucleotides. In light of these findings, this proposal focuses on studying YRDC and its impact on tumor metabolism using HCC as a model. We hypothesize that YRDC promotes tumor growth by activating one-carbon metabolism, thereby stimulating de novo purine synthesis. Consequently, targeting YRDC represents a potentially effective strategy against HCC. We will define the mechanisms underlying YRDC upregulation in HCC, we will use isogenic cell settings deleted for the tumor suppressor P53 and expressing mutant KRAS, and examine the role of the MAPK/ERK downstream of KRAS in the regulation of YRDC mRNA and protein levels (Aim1). Then, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which YRDC stimulates one-carbon metabolism and purine synthesis in HCC cells (Aim2). Finally, we will examine the therapeutic potential of suppressing YRDC to improve HCC, and/or sensitize HCC to chemotherapy (Aim3). Overall, the proposal is significant because it will identify novel regulators of onecarbon metabolism and the de novo purine synthesis pathways, clarify the tumor pro-growth function of YRDC, and identify a novel drug target in HCC treatment. The project is highly innovative because, to date, YRDC has not been linked to the regulation of one-carbon metabolic pathway. The proposal will provide a stepping-stone to aid the applicant to establish an independent research career and the work performed under this award will be used to generate NIH R01 grant proposals."

11082861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children’s socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with disparities in cognitive, linguistic, and
academic development. Understanding the precise environmental and neurodevelopmental mechanisms that
underlie these disparities is critical for developing maximally impactful interventions to reduce and ultimately
ameliorate achievement gaps. This proposal will test an innovative developmental model in which specific
features of children’s early language input engage the development of cascading frontotemporal neural
networks that ultimately scaffold multiple aspects of social-cognitive development, including children’s
language abilities as well as executive functioning and social cognition—critical school readiness skills that are
known to contribute to SES achievement gaps in school. The proposed research will leverage multimodal
assessments of children’s environments (real-world auditory language exposure and lab-based video-coding of
parent-child interaction) and brain development (MRI measures of structural brain development, and fNIRS
measures of brain function during domain-specific cognitive tasks) longitudinally across the preschool years
(ages 3;0-4;11 years) to address three specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate the how three dimensions of early
language experience (linguistic, social/interactive, and conceptual) influence structural and functional brain
development underlying receptive and expressive language development. Aim 2 will extend this investigation
beyond the language domain and evaluate whether these dimensions of language experience partially explain
SES-related differences in executive functioning and social cognition, either directly or indirectly through
developing language skills. Finally, Aim 3 will examine whether input-driven, longitudinal development of
frontotemporal language-related brain networks also scaffold the development of neural circuitry underlying the
emergence of executive functioning and social cognition. Results will help identify the precise components of
early language experience that drive development across multiple neurocognitive domains, and will help
determine the mechanisms by which exposures to specific social and environmental factors affect neural and
cognitive plasticity during a critical period of brain development. By identifying the most impactful, malleable
environmental factors that shape early neurocognitive development, this work has direct translational
implications to inform the development of interventions to ameliorate income-related achievement gaps."
11083975,"Project Summary
Enzymes that employ transition metals can initiate chemically challenging modifications
of inert chemical bonds. These systems serve as both important drug targets and useful
biocatalysts. In certain transition-metal driven essential biological transformations, such
as DNA biosynthesis, divergent trace elements can be used for reaction initiation.
Discovery of novel metal cofactors used for these processes, and their mechanisms of
assembly and deployment, will enable novel routes of enzyme inhibition in bacterial
pathogens. In a second project, structures and reaction mechanisms in three different
metalloenzyme superfamilies relevant to biocatalysis will be elucidated. These systems
use a common cofactor to catalyze divergent reaction outcomes, controlled by structural
features of each enzyme. A comparative approach provides detailed and testable
hypotheses about the means by which distinct chemical reactions are accomplished, as
well as discovery of entirely new families of enzymes and new ways to control their
activities. The objective of this work is to enable exploitation of the catalytic power
inherent in these systems for more efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of
drugs, chemicals, technological tools, and new chemical processes."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOSI
NOT-CA-24-032. The proposed research supports the specific activities and aims of R01CA270441, “Using a
SMART design to evaluate a remotely delivered, culturally tailored weight loss interventions among
Latina breast cancer survivors” (PI: Greenlee). Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death
among US Latinas. Latinas are at high risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases, which are associated with
poorer cancer outcomes. Latina BC survivors are underrepresented in cancer research and there is a
significant lack of effective interventions to address the diverse needs of Latina BC survivors to achieve and
maintain a healthy weight. We were recently funded by NCI to conduct a two-stage sequential multiple
assignment randomized trial (SMART) testing 12-month adaptive culturally-tailored Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP)-based weight loss interventions in a geographically diverse group of Latina BC survivors in
Washington State and California recruited via NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program
(SEER) registries (n=640), called the ¡Vida! trial. With this Administrative Supplement, we propose to initiate
additional baseline data collection to assess multi-level factors that may contribute to the success and/or failure
of Latina BC survivors engaging with the ¡Vida! program and their weight loss at 12 months. Proposed new
data collection measures will include social determinants of health [SDOH, measured via the 27-item Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services Accountable Health Communities (AHC) Health-Related Social Needs
Screening Tool (HRSN) assessing housing instability, food insecurity, transportation problems, utility help
needs, and disabilities] and neighborhood characteristics (built environment, safety, noise, litter, neighbors,
and walkability measured via an adaptation of a 27-item questionnaire previously used in the Kaiser
Permanente Northern California Pathways Study cohort of BC survivors). Engagement will be assessed via
program attendance and use of digital resources throughout the 12 month trial period. Weight loss will be
assessed via percent weight loss at 12 months. Specific Aims are: 1) To solicit input from the ¡Vida!
Community Advisory Board on the HRSN and neighborhood characteristics assessment tools, and culturally
adapt the tools as needed; 2) To assess SDOH as moderators of ¡Vida! program engagement (Stages 1 and
2) and weight loss at 12 months in a diverse population of Latina BC survivors; and 3) To assess neighborhood
characteristics as moderators of ¡Vida! program engagement (Stage 1 and 2) and weight loss at 12 months in
a diverse population of Latina BC survivors. Results will provide data on how SDOH and neighborhood
characteristics affect within-group engagement with and weight loss effects of a culturally-tailored DPP-based
weight loss program in Latina breast cancer survivors."
11081330,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mammalian tissue development requires a series of tightly regulated and dynamic fluctuations
in metabolic pathways, growth factor signaling, gene expression, and cofactor availability. An
important cofactor is copper (Cu), an essential but toxic trace nutrient that is required for oxidative
phosphorylation, removal of reactive oxygen species, iron homeostasis, and pro-survival
signaling pathways. Cu is important for normal tissue development, and we and others have
shown that Cu is required for differentiation of skeletal muscle and neuronal cells. This need for
Cu is highlighted by the severe postnatal developmental impairment in cases of Cu deficiency
including profound hypotonia and neurodegeneration. Menkes is a fatal genetic Cu deficiency
disease caused by mutations in ATP7A, which encodes a trans-Golgi Cu transporting ATPase.
Several open questions remain about the critical Cu targets during tissue differentiation and how
regulated gene expression contributes to prioritized Cu distribution to those targets. These
questions create a gap in knowledge of Cu handling that limit the development of therapies to
treat Cu diseases including Menkes. Our preliminary data indicate that ATP7A is required for
skeletal muscle cell differentiation and that Cu and ATP7A may contribute to regulated inhibition
of TGF- signaling pathways that prevent differentiation. We also discovered that post-
transcriptional regulation of the Atp7a RNA contributes to differentiation-dependent tuning of
ATP7A expression. The proposed research program includes two projects to understand
prioritization of Cu during skeletal muscle differentiation by first focusing on function and
regulation of ATP7A. The first project will study the role of Cu and ATP7A in modulating TGF-
signaling to promote differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The second will focus on uncovering the
mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of Atp7a RNA and how they control ATP7A
expression. These projects will identify new signaling pathways regulated by Cu and new
mechanisms of Cu regulation. This work will open the possibility of modulating Cu availability by
targeting post-transcriptional regulatory pathways and raise the possibility of controlling TGF-
signaling by manipulating Cu availability to treat Cu-related and developmental disease."

The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) is in its 44th year as an NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer center, having received an “exceptional” overall merit descriptor in its last two reviews in
2010 and 2015, and is requesting continued federal support for the next five years. The OSUCCC mission
remains to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through basic, population, translational and clinical research.
Through thoughtful strategic planning, attention to the cancer burden in the catchment area (the state of Ohio),
effective organizational capabilities and targeted investment, the Director and his Senior Leadership team will
enable the OSUCCC to advance collaborative cancer research with local, national, and global partners on
initiatives of the highest priority to the OSUCCC. The 293 full and introductory members are currently served by
16 full and two developing shared resources and are distributed among our five Research Programs: Cancer
Biology (formerly Molecular Biology and Cancer Genetics), Cancer Control, Leukemia Research, Molecular
Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention and Translational Therapeutics. The OSUCCC fosters collaborative basic
research and implements strategies that advance and translate early discovery into clinical and population-based
research and addresses the needs of our catchment area through research, engagement, and outreach, from
etiology through prevention, treatment and survivorship regarding the major cancers afflicting our catchment
area population. The OSUCCC trains the next generation of cancer-focused scientists and clinicians through
new and established programs focused on integrating training for collaborative research efforts. Under the
leadership of a new Director, Raphael Pollock, MD, PhD, The OSUCCC supports innovative research efforts
within four strategic planning priorities: immuno-oncology, cancer engineering, translational genomics and
cancer prevention and survivorship. Since the last CCSG competitive renewal, the OSUCCC has shown
significant growth demonstrated by: 1) the recruitment of 108 basic, population, and translational science faculty
who are OSUCCC members; 2) the addition of 94,647 ft2 research and administrative space under the full control
of the OSUCCC Director; 3) a 16% increase in direct cancer-related funding to $75.4M, with $44.3M coming
from the NCI; 4) accrual of 14,996 patients to interventional clinical trials (5,648 accruals to therapeutic trials); 5)
increased collaborative and impactful research demonstrated by 3,477 peer-reviewed publications in which 74%
of manuscripts are multi-institutional and 85% are collaborative (i.e., inter-, intra-programmatic or multi-
institutional); 497 are published in journals with an impact factor >10; 6) the addition of two new shared resources
at an institutional investment of $1.3M; and 7) preclinical and clinical development of an FDA approved drug
which has changed the treatment for CLL and other blood cancers. With new recruits and strong institutional and
philanthropic support in place, the OSUCCC is building upon the momentum and poised in the next five years to
take significant steps toward achieving our mission and our broad vision of living in a cancer-free world."

11069604,"The promise of genomic medicine to transform healthcare and improve health will not be fully realized until
discoveries become relevant to and available for use by diverse populations and their clinicians. As part of the
IGNITE II network, we are proposing two prospective randomized pragmatic genotype-guided clinical trials
(GUARDD-US and ADOPT-PGx) to determine the impact of implementing genetic testing on hypertension,
depression, and pain therapies.
 GUARDD-US: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with hypertension. People with African ancestry
(AAs) have the highest risk of CKD and kidney failure, the highest prevalence of hypertension, and the lowest
rate of blood pressure (BP) control. While this disparity is in part due to social determinants, ancestry has
biological underpinnings and APOL1 high-risk genetic variants, nearly exclusive found in AAs, increase kidney
failure risk 10-fold. We propose a genotype-guided trial to determine the effect of early vs. delayed knowledge
of a positive APOL1 genotyping result on 3-month systolic blood pressure (SBP). The trial aims to recruit 5435
African Americans with hypertension, with or without CKD, randomized to immediate versus delayed return of
APOL1 genetic testing. In those who are APOL1 negative, we will also conduct a pilot study to test the impact
of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing on SBP. Secondary outcomes include 6-month SBP, in CKD patients, on
medications ordered, renal diagnosis and testing patient psycho-behavioral outcomes, cost effectiveness, and
the effect of PGX guided hypertension management on SBP.
 ADOPT-PGx: Pain and depression are conditions that impact substantial proportions of the US population.
The treatment of acute and chronic pain is challenged by the difficulty of finding effective therapies while
minimizing the risk of adverse effects or opioid addiction. For depression, there are few clinically relevant
predictors of successful treatment, which results in inadequate therapy for many patients. Both opioid and
antidepressant prescriptions can be guided by PGx data based on existing guidelines from the Clinical
Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). We propose a prospective randomized pragmatic
genotype-guided clinical trial that tests the effect of genotype-guided therapy in three scenarios of patients:
acute post-surgical pain, chronic pain, and depression. For each scenario, participants will be randomized to
genotype-guided drug therapy versus usual approaches to drug therapy selection. Changes in patient reported
outcomes representing pain and depression control using standard PROMIS scales define the primary
endpoints. Secondary analyses include safety endpoints, changes in overall well-being, and economic impact
represented by differences in healthcare utilization.
 We expect the successful results from these clinical trials will provide critical evidence needed to drive the
implementation of genomic medicine across broad demographics of patient populations."

11084657,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-24-year-olds. To address this significant public 
health concern, this study seeks to advance our understanding of the daily interplay of sleep and the 
biological clock and how teens think of themselves with their thoughts of suicide. This proposal's central 
hypothesis is that a prolonged time interval between feeling sleepy and actual bedtime creates unique 
opportunities to engage in nighttime self-critical rumination-repetitive negative thinking about self and 
diminishes teens' ability to self-reassure (supportive of self). We also investigate how neural processing of 
self-criticism and self-reassurance varies based on the circadian timing, potentially affecting their 
subsequent sleep and next-day suicidal thoughts. Our central methodology is to examine the interface of 
sleep and biological clock and nighttime self-critical rumination and self-reassurance with next-day 
suicidal thoughts using ecological momentary assessment (EMA}, gold-standard assessments of 
circadian timing and sleep, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 60, 13-17-year-old 
youth. Teens will be recruited on a range of suicidal thoughts from the inpatient, partial hospitalization, 
and outpatient care, as well as the community. This age group represents a critical developmental period 
for self-referential processes and sleep changes, and youth in this age group experienced a sharp 
increase in suicide rates over the last decade. This proposal innovatively links nighttime self-critical 
rumination and self-reassurance with next-day subsequent suicidal thinking via circadian rhythms and 
sleep by integrating (i) state-of-the-art biological clock and sleep measures for objectivity; (ii) EMA 
techniques for real-life meaning; and (iii) fMRI techniques to identify neural treatment targets. This 
research is significant because characterizing brain-behavior mechanisms of the association of circadian 
timing and sleep behavior with nighttime self-critical rumination, self-reassurance, and next-day suicidal 
thinking can contribute to developing novel mobile interventions that target self-referential thinking and 
sleep to reduce suicide risk in youth."
11084733,"Healthy adipose tissue function is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and preventing metabolic diseases. While hypertrophic expansion of adipocytes can lead to adipose tissue dysfunction and contribute to obesity-related metabolic complications, expansion through hyperplasia, driven by adipogenesis, can serve as a protective mechanism. Impaired adipogensis is associated with obesity and aging, promoting the development of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms behind impaired adipogenesis is crucial for designing therapeutic strategies to combat metabolic diseases. In both human and mouse obesity, defective adipogenesis has been linked to senescence in adipose progenitor cells. Recent evidence suggests that extracellular vehicles (EVs) play a role in intercellular communication within adipose tissue and regulate adipose tissue function. However, the specific EVs responsible for regulating adipoegnesis and the factors controlling the secretion and adipogenic function of EVs remains unexplored. Our preliminary studies indicate that Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), as a novel phosphatidic acid (PA) binding protein, plays a regulatory role in senescence and adipogenesis of adipocyte progenitors through EV-mediated intercellular communication. Lcn2 deficiency impairs adipogenesis and results in hypertrophic obesity under high fat diet conditions. Stromal-vascular (SV) cells from brown and white adipose tissue of Lcn2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit increased senescence and decreased adipogenesis. Additionally, we have discovered that Lcn2 is present in a specific population of small EVs secreted by adipocytes. Lcn2 deficiency reduces the small EV population and the secretion of EVs from adipocytes, particularly under inflammatory conditions. Our recent investigations unveiled a pivotal role of Lcn2 as a PA binding protein in the recursive regulation of phospholipase 2 (PLD2)-PA loop and PA production, which is crucial for EV biosynthesis and secretion. Our hypothesis is that Lcn2 functions as an anti-senescence factor that maintains the health of adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) via regulating EV-mediated intercellular communication within adipose tissue. This one-year project proposes two Aims. Aim1 will establish the protective role of Lcn2 against senescence and adipogenic defects in ASPCs during diet-induced obesity, focusing on anti-senescence and adipogenic effects of Lcn2 overexpression in adipocytes. Aim2 will determine the role of Lcn2 in EV-mediated intercellular communication necessary for maintaining the adipogenic function of ASPCs. We will characterize the role of Lcn2 in the release and cargo loading of EVs from adipocytes in response to metabolic stress and inflammatory stimulation. The findings from this project will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of hypertrophic obesity and to pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches."
11085830,"Abstract
Tissues and organs display characteristic patterns established during embryonic development. Segmentation
of somites, precursors of vertebrae, is a unique example in which spatial patterns are established sequentially
and periodically. The prevailing clock and wavefront (CW) model states that the period of segmentation is set
by the oscillatory expression of the Hes/her gene family (the segmentation clock). Disrupting these oscillations
causes vertebral defects. The CW model further states that the positions of segment boundaries are
determined by a critical readout of a signaling gradient (i.e. the wavefront) in the middle of the presomitic
mesoderm (PSM). Depending on the stage, three to five compartments are predetermined to segment. We
recently developed a novel 3D explant culture of zebrafish PSM and discovered that the FGF-mediated double
phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) gradient is the wavefront. We also showed that in three popular vertebrate
models (fish, chick and mice), anterior somite lengths are uniform but posterior somite lengths scale with the
length of PSM. This scaling phenomenon contributes to the generation of species-specific segment numbers.
Several important questions remain unsolved: 1) What mechanism controls segment length scaling, 2) How
the clock and ppERK gradient are integrated to govern segmentation, and 3) How cells decode the
spatiotemporal information, provided by the clock and ppERK gradient, to commit to segmentation in mid-PSM.
To address these fundamental questions, we will perturb the clock, gradient or cell polarity machinery in a
spatiotemporally-controlled manner, visualize their readouts at the single-cell level, and combine quantitative
data analysis with mathematical modeling to test alternative mechanistic hypotheses: Aim 1: Discover the
mechanism governing pattern size scaling. Aim 2: Discover the mechanism integrating the segmentation clock
with the wavefront. Aim 3: Discover the mechanism decoding spatiotemporal information of the clock and
wavefront. Hes/Her oscillations and FGF/ERK activity control pattern formation in various tissues during
development. Disruption of their activities also result in specific cancer types. Our work might inspire future
investigations on their roles during development of other tissues and how their dysregulations result in birth
defects and cancer. Therefore, this application has strong relevance to the mission of the National Institute of
Health."
11064375,"In comparison to the advances in the medical treatment of adult heart failure over the past 50 years, relatively
little progress has been made in the treatment of pediatric dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM). While the majority
of pediatric DCM cases are considered idiopathic, genetic etiologies are commonly suspected. Pediatric DCM
has a poor prognosis, particularly for infants < 1-year-old. Drug development efforts for pediatric heart failure
have been hampered by the lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology. Against this backdrop, our lab
recently identified the RTTN gene, encoding the centrosome protein Rotatin, as a new causal gene for
nonsyndromic congenital dilated cardiomyopathy (cDCM). Additionally, we found that impaired cardiomyocyte
maturation, involving the failure to assemble perinuclear microtubule organizing center (pnMTOC), underlies the
structural and functional defects observed in the mutant cardiomyocytes. Based on this finding, we hypothesize
that impaired postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation, in which the primary MTOC fails to switch from the
centrosome to the perinuclear region, is a new general paradigm for the pathogenesis of cDCM. Remarkably,
we found that a small molecule C19 can restore cardiomyocyte maturation and reverse every feature of cDCM,
including impaired pnMTOC assembly, in the induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM)
model. To better understand the composition and the functional role of pnMTOC important for proper sarcomere
alignment during cardiomyocyte maturation, we will utilize the following specific aims: 1) Determine which
centrosome proteins are dependent on RTTN for perinuclear relocalization during cardiomyocyte maturation; 2)
Determine which centrosome proteins play a functional role in MT cytoskeleton assembly and sarcomere
alignment in mature cardiomyocytes, and 3) Elucidate the mechanism by which C19 rescues pnMTOC assembly
in RTTN-/- cardiomyocytes. The proposed research is highly innovative in that it leverages the newly discovered
insights to cDCM pathogenesis to develop future precision medicines with a transformational impact on the lives
of infants with this devastating illness."
11081831,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With widespread public concern about the increasing presence of smartphone and social media (SSM)
technologies in the lives of American youth,1–3 there is a conspicuous need for investment in rigorous scientific
work that will inform our understanding of the psychological precursors of SSM habits, and on the impacts that
these habits may have on subsequent development and everyday functioning. While a foundational literature is
starting to form, research on the origins and outcomes of SSM habits remains skeletal, and two basic
questions are still unanswered: 1) Are the correlates of digital media habits stable across development, or do
they vary with age? 2) In what direction do these relationships ensue – do observed correlations reflect
individual differences that presage subsequent variation in SSM habit formation/intensity, or, do they reflect the
impacts of SSM habits on consequent brain/psychological development and everyday functioning? The
present study aims to refine our answers to these key questions through a multi-methodological (behavior,
neuroimaging, self-reports, ecological momentary assessment) cross-sequential investigation of the individual
differences factors that prospectively predict SSM habit formation and of the outcomes associated with
intensification of such habits across development. Through an initial cross-sectional assay of children,
adolescents, and young adults, we will investigate whether the relations between psychological/brain
functioning and SSM behaviors vary as a function of age. In a subsequent longitudinal phase, we will
concurrently track trajectories of psychological/brain maturation, everyday functioning (e.g., academic
outcomes, psychological and physical wellbeing), and SSM engagement, in order to shed light on the temporal
chain of processes linking mental functioning and SSM usage. Our investigative team is extremely well
positioned to execute the proposed research, which will draw heavily from the theoretical framing and methods that
have propelled our previous work, and which will recruit from active developmental cohorts who have participated in
related recent studies implemented in our labs. Based on guiding neurodevelopmental theories, we hypothesize
that individual differences in self-regulatory control, reward and sensation seeking, reactivity to social inputs,
and risk-taking propensity will be differentially predictive of usage patterns at varying points in development,
and that these relationships will be shown to have bidirectional interactions with intensifying SSM behaviors,
with important implications for everyday functioning."
11082910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is an urgent need to fully understand the fundamental mechanisms governing brain development
during the early postnatal period, a period that is critical in establishing the correct brain wiring for lifelong
behavioral and cognitive functions and a period during which, unsurprisingly, symptoms of many
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) start to manifest. The functional maturation of the postnatal brain is highly
influenced by neuronal activity, but the mechanisms by which neuronal activity drives synaptic and circuit
maturation are poorly understood. It is particularly challenging to gain a whole brain view of the maturation
process because, in addition to the tremendous heterogeneity within the neuronal population, activity-dependent
maturation is highly variable across the brain, with different regions undergoing maturation at different times and
speeds. To meet this challenge, we have developed a genetic tool to capture the neuronal populations as they
undergo activity-dependent circuit maturation. With this tool combined with tissue clearing and whole brain
volume imaging, we propose to construct, for the first time, a spatiotemporal map of postnatal whole brain circuit
maturation. We will also examine the whole brain impact of developmental interventions, paving the way to
creating a discovery platform to study NDDs. Finally, taking advantage of our ability to distinguish neurons that
have undergone activity-dependent maturation from their less mature counterparts, we propose to uncover
molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent brain development. Our proposed research will provide
much-needed knowledge of postnatal brain development, and ultimately inform the design of future therapeutic
interventions to ameliorate symptoms of NDDs."

The long-term objective of this grant is to define the relationship between infant respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) infection and the host response that enables asthma inception using both
a longitudinal birth cohort (Project 1) and a mouse model of RSV infection (Project 2). The
goals of Project 1 are two-fold: first to identify RSV strains associated with asthma inception,
and second to understand the mechanisms through which these RSV strains cause asthma in
humans. To test our hypotheses, we propose to extend longitudinal follow-up of the 1900
children enrolled in the established INSPIRE birth cohort who will be four at the end of the first
U19 funding period. This will enable us to confirm if the RSV strains that we have identified to
cause more severe infant morbidity and early wheezing outcomes are also associated with
asthma development and the pathways through which these RSV strains cause asthma. We
propose to test our hypotheses through the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Identify RSV strains
associated with asthma inception and respiratory morbidity at ages 6 to 8 years. Specific Aim 2:
Determine how RSV strains differentially impact the host microbial environment during primary
RSV infection, if those microbial changes persist with time, and if microbial changes are
associated with changes in immune responses and asthma development. Specific Aim 3:
Assess primary airway epithelial cell (AEC) response to asthmagenic RSV strains. We will in
vitro identify the differential AEC responses from INSPIRE children with their infecting strains
and asthmagenic RSV strains. Specific Aim 4: Determine RSV induced memory T cell and
innate responses associated with asthma inception in the INSPIRE cohort. We will use non-
asthmagenic (control) and asthmagenic strains of RSV to stimulate PBMCs in children with and
without RSV-associated asthma at ages 3 and 6 years, and compare responses. We propose
an innovative set of studies identifying asthmagenic RSV strains and elucidating mechanisms of
RSV-mediated asthma development by determining how RSV strains interact with the host to
cause asthma."
11085789,"Summary/abstract: Stimulants provide major challenges in the US. In a recent year, almost 7.5 million
Americans reported cocaine or methamphetamine use. More than 32 million amphetamine prescriptions were
written for conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. 1.75 million Americans
reported amphetamine or cocaine use disorders. There were > 212,000 admissions to stimulant use disorder
treatment programs. However, there is no FDA-approved stimulant use disorder pharmacotherapeutic.
The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase D (PTPRD) is a novel target for new drugs that aid abstinence
from stimulants by reducing reward from stimulants. We have developed pentilludin (NHB1109), a novel
PTPRD phosphatase inhibitor, to advance to clinical use. Pentilludin inhibits PTPRD phosphatase with Ki 690
nM potency. Its composition of matter patent application has received notice of allowance from USPO.
Pretreatments with 20 mg/kg pentilludin reduce rat amphetamine self-administration and mouse cocaine-
conditioned place preference. Pentilludin displays good selectivity vs sites assessed by EUROFINS screens
and phosphatases that include PTP1B. It provides good results in studies of its carcinogenicity, hERG channel
effects, CYP activities and CYP induction. It is metabolized in plasma > hepatic microsomes and competes for
activity of recombinant paraoxonases, supporting its role as a substrate for these plasma enzymes. There is no
toxicity noted in dogs, rats or mice repeatedly dosed with 15, 75 and 100 mg/kg/d, respectively (chemistry,
hematology or histopathology except idiosyncratic rodent renal tubular basophilic lesions not seen in dogs, a
pattern found with many drugs that provide no human toxicity). Repeated mouse doses > 150 mg/kg/d po
provide dose-limiting reductions in oral intake and weight. We have recently completed a successful FDA
preIND meeting (PIND #169179). FDA indicated that our proposed studies were generally correct, but that we
needed to add more dosing levels, greater n and to repeat some nonGLP work under GLP conditions.
This supplement to UG3 support will allow us to complete more of the expanded list of GLP studies required
by FDA, moving pentilludin closer to the threshold of first use in humans. It will allow us to add additional n and
additional dose levels to our previously-planned rat and dog GLP studies. It will allow us to repeat genotoxicity
and hERG work under GLP conditions. We will work with NIDA staff and experienced consultants to complete
an efficient a series of these IND-enabling studies. We anticipate that this supplement will allow us to satisfy
NIDA criteria for transition to UH3. UH3 work, in turn, will allow us to complete GMP pentilludin synthesis, IND
submission, first in human/ascending dose studies and repeated dose phase I studies. This supplementary
support will allow us to move closer to these goals for this highly-promising compound."
11081610,"An estimated 294,000 people live with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States of which over 40,000 are
veterans. Though several therapeutic directions have shown promise in experimental paradigms, there does not
exist a restorative treatment clinically that can significantly reverse the neurological deficits associated with SCI
to improve function. At the forefront of experimental regenerative therapies that are being translated to clinical
trials for human SCI is the transplantation of cells, from neural and mesenchymal stem cells to Schwann cells
and olfactory ensheathing cells. Though benefits are observed with cell implantation after SCI, critical challenges
associated with their use remains, including poor viability within the injured spinal cord, the need for an
immunosuppressant when not autologous as well as the possibility of unwanted cell differentiation, proliferation,
or migration of the implantation cells leading to various undesirable effects. Whereas combinatory approaches
have been demonstrated to overcome some of these deficiencies, an alternate strategy to exogenous cell
therapy is to stimulate host repair through exosomal vesicles (EVs). EVs are nanosized endocytic vesicles that
cells release into the immediate environment, allowing transfer of biomolecules between them. EVs contain a
variety of cargoes from microRNA to proteins and signaling intermediaries that can promote cell survival,
differentiation, axon growth and myelination or subdue inflammation and scar formation. There is a growing
consensus that EVs play a crucial role in regulating the adult neural stem niche. These EVs also offer the
capacity to be engineered to express a fluorescent label, be targeted to a selective cell type, or be loaded with
specific cargoes (e.g. small molecules, peptides, and miRNAs) for tissue or targeted cell specific delivery.
 Recent advances in our understanding of cell derived EVs and realization of their therapeutic potential in
conditions such as stroke and cardiovascular disease have expanded the EV field. However, their use as a
therapeutic modality after SCI has been limited and remains largely in its infancy. In the proposed studies, we
will focus on the comparative assessment of the neuroprotective, neurogenic and the regenerative potential of
EVs derived from disparate parental cell populations and under different cell culture conditions. Microglia (MG)
and Schwann cells (SCs), immunologically primed or growth-stimulated, will be evaluated for their capacity to
promote repair and recovery in murine models of subacute SCI to answer fundamental questions of feasibility,
delivery, and efficacy. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished through two Specific Aims. In Aim
1, the most effective cell-derived EV type will be identified according to their ability to promote neural cell survival
and axon growth in vitro. Further, the aim will optimize their in vivo delivery in an experimental SCI mouse model
and assess their comparitive effects on ameliorating inflammation, astrogliosis and regeneration associated gene
(RAG) expression repression while promoting neurogenesis, axonal growth and functional recovery. The vesicle
content of the most efficacious EV after SCI will be characterized with respect to its nucleic acid content to
identify specfic microRNA sequences that correlate with their reparative potential. In Aim 2 EVs will be
engineered for cell-specific delivery of reparative and neurogenic microRNA. The feasibility and functionality of
microglia and Schwann cell derived EV engineering for NSC targeting with a specific microRNA: miRNA-9, that
has been demonstrated to alter the neural stem cell fate program, neurogenesis and the restriction of gliogenesis,
respectively while promoting angiogenesis. The engineered EV will be tested using in vitro assays and, in vivo
experiments for effects on functional efficacy.The overall objective of the proposed studies is to improve
our understanding of how cell derived EVs may be involved in neurorepair and whether they can be
engineered to further enhance their beneficial effects on host cells and subsequent reparative actions
following SCI."
11082605,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite declines in combustible cigarette smoking among young adults, use of electronic nicotine delivery
systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes, continues to rise. Young adulthood marks a particularly susceptible
time for the experimentation and initiation of substance use behaviors, including tobacco. Further, some who
initiate tobacco use with ENDS transition to combustible products, such as cigarettes or marijuana, or become
users of multiple products (dual/poly users). Despite the addiction potential of ENDS
and high interest in
quitting among young adults
, there are few resources available to help individuals quit
or reduce their use of
ENDS. The aim of the proposed research is to develop an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) text-
message based intervention for young adult ENDS and dual (ENDS and cigarette) users (K99 phase 1), and
determine whether the intervention is effective in
reducing ENDS use (primary outcome) and increasing
cessation
, quit attempts, and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; secondary outcomes; R00 phase 2).
In phase 1 (K99), we will determine intervention content and delivery schedule based on existing evidence-
based smoking cessation materials as well as utilize focus groups with young adult ENDS users (both ENDS-
only and dual users) to adapt content to an mHealth ENDS-specific intervention. We will then run an initial pilot
study with
45
participants to determine intervention feasibility and acceptability. After the pilot intervention, we
will conduct additional focus groups with individuals who participated in the pilot to further refine the
intervention. In phase 2 (R00), we will conduct a randomized control trial to determine the intervention’s effect
on ENDS outcomes. Young adult ENDS and dual users will be randomized to one of
three
conditions: 1)
mHealth ENDS intervention,
2) standard ENDS advice+NRT, or 3) standard advice alone
. Standard advice will
include a website that will be updated with information on products/safety and strategies for ENDS cessation
as information evolves over the course of the study. Participants in the mHealth condition will complete a 6-
week text-message based intervention with content tailored based on 1) motivation to quit ENDS, 2) whether
an individual uses ENDS only or is a dual user of tobacco products, and 3) target quit date. Participants will
complete an assessment of ENDS behaviors, quit attempts, and use of NRT at 3-month follow-up. ENDS
use
frequency will be the primary outcome
, while biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence, NRT
use, and quit attempts will be the secondary outcomes of interest. This study’s findings will inform emerging
ENDS intervention literature, an area where a clear evidence base is currently lacking, and whether a mHealth
intervention can impact young adults’ ENDS cessation, behaviors, and barriers to NRT use. This project will
serve to provide valuable mentorship and training complementary to the proposed research to facilitate Dr.
Brett’s transition to an independently-funded investigator and clinical addiction and tobacco control scientist."
11082821,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age is the number one risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), however, the mechanisms that drive age-associated
joint changes and how these contribute to cartilage damage are not well defined. As OA joint tissues age, it is
well established that cartilage-forming stem cells (CSCs) display a significant decline in their ability to
differentiate, and the joint environment becomes more inflammatory. Both of these factors together undermine
the ability to recover from injuries and also contributes to the failure of autologous stem cell therapies. Thus, we
propose an innovative dual strategy which will address both. We hypothesize that activation of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6)
will rejuvenate older CSCs, and apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibition will reestablish a
regenerative environment in the joint. Together, this novel solution has the potential to greatly augment the ability
for CSC differentiation and cartilage repair in the aged population. We will test this hypothesis and determine the
epigenetic mechanisms that SIRT6 regulate in the following three Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanisms by which (a) SIRT6 activation and (b) ASK1 inhibition enhance the cartilage-forming differentiation
and pro-survival activities of aged CSCs. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of SIRT6 activation, in the
presence of ASK1 inhibition to stimulate cartilage formation in aged, male and female rodents. Finally, in Aim 3,
we will determine the efficacy of SIRT6 activation and ASK1 inhibition to promote cartilage regeneration and
repair in response to chondral injury in a pre-clinical aged minipig model. These Aims will be achieved through
comprehensive in vitro analysis of young and old (male and female) CSCs and macrophages, in proof-of-concept
aging rodent models (mice and rats), and a clinically relevant large animal chondral defect model (aged minipig).
Importantly, the findings from this proposal are likely to give unique and important insights into the role of
epigenetic regulation of aged cells and the role of the surrounding environment in other aging and diseased
tissues. If successful, the overall impact of this novel pro-regenerative therapy to ameliorate the ravages of aging
and joint injury would represent a significant advancement in the treatment of age-associated diseases, such as
OA. Additionally, it will lead to the discovery of new disease-modifying treatments for other organ systems and
increase the ability of the aged population to live a healthy, mobile life."

Delusions are psychotic symptoms that contribute to significant emotional distress, poorer quality of life,
functional impairment, hospitalization and violence. Delusions are treatment-resistant in many patients.
Mechanistic understanding of delusion severity remains elusive, limiting treatment advancement. Abnormal
belief updating is a proposed mechanistic framework of delusions with accumulating evidentiary support. My
K23 mentored patient-oriented career development award proposes a longitudinal examination of delusion
severity and belief updating in psychotic disorder patients recovering from an acute episode of psychosis. This
project will use computational and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) approaches to 1) determine how belief
updating parameters change throughout six months of recovery from an acute delusional state, and 2)
characterize neurobiological correlates of belief updating parameters as symptom severity changes. I am an
Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center on the Clinician Scientist-Investigator (tenure) Track. My long-term career goal is to build an
independent research program that employs sophisticated cognitive neuroscience techniques to test
mechanistic models of psychosis, and then use that knowledge to develop and test novel interventions. These
goals are being supported by a K23 mentored career development award, that includes training in: 1) the
computational and cognitive neuroscience of delusions, 2) longitudinal research design and statistics, and 3)
intervention research to prepare the me for a translational research career. Mentored training and completion
of the proposed project will provide me the skills and experience necessary to launch a successful independent
research career. I am therefore requesting an administrative supplement to my K23 parent award following the
critical life event of childbirth. In January 2024, I gave birth to my child, and I am currently on parental leave.
This critical life event was not anticipated when I developed my K-award timeline and career development
goals. While my child is still small, I will have reduced flexibility to oversee data collection and less predictable
time set aside for time-intensive analysis of neuroimaging data and in-person coursework. I am therefore
requesting supplemental funds to support effort of a research assistant and neuroimaging data analyst, in
addition to asynchronous online coursework focused on longitudinal data analysis. These additional resources
will support final data collection on my parent award and analysis of study aims, as I move into the final years of
my award period. This will support the continuity of my research and career development during this critical
time in my life; it will allow me to continue on my current research trajectory towards becoming an
independent investigator studying the cognitive mechanisms of psychosis and developing novel interventions to
treat these debilitating symptoms."
11084640,"Project Summary
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the locus of the brain’s circadian clock, plays a critical role in mediating
circadian rhythmicity of numerous important functions. A growing body of work supports that these actions are
not only mediated via hard-wired efferent projections from the SCN, but also via diffusible signals. Still, the routes
by which diffusible signals from the SCN act, and whether and how this signaling modality is regulated, remains
to be determined. Almost 90 years after the discovery of thehypothalamic-pituitary portal system, considered
the sole brain portal system in the brain, we identified a new portal system connecting the SCN and a
cirumventricular organ, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) in mouse. This novel
portal system, named hereSCN-OVLTP, stands as a likely candidate vascular route by which small amounts of
biologically significant secretions generated in the SCN could reach specialized local targets in the OVLT.
Because the OVLT provides the portal system with direct access to the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), this system
can orchestrate rhythms throughout the body. For this to be proven, fundamental properties of the SCN-OVLTP,
including directionality of blood flow and underlying regulatory mechanisms, must be determined. To address
this critical gap in our knowledge, we first asked whether the SCN-OVLTp pathway occurs in rats as we showed
for mice. Using iDisco clearing and high resolution light sheet microcopy our exciting preliminary data indicates
that the SCN-OVLTP is in fact present in the rat. The OVLT, like the SCN, is a heterogeneous structure, and it
will be critical to assess which OVLT compartments are targets of signals carried in the portal pathway. We
developed a novel surgical/imaging experimental approach that enables, for the first time, the in vivo assessment
of blood flow and its regulation in the SCN-OVLTp. We determined that blood flows unidirectionally from the SCN
towards the OVLT and that it varies according to the day-night cycle. In addition, we show that systemic
vasopressin (VP) can access and travel within this portal system. Collectively, these data lead us to propose the
overarching novel hypothesis that the SCN-OVLTP is a functionally relevant route by which low amounts of
signals generated within the SCN can act in a diffusible manner to efficiently regulate distant targets via the CSF.
The proposed work will delineate (1) where the portal vessels originate within the SCN, and the targets reached
by the portal vessels within the OVLT and its fenestrated blood vessels, and thence to the CSF; and (2) whether
blood flow within the SCN-OVLTP is regulated in an activity-dependent manner, by photic stimulation and/or by
systemic homeostatic challenges. Using a multidisciplinary approach and state-of-the-art techniques in Aim 1
we will characterize the SCN-OVLTP in the rat to determine the origin of the portal vessels within the SCN and
their targets in the OVLT. In Aim 2, we will define whether blood flow directionality and velocity within SCN-
OVLTP is amenable to regulation. We expect results from this work to contribute to a better understanding of
fundamental mechanisms by which the SCN orchestrates circadian rhythmicity throughout the body.

competencies in implementation science to design an intervention prototype for an R01 network intervention.
Research Project. This proposed five-year mixed-methods project explores the health implications of natural
event-driven displacement for PWH in San Juan, PR. It aims to establish the link between natural event-related
displacement and PWH's continuity of care and mental health. The study addresses how HIV providers, PWH,
and organizations respond to natural events to bridge service gaps amid temporary or permanent
displacement. Employing SNA and longitudinal analysis it investigates how strategies at individual, community,
and government levels can be created with social network to improve HIV treatment continuity and mental
health support during natural events.
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine the displacement generated by natural events and the impact on HIV and
mental health care in PR. Aim 2. Identify the role of social networks related to natural event response for HIV
and mental health care continuity in PR. Aim 3. Systematically develop an intervention prototype,

Caregiver Speech and Brain-Behavior Development in Infants At-Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder
The defining symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge only after an initial presymptomatic period during
the first year of life. The first year of life is also a time of tremendous growth and neuroplasticity for the infant
brain. The overall goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to enable and inform presymptomatic infant
interventions for autism by examining the relationships between infant vocalizations, caregiver speech, and
brain-behavior development in infants at high familial risk for autism. Conceptually, the project focuses on the
potential protective effects of caregiver speech on infant development. The proposed study is a companion to
and collaboration with the IBIS Network-Early Prediction Study, an NIH-sponsored study of 250 infants at high
familial risk for autism. All infants in the study have an older sibling with autism. These high-risk infants have a
20% probability of developing autism themselves.
Ecologically valid day-long home language recordings will be collected when infants are 6 and 12 months of age.
A state-of-the-art automated processing pipeline will used to estimate daily counts of infant and caregiver speech
quality and quantity. Micro-level targeted annotation will be applied to semi-structured, parent-infant play
sessions collected in the lab. Automated processing pipelines and micro-level targeted annotation will be used
to generate multivariate infant vocalizations and caregiver speech data. Infant vocalizations will be classified as
speech-like or non-speech-like (delight or distress). Caregiver speech variables include lexical diversity, mean
length utterance, and temporal contingency.
The study will determine if infant vocalizations predict subsequent autism diagnosis and later language and
social communication scores, and specify the relationship between caregiver speech and infant communication
skills. Diffusion MRI will be collected when infants are 6, 12, and 24 months of age by the Early Prediction Study.
The proposed study will determine if multivariate caregiver speech is related to targeted prefrontal and temporal
brain regions. By determining if caregiver speech can have a protective effect on brain development, we forge a
new scientific approach to studying communication development in infants at high-risk for autism.
As first-year autism detection and presymptomatic intervention become increasingly feasible, an evidence base
is needed to inform interventions. The proposed study will identify infant-based language and communication
risk markers, caregiver-based intervention targets, and brain-based monitoring biomarkers to guide
presymptomatic intervention for autism that is parent-mediated and delivered in the natural setting."

The Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) in Botswana conducts research related to adult and pediatric HIV
therapeutic strategies; interventions to address HIV-associated infections/conditions in pediatric and
maternal populations; treatment and prevention of tuberculosis in adults (including pregnant women) and
children with and without HIV; and integrated HIV prevention strategies in pediatric and adult
populations.
These activities occur through participation in three research networks: 1) the ACTG; 2) IMPAACT, and
3) HPTN. We perform multi-center studies at our two established CRSs: one in Gaborone (all 3

village in Botswana. We thus work with both urban and village populations of all ages and of both sexes.
The primary objective of this CTU project in Botswana is to participate in and and contribute to the
following high-impact areas of research:
• Novel and durable treatments for HIV in adults (including pregnant women) and children

11082250,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Administrative / Biostatistics Core)
The SuperAging Consortium includes a network of Sites, Cores, multidisciplinary data collection and two
Projects. The Administrative/Biostatistics Core will provide governance and fiscal oversight, maintain scientific
integrity, deliver data management and biostatistical support, and harmonize the goals and activities of the
Cores, Sites, Research Projects, with each other, with the NIA and with extramural collaborators for the
SuperAging Consortium. The Admin/Biostats Core will play a pivotal role in integrating the components of the
Consortium so the whole is more than the sum of its parts through three Aims. Aim 1 will provide overall
leadership, operational, and administrative support for the SuperAging Consortium including coordinating regular
meetings among Cores, Projects, data collection Sites, managing reporting, monitoring, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal. Aim 2 will establish an Executive Committee with regular meetings and leadership from
each of the components of the SuperAging Consortium and the NIA to proactively facilitate research, and
promote the productive utilization of resources generated by the SuperAging Consortium. Aim 3 will appoint a
Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ensure their recommendations are implemented. Aim 4 will develop and
manage a tightly integrated data repository and provide biostatistical support for the SuperAging Consortium.
Collectively, these efforts will enable efficient completion of the investigations outlined here as well as additional
intramural and extramural collaborative ventures."
11082254,"ABSTRACT (Project 1)
Project 1 will leverage the SuperAging Consortium to test the supposition that SuperAgers have relatively
preserved physiologic and behavioral complexity, compared to Controls, in the domains of physical activity,
autonomic responsivity (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate), sleep, and social engagement. The number of people
80 years and older is expected to triple to ~ 426 million by the year 2050 making successful aging an essential
social and economic priority. Typical aging is associated with challenges responding dynamically to heightened
system demands (internal or external). This loss of responsiveness, and/or ability to stabilize the system, (framed
theoretically as a ‘loss’ of physiologic and behavioral ‘complexity’) accounts for a number of age-related declines
in neural connectivity, balance control, memory, among others. However, SuperAgers appear immune to some
age-related cognitive changes, and thus represent an ‘ideal’ aging target. Whilst SuperAgers self-report
increased physical activity and social engagement compared to their Controls, little is known about the actual
physiologic and behavioral differences that distinguish SuperAgers. This is a critical missing link in understanding
processes that underlie potential pathways to successful aging. The SuperAging Consortium offers a unique
opportunity to reveal this missing link, and importantly, to do so in a diverse cohort. Understanding how loss of
complexity manifests in everyday activities requires sensitive, multiple time-scale, measurements capable of
capturing dynamic and complex behaviors in a way not afforded by point-in-time and clinical assessments. We
will collect mechanoacoustic sensor recordings, during every day activities, over 24-hour time periods for two
weeks in both SuperAgers and their Controls co-enrolled with the Clinical/Imaging Core. Using multiscale entropy
approaches we will generate a ‘complexity’ score that captures the quality, quantity, range, and consistency of
physical activity, autonomic nervous system function, sleep, and social engagement behaviors within, and
across, days. In Aim 1, we will determine whether loss of complexity in physical activity and autonomic nervous
system (ANS) activity differentiates SuperAgers from Controls. In Aim 2, we will determine whether loss of
complexity in sleep quality and ANS activity during sleep differentiates SuperAgers from Controls. In Aim 3, we
will determine whether complexity in social engagement differentiates SuperAgers from Controls. We predict
that compared to their Controls, SuperAgers will demonstrate higher physical activity complexity and higher
autonomic function complexity reflecting greater overall levels and quality of physical activity; lower (i.e., better)
sleep complexity scores reflecting lower variability in sleep patterns; and higher social engagement complexity
scores suggesting they are more consistently engaged in verbal activities compared to typical agers. Project 1
will expand the SuperAging phenotype, reveal whether SuperAgers are immune to loss of physiologic and
behavioral complexity, and will accelerate geroscience discoveries by fostering future high impact studies that
can address novel hypotheses linking biological, physiologic, and behavioral mechanism of aging."

The overall goal of this diversity supplement is to provide Mr. Rojas with a niche research area in
addition to the parent R03 and facilitate his career development within biomedical sciences. While
the parent grant focuses on the impacts of Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on maternal-to-
zygotic transition and histone acetylation, the supplement focuses on the role of naa10- an N-
terminal (Nt) acetyltransferase (NAT) gene that is potentially a crucial regulator of the newly
synthesized proteome by stabilizing them through Nt acetylation. Our hypothesis for the
supplement grant is that the developmental toxicity observed in TBBPA-exposed embryos is partly
driven by inhibition of naa10, resulting in inhibited Nt- acetylation of peptides. Based on this
premise, the additional aims described differ from the parent grant as it is focused on a different
(but linked) mechanism of TBBPA-induced toxicity during the same exposure regime. Within the
supplement, aim 1 will determine the role of naa10 in TBBPA-induced developmental delays
through naa10 mRNA injections, phenotyping and qPCR. In aim 2, Mr. Rojas will profile naa10-
induced effects on Nt-acetylation by cloning naa10, purifying protein and conduct Nt-acetylation
assay. Overall, within this supplement, I will mentor Mr. Rojas to achieve training in several
molecular biology strategies such as cloning, microinjection, protein purification and biomolecular
assays. Coupled with his training in -omics and data integration within the parent grant, this
supplement will provide Mr. Rojas an exciting opportunity to lead an independent project in
molecular toxicology and learn molecular techniques. In addition, it will also provide him with
several opportunities to be proficient in scientific writing, networking, conference presentations
that will be valuable for his professional development and career goals."

Project Summary
The objective of this proposal is to broaden the capabilities of current synthetic biology tools by specifically
focusing on yeast as biosensors, therapeutics, and as sense-and-respond communities. Living cells are
positioned to be one of the next transformative technologies for therapeutic treatment. Rather than giving a
purified small molecule or a purified protein as the drug, the living cell, in this case yeast, can be applied in situ
at the site of disease that will continuously produce the necessary therapeutic. There are many advantages to
using living yeast, as opposed to bacteria or mammalian cells as the in situ therapeutic, as they are cheap, easily
scalable, easy to store, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae arguably has the most powerful genetic and synthetic
biology tools for cell engineering. This project involves several different arms working in tandem: we plan to
develop yeast that can sense different bacterial infections in wounds, yeast that can secrete different antibiotics
in wounds, and finally yeast that secrete specific antibiotics in response to the bacteria present in the wound. This
research combines our expertise working with antibiotics and wound healing to become a more sophisticated
method of disease treatment. Yeast that can sense bacterial infections and secrete different antibiotics ultimately
can be broadly applied beyond wound healing. The sensing and therapeutic approaches developed here should
be broadly enabling in the longer term for making yeast sense-respond communities for treating human disease
beyond bacterial infections and antibiotics.

This diversity supplement provides doctoral training for Ms. Avary Evans within the Building Resilience and
Nurturing Children's Health (BRANCH; R01DA055630) study. BRANCH investigates the influence of rural
environments on neurobehavioral vulnerabilities to drug use. Children in rural areas face higher addiction risk
due to socioeconomic and resource disparities that affect their development. The study collects comprehensive
data on 250 children starting at age 7, using fMRI to assess reward sensitivity, biospecimens to evaluate stress
biology, and various measures of risk and protective processes.
 The supplement supports Ms. Evans, a doctoral student at the University of Georgia, to examine
neuroendocrine processes influencing the development of reward sensitivity. Reward sensitivity, a significant
predictor of drug use vulnerability, undergoes notable changes during pubertal maturation starting with
adrenarche (ages 7-9). This work aims to clarify the influence of adrenarcheal timing on reward sensitivity and
how socioeconomic hardship (SES-H) moderates this relationship. The first aim is to investigate how
adrenarcheal timing, measured via dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, predicts activation in the reward
network during a task 18 months later. The second aim is to explore how SES-H amplifies the relationship
between early adrenarche and reward sensitivity.
 Ms. Evans will receive training to integrate hormonal data with developmental hypotheses, understand
addiction neuroscience, conduct data analysis, and pursue professional development. This supplement aims to
empower Ms. Evans with the necessary skills to excel in her career as an independent addiction scientist."

This Administrative Supplement will support post-baccalaureate researcher, Gabriela Gutierrez, to
receive research training through her mentored leadership of a project characterizing the bilingual
language input and bilingual language production of children with hearing loss. The Supplement builds
on parent R01 (DC018542) that gathers objective, longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of
children with hearing loss (HL). Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing peers in preschool
classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how early vocal interaction with peers and teachers
contributes to the language development of children with and without HL. The parent R01 employs
computational models of child location and orientation to indicate when children are in social contact
with their peers and teachers. To support primary project analyses, the parent R01 characterizes
classroom speech as English and Spanish by harnessing noise-robust automatic speech recognition
tools. The parent R01 Aim 1 determines whether exposure to partner speech longitudinally predicts
children’s speech to those partners. To support that Aim, Supplement activities include a) conducting
expert (manual) transcription of R01 audio recordings in English and Spanish to determine the content
of children and teachers’ vocalizations and b) assessing the reliability of automated speech recognition
tools when compared to expert transcription. Automated speech recognition tools will include Open AI’s
Whisper, which is a privacy-preserving deep learning neural network. Ms. Gutierrez will train and
supervise a team of experts to transcribe segments of English and Spanish child and teacher speech to
quantify multiple features of classroom language. These features are mean length of utterance (MLU),
lexical diversity, questions, responsivity to partner utterances, and the alignment of teacher and child
speech, e.g., the degree to which teachers and children use the same words as their interlocutor in
responses. Ms. Gutierrez will be mentored in the selection and use of automated tools, the calculation
of reliability measures, the interpretation and write-up of study statistical results, and the intersection of
children’s bilingualism and hearing loss. As the Supplement research focuses on characterizing the
bilingual experiences in preschool classrooms,
Ms. Gutierrez’s bilingual language skills are critical for
the successful completion of the project. The training afforded to her by the Supplement will help her
accomplish her long-term objective of conducting independent research focused on language
development and bilingualism. In support of this long-term objective, Ms. Gutierrez will pursue three
Supplement goals: expand her knowledge base in language research and bilingual development (Goal
1); enhance her computational and quantitative analysis skills (Goal 2); and develop her leadership
abilities in conducting research with diverse populations (Goal 3)."
11066748,"Optimization of a modified immunotherapeutic LANA antigen for use in treating persons with HIV/AIDS
and refractory KSHV-related cancers (Immuno/Microenvironment).
ABSTRACT
This PA-20-272 administrative supplement to the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center Support Grant (P30CA047904)
is directly responsive to the Immunotherapy and Tumor Microenvironment in HIV/AIDS Cancer Patients at
NCI-Designated Cancer Centers Administrative Supplement Announcement for P30 Cancer Centers Support
Grants (CCSG). It focuses on research to 1) discover and characterize an immunotherapeutic target (KSHV
LANA), 2) by developing a new immunotherapeutic approach (protein engineering to enhance LANA peptide
presentation), that 3) improves our understanding of the immunosuppressive environment of KSHV tumors. It
is 100% aligned with NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities as a new and important approach to treat persistent or
recurrent AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in patients who have undergone immune reconstitution through
antiretroviral therapy. This proposal also addresses targeting KS in the aging KSHV+ HIV/AIDS population who
do not currently have KS but can be expected to be at high-risk for developing KS with aging.
The purpose of this study is to optimize LANA as an immunotherapeutic by changing the immunologically “cold”
LANA protein into an immunologically “hot” CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytic (CTL) antigen. Our preclinical mouse
study, using an ovalbumin T cell peptide reporter, reveals that the LANA central repeat domain 1 (CR1)
specifically inhibits LANA proteolytic processing and MHC I peptide presentation to evade cell-mediated
immunity. By deleting the CR1 domain and expressing LANADCR1 in murine MC38 cancer cells, we provoke a
robust CTL response with specific recognition and cell killing by OT-1 CD8+ cells. When wild-type LANA-
expressing MC38 cells are injected into syngeneic, immune-competent C57BL/6 mice, mice develop
monotonically-growing tumors that require termination, consistent with LANA-induced CTL immune escape. In
contrast, mice injected with MC38 cells expressing LANADCR1 show brief tumor formation and then tumor
regression, consistent with an effective anti-tumor CTL response. Both LANA- and LANADCR1-expressing cells
generate indistinguishable tumors when injected into Rag1-/- mice demonstrating that this differential response
is due to immune surveillance.
During this proposal period, we will further optimize the LANADCR1 as an immunotherapeutic antigen by
fragmenting the corresponding ORF73 gene, performing codon-optimization and removing additional repetitive
peptide regions and the nuclear localization signal that may contribute to reduced CTL responsiveness. We will
immunize mice with the optimized antigen and, after an appropriate boosting schedule, challenge the mice with
wild-type LANA only-expressing MC38 cells to determine whether optimized antigen can prevent tumor formation
through LANA epitope recognition. Successful conclusion of this study will set the stage for moving this vaccine
candidate into mRNA nanoparticle or virus-vector antigen presenting vaccines for animal studies as a preliminary
step to Phase I trials.

11047863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As many as 42% of American Samoan women develop gestational diabetes (GDM) in pregnancy, which
substantially elevates their risk of progressing to Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Genetic factors play a substantial
role in diabetes risk, underscoring the importance of utilizing genomic data for targeted screening, treatment,
and prevention. However, historical exclusion of PI populations from genetic research has hindered
advancements in inclusive precision health initiatives, particularly related to women's health. In >10 years of
research with Samoan communities our team identified a novel missense variant (rs373863828) in the
CREBRF gene that is common among Pacific Islanders, including American Samoans. The CREBRF variant is
associated with increased body mass, but is paradoxically protective against T2DM, making it an attractive
potential biomarker of diabetes risk. The impact of the CREBRF variant on GDM risk, progression to
postpartum T2DM, and the variant's mechanism of action remain unclear. However, preliminary data suggest
that CREBRF may protect against GDM and that the mechanism of protection may be improved insulin
secretion. To test these hypotheses, we will recruit a prospective cohort of 350 pregnant American Samoan
women enrolled in the first trimester and followed until 18 months postpartum. Through three pregnancy (10-14
weeks (w), 24-28w, and 32-26w) and four postpartum (6-12w, 6 months (m) 12 m, 18m) visits we will
comprehensively evaluate glucose homeostasis (frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests, HbA1c, and
continuous glucose monitoring) and insulin response. We will use cutting-edge statistical approaches to
examine how changes in glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion/action associated with CREBRF, which
are not currently captured by routine 24-28w oral glucose tolerance tests, influence GDM and postpartum
T2DM risk. Specifically, we will examine associations of CREBRF with glucose homeostasis during pregnancy
(Aim 1) and postpartum changes in glucose homeostasis and incident pre-DM/T2DM risk (Aim 2), whether
improved insulin secretion mediates the protective effect of CREBRF on diabetes risk (Aim 3), and explore the
connections between CREBRF, insulin secretion, and birth outcomes (Exploratory Aim 4). Our work has strong
potential to shift clinical practice and reduce diabetes disparities by proving insight into the potential for
CREBRF to serve as a genetic biomarker of GDM or T2DM risk. More broadly, uncovering important insight
into how the CREBRF variant regulates glucose homeostasis will inform future molecular studies to further
understand CREBRF's mechanism(s) of action, potentially leading to pharmacogenomic approaches and
future diabetes therapeutic targets for all populations. With expertise in epidemiology, diabetes, obstetrics,
endocrinology, and biostatistics, our team is ideally positioned to carry out this ground-breaking work to reduce
diabetes-related health disparities for American Samoan women."

Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death globally and the leading cause of
cancer death in women in 36 countries, including Zambia. The costs of implementing cervical
cancer prevention programs are high. Thus, Zambian health policymakers need to identify the
optimal cervical cancer prevention strategies for their setting. Mathematical models can help
generate such evidence. However, few model-based evaluations have considered the impact of
HIV on cervical carcinogenesis, and no such models are available for Zambia. The proposed
project aims to assist policymakers in Zambia in deciding on the optimal cervical cancer
prevention policy. Specifically, it aims (i) to adapt the openly available HPVsim model to Zambia
using robust estimates obtained through the analysis of Zambia-specific HPV and cervical cancer-
related databases, (ii) to enhance the HPVsim model by adding more detailed information on
cervical cancer stage at diagnosis, and (iii) to generate evidence on the (cost-)effectiveness of
cervical cancer prevention policies using the enhanced HPVsim model."
11081839,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Biologics with potential
to affect underlying pathophysiology have failed to display significant therapeutic benefits in the clinic. The
inability of biologics to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents their biggest hurdle to clinical efficacy.
A promising strategy to address this challenge is to fuse IgGs to a second affinity ligand that engages a
cerebrovascular endothelial target and induces transport across the BBB. While nearly all prior efforts have
focused on the transferrin receptor (TfR-1) as the prototypical endothelial target despite inherent delivery and
safety challenges, we have developed a bispecific antibody shuttle that engages CD98hc, the heavy chain of
the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT-1). Notably, our preliminary data show preserved affinity and
specificity of off-the-shelf IgGs incorporated into our first-generation CD98hc bispecific shuttle, superior brain
retention of IgGs shuttled via CD98hc as compared to TfR-1, and preserved endothelial levels of CD98hc and
brain uptake after saturating CD98hc shuttle doses.The overall objective of this proposal is to further the
development of the CD98hc BBB shuttle by: i) defining the optimal characteristics for maximal IgG brain
parenchymal delivery; ii) evaluating age- and disease-dependent effects on CD98hc-mediated transport; and iii)
generating proof-of-concept efficacy data in an AD mouse model using agonist (anti-TrkB) and antagonist (anti-
phospho-tau) antibodies alone and in combination. Our central hypothesis is that IgG transport via the CD98hc
shuttles will increase parenchymal delivery and achieve brain concentrations and target engagement
comparable to viral delivery, generating robust neuroprotection in a tau mouse model, including potential additive
or synergistic neuroprotective effects by targeting two different neuroprotective pathways. Therefore, we propose
in Aim 1 to optimize brain parenchymal delivery of a second-generation CD98hc antibody shuttle. We will test
the impact of the valency, affinity, and epitope of CD98hc interaction on brain uptake and parenchymal delivery.
The optimal dose and construct identified using adult mice will be tested in aged wild-type and PS19 (tau P301S)
mice to evaluate the integrity of the transport pathway. Next, in Aim 2, we will assess the efficacy of individual
neuroprotective antibody/CD98hc shuttles in PS19 mice. Validated antibodies against TrkB (C20, agonist) and
phosphorylated tau (PHF1) will be individually delivered via our best CD98hc shuttle. Efficacy outcomes will be
levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, neuronal and synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits. Efficacy will be
tested in three modes of treatment, beginning at early, intermediate, and late stages of progression of AD
pathology and cognitive decline. Finally, in Aim 3, the efficacy of combinations of antibody shuttles targeting
multiple neuroprotective pathways in PS19 mice will be evaluated. These studies are expected to provide new
fundamental knowledge related to the CD98hc transport pathway and preclinical data for bispecific AD
therapeutics, including combination therapies that target mechanistically unique neuroprotective pathways."

programs, the national need for genetically characterized eSPF rhesus macaques for HIV/AIDS research
continues to exceed current availability. It is imperative that the available eSPF rhesus macaque colonies
continue to expand to support this research and the advancement of human health. The successful
maintenance of eSPF colonies requires strict barrier management practices in order to remain specific
pathogen free. With over 22 years' experience in maintaining a colony of eSPF animals, the ONPRC is a
leader in managing eSPF rhesus macaques. The overall aims of the Husbandry and Management Core are
to expand the ONPRC eSPF breeding colony to meet existing and future animal resource demands,
continue to refine existing exemplary eSPF husbandry and veterinary care, and to diversify the eSPF

11084931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the United States are aged 50 or older, and they are at
increased risk for dementia and multimorbidity. Dementia is of major clinical policy concern because it results
in both inexorable clinical decline and extremely high costs of care. People with HIV are at particularly high risk
because they often have major risk factors for the development of traditional etiologies of dementia, such as
Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), and they also have a risk of
HIV-associated neurocognitive disease (HAND) despite sustained virologic suppression. Depression,
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and HIV are known to have potent synergies that contribute to the development
of dementia. These comorbidities are modifiable risk factors for dementia that are highly prevalent, known to
be undertreated in people with HIV, and likely to be clinically and economically important targets for prevention
and management.
The overall goal of this proposal is to provide an evidence-based approach for prioritizing and advocating for
interventions to improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality among people aging with HIV.
The benefits of reducing the burden of depression and CVD among people with HIV may currently be
underestimated, given that concomitant benefits related to multimorbidity are often not captured due to short
durations of observational or trial data. Determining which interventions are most clinically effective and cost-
effective is critically important to understand so that people aging with HIV can benefit from strategies to
reduce their risk of dementia and multimorbidity as they age. We propose to: 1) develop the Cognitive
impairment, HIV, Aging, heaRt, MEntal health, and Dementia (CHARMED) Model, including populating the
model with clinical and outcomes data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and
Design (NA-ACCORD) and nationally-representative cost data; 2) project clinical and economic outcomes of
people aging with HIV; and 3) perform cost-effectiveness analyses of targeted interventions to reduce the
burden of depression and CVD and to quantify the resultant reduction in dementia and multimorbidity.
This proposal comprises a unique collaboration of experts in methods that are complementary and essential to
complete the research aims: clinical expertise, epidemiology of people aging with HIV, costing, simulation
modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis. The proposed innovative multimorbidity model will be the first to
include these important comorbidities that are highly prevalent, demonstrate synergies that contribute to
dementia, and are amenable to treatment. The model structure and parameterization can both be revised with
the emergence of updated data and improved understanding of the synergies and pathophysiology. This
simulation modeling approach will allow for analyses of clinical and policy questions that aim to improve clinical
outcomes, improve quality of life, and reduce costs among people aging with HIV."

Project Summary
The overall goal of this grant is to use surgically removed brain tissue and CSF from elderly patients presenting
for hydrocephalus surgery to characterize the effects of early co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology on
these tissues and correlate these findings with clinical outcomes. Chronic hydrocephalus in the aging
population can occur for a variety of reasons, although the etiology is often unclear. In the absence of a clear
etiology, most of these cases are categorized as “Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus” (NPH). Placing a
ventricular shunt is often effective for symptom relief in the setting of NPH. At the time of shunt placement, a
cortical biopsy is often obtained at the brain entry point to look for possible coexistent brain pathology. Perhaps
not surprisingly, cortical biopsies taken from elderly NPH patients at shunt placement have been shown to
have a relatively high frequency of b-amyloid plaque pathology and occasional trace tau pathology, perhaps
because early-stage AD may be causing some of the symptoms attributed to NPH. We have recently
performed RNA-seq on 106 NPH biopsies and compared the results to histologic measures of b-amyloid and
tau and contemporaneous cognitive data. In contrast to the existing human AD autopsy literature, we identify a
homeostatic microglial module that partially replicates the decrease in homeostatic genes that is seen in the
mouse AD literature. These data suggest that our NPH biopsies are capturing some of the earliest changes in
AD physiology, and in doing so may serve as a conceptual bridge between some of the early responses seen
in the mouse literature and the post-mortem human AD literature. Motivated by these data, the goal of this
grant is to test the following three hypotheses: 1) Changes in microglial modules in our bulk RNA-seq data
reflect population shifts or changes in gene expression in microglial subtypes, 2) An evolving microglial
response in patient biopsies will correlate with alterations in CSF proteins, and 3) The microglial immune
response in patient biopsies has predictive value for cognitive decline that is different or additive to the degree
of b-amyloid and tau deposition in cortex. Completion of this project will identify CSF proteomic changes that
correlate with shifts in microglial populations and microglial gene expression changes, and place all of these
changes in the context of AD pathology density on biopsy and clinical outcomes.

11087895,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Inner ear hair cells have actin-filled projections known as stereocilia on the apical surface. These
stereocilia are microvilli-like structures that are arranged in highly organized rows of increasing heights
known as “hair bundles”. The stereocilia possess mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channels at
their tips where sound-induced vibration and head motion are converted into electrical signals.
Previously, Velez-Ortega et al. (Elife, 2017) demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton in stereocilia
exhibits MET-dependent remodeling as the stability of the stereocilia was crucially affected by alterations
to the constant entry of calcium through MET channels (which are partially open at rest). The actin
cytoskeleton within stereocilia is comprised of two actin isoforms, beta and gamma, which are produced
by two separate genes. Prior studies have elucidated that although hair cells can develop hair bundles
in the absence of either actin isoform, these bundles quickly degenerate resulting in hearing loss (Perrin
et al., PLoS Genet, 2010). Thus, it is apparent that both actin isoforms are required for proper stereocilia
stability and maintenance. Here, we hypothesize that a specific mutation in the gamma actin gene leads
to progressive hearing loss (in both human and mouse models) through the exaggeration of MET-
dependent remodeling of the aforementioned actin cytoskeleton. To investigate this hypothesis, Aim 1
will analyze MET-dependent changes to the morphology of stereocilia through scanning electron
microscopy after exposing gamma actin mutant mice and littermate controls to MET channel blockers or
an increase in intracellular calcium buffering. Given that beta and gamma actin exhibit different rates of
polymerization and depolymerization in the presence of calcium (Bergeron et al., J Biol Chem, 2010),
Aim 2 will evaluate how MET-dependent alterations affect the ratio of the beta and gamma actin isoforms
in both the stereocilia and cuticular plate of auditory hair cells in mutant mice and littermate controls using
immunohistochemistry and high-resolution confocal microscopy. Overall, results from this supplement
may elucidate the molecular mechanism that triggers stereocilia degeneration in sensorineural
progressive hearing loss when a mutation in the gamma actin gene is present."
11087906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social stress is a prevailing factor in the lives of all social species and can motivate the misuse of reinforcing
drugs such as alcohol. Individuals that use alcohol to alleviate the negative emotions created by social stress
are more likely to develop pathological drinking patterns, which can lead to an alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Indeed, an individual’s standing in a social hierarchy (i.e. social rank) is inversely related to alcohol
consumption in rodents and non-human primates as well as problematic drinking in humans, highlighting the
conserved impact of subordination stress on motivation for alcohol. Social rank also influences how individuals
respond to challenges, and social isolation is a particularly profound stressor with increasing human relevance.
Our data identify a previously unknown relationship between mouse social rank and isolation-associated
escalated alcohol drinking, where subordinates display a greater magnitude increase in drinking following
social isolation compared to dominants. These data suggest that low social rank may be a potent risk factor for
developing pathological alcohol drinking patterns. In addition, our data show a critical role of the amygdala-
cortical circuit in social isolation-induced escalated alcohol drinking. Notably, it is becoming increasingly
evident that social stress induces microglia-mediated neuroimmune responses in select stress-responsive
brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which contribute
to stress-induced behavioral adaptations. Indeed, social isolation-induced escalation of alcohol strongly
parallels increases in microglia previously seen following social stress, supporting a potential role for microglia
in isolation-induced adaptations in alcohol drinking. Despite the substantial evidence linking social stress and
alcohol drinking as well as the impact of social stress on neuroimmune signaling, virtually nothing is known
regarding the neuroimmune regulation of circuits underlying social stress-induced behavioral adaptions in
alcohol drinking. This supplement will fill this gap by (1) determining if BLA and mPFC glial activation is
predictive of social rank and isolation-associated alcohol drinking and (2) determining if individual differences in
social anxiety underlie social rank and isolation-associated alcohol drinking. The findings will provide insight
into the role of immune signaling and motivational differences underlying social rank and isolation-associated

11081205,"ABSTRACT
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-032. American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people experience a disparate burden of cancer than their
non-Indigenous counterparts. Critically, substantial differences in cancer burden exist across AIAN groups.
Receipt of timely and evidence-based guideline concordant cancer treatment contribute to survival disparities
affecting AIAN people. Survival is lower among AIAN people not receiving guideline-concordant cancer care;
however, when AIAN people do receive guideline-concordant treatment, cancer-specific survival does not differ
from that observed among NHW. Yet, little is known about variation in guideline-concordant care by region
among AIAN people, or about differences in receipt of guideline concordant care between people living in
Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Areas (i.e., counties that are served by or adjacent to IHS facilities) and
those that are not.
 Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of cancer among AIAN people by increasing access to
timely, guideline-concordant cancer care. Our current objective is to understand variations in and predictors of
receipt of timely, guideline-concordant cancer care by IHS region, and between PRCDA/non-PRCDA counties.
Our central hypothesis is that there will be substantial variation in receipt of guideline-concordant cancer care
among AIAN people. The rationale for this study is that locally relevant information is essential to support local-
level intervention development in collaboration with AIAN peoples.
 To address this objective, this research will pursue two specific aims and one exploratory aim. The first
aim will validate a set of healthcare quality metrics that can be used to assess receipt of timely and evidence-
based services during diagnosis, staging and first-line treatment among AIAN people using only cancer registry
data. We will then use these measures to assess multi-level predictors of timely and guideline-concordant care
among AIAN people across IHS regions using national cancer surveillance data.The second aim will examine
regional differences in predictors of outcomes for leading cancers (breast, lung, colorectal) among AIAN
people, including mediation by receipt of timely and guideline-concordant cancer care. The exploratory aim will
investigate how the associations observed in Aims 1 and 2 vary between AIAN between people living in
Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Areas (i.e., counties that are served by or adjacent to IHS facilities) and
those that are not. This research is innovative because it explores questions about which nothing is known for
AIAN people. Upon the successful completion of this research, we will have elucidated differences in guideline-
concordant cancer care and its relationship with outcomes by IHS region among AIAN people. This information
will provide critical information to understand variation in AIAN cancer disparities that will be used to drive
future healthcare-based structural and programmatic interventions."

The Data Science and Medical Image Analysis Training for Improved Health Care Delivery in Nigeria (DATICAN)
project is a UE5 DS-I Africa project funded by NIH. The main aim of DATICAN is to build capacity in Data Science
and medical image analysis. DATICAN’s overarching objective is to produce a new generation of data scientists
possessing the requisite data science skills in medical image analysis and the potential to become the clinical
research leaders needed to improve healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). DATICAN is a
collaborative effort amongst 4 universities, 3 in Nigeria and 1 in the USA, these are Lagos State University, The
University of Ibadan, Redeemer’s University and The University of Chicago. The project is funded for 3 years
from September 2023 to September 2026.
Project implementation started immediately after receiving the award letter in September 2023 and we have met
our target for year 1 recruitment. We have recruited 36 participants, comprising PhD and MSc students,
postdocs, and Faculty members. We are currently training and as contained in our year 1 plan, the USA trainers
have visited Nigeria and the Nigerian trainers have visited the USA this year.
DATICAN was structured to be skills acqusition-driven, hands-on and project-driven. To achieve these, each
trainee was given a project work related to improved healthcare delivery in SSA using data science and AI
knowledge. This implies that we have 36 use cases already. There are 3 major requirements for implementing
these use cases, these are the relevant skills set, local data peculiar to the SSA and computational resources.
We have started training the students and the progress recorded so far shows that DATICAN has the potential
to give the students the relevant skills required to execute their use cases. On local data, we have collected
medical images of 2000 individuals with different modalities (e.g. ultrasound, MRI, CT, etc) and different body
parts (brain, liver, abdomen, etc) and stored them on our hard drives, and there are many more to collect. The
unfortunate thing is that these images are unstructured, un-curated and some of them are even unlabelled.
This implies that the data are not in a useful form. On computational resources, imaging data are huge and
processing them requires access to compute infrastructure such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) with
Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). UChicago has given our trainees access to its HPC, the downside of this is
the lack of sustainability and scalability. DATICAN has a lifespan of 3 years and lack of access to
computational resources afterwards will make the acquired skills useless.
The aims of this supplementary project are (1) to extend DATICAN to include data curation and proper data
management, this is to make data sharing amongst the three institutions possible. (2) to procure an HPC with a
GPU that will meet the computational needs of our trainees. We strongly believe that both the computational
resources and repository will be useful not only for the member institutions of DATICAN, but for all data
scientists and clinicians interested in using AI and data science technologies to improve healthcare delivery in
Africa."
11081825,"Accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules by fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsy is essential to modern day best
practice care in patients who are at risk of thyroid cancer. Current diagnosis of suspicious thyroid nodules relies
on the interpretation of cytology findings by cytopathology. Unfortunately, difficulties in FNA diagnosis due to
overlapping cytological features, inadequate sample size, or lack of clear pattern result in an indeterminate
diagnosis in ~ 20% of cases. Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with indeterminate FNA undergo further
testing including repeat biopsy (painful, may yield same indeterminate result), genomic analysis (expensive, not
always available), or diagnostic thyroid surgery (very expensive, painful, invasive, with many life altering
complications). Shockingly, 70-90% of patients that undergo diagnostic surgery are found to present benign
nodules by surgical pathology, meaning that surgery was completely unnecessary. Unnecessary surgeries have
major negative consequences. For patients, diagnostic surgery hypothyroidism results in decreased quality of
life and lifelong need for hormone replacement therapy. For the healthcare system, the cost from unnecessary
surgeries is enormous. Despite best efforts in genomic analysis and improved cytologic classification, there still
remains a large diagnostic gap and need for improved technology for preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancers.
 To address this critical clinical need, we have combined our expertise in thyroid cancer/surgery (Dr.
James Suliburk, Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, BCM), mass spectrometry imaging (Dr.
Livia S. Eberlin, Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin), statistical analysis (Dr. Rob
Tibshirani, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University), clinical chemistry (Dr. Rongrong
Huang, Scientific Director of Clinical Chemistry, BCM), and clinical pathology (Dr. Thomas Wheeler, Department
of Pathology, BCM), and developed an assay using mass spectrometry imaging and machine learning to
diagnose FNA biopsies based on the detection of a profile of hundreds of metabolic markers directly from clinical
specimens. Now, we propose to conduct critical analytical and clinical validation studies with FNA biopsies
prospectively collected from patients undergoing treatment at BCM to rigorously validate the method for clinical
implementation. During the UH2 research phase, we will establish key analytical performance metrics, quality
control measures, and method standardization procedures to evaluate the performance of our assay and
metabolic markers within its clinical context of use. During the UH3 research phase, we will validate the clinical
and diagnostic performance for FNA diagnosis in comparison to gold standard pathologic evaluation. Our
premise is that the rigorous studies proposed will complete the analytical and clinical tasks needed to validate
our assay and predictive markers for thyroid FNA diagnosis, thus demonstrating its effectiveness as a diagnostic
assay. With support from commercial partners, our ultimate objective is to develop this innovative metabolic test
into a robust technology for high-throughput and accurate diagnosis of thyroid FNA material."

Leukodystrophies are inherited diseases that affect the white matter of the brain due to the loss or absence of
myelin, the lipid membrane that insulates axons in the nervous systems. The leukodystrophy community is at a
key turning point. Novel molecular approaches have increased disease recognition. At the same time key
disorders now have potential treatment pathways. There is urgent unmet need in clinical trial readiness, lest the
promise in pre-clinical development be unable to be translated to well-designed clinical trials. This gap in
knowledge has galvanized stakeholders in the disease community. In collaboration with advocacy partners, we
have formed a research-based consortium, the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative Clinical Trials Network
(GLIA-CTN) that is focused on, but not limited, to a core set of ten leukodystrophies that are at or approaching
stages of clinical trial readiness. Approaches will include Clinical Outcome Assessments (COA) and Patient
Reported Outcomes (PRO) with a focus on reliability, reproducibility and validity. Additionally, we will expand
advanced methodologies for Electronic Medical Record (EMR) extraction of natural history data for the
leukodystrophies. Oversight for these projects will occur under a well-developed Administrative Unit at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), which includes the GLIA-CTN Data Integration Core staffed by
bioinformatics, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians. All aspects of the program are carefully aligned with our
patient advocacy partners, represented by the Chair and Co-Chair of the GLIA-CTN Patient Advocacy
Committee, who have provided meaningful input and will be stakeholders in data sharing platforms. Together,
these approaches will expand our clinical trial readiness platform across the leukodystrophies, enabling
transformation of the field."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of data on chemical inhalation injuries in humans comes from adult patients exposed in war times
or during occupational accidents. For this reason, injury in pediatric patients is scarcely reported and not
characterized. Moreover, impacts on lung and heart development and function of infants born to mothers who
were exposed to these chemicals during pregnancy is not known. For example, from adult patient reports, we
know that sulfur mustard (SM)causes acute cardiopulmonary failure from airway obstruction due to fibrin airway
casts, and that survivors are burdened with development of significant pulmonary morbidities, including delayed,
long-term (often progressive) cardiovascular sequelae months to years after the acute exposure event. These
late-onset morbidities from SM inhalation include chronic lung diseases, and chronic progressive cardiovascular
diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, arterial hypertension and cardiac dysfunction/failure. Conversely to
sulfur mustard, high dose chlorine (Cl2) inhalation in adult patients causes acute airways edema, severe acute
nervous system dysfunction, abnormal calcium storage/release, and acute vasoconstrictive pulmonary
hypertension. However, recovery after chlorine exposure does not result in any long-term cardiovascular
morbidities. What is not known is how these exposures impact children who have developing lungs and
hearts, and if dysfunction will be present in them acutely and/or chronically. More importantly, the time of
most critical cardiopulmonary development occurs in utero during the first trimester, followed by the second and
third trimester of pregnancy in humans. We hypothesize, that pediatric animals born to mothers that were
exposed by inhalation during pregnancy to SM but not Cl2 will develop abnormal lung growth, increased
pulmonary hypertension and significant cardiac dysfunction throughout pediatric development (0 – 8 weeks in
rats), and that exposure in early gestation will cause worse outcomes than if exposure occurred in late gestation.
This proposal will characterize long-term pediatric effects of in utero exposure to two important toxic chemical
exposures."

11087989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep disorders are pervasive and cost approximately $100 billion a year, yet the mechanisms that regulate
sleep are still poorly understood. Previous sleep research has focused on neurons and some neuronal factors
that regulate the homeostatic process of sleep. However, an understanding of how astrocytes, a type of glial
cell, contribute to the sleep homeostat is less well understood. We propose a series of experiments to investigate
the role of astrocytes in regulating homeostatic sleep need which exploit key features of larval zebrafish. The
advantages of using larval zebrafish for this purpose is their amenability to whole-brain calcium imaging, with
single cell resolution, which is possible due to their transparency and relatively small but conserved vertebrate
brain, as well as their amenability to large-scale behavioral assays. Using larval zebrafish and our custom-built
two-photon selective plane illumination microscope (2P-SPIM), we will perform several imaging and perturbation
experiments that record whole-brain astrocyte activity in both natural and induced sleep and wake states. We
then will apply computational tools to segment individual astrocytes and identify astrocytes that may encode the
sleep homeostat. In addition, we will use optogenetic, chemogenetic, and loss-of-function perturbation
approaches to test for functional roles of astrocytes in sleep. This diversity supplement application describes an
experimental and conceptual career development plan for a graduate student whose experimental goals are to
(1) test the hypothesis that astrocytes encode homeostatic sleep need in zebrafish, (2) test the hypothesis that
stimulation of astrocytes results in increased sleep, and (3) test the hypothesis that inhibition or loss of astrocytes
results in decreased sleep. We also describe a detailed career development plan that addresses key gaps in the
graduate student’s training. This diversity supplement application directly relates to the parent grant that
proposes to explore neuronal mechanisms that underlie zebrafish sleep by extending these studies to astrocytes.
Thus, the experiments described in the diversity supplement application are separate from, yet synergize with,
those described for neuronal mechanisms in the parent grant. Together, the parent grant and diversity
supplement have the potential to transform our understanding of mechanisms that regulate sleep homeostasis,
which is important as sleep disorders impose physical and economic burdens on society."

The 2025 Gordon Research Conference on Epithelial Differentiation and Keratinization (GRC-EDK) is the
leading international meeting in the field of epithelial biology. Since its inception in 1979, the biennial GRC-EDK
has contributed to scientific advances and shaped therapeutic approaches for treating skin conditions. For over
four decades, the GRC-EDK has had a high level of attendance, the consistent participation of world-renowned
experts in the field, and highly favorable reviews from conference attendees. The 2025 GRC-EDK conference
is entitled ""Epithelial Development, Aging, Disease, and Regeneration Across Cells and Systems"" and
will take place in Ventura Beach, California, from June 1-6, 2025. The 2025 GRC-EDK will celebrate its
46th year, continuing its tradition of addressing cutting-edge basic questions in epithelial biology and ways
of translating these discoveries into disease treatment. It will showcase recent conceptual and technological
advances comprising stem cell biology, regenerative medicine, cancer, immunity, aging, epigenetics, skin
diseases, novel single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies, and global genomics. GRC-EDK also
acts as a platform to support the careers of a full range of investigators, including women and men, young
investigators, and investigators from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. More than 15% of the invited
speakers are from fields beyond the immediate scope of the conference, 85% did not present at the previous
meeting, and over 30% of speakers will be selected from abstract submissions to ensure plentiful opportunities
for junior faculty and trainees. The relatively secluded location for the 2025 GRC-EDK and the allocated
informal afternoon periods are chosen to maximize the potential for in-depth scientific discussions,
mentoring, and the initiation of collaborations among conference participants. The power hour is an
important part of the GRC-EDK meeting and will encourage discussions on overcoming discrimination and
facilitating diversity and inclusion in the scientific community. The commitment to nurturing the next generation
of scientists will continue with the 6th Gordon Research Seminar on Epithelial Differentiation and
Keratinization (GRS-EDK), scheduled at the same location and just before the main conference from
May 31-June 1, 2025. This seminar is organized by and for trainees and offers a supportive environment for
presenting research, networking, and fostering collaborations. A career mentoring panel at the GRS-EDK will
address key topics such as career development, choices between academia and industry, and the critical
importance of diversity in science. Taken together, the 2025 GRC/GRS-EDK exemplifies the NIAMS institute's
strategy with the following main objectives: (i) to advance pioneering research in skin biology, (ii) to facilitate
the transition of scientific discoveries to clinical practice, and (iii) to support the professional

11081840,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the primary contributor to global mortality and play a significant role
in diminishing the quality of life. The growing incidence of cardiovascular diseases has led to an escalating
demand for cardiac bypass grafting (CABG), now recognized as the most prevalent cardiac surgical procedure
on a global scale. Despite autologous tissue interventions in CABG being considered among the most effective
treatment options, their failure rate remains as high as 42.8%, with only 50% to 60% maintaining patency after
a decade. Vascular engineering research has aimed to create tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) in the
form of acellular or cellularized constructs as an alternative solution. Despite decades of research progress, only
a limited number of TEVGs have progressed to clinical studies, and currently, there are no clinically approved
TEVGs in use.
Aim 1: Quantify VSMC infiltration in compliance matched TEVGs biofabricated with mesoscopic porosity
features in-vivo. First, we will test the hypothesis that the manufactured mesoscopic porosity features can influ-
ence the rates of cellular migration and proliferation of native vascular tissue onto a tissue-engineered vascular
graft (TEVG). In this Aim, we will employ two-photon subtractive manufacturing to enhance cell infiltration in our
compliance-matched TEVGs in vivo. This technology will create precisely cut pores to enhance cell infiltration.
The rationale behind this approach is rooted in the notion that heightened porosity will facilitate greater infiltration
of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thereby promoting enhanced engraftment and bolstering the produc-
tion of extracellular matrix (ECM). By optimizing the porosity, we aim to create an environment conducive to robust
cellular integration and ECM synthesis within the TEVGs.Cellular migration and proliferation will be evaluated at
the end of a 4 week time period.
Aim 2: Quantify the hemocompatibility of SB coated compliance matched TEVGs in-vivo. Secondly, we will
evaluate the efficacy of SB coating in reducing platelet deposition on our TEVGs in-vivo. We aim to investigate
whether SB-coated TEVGs will reduce platelet deposition on the graft surface and enhance in vivo hemody-
namics. Additionally, we will conduct comprehensive characterization of the resulting polymers, examining their
mechanical and thermal properties, hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and thrombogenicity. The rationale behind
this Aim lies in the hydrophilic nature of the SB coating, which is expected to mitigate thrombotic deposition both
before and after significant degradation. This assessment aims to provide insights into the long-term performance
and biocompatibility of the SB-coated TEVGs."

11083938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use (SU) is most commonly initiated during adolescence. Earlier age of onset is associated with
more significant and persistent adverse outcomes, such as impaired psychosocial and educational functioning,
myriad health consequences, and long-term struggles with SU and addiction — underscoring the critical need
to identify and intervene on SU as early as possible. Thus, the public health need to increase availability and
quality of evidence-based interventions for adolescents (ADOL) who are using substances cannot be
overstated, especially in Rhode Island where ADOL are not receiving substance use disorder treatment that
they need at higher than national averages. This proposal not only aims to increase access to interventions for
ADOL using substances but also improve brief interventions for ADOL by co-addressing pain in an innovative
pre-surgical context. Acutely painful procedures, such as wisdom tooth extraction, are an opportune time to
identify SU behaviors and engage ADOL in brief intervention due to shared risk factors between SU and pain
and the potential for exposure to prescription opioids. Aim 1 is to adapt and integrate pre-existing evidence-
based brief interventions for adolescent SU (MET-CBT) and acute pain coping (CBT) into a pre-surgical brief
intervention (PS-BI) for ADOL and their parents. PS-BI will be developed by the PI and her interdisciplinary
mentorship team in conjunction with feedback from key informants (e.g. ADOL, parents, and dental providers).
Aim 2 will evaluate PS-BI in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) versus a control condition of current best
practice among ADOL (age 15-18 years) who use cannabis (and other substances) undergoing wisdom tooth
extraction. Key outcomes for the pilot RCT (Aim 2) are feasibility and acceptability. Ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) methods will be used to elucidate associations between pain, craving, and SU (Aim 3) and
explore if those associations are attenuated by PS-BI (Exploratory aim). This will be the first test of within-
person associations of hypothesized precursors (e.g., pain intensity), substance craving, and use in the
perioperative context among ADOL who use substances. A highly structured training plan will ensure execution
of the proposed research aims. Specifically, the PI will receive advanced training in (1) intervention
development and clinical trial methods, (2) integrated SU interventions for ADOL, (3) EMA, (4) advanced
statistical approaches, including longitudinal data analysis, and (5) mentoring and leadership skills to combine
with her expertise in pediatric psychology, interdisciplinary collaboration in medical settings, and pediatric pain.
Through this K23, the PI will obtain specialized training to launch her independent research focused on
developing, evaluating, and implementing innovative interventions for adolescent SU and pain in integrated
care settings. Supplemental research funds will facilitate launch of the pilot RCT and expedite
recruitment in order to maintain study progress and minimize disruption to career development and
research productivity while the PI experiences a critical life event."

11085700,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Among people with HIV infection (PWH), hazardous drinking is a common, modifiable
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Both alcohol and HIV cause gut dysbiosis. Gut
dysbiosis is associated with systemic inflammation and harmful metabolites, each of which is associated with
CVD and death. However, the specific bacterial shifts that drive dysbiosis and its harmful effects among PWH
who drink are unclear. Our overarching model posits that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis leads to a
reduction in specific species of butyrate-producing bacteria, lowering butyrate levels and increasing
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). These mechanisms contribute to microbial translocation and vascular
inflammation. Ultimately, these processes promote CVD and excess mortality. This application leverages rich
existing data from three fully harmonized NIAAA cohort studies (ACME HIV, U01AA026222; TMAO HIV,
R01AA025859; META HIV, P01AA029542) in response to NOT-AA-23-011 requesting proposals for use of
existing data and biospecimens in alcohol research. We hypothesize that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis will
be characterized by reductions in butyrate-producing species (Aim 1); that reductions in these species will
associate with increased levels of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful metabolites (Aim 2); and
that reductions in butyrate-producing species will associate with greater subclinical CVD dysfunction, CVD risk,
and mortality risk (Aim 3). Prior studies examining alcohol associated dysbiosis in PWH are limited in
two major ways: (1) they rely on 16S characterization of the gut microbiome, which cannot provide granular
(i.e., species level) data; or (2) they employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) to collect species level data, but
only in small samples. Our application is innovative because it addresses both limitations by utilizing WGS in
three existing, fully harmonized NIAAA-funded studies involving 583 PWH who consume alcohol with >1700
longitudinal fecal specimens. Extant data include alcohol measures (AUDIT; Timeline Followback, TLFB;
phosphatidyl ethanol, PEth), stored serum/plasma and fecal samples, 16S gut microbiome data, and serum
biomarkers for metabolites (e.g., TMAO), microbial translocation (e.g., LBP), inflammation (e.g., IL-6), VACS
Index (mortality) and Reynolds Risk (CVD) scores, and echocardiograms. New data to be generated are
WGS on all fecal samples from the three studies. Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1: To characterize
alcohol associated dysbiosis using WGS, employing longitudinal fecal specimens. Aim 2: To test the relations
of the gut microbiome at species/strain-level with markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful
metabolites. Aim 3: To test the association of species/strain-level changes in butyrate-producing and other gut
bacteria with subclinical CVD markers, CVD risk, and mortality risk. IMPACT: Precision medicine approaches
utilizing gut microbiota profiles at the species level can be leveraged into novel interventions to mitigate
harmful downstream health effects of alcohol (i.e., inflammation, CVD, mortality risk) in PWH."
11087987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopment, increase
the risk of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood. This application
proposes examination of socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic differences in the Recovery specialty
project of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-
A). The Recovery Project at the Duke, OHSU, and UCSD Research Sites examines the extent to which short-
term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect, sleep and
resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects of frequent binge alcohol
use. For this application, we will extend analyses planned in the parent grant with supplemental analyses of
patterns and predictors of abstinence and changes in behavior for adolescents and young adults participating in
the four-week abstinence protocol who identify as from diverse socioeconomic and minoritized ethnic/radial
backgrounds. We will test the hypothesis that predictors of recovery after 4 weeks of discontinuation of alcohol
consumption, and predictors of improvements in behavior and affect during this time, will differ by SES and
ethnic/racial group. The study has two specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate how four weeks of abstinence
influence mental health (depression and anxiety), physical activity level, social interaction, and self-reported
sleep as a function of socioeconomic indicators and racial/ethnic group. Aim 2 will examine cultural, community,
and context predictors of abstinence and improvements by SES and racial/ethnic group. Analyses within the
Recovery Project will serve as pilot research to assist the candidate in understanding the social determinants of
these aspects of health. A “Research Independence Plan” is proposed to shape the candidate’s future goals and
professional development during the training period through weekly meetings with Dr. Sandra Brown, guided
readings, and supervised writing, data analysis and scientific dissemination. The trainee will work with the
NCANDA research team at UC San Diego to learn the Recovery protocol, attend biweekly seminars on
substance use research with adolescents, and receive professional development mentorship with Dr. Brown in

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling,
increased pulmonary arterial pressures, declining right ventricular (RV) function, right heart failure, and death.
No curative therapies are currently available. In this F31 application, the PI will train in the acclaimed translational
laboratory of Joe GN Garcia, MD and seek to address the unmet need for novel effective PAH therapeutic
strategies by focusing on eNAMPT (extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase). eNAMPT is a novel
damage-associated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) and PAH target identified by the Garcia lab utilizing
genomic–intensive approaches. Intracellular NAMPT mainly serves as a rate-limiting enzyme in nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis. However, secreted extracellular eNAMPT (from leukocytes, lymphocytes,
endothelium, epithelium) ligates the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to potently activate this inflammatory signaling
cascade. eNAMPT/TLR4 participation in innate immunity inflammatory responses is key to the severity of several
serious inflammatory disorders (ARDS, lung fibrosis) including PH with elevated plasma eNAMPT levels in PH
subjects correlating with RV dysfunction. Increased eNAMPT secretion is influenced by NAMPT promoter SNPs
and NAMPT transcriptional regulation by anti-oxidant response elements and hypoxia response elements
induced by transcription factors such as HIF-2α. We have demonstrated that the eNAMPT/TLR4 pathway is
highly druggable as a humanized eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb effectively reduced the severity of preclinical PH.
Several key gaps remain, however, in fundamentally understanding the role of eNAMPT in PH pathobiology. For
example, it remains unclear as to whether endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the primary
target cell for eNAMPT involvement in PH. In Specific Aim #1 (SA), the PI will examine EC- and SMC-specific
NAMPT promoter responses to PAH stimuli that increase NAMPT transcriptional activities and translation. SA
#2 will investigate the EC- and SMC-specific intracellular mechanisms contributing to eNAMPT secretion into
the circulation by PAH stimuli focusing on the role of NAMPT dimerization, inflammasome and ABC transporter
activation and generation of extracellular vesicles. Finally, utilizing human and rodent tissues, SA #3 will define
EC- and SMC-specific eNAMPT-induced responses by examining cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, cell
proliferation/activation, cell survival, EMT activity and angiogenic activity as readouts. Together, these studies
will provide key novel mechanistic insights into eNAMPT’s influence on vascular remodeling and PH
pathobiology."
11048181,"The endolysosomal/Golgi system provides routes for degradation or recycling of plasma membrane (PM) proteins via endocytosis and degradation of cytosolic proteins/organelles via autophagy. Much evidence supports the idea that endolysosomal system dysfunction underlies a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, ranging from Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) to Parkinson’s diseases. Among the proteins encoded by genetic drivers of AD/ADRD are core components of the endolysosomal system itself (e.g. BIN1, PSEN1/2, GRN, CHMP2B) and proteins whose endolysosomal trafficking is disrupted in the context of genetic disease (APP/Ab, SORL1, Tau aggregates). In addition, the expression of endolysosomal retrograde trafficking regulators such as the Retromer subunit VPS35 are reduced during aging, thereby promoting aberrant accumulation of toxic Ab species. Nevertheless, how individual risk alleles alter trafficking and degradation pathways within the network and whether diverse alleles converge on a common set of phenotypic outcomes remains unclear. This reflects, in part, the absence of a framework for understanding the key protein assemblies within the endolysosomal system that are subject to altered regulation in the context of risk alleles. Building on our previous work defining organelle quality control systems in iNeurons principally through autophagy, we now seek to re-imagine our understanding of the architecture of the endolysosomal system through the generation of “organellar structural proteome landscapes” within the system and through interrogation of how these networks are altered in the context of neurodegenerative disease risk alleles (including VPS35). Our approach merges organelle isolation with crosslink proteomics to identify interacting protein pairs and couples this with Alphafold Multimer to generate pairwise and higher order structural predictions across organellar proteomes. This approach, which overcomes several limitations of conventional methods for identifying protein interactions within the context of membrane-bound organelles, has already allowed us to generate structural predictions for hundreds of endosomal and Golgi protein complexes, including complexes that control chloride ion balance or lipid composition within endolysosomes – key drivers of organelle homeostasis. We propose to: 1) complete and disseminate an integrated structural proteome landscape resource (EndoLysMAPV1) in the HEK293 cell system (Aim 1), 2) generate the first of its kind EndoLysMAPV2 in iNeurons, which we have demonstrated express a dramatically different plasma membrane proteome including numerous dynamic synaptic proteins (Aim 2), and 3) create analogous maps in iNeurons harboring risk allele variants, including VPS35D620N and LRRK2G2019S, which dramatically alters the PM proteome based on our proteomics analysis (Aim 2). To demonstrate the value of our approach to reveal new biology, Aim 3 will mechanistically dissect new and validated transmembrane protein interactions with endolysosomal membrane embedded transporters that likely contribute directly to endolysosomal function and identity."

The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will leverage our research expertise in environmental
epidemiology, analytical chemistry and clinical practice to renew our Human Health Exposure Analysis
Resource (HHEAR) Laboratory Network Hub (formerly known as “CHEAR” in grant cycle 1). We will measure
targeted chemical exposures across all life stages to help NIH funded researchers determine how the
environment affects human health, development and risk of disease across the life span. In the last 3 years we
have expanded our laboratory resources to include liquid handlers to automate sample prep/aliquoting and
worked with data scientist to automate data processing to speed the pace of our jobs. In addition we doubled
the number of mass spectrometers from 7 to 14 and hired additional faculty all in preparation for this renewal
application. We will leverage our substantial institutional investments, including our new 30 million dollar
Institute for Exposomics, to serve the HHEAR Lab network and its NIH researcher clients. Our targeted
resource will analyze common exposure biomarkers (metals, pesticides, flame retardants, endocrine disrupting
chemicals, tobacco metabolites, vitamins, nutritional status, minerals, and other organic compounds) using
state-of-the-art analytical methodologies, while developing new biomarkers of chemical exposure based on the
needs of our NIH clients. We will further build upon our work in CHEAR in which we created a suite of
customizable panels that facilitate research in complex chemical mixtures. Our Developmental core will build
upon its highly successful work in creating novel methods to measure current and past chemical exposures in
novel biological matrices (e.g. teeth, hair, dried blood spots, placenta) and develop new assays that arise from
hits from HHEAR's untargeted and environmental resources. This team already developed methods to
objectively reconstruct past chemical exposures and identify susceptibility windows as they relate to human
health in CHEAR. Our Administrative Core will coordinate planning and communication internally among all
Hub components and externally with the HHEAR Coordinating Center, Data Center and the other HHEAR
Network Hubs. Internally, the Administrative Core will streamline and prioritize HHEAR jobs, assess assay
needs, promote and disseminate new assays as they are developed, harmonize protocols and QA/QC
procedures and coordinate day to day operations. Our Hub will advise applicants on sample requirements,
sample quality, results interpretation, sample collection, storage protocols and sample shipping specifications
guiding them to exposures that fit the most up to date and innovative environmental health science. If
necessary we will outreach to outside laboratories with analytic capabilities/expertise that do not reside in our
Lab Hub. In conclusion, this proposal links highly experienced environmental health scientists with physicians,
toxicologists, stress researchers, chemists, exposure scientists, epidemiologists, and computer scientists to
build the infrastructure and capacity to objectively measure human environments."

Many of the organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterases, such as nerve agents, are highly toxic. Terrorist
actions or accidents involving OPs could lead to mass casualties. The current therapy consists of the
muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and an oxime reactivator of the inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
(2-PAM in the US). The current testing paradigms to identify improved medical countermeasures are largely
from adult animals, and there is little information available on pediatric therapies. There is some information on
the vulnerability of juvenile animals from the OP insecticide literature, which verifies that the juveniles are more
sensitive to OPs. Thus, there is a need to have a pediatric testing paradigm available to investigate the efficacy
and safety of new countermeasures to OP threats in juvenile animals. We have developed a testing paradigm
in adult rats and have used it for several years to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic countermeasures in adult
rats using a nerve agent chemistry (nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate; NIMP, sarin surrogate) and an
OP insecticide chemistry (paraoxon, active metabolite of parathion). The paradigm is particularly relevant to
civilian casualties in that it introduces the antidotes at the time of appearance of signs of poisoning (typically
about 30 minutes) which would be consistent with therapy in the field in a mass casualty situation. We have
developed a platform of novel brain-penetrating oxime AChE reactivators that have shown impressive efficacy
in adult rats; Oxime 20 is our lead candidate. We propose to evaluate this paradigm in juvenile rats (12 and 21
days, 3 and 7 year human equivalent) to verify the natural history of the toxidrome for these 2 OPs (i.e.,
dosage of OP, signs of toxicity, time to severe signs, time to death in lethal dose) (Aim 1a) and the efficacy of
standard of care (atropine + 2-PAM or novel Oxime 20) (Aim 1b). The overarching goal of this supplement is to
develop a pediatric testing paradigm for high dose poisoning by an OP anticholinesterase that will be useful for
the development of new medical countermeasures suitable for infants and children."

ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
 Traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage are frequently complicated by
intracranial hypertension leading to progressive ischemia and secondary brain injury. Recent efforts focused
on improving outcomes have therefore been focused upon improving cerebral oxygenation and the
development of monitoring devices to guide therapy. Current devices designed to measure tissue oxygenation
are, however, severely limited in their scope of surveillance and accuracy. Surface oximetry monitors
interrogate only superficial brain tissue, with contamination from intervening skin and skull. Intraparenchymal
brain tissue oxygen probes survey relatively metabolically less active white matter (compared to gray matter), a
volume of less than 3 mm3, and at a single location. Lastly, intraparenchymal tissue oxygen monitors are
bulky, incompatible with magnetic resonance imaging, and have yet to demonstrate clinical efficacy.
 To fill this need, we will finalize the development of a brain-specific, minimally invasive, optical blood flow
and oxygenation monitoring system (FLOXBR), then translate this device to humans. The FLOXBR, employing
diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies via a brain surface probe, may offer improved sensitivity and
specificity compared to non-invasive probes and will probe larger volumes than currently available invasive
probes, such as the LicoxTM tissue pO2 probe. Unlike intraparenchymal probes, this device can lie above or
below the dura and will be more sensitive to highly metabolically active gray matter. Its small size and flexibility
will permit multiple probes to be placed through a single burr hole, thus allowing for the monitoring of regional
differences in flow and oxygenation. Unlike surface oximetry, the FLOXBR is not impacted by superficial trauma
or edema, improving reliability and sensitivity. Continuous, easily interpreted, and reliable minimally invasive
monitoring of cerebral oxygen delivery may enhance management and outcomes in patients suffering from
intracranial hypertension.
Our aims are succinctly summarized below.
Aim 1) Finalize development & manufacture the FLOXBR brain flow and oximetry monitoring device.
Aim 2) Pre-clinical device evaluation, measurement validation, and safety testing of FLOXBR.
Aim 3) Complete regulatory and safety requirements to support FLOXBR first-in-humans feasibility testing.
Aim 4) Conduct first-in-humans feasibility testing.

11081362,"Summary
Of the retinal degenerative diseases that affect 9 million Americans, rod and cone photoreceptor dystrophies are
arguably the most devastating. Gene therapy is a potential means to strengthen photoreceptor viability. However,
the first human gene therapy trial for retinal degeneration found improved visual function but did not slow
degeneration of photoreceptors. The goal of this gene therapy-oriented proposal is to determine whether therapy
is achievable in the context of an already diseased retina and at what timepoints gene therapy should be
administered in order to improve functional vision in rod and cone dystrophies.
We will determine whether cone-specific rescue is possible at late stages of disease. Finally, we will determine the
latest timepoint at which gene therapy can be administered for rod monochromatism. To do this, we will use a novel,
inducible genetic rescue system in the cone-specific G-protein, guanine nucleotide binding α-transducin 2 (Gnat2),
which will allow us to conditionally reverse GNAT2-deficiency while controlling the temporal and spatial aspects of
phenotypic reversal. We will also use a phosphodiesterase 6 (Pde6b) mouse as a model for rod dystrophy.
The Gnat2floxSTOP/Gnat2floxSTOP::Arr3CreERT2/WT and Pde6cfloxSTOP/Pde6cfloxSTOP::Arr3CreERT2/WT programmable models
will provide a platform for contributing to ongoing efforts aimed at increasing restoration of visual function
following gene therapy for rod- and cone-mediated dystrophies. They will also allow us to address several
compelling, clinically relevant questions: Is the brain’s circuitry sufficiently plastic to recover from the pathological
changes caused by the Gnat2 mutation? Is there a point of no return after which, despite reversion of the
genotype to wild type, cones cannot be salvaged? Can temporal barriers to gene therapy be relieved by
metabolic reprogramming?
Taken together, this proposal is certain to: i) determine whether metabolic reprogramming can serve as an
efficacious, non-gene-specific strategy for treating retinal degeneration, ii) define the factors limiting interventional
therapy, and iii) validate a new, inducible models of cone-mediated retinal degeneration."
11081365,"PROJECT SUMMARY (from the parent grant 5R01AG058066)
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals in the
U.S. It has so far resisted attempts to develop effective therapies despite numerous (failed) clinical trials based
on known targets, most identified over 20 years ago. While genomic research (e.g. the Alzheimer’s Disease
Sequencing Project; ADSP) has identified numerous additional risk loci, these results derive primarily from
case- control datasets. In contrast, cohorts designed to identify variants that may protect from AD, and those
using complementary study designs, are few. We used our extensive experience with the Amish communities
in Indiana and Ohio to establish a cohort of older individuals at high risk of developing AD but who are
cognitively unimpaired (CU). The Amish provide a unique opportunity to identify protective variants for AD
because of their reduced background genetic variation and environmental risk factors. Their small founding
population and endogamy provides enrichment for rare variants. Founder populations also enable testing for
non-additive allelic effects and can magnify sub-significant association signals identified in case-control
studies. The stability and engagement of our Amish participants enables longitudinal assessments of cognition
and biomarkers. Our primary goals are to identify AD protective loci and characterize pre-clinical biomarkers of
progression to cognitive impairment. Building on our existing large cohort, our replicated protective locus and
several suggestive protective loci, and our existing biobank of DNA and plasma and databank of GWAS and
WGS, we propose to: 1) Perform longitudinal assessment of cognition in our family-based Amish cohort; 2)
Identify protective factors for AD and predictors of progression to cognitive impairment by analyzing genomic
and longitudinal cognitive, biomarker, and SDOH data; and 3) Examine the functional implications of current
and novel genes and variants by prioritizing loci using in silico annotation for functional consequences followed
by in vitro functional characterization. Our results will identify potential druggable targets and accelerate the
development of better treatments for AD."

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are a vital non-human primate (NHP) model for the study of infectious
disease and are in critically high demand for biomedical research studies. The expanded Specific Pathogen
Free (eSPF) colony at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) is an essential resource for the
production of model macaques free from an extended list of pathogens capable of confounding the study of
human immunodeficiency virus and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) pathogenesis. These
purpose-bred animals are crucial for meeting the growing demand for NHP research animals and to facilitate
advancements in human health. Accurate and comprehensive genetic analysis of the eSPF colony is essential
to its long-term health and the continued productivity in generating valuable research animals. Of critical
importance is the genotyping of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which can strongly influence host
response to infection and must be accounted for in study design and data analysis. MHC loci are highly
polymorphic and structurally complex, requiring specialized assays and analysis procedures for accurate and
comprehensive genetic characterization. The MHC Genetic Typing Core (Genetics Core) is responsible for
genetic testing and analysis of the eSPF colony and works closely with individual investigators and the
Husbandry and Management Core to ensure that research and colony management needs are met.
Additionally, the Genetics Core assays genetic variation within the population using multiple metrics to promote
adequate genomic diversity through the use of parentage confirmation, ancestry testing, and the genotyping of
specific pathogenic variants or alleles capable of influencing pathogenic response. ONPRC is a leader in the
development and use of genomic technologies in NHP research and the Genetics Core will utilize state-of-the-
art tools and incorporate the use of novel resources to support the goals of the eSPF colony."
11082652,"ABSTRACT (Parent Award): Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most
common cancer globally. Current treatments are morbid, even for patients who are cured, and there are over
13,000 deaths in the US from HNSCC annually. HPV-negative HNSCC is commonly resistant to DNA
damaging therapy, EGFR inhibition and immunotherapy. HPV-associated tumors are highly treatment-
responsive, but 20-30 percent recur. Even with immune checkpoint inhibition, the majority of these patients
succumb. The Yale Head and Neck SPORE (YHNSPORE) represents highly translational researchers with
deep disease-based expertise who leverage the extraordinary scientific strength at Yale Cancer Center, to
improve treatment for patients with this terrible malignancy. YHN-SPORE investigators have significantly
impacted the field of HNSCC through training, and translational and clinical research. Basic scientists bring
rigorous methodology to bear. The YHN-SPORE seeks to address critical barriers to cure of HNSCC due to
resistance to immune, DNA damaging and targeted therapy through these specific aims: Aim 1: To overcome
resistance to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC by targeting active conformations of ErbB family members; Aim 2: To
advance rational synthetic lethal combination therapy to the clinic in HPV-negative HNSCC; Aim 3: To advance
combination demethylating therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition to the clinic for HPV-mediated HNSCC,
with mechanistic studies and characterization of immune response; Aim 4: To bolster the foundation for
HNSCC research through our Administrative, Biospecimen and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics cores, to engage
institutional resources and the wider SPORE community; and Aim 5: To advance new research and to foster
the next generation of HNSCC translational researchers through a Developmental Research Program, a
Career Enhancement Program, and interaction and collaboration with the wider SPORE and HNSCC research
communities. The overarching theme of the 3 coordinated projects is overcoming treatment resistance,
spanning mechanistic insights into resistance to current treatment modalities and immunotherapy; translational
validation; human endpoints to underpin future trials of novel strategies to circumvent resistance; mechanistic
confirmation in correlative studies; and clinical trials in HPV-negative and HPV-driven HNSCC. Anticipated
translational outcomes of the YHN-SPORE are: (1) conformationally sensitive inhibitors to overcome
resistance to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC; (2) clinical safety and pharmacodynamic data combined aurora A
kinase/WEE1 inhibition in HPV-negative HNSCC; (3) proof-ofconcept and immunoprofiling data to support
development of combined demethylation and immunotherapy in HPV-mediated HNSCC; (4) novel models and
genomically-characterized tumors to enable HNSCC translational research; and (5) a diverse group of young
investigators who will emerge as the generation who cure HNSCC."

Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalizations in Appalachia. Rural areas
have the highest HF mortality rates. West Virginia (WV), the only state totally within the Appalachian region, has
the highest HF death rate in the U.S. (32.6 per 100,000; the substantial deaths in those over 65 years). HF is
devastating for patients and their family caregivers, especially during the HF end stages. Families are
unprepared for this deteriorating condition, the home caregiving burdens, and the fear of a painful death. Further,
rural Appalachians lack access to health services, end-of-life palliative care (EOLPC), and have extreme
inequities in health.
The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the integrated nurse-led intervention bundle of 1) HF-
FamPALhomeCARE, 2) Visiting Neighbors supporting functional health, and 3) Appalachia Faith-based nurses
providing comforting palliative care. The preliminary studies verified the bundle components. This RCT is guided
by the social support conceptual theory consistent with Appalachian culture. This intervention bundle addresses
rural disparities in the lack of access to health care which the faith-based nurses and rural volunteers visiting
neighbors address. The intervention components are designed to address several Appalachian social
determinants of health (SDoH) disparities, such as reducing costs by nurses enabling direct access to health
services, clearly illustrated HF home care guides for low literacy, and inspections for safe housing for older
adults. This mixed methods RCT will address Primary Aims (1 & 2), testing the outcomes of patients with HF
and family caregivers (92 dyads) managing home supportive EOLPC in rural WV. Secondary Aim (3) is to
assess the bundled intervention helpfulness, cost, and plans for maintaining the sustainability of our visiting
neighbor volunteers, and the Faith Nurse of rural WV. Descriptive measures, group comparisons, intervention
costs, and focus group discussions will be reported. The qualitative results will be compared to the social support
framework, quantitative results and to the results of the Aim 3a helpfulness ratings to identify any other facilitators
or barriers to sustainability.
This R01 study supports research to improve rural health equity by providing access to health services and
addressing SDoH disparities in underrepresented Appalachia. Designing and testing practical, sustainable
approaches using the available rural resources to address a prevalent, devastating disease, family EOLPC
preferences, older adults' functional health, HF home caregiving skills, and providing social support. Engaging
rural stakeholders in recruitment, implementation, and designing sustainability plans can result in continuing
research on the health, EOLPC and SDoH disparities of the 26.3 million people living across Appalachia. The
long-term impact will be pragmatic strategies for other rural Appalachian states."

An estimated 70% of all eukaryotic cellular proteins are regulated by phosphorylation. Strict temporal and
spatial control are essential for the fidelity of this process, as derailed signaling cascades lead to disease. While
the importance of phosphorylation is clear, knowledge gaps remain in the mechanisms that regulate key
proteins involved in this process, especially phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP). Our long-term goal is to
understand the structural and functional mechanisms that control PPP activity in health and disease. Here, we
focus on the function of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A, both of which have major roles in cell division
and cancer. Our aims are designed to define the mechanisms of PP1- and PP2A:B55-based substrate
recruitment to obtain a systems biology understanding of the proteomes and phosphatomes directed by these
enzymes. For the PP2A family of enzymes, it is established that substrates are recruited by their variable B-
subunits. Here, we investigate PP2A:B55, the most abundant PP2A holoenzyme in cells and the primary
enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating CDK1 targets to initiate mitotic exit. Consistent with this, at mitotic
entry, PP2A:B55 activity is inhibited. This is achieved by two B55-specific inhibitors: FAM122A and ARPP19.
To molecularly define how these inhibitors block PP2A:B55 activity and to elucidate the molecular basis of B55
substrate recruitment. We have also developed a unique PP1 regulator (PhosTAP), which we show can be
used to fully define the PP1 interactome and phosphatome. Due to its 100% specificity and exceptional affinity
for only PP1, this novel PP1 PhosTAP can also be leveraged to specifically recruit PP1 to its point of action
within the cell, in a manner similar to that used by PROTACs for targeted degradation. Critically, both projects
require the purification of exceptionally challenging to produce samples (typically multimers) that strictly require
mammalian expression. It is only mammalian expression that provides the rigorous, reproducible samples
needed for the proposed structural and biophysical studies. Here, we request the costs for a new FPLC system
to replace an outdated system that is no longer functional. Our proposed experiments require exceptionally
pure samples. Obtaining these samples requires multiple purification steps using diverse chromatographic
media and highly functional sophisticated chromatographic systems. Each prep requires ~2.5 days on these
systems, clearly demonstrating the need to replace our non-functional system in order to successfully complete
all aims. Because these holoenzymes have critical roles in multiple human diseases, especially cancer, the
proposed work will establish these holoenzymes specifically, and PPPs generally, as potent and specific drug
targets."

11082093,"Project Summary
Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation, a phenotypic switch from a differentiated
contractile phenotype to a proliferative phenotype, contributes to vascular remodeling and the development of
diverse vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis following angioplasty.
However, the molecular mechanisms that control VSMC phenotypic modulation are poorly understood. Our
exciting preliminary data strongly support a novel role of Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) in VSMC
phenotypic modulation. RUNX3 belongs to the ‘Runt domain’ family of transcription factors that act as
regulators of gene expression in several important developmental pathways. We found that RUNX3 expression
is significantly increased by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a potent stimulator of VSMC
phenotypic modulation. Knockdown of RUNX3 reversed PDGF-BB-inhibited expression of SMC contractile
markers. In addition, RUNX3 knockdown blocked PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation. These data
demonstrate that RUNX3 is essential for PDGF-BB-induced VSMC phenotypic modulation and cell proliferation
in vitro. In addition, RUNX3 overexpression blocked myocardin-induced α-SMA expression and promoter
activity, suggesting that RUNX3 regulates VSMC contractile marker expression through myocardin/SRF
signaling. RUNX3 knockdown also inhibited PDGF-BB induced expression of c-Myc, a crucial driver of VSMC
proliferation. The PDGF-BB-induced activation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of GSK3β, important pathways in
regulating c-Myc levels, were adversely affected by RUNX3 knockdown. RUNX3 expression was activated in
the media and neointima VSMCs following the left common carotid artery injury in C57BL/6 mice. RUNX3
deficiency (RUNX3-/-) dramatically inhibited injury-induced neointima formation, suggesting that RUNX3 plays a
critical role in injury-induced neointima formation and vascular remodeling in vivo. These data together strongly
support a novel hypothesis that RUNX3 induces VSMC phenotypic modulation by suppressing VSMC
contractile marker expression and promotes VSMC proliferation via c-Myc, leading to neointima
formation/vascular remodeling, which will be tested by three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying RUNX3 function in modulating VSMC phenotype by testing the hypothesis that
RUNX3 regulates VSMC phenotypic modulation via suppressing myocardin/SRF-mediated transcriptional
activation of VSMC marker genes. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that RUNX3 upregulates c-Myc expression
through NF-κB and GSK3β/β-catenin signaling to promote VSMC proliferation. Aim 3: Test whether RUNX3
is essential for carotid artery ligation/wire injury-induced vascular remodeling using global, VSMC-specific, and
endothelial cell-specific RUNX3 knockout mice. Taken together, this project will shed new lights on the
pathogenesis of vascular remodeling after vessel injury, which may ultimately lead to the identification of novel
targets for therapeutic treatment of various cardiovascular diseases related to vascular remodeling."
11082106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Role of APOE in endosomal processing of alpha-
synuclein
Dementia is among the most harmful and costly aspects of Lewy body disease (LBD) which is
comprised of Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and shares some
clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, dementia and psychosis are often early
and aggressive symptoms in patients with DLB. Pathologically, these illnesses share the feature
of aggregation of misfolded forms of the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn), termed Lewy bodies,
which spread throughout multiple brain regions during the disease and are toxic to cells. In
addition to Lewy bodies, patients with LBD often have amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, and patients with Alzheimer’s disease often have
Lewy bodies in addition to plaques and tangles. The exact mechanism of how aSyn becomes
misfolded and why cognitive decline is accelerated in DLB is unclear. Genetic studies point to a
strong link between increased DLB risk and the APOE4 variant of the gene that encodes
apolipoprotein E, another protein that is also central to Alzheimer’s disease risk. We reported that
mice expressing the APOE4 version of the human APOE gene had accelerated aSyn aggregation
and early death compared to other APOE genotypes. This finding is similar to the effects observed
when human APOE genotypes are expressed in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Our
preliminary data indicate that astrocytes and microglia take up aSyn aggregates and process
them through the endolysosomal pathway, which may serve as a compensatory mechanism to
degrade harmful aSyn aggregates. We propose to examine the cell biological transit of aSyn
aggregates through the endolysosomal pathway in astrocytes and microglia and determine if
there are differences in this trafficking related to APOE genotype. We hypothesize that the APOE4
genotype impairs endolysosomal degradation of aSyn aggregates in both astrocytes and
microglia, and that astrocyte expression of APOE4 in particular drives accelerated aSyn
pathology leading to brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We will test whether this effect
occurs mainly due to cell-autonomous changes within astrocytes or microglia themselves,
including related to changes in gene expression in those cells, or whether it is mediated through
secreted apolipoprotein E protein particles that are known to have effects by binding to receptors
on both neurons and glia. The main goal of these experiments is to clarify how APOE genotype
regulates endolysosomal processing of aSyn in glia and how this knowledge can be leveraged to
develop novel treatments for DLB, Alzheimer’s disease, and other related dementias."
11082842,"Estimates from the Alzheimer's Association indicate that approximately one in ten older adults in the US
have Alzheimer's disease (AD) while 15 to 20% have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), projecting that
about a third of those will develop dementia within five years. Several variables have been associated
with delaying the onset and rate of cognitive decline in AD and have been grouped under the Cognitive
Reserve/Resilience (CR/R) theory; it postulates that complex mental activity throughout the lifetime
creates resistance to cognitive decline despite the biological risk (brain loss). Emerging evidence shows
that bilingualism may be one of these neuroprotective factors in the aging brain, but results in
bilingualism and CR/R remain inconsistent. W to analyze the contribution of bilingualism to CR/R in a
large cohort of aging Spanish/English bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals with amnestic MCI (aMCI).
To overcome limitations in previous research, we will use a longitudinal design, operational
characterization of bilingualism, refined sociocultural measures, and multimodal neuroimaging. The
current study will leverage and extend a large ongoing NIH cohort prospective study from the 1Florida
ADRC, in which Spanish/English bilingual Hispanics with aMCI are well-represented (n = 120), but
Spanish monolinguals are underrepresented although they comprise approximately 40% of foreign-born
Hispanics in the US. In the present study, we directly address this by deploying an intensive, culturally-
informed, community-engaged research approach in the Miami area to increase outreach and recruit 120
Hispanic monolinguals with aMCI. We will make the ADRC MCI bilingual and monolingual groups
ethnically equivalent and create a longitudinal data set (n=240), ensuring that we are well-powered to
determine the contribution of bilingualism to CR in the aMCI population. As co-investigators on the
1Florida ADRC, our research team is well-positioned to execute the proposed study. We will collect
neuropsychological data at years 1, 2, and 3 and neuroimaging data (MRI and DTI) at years 1 and 3. The
neuropsychological battery will include the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scale for Semantic Interference and
Learning (LASSI-L), a cognitive stress test that evaluates failure to recover from Proactive Semantic
Interference (frPSI) and is highly sensitive to subtle cognitive changes in early AD. The innovation lies in
studying the relationship between brain diffusivity measures of WM and frPSI, as measured by the
LASSI-L in combination with volumetric brain data; the use of Bilingual indexes of language proficiency
and degrees of acculturation, and levels of education. Our findings will advance our understanding of the
complex interactions between neural, environmental, and sociocultural factors and the role of
bilingualism in CR/R in AD/ADRD, paving the way for new targets for interventions and providing
fundamental insight into the role of language(s) in the aging brain."
11082845,"Hypertension affects 122.4 million Americans, and African American (AA) women have significantly higher
hypertension estimates (58.4%) compared to White (42.6%), Asian (37.6%), and Hispanic (35.3%) women,
resulting in a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the parent G08 study for this
administrative supplement, “DASH-ing to Heart Health: Supporting low-income African American women with
an interactive Meals that Heal resource book,” we proposed creating a useful and usable resource, Meals that
Heal, that increases awareness/knowledge of hypertension and improves ease of following a DASH diet by
providing culturally-relevant and low-cost DASH recipes that low-income African American women can utilize
when making heart-healthy food choices. DASH recipes in the parent award were compiled from existing peer-
reviewed publications and government, academic, and professional organizations. Although the DASH (Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of hypertension and
other cardiovascular disease risk factors, we found that low-income AA women, such as those who live in
public housing and who may be at the highest risk for hypertension because of poor social determinants of
health, lack sufficient health information on how to feasibly follow this DASH diet. To preserve the project's
overall impact of reaching the full spectrum of AA populations, we propose new research aims in this
supplement to develop new culturally relevant low-cost DASH recipes. In addition, the parent award recruited
study participants from a public housing community in central Kentucky, limiting the generalizability (external
validity) of the Meals that Heal resource. In this supplement, we will increase our findings' generalizability by
recruiting study participants from additional public housing in a large Midwestern city with similar
sociodemographic characteristics. The aims of this supplemental request are to: (1) identify preferred culturally-
relevant recipes of low-income AA women by conducting qualitative interviews; (2) modify the culturally relevant
recipes to follow DASH guidelines and fit within a financially constrained food budget; and (3) evaluate the
effectiveness of Meals that Heal, with the modified culturally relevant low-cost DASH recipes, at increasing
DASH knowledge and the likelihood of using DASH recipes among low-income AA women. This supplemental
project is significant because the findings will increase the availability of culturally relevant and low-cost DASH
recipes for a health disparity population and increase the generalizability of Meals that Heal. This knowledge
can improve adherence to the DASH diet and the effectiveness of existing interventions, which is critical to
reducing hypertension disparities. Specifically, the results of this supplemental project will allow future studies
to identify evidence-based strategies to reduce blood pressure and hypertension risk."

Over 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and the non-communicable complications of HIV infection
are a significant global health concern. People with HIV (PWH) have an increased risk of cerebrovascular
disease, cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and white matter disease despite treatment with antiretroviral
therapy (ART) and viral suppression, though the mechanism behind this finding is not fully understood. While
endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in chronic HIV cohorts even after ART initiation, endothelial
function in early and acute HIV infection, and how this relates to later cerebrovascular health, has not been well
defined. A better understanding of the timing and pathophysiology of vascular disease in PWH is needed to
identify biomarkers for early preventative interventions in this population. Furthermore, given accelerated
vasculopathy is a contributor to other neurocognitive disorders including COVID-19 cognitive impairment and
vascular dementia, this work also has broader implications to improve brain health worldwide.
In this R03 application, I seek to utilize a unique, well-established longitudinal cohort (SEARCH010/RV254) of
people who initiate ART during acute HIV (AHI, i.e within 30 days of infection) in Thailand to characterize the
pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction during acute HIV and after early ART. Based on preliminary data, we
hypothesize that peripheral and central vasculopathy progress in PWH despite early ART. To test this
hypothesis, we will prospectively enroll a cohort of 30 participants with AHI and 30 HIV negative controls and will
systematically measure blood markers of endothelial dysfunction and reactive hyperemia index (a non-invasive
measure of endothelial function) during AHI and longitudinally for two years (96 weeks). We will also perform
automated white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden quantification on brain MRIs performed at week 0 (AHI)
and at week 96 in these participants. We will then identify if blood biomarkers and reactive hyperemia index
measurements associate with white matter disease progression at week 96. We will also examine associations
between blood and imaging markers of vascular dysfunction and cognitive test scores at week 0 and week 96.
The PI Dr. Holroyd is a neuroimmunology and neuroinfectious diseases trained clinician-scientist with expertise
in translational research on the neurologic complications of viral infections such as HIV. The goal of this work is
to gather novel exploratory data elucidating the pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction during very early HIV
infection, and to identify easily measurable biomarkers that predict PWH at high risk of cerebrovascular disease
to design subsequent studies to test early preventative interventions to promote brain health in this population."
11085643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains one of the most
critical public health problems in the 21st century, with more than 39 million global infections. Antiretroviral
therapy (ART) significantly suppresses viremia, leading to a decline in AIDS-related mortality. Conversely, there
are emerging concerns of multimorbidity (i.e., co-occurrence of ≥2 chronic diseases) despite ART-induced
longevity. Multimorbidity significantly impacts the health quality of people living with HIV (PLWH) and poses a
substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. While HIV drives multimorbidity, alcohol, consumed by
more than 50% of PLWH, promotes HIV-associated multimorbidity. Alcohol mediates multimorbidity by promoting
organ-organ crosstalk via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and inflammatory mediators. The direct effects of HIV and
alcohol on the lungs and the liver have been demonstrated; however, there is a gap in knowledge about whether
HIV- and alcohol-induced lung and liver injuries are regulated by EV-mediated crosstalk. The objectives of the
studies outlined in this proposal are to investigate the triggering effects of alcohol metabolism and HIV on the
secretion of lung-derived EVs and the role of these EVs in amplifying the release of liver cytokines into circulation
to induce lung injury. To achieve these objectives, during the K99 phase of this award, the PI will determine how
alcohol enhances EV release in HIV-infected alveolar macrophages, AMs (Aim 1). Then, the roles of EVs
secreted by alcohol and HIV-stressed AMs in the depletion of alveolar epithelial cells and barrier dysfunction will
be examined (Aim 2). During the R00 phase, the PI will examine the contribution of EVs to lung-liver crosstalk
driven by HIV infection and EtOH consumption in vivo (Aim 3). Successful completion of these studies will identify
molecular targets that will make it possible to concurrently address both lung and liver multimorbidity among
PLWH who misuse alcohol.
The PI’s focus on alcohol research began during his predoctoral training when he investigated the contribution
of the hepatocyte-hepatic stellate cell axis to alcohol—and HIV-induced liver injury via the NRSA NIAAA F31
funding mechanism. The PI acquired additional expertise with numerous molecular techniques during his
postdoctoral training in the laboratories of Dr. Yeligar and Koval, when exploring the contribution of alcohol and
HIV to AM immune dysfunction and alveolar barrier impairment.
The support from this MOSAIC K99/R00 grant will provide the PI an outstanding opportunity to expand and
consolidate his experimental and laboratory skills, collect critical preliminary data for subsequent grant
applications, present research findings at national meetings, and support his career goal to become an
independent investigator. Thus, this MOSAIC K99/R00 application provides an excellent opportunity to advance
the career of the PI in developing his independent research program with a focus on HIV- and alcohol-induced
inter-organ crosstalk during the R00 phase."

10792629,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent across the age spectrum and associated with significant
cardiovascular (CV) diseases. To date, our understanding of the association between OSA and CV pathobiology
comes from limited cross-sectional data examining older individuals with severe OSA and advanced CV disease,
and recent clinical trials have demonstrated OSA treatment in this population does not improve CV outcomes
likely because of irreversible CV pathology. The effects of incident and developing OSA on CV phenotypes in
younger and healthier individuals remain unknown and whether OSA treatment in this population reverses early
CV pathophysiology is uncertain. In my K23, we have demonstrated that OSA is highly prevalent in collegiate
American-style football (ASF) athletes, which is a young and healthy population, but also enriched with early
traditional CV risk. Our data suggest that OSA in ASF athletes is associated with maladaptive CV functional
changes, reduced diastolic function and arterial stiffness; the combination which mirrors the pathophysiology of
ventricular-arterial (V-A) uncoupling. New preliminary data also suggest OSA is prevalent among higher-risk
female collegiate athletes. We will now leverage our access to at-risk young college-aged individuals to analyze
developing OSA and the corollary impact on CV function in absence of confounding and advanced CV morbidity.
The scientific premise for the proposed work lies in establishing the pathophysiology that leads to OSA-
associated CV disease. Understanding the natural progression of OSA disease could lead to new and effective
treatment options for healthier patients prior to irreversible CV pathology, thereby reducing the public health
burden of OSA. This prospective and observational cohort study will examine young individuals with OSA using
repeated measures analyses and will bring together a multi-disciplinary expert team of scientists from cardiology,
exercise physiology, and sleep medicine. We will use a comprehensive array of non-invasive testing including
cardiac imaging, vascular function analysis, sleep studies, and plasma metabolomics to characterize the effects
of incident and developing OSA on CV function. The working hypotheses are: 1) Independent of weight gain,
OSA leads to impaired diastolic function, arterial stiffening, and V-A uncoupling among at-risk young athletes
and non-athlete undergraduates with OSA, 2) Changes in OSA observed in detrained individuals will remain
associated with CV functional measures, independent of changes in weight, and 3) OSA leads to a specific
changes in metabolism that will be associated with CV dysfunction. Aim 1 will investigate the relationship
between incident OSA and diastolic function, arterial stiffness, and V-A coupling, adjusting for weight, in a large,
multi-center cohort of male ASF athletes, female athletes, and undergraduate controls. Aim 2 will assess the
relationship between CV dysfunction and OSA in detrained subjects adjusting for weight change and left
ventricular mass regression. Aim 3 will identify the metabolic profile associated with OSA and the association
between OSA-specific metabolites and early CV dysfunction."
10811711,"Reductions in estrogen receptor (ER)α expression are associated with metabolic dysfunction and
heightened disease risk in women and men. However, the causal mechanisms underlying reduced ERα levels in the context of metabolic dysfunction and the specific tissue(s) conferring ERα-mediated effects on metabolism, inflammation, and insulin action remain inadequately defined. We have shown that aspects of the metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance, tissue inflammation, and obesity are recapitulated in whole body Esr1-/- mice (Esr1 encodes ERα). We have subsequently performed a tissue dissection approach to understand the cell-specific impact of ERα action on inflammation and metabolic homeostasis. Because macrophages (MΦ) are a key cell type regulating tissue metabolism, and are involved in the pathobiology of cardiometabolic-related diseases, herein we propose to interrogate the mechanisms by which ERα modulates MΦ function with a specific focus on MΦ mitochondrial metabolism and mtDNA replication. In Aim 1 we will use loss- (MACER) and gain-of-Esr1 (ERαMyeTg) expression approaches to selectively modulate ERα in the myeloid lineage of male and female mice. We will examine the impact of
ERα expression on metabolic homeostasis in response to high fat diet feeding and determine whether restoration of ERα in myeloid cells of the whole body Esr1-/- mouse model can reverse the obesity and insulin resistance phenotype. Since we were the first to identify that ERα regulates mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA replication in myocytes and adipocytes, and since mitochondria are viewed as central signaling hubs regulating immunometabolism, in Aim 2 we will interrogate the role of ERα in controlling fission/fusion/mitophagy dynamics and mtDNA replication by polymerase γ, Polg1 (catalytic subunit). Since our research shows contrasting molecular outcomes to ERα deletion in different cell types, a primary goal of this proposal is to better understand the role of ERα in controlling mitochondrial function specifically in MΦ, as well as determine how impaired ERα action drives inflammation and metabolic dysfunction with relevance to cardiometabolic disease susceptibility, especially in women during the menopausal transition."

11080548,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Reactive astrocytes (RAs) are a feature of normal aging and neurodegeneration. RAs drastically change their
morphology and gene expression, notably increasing the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in
response to injury or inflammation. GFAP is the major intermediate filament protein of mature astrocytes.
Autosomal dominant mutations in GFAP cause the rare and fatal leukodystrophy, Alexander Disease (AxD). In
AxD patients, astrocytes accumulate pathological GFAP aggregates (Rosenthal fibers; RFs) and become
reactive. However, the mechanisms linking >70 different GFAP mutations to RF formation and other disease-
relevant phenotypes in AxD remain unknown. My extensive preliminary data show that aberrant
phosphorylation promotes GFAP aggregation, and that this modification is a marker of AxD severity,
independently of the disease mutation. Further, I show that site-specific GFAP phosphorylation is associated
with increased proteolysis by caspase-6, but whether the two are directly linked is unknown. I hypothesize
that coordinated cross-talk between casein kinase (CK2) and caspase-6 promotes defective GFAP
proteostasis to exacerbate the reactive phenotype of AxD astrocytes. For the F99 phase, I propose to use
pharmacological and genetic strategies to inhibit CK2 and caspase-6 activity in order to characterize their roles
in vitro using the astrocyte model that I developed (Aim 1.1), and in vivo utilizing an AxD mouse model (Aim
1.2). I will master iPSC gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 to generate CK2 and caspase-6 knockouts and iPSC
handling and differentiation to astrocyte and neurons (Aim 1.1), and I will apply these techniques to my
postdoctoral project (Aim 2). For the K00 phase, I will investigate the functions of RAs in Alzheimer's disease in
the lab of Dr. Mel Feany. Proteoglycans (PGs) are among the most highly upregulated genes in aging and
RAs. Preliminary data from Dr. Feany's lab identified genetic interactions between PGs and models of
neurodegeneration in the fly. I hypothesize that RAs produce an imbalance of PGs in the extracellular matrix,
which creates an environment that is inhibitory to neuronal growth and remodeling. To model the mechanical
changes known to occur in AD brain, I will develop a novel model to study RAs by culturing iPSC-astrocytes on
substrates of different stiffness. Additionally, I will generate knockouts of candidate PGs in iPSCs and
differentiate them to reactive and non-reactive astrocytes. I will use in vivo fly models and co-cultures of iPSC-
astrocytes and neurons to examine the role of PGs in toxicity of RAs. My thesis project and my future
postdoctoral studies will provide a rich training experience that will prepare me for a career as an independent
investigator leading a rigorous research program at the nexus of aging and glial biology."

Chemical Synthesis of Complex Natural Products for Translational Science
The goals of the continuing MIRA (R35GM118173) research program are to continue focus on chemical
syntheses of bioactive molecules for translational studies. The MIRA effort will allow flexibility and stability to
enable new research directions that come up during the course of research. The first four years of the R35
program have been highly productive and have led to 30 publications in high impact journals. This includes 17
collaborative manuscripts with clinical and biological investigators. As part of our studies, we have taken
opportunities to address key questions and contemporary needs in organic chemistry including asymmetric
catalysis of photocycloadditions, biomimetic cascade reactions and cycloadditions, and chemoenzymatic
synthesis. Key accomplishments in the past four years include synthesis of amidino rocaglates (ADRs) as
highly potent translation inhibitors, synthesis of meroterpenoids using reactive enetriones, biomimetic synthesis
of meroterpenoids by dearomatization-driven polycyclization, and computational investigation of chiral ion-pairs
using parallel tempering (PT) computation. As part of the MIRA renewal project, the Principal Investigator
Professor John Porco and colleagues will continue development of novel synthetic methodologies for concise
entry to bioactive classes of natural products including rocaglates, oxaphenalenones, meroterpenoids, spiro-
PPAPs, polycyclic xanthones and tetrahydroxanthones, xanthone dimers, trichothecenes, and
pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids. The project will continue major emphasis on collaborations to study biological
properties and mode of action (MoA) of target molecules for use as pharmacological therapies for human
cancers as well as viral, fungal, and bacterial illnesses. It is anticipated that the MIRA program will allow us to
continue development of innovative syntheses of complex natural products and derivatives and work to
aggressively interface these studies with applications in clinical and translational research."

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD) and
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) have no cure, but all three share signs of α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology and
a pattern of neurodegeneration in which there is variation in neuronal loss. Our long-term goal is to examine
this differential neuronal susceptibility to identify features of neurodegeneration in synucleinopathy, and to use
this knowledge for subsequent development of neuroprotective strategies and biomarkers. Our central
hypothesis is that CRISPR-Cas9 library screening can be used as a cell-type specific, high-throughput in vivo
method to elucidate determinants of neurodegeneration in synucleinopathy. The rationale for the proposed
research is that, once susceptibility modifiers are identified, therapeutic strategies can be devised for the
treatment of PDD, DLB and even perhaps AD. Thus, in AIM 1, we propose to begin by identifying candidate
modifiers of neuronal susceptibility in the transgenic mThy1-α-syn (L61Tg) mouse model of synucleinopathy
using cell-type-enriched single-nucleus profiling of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Given the known differential
susceptibility among ventral midbrain DA neurons in synucleinopathies, we posit that transcriptomic profiling of
these neurons will not only identify signatures of neuronal resilience to stress, but also identify candidate
modifiers for inclusion in our subsequent CRISPR library screen. For this work, our cell-specific nuclei tagging
system will allow to selectively profile, by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, DA neurons in L61Tg and their non-
transgenic (NTg) littermates. The resulting sequencing data will then be clustered and investigated using
differential composition and gene expression analysis to generate a final set of candidate genes that are
expressed in subsets of DA neurons, differentially regulated in L61Tg mice, and relevant to human DA
subtypes. These candidate genes, which will be included in the list of perturbation candidates in AIM 2, will
also serve as a set of genes for future investigations in neurodegeneration research. Next, in AIM 2, we will
perform a targeted in vivo CRISPR library screening of DA-neurons in the same mouse model of
synucleinopathy. Here, single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries will be delivered by systemic AAV injection, before
brains are harvested six months later and processed for sgRNA sequencing, to identify which genes from our
list, upon being silenced, are functional modifiers of neuronal loss. The candidate gene list will be made of our
reported hits (Brichta et al., Nat Neurosci, 2015) and those identified in AIM 1. Successful completion of this
project will reveal determinants of neuronal survival in vivo and in response to α-syn, a stressor relevant to
human neurological disorders. Thus, our anticipated results will have an important positive impact as they will
provide opportunities for preventive and therapeutic interventions and, fundamentally, advance our mechanistic
understanding of PDD, DLB and even perhaps AD."

the potential to cause serious disease in staff working with macaques. Since its inception, the animals
produced in the ONPRC U42 eSPF Rhesus Macaque Breeding Colony have been extensively used for the
study of virus-host interactions and pathogenesis, basic immunology, AIDS-related opportunistic infections and
vaccine development. The scope of the need for eSPF animals is far greater than the support of AIDS
opportunistic infection and HIV vaccine development research. CMV infections are widespread in human

Accelerating B Cell and Antibody Molecular, Functional and Structural Analysis
 in Sequential bnAb-inducing Env Immunogen Clinical Trials
 Development of an effective HIV vaccine is essential for achieving long-term immunity to prevent new HIV
infections globally. A successful HIV vaccine regimen will likely need to induce potent broad neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs) to contemporary circulating viral strains. New HIV Env immunogen designs, guided by
knowledge of bnAb interactions with envelope epitopes and their B cell clonal lineage development in natural
HIV infection, have entered first in human studies in the HVTN. These phase 1 “discovery” trials rely on more
efficient, near real-time molecular, functional, and structural analyses of B cell and antibody responses. To meet
this expectation, the HVTN Laboratory Center proposes to continue expansion and improvement of laboratory
and analytical capacity that can accelerate iterative evaluation of bnAb-inducing vaccine candidates. The
supplemental funds for the HVTN Laboratory make it possible to fully access evolving immunologic, molecular,
and structural technology, which deepens our laboratory analyses and increases throughput of data generation
and interpretation. To accomplish this, we will sustain the employment of additional dedicated trained staff and
equipment to increase laboratory throughput of B cell repertoire, antibody binding with epitope mapping,
neutralization, and antibody structural analyses. These funds will continue to enable efficient laboratory
operations and integration of the scientific partnerships between key investigators at Fred Hutch, Duke
University, and the Scripps Research Institute."

 The proposed research will interrogate natural product scaffolds as starting points for narrow-spectrum and
antivirulence agents. Of specific interest are compounds that target specific bacteria and/or mitigate bacterial
biofilms, which play a role in the development of resistance in bacteria, the rejection of medical implants, and
many other health related diseases. The compounds which this proposal will focus on, have been chosen from
privileged areas where bacteria utilize chemical warfare to prevent colonization of invading species. Here we
present a multi-faceted approach, including organic synthesis, molecular genetics, proteomics, transcriptomics,
and microbiological assays that begins with these privileged scaffolds but has as an overarching goal of
developing next generation therapeutics and tool compounds to better understand processes within a
multispecies environment.
 We will interrogate the chemical synthesis of natural product scaffolds identified from nature that possess
species-specific activity, which is ideal for the development of “narrow-spectrum” therapeutics and tool
compounds. Proposed scaffolds are derived from plant material, fungi, and rhizosphere bacteria and have
previously demonstrated biological activity. We propose to leverage diverted total synthesis to construct both the
lead compound and hypothesis-driven analogs for biological evaluation.
 We will also characterize antivirulence compounds that inhibit biofilm formation. Starting with reported natural
products with biofilm inhibitory activity, we will explore the unique chemical features that endow each molecule
with their biological effect. Furthermore, we will utilize the chemical toolbox to design compounds with improved
chemical and physical properties to improve the likelihood of translation. Analogs will then be tested with the
goal of identifying specific processes that the natural product affects and allow for a broader evaluation of the
target in general biofilm processes.
 Finally, we will investigate both the biological target and properties of the tool compounds both in single
species and multispecies biofilms. This approach will employ a combination of genetic and MS-proteomic
techniques to develop a candidate list of proteins, from which we will identify the targets by biochemical studies.
Previous research has demonstrated that these sources have provided compounds with unprecedented
biological activity with significant implications to improving human health. Furthermore, they act on therapeutic
targets that were previously unknown providing new approaches to combat bacteria."

Non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) are increasing in HIV-infected individuals (HIVIIs), urging the development
of novel therapeutic interventions and model systems to assess HIV’s contribution to tumor pathogenesis. Many
HIV-associated cancers result from oncogenic virus co-infections, and the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
is prevalent in the development of NADCs, including head-and-neck (HNC) and anal cancers, which are
significantly elevated in HIVIIs. Importantly, the HPV viral oncogenes are involved in the transformation and
maintenance of these cancers, susceptible to targeted gene therapeutic strategies such as RNAi interference
(RNAi). However, a major hurdle preventing the development of therapeutic RNAi for HPV-associated
malignancies is delivery. Both viral and non-viral systems have been developed, but viral delivery systems are
immunogenic precluding repeat dosing, and non-viral synthetic nanoparticles are challenging to target away from
the liver with limited tumor uptake when administered systemically. We have pioneered a non-immunogenic
native extracellular vesicle system for the delivery of potent RNAi effectors to drastically advance RNAi-based
treatment for HPV-associated NADCs. However, HIVIIs have more aggressive NADCs, which are diagnosed at
a younger age with possible treatment resistance with many confounding features including chronic inflammation
and immune dysregulation, HIV viral factors that promote angiogenesis and cellular pathways associated with
treatment resistance, and possible side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but representative in vivo models
are lacking to study the HIV factors affecting NADC progression and drug insensitivity. There is a need to
understand the factors affecting tumors in an HIV environment with patient-derived samples, which could be
explored through the development of immune-competent in vivo patient models that support HIV infection,
recreating a HIV-cancer ecosystem to study NADC pathogenesis. Our long-term goal is to develop innovative
interventions and models for the treatment of virally driven cancers emerging in HIVIIs, and we seek to develop
these objectives through two distinct aims: 1) characterization of an innovative EV-deliverable anti-HPV
treatment to inhibit ADC and NADCs, and 2) the assessment of the cellular profile of HPV-associated HNC
tumours from HIV+ and HIV- individuals to inform the development of representative immune-competent HIV
murine models for study factors affecting NADCs. Collectively, this work will be impactful by developing
innovative targeted treatments and representative models for HPV-associated malignancies prevalent in HIVIIs
to address the rising cases of virus-associated cancer in people living with HIV."

The development of new medical devices and technologies requires a biomedical engineering (BME)
workforce that is capable of identifying unmet clinical needs and working in teams to develop design solutions.
BME curricula generally attempt to prepare students for such challenges through hands-on projects and team-
based capstone courses, but such experiences often fall short at preparing students for needs identification
and translation of design solutions. Clinical immersion provides a complementary experience to traditional
curricular features, as students in such opportunities observe real-world application of medical devices and
communicate with clinical personnel. Clinics in urban environments present a unique set of issues, including
the challenge of delivering health care to populations that are socially and economically diverse. Our proposed
INdiana Summer Clinical Residency in Innovation for Biomedical Engineers or (IN)SCRIBE Program will
engage undergraduate BME students in a seven-week summer clinical immersion and design experience that
challenges student teams to integrate socioeconomic considerations into clinically-relevant design. Both health
care professionals and biomedical engineers will serve as faculty for the program.
Indiana ranks 41st of the 50 states in overall resident health quality; chronic disease, obesity, smoking, and
infant mortality rates plague our state. Socioeconomic disparities related to these health issues are of particular
concern in cities like Indianapolis, as 39% of its population are people of color and 19% of its residents live in
poverty. However, with the ample resources for medical innovation present in Indianapolis, our clinicians,
researchers, and industry professionals can better engineer solutions that take socioeconomic disparities into
account. Our proposed (IN)SCRIBE Program will train biomedical engineers to be adept at translating urban,
healthcare-related technologies.
The long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop a model program for urban universities to train
biomedical engineers who will contribute to solutions to society's most challenging health care problems.
Specific Aim 1 is to implement the (IN)SCRIBE Program at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis
(IUPUI), in collaboration with the IU School of Medicine. We will immerse undergraduate BME students in
diverse clinical settings, develop student skills and self-efficacy in needs identification and clinically-relevant
design, and create student awareness of socioeconomic disparities in healthcare. Specific Aim 2 is to
determine how the (IN)SCRIBE Program affects undergraduate BME students. We will identify how student
teams articulate consideration of socioeconomic factors in design solutions and document how student teams
pursue design to meet urban health needs beyond the Program.
Successful achievement of the long-term objective and specific aims will result in improved training for
biomedical engineers and better health for all residents in both urban and non-urban areas."

One of the most widespread presentations of Interstitial Lung Disease is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a
chronic, progressive and fatal disease. The prevalence of IPF in the US has increased 2-fold in the last 10 years
and it affects ~180,000 Americans. Subclinical epithelial injury has been identified as a central process in IPF.
The prognosis of IPF is dire, with a median survival of 3.8 years among adults 65 years or older. Important
advances in the therapy of IPF include the approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone. Although these agents are
able to clinically attenuate the loss of lung function in IPF, they do not completely halt or reverse the progression
of disease. This underscores the need to identify novel therapies for the treatment of IPF. Epithelial reprograming
of alveolar type II cells (AEC2) is a central process that leads to lung remodeling in IPF. Intriguingly, we have
identified a novel developmental transcription factors that is up-regulated in IPF: Sine Oculis Homeobox Homolog
1 (SIX) and its co-factors eyes absent (EYA)-1 and 2. Using an experimental model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced
lung fibrosis, we demonstrate that deletion of SIX1 in AEC2 inhibited the development of lung fibrosis and
improved lung function and that SIX1 overexpression in AEC2 results in an atypical lung epithelization. Taken
together these results point at elevated SIX1 in AEC2 as an important pathway for lung fibrosis. Preliminary data
suggests that activation of this pathway promotes expression of senescent associate secretory phenotype
(SASP) factors and hyperplasia of AEC2, key features of lung fibrosis. However, the SIX1/EYA driven
mechanisms that promote these changes are not fully understood and will be interrogated in this proposal."
11064251,"From Bench to Bioequivalence: In Vitro Mechanistic Understanding of ASD Drug
Products in Simulated Gastrointestinal Conditions
– Project Abstract
 The findings from this project will enhance our comprehension of how food and gastric pH
affects the release of drugs from ASDs, and how the variability arising from differences in
formulations and manufacturing can impact upon in vivo performance. This project will generate
Tiny-TIMsg data on a series of amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) drug products under fasted;
fed and reduced gastric pH conditions and correlate this in vitro data to in vivo clinical data. In
the second step, a mechanistic modeling-based methodology will be employed to link the in vitro
dissolution obtained in the Tiny-TIMsg system to the in vivo performance of ASD drug products.
Using this in silico model, clinical performances of ASD formulation variants will be simulated,
and virtual BE (VBE) conducted to assess the impact of formulation and manufacturing process
modification on API’s exposure.
 The series of ASD drug products will be carefully selected to ensure that there is diversity in
products based on: method of manufacture; excipient composition and the ratio of stabilizing
polymer:API. Access to clinical data is critical in the selection of products hence the initial focus
will be on the identification of relevant data sets. All products to be tested will be interrogated to
identify data on degree of solubility enhancement required; pH dependent solubility and reported
food effect. Where formulations are not commercially available they will be manufactured to
match reported parameters using dissolution matching as the primary target.
 Output data from the Tiny-TIMsg will report the ratio of bioaccessible dose in either the fed
or the reduced gastric pH state to the fasted state; this will be correlated to the clinical data of
the ratio of the AUC in the fed or the reduced gastric pH state to the fasted state. Each
formulation’s performance in the Tiny-TIMsg will be closely interrogated to identify the kinetics
of precipitation to mechanistically understand ASD performance. The closely controlled and
reproducible nature of Tiny-TIMsg will enable discrimination at a level not possible with pre-
clinical or clinical testing; hence the ability to discriminate between formulations and identify risks
associated with food or reduced gastric pH in the prediction of in vivo outcomes. Coupling the
Tiny-TIMsg data to PBPK models will support formulation development and minimize future
clinical testing thus accelerating the speed of development of safe and effective medicines. The
developed and validated workflow will help to establish scientific and regulatory standards for
supporting innovative development of ASDs and performing virtual bioequivalence evaluation of
these generic drug products."

In the three major intracellular trafficking pathways–exocytosis, endocytosis and autophagy–proteins and
membranes are secreted, internalized or shuttled for degradation, respectively. These pathways are regulated
by the conserved Ypt/Rab GTPases that when activated by nucleotide exchangers (GEFs), recruit their
effectors to membranes. These effectors are machinery components that mediate vesicular transport steps,
from vesicle formation, through motility and targeting, to fusion. I have worked in the Ypt/Rab field since its
inception and contributed to the formulation of principles that underlie their mode of action. These include ideas
that they function in “GTPase modules”, which contain GEF/s, a GTPase, and effector/s, to organize pathway-
or step-specific membrane microdomains. While mechanisms underlying Ypt/Rab function are currently known,
questions regarding pathway and step coordination remain open. We propose that Ypt/Rab GTPases
coordinate intracellular trafficking at three levels: Coordination of multiple pathways, integration of transport
steps into whole pathways, and coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps of individual transport steps.
The proposed research relies on our recent findings using yeast as a model system, and we will continue using
yeast due to its smaller proteome that results in a much smaller interactome, which is important for exploring
the following coordination issues: Multiple pathways coordination: I propose that Ypt/Rabs coordinate
autophagy with secretion and endocytosis at two intersections. In the first, Ypt1/Rab1 is required for the
beginning of secretion and autophagy in the context of two different GTPase modules. In the second
intersection, merging of endocytosis and late autophagy is regulated by a shared Vps21/Rab5 GTPase
module. Here, we will determine whether cells prioritize certain pathways under different environmental
conditions and how such a priority is promoted. Integration of transport steps: Here, we will address two major
questions: First, how do Ypts regulate the beginning of a pathway, especially when a single GTPase functions
in the context of two different modules? Second, what are the specific mechanisms by which Ypts coordinate
early and late steps in secretion and autophagy? Coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps: We will explore
late steps of the secretory and autophagy pathways, for which members of the GTPase modules are known,
and ask how effectors that function sequentially are recruited. We will use classical and molecular genetics
combined with cell biology and biochemistry approaches to address these questions.
An efficient and well-coordinated network of cellular trafficking pathways is important for all the systems of the
human body, and even a minor defect can result in a severe disease. Ypt/Rabs in general were implicated in a
spectrum of acquired and inherited diseases, and those we study were associated with cancer and
neurodegeneration. Finally, we recently showed the value of yeast modeling in understanding how a
conserved protein variant causes a neurodevelopmental disorder."

Over 16 million children are HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU) globally, many of whom were
also exposed to maternal antiretroviral drugs in utero and/or during breastfeeding. Over a quarter
of all adolescents ≥10 years of age in Botswana are HEU. Children and adolescents who are
HEU experience increased risk of infectious morbidity, mortality, poorer growth and
neurodevelopmental delays compared to those born HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU). Yet,
much of the research to date following outcomes in this population has focused on assessing
health and neurodevelopmental disparities occurring in infancy, childhood, or adolescences. Little
is known about associations between gestational exposure to HIV and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs,
growing up in a household affected by HIV and adult health outcomes, including cardiometabolic
health, reproductive health, cancer risk, or mental health. We have the potential to follow
adolescents who are HEU into young adulthood, with detailed prospectively collected data on
their in utero exposures, including maternal viral load and specific ARV drugs in the Botswana-
based FLOURISH study (R33 HD103099) . However, only 41% of caregivers participating in the
FLOURISH study had disclosed their HIV status to their adolescents who are HEU. Contextually
appropriate tools and approaches are urgently needed to support caregiver disclosure of HIV
exposure status to their adolescents, creating the opportunity for longitudinal surveillance of
health and wellbeing outcomes into adulthood. Employing a multi-methods study design. the
Disclosure Intervention to Support Caregivers (DISC) study will advance an understanding of the
benefits of disclosure while facilitating the development of a contextually appropriate disclosure
tool designed to prepare caregivers for a disclosure discussion and provide caregivers with skills
for assessing their adolescent’s wellbeing post disclosure through the three scientific aims,
including 1) evaluating whether caregiver disclosure of HIV status is associated with lower
prevalence of depression and anxiety for both caregivers and adolescents, as well as improved
parent-adolescent relationships, where disclosure has occurred compared to dyads where
disclosure has not occurred; 2) developing tools to support caregiver disclosure of HIV status to
adolescents who are HEU, relying on in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and human-
centered participatory design workshops with FLOURISH caregivers and adolescents; and 3)
assessing acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the newly designed disclosure support
tool among a subset of FLOURISH caregivers who have not yet disclosed to their adolescents."

 Reconstructive surgeons are tasked with the restoration of soft tissue loss irrespective of etiology. Over
the past two decades, hydrogel scaffolds have become a vital platform for tissue revascularization and surgical
repair. However, their slow and random vascularization upon implantation often precipitates failure and precludes
true tissue regeneration and function. Native microvascular networks are characterized by organized tree-like
branching patterns that originate from large feeding vessels. Our objective is to utilize complementary
regenerative strategies based upon rigorous preliminary data that enables the rapid development of this
hierarchical microvasculature. To achieve our objective, we recently developed an innovative microsurgical
tactic termed vascular micropuncture (MP). In this method, small perforations are created using a needle in the
recipient vasculature to facilitate cellular extravasation and angiogenesis, without causing thrombosis or
significant hemorrhage. Such induced angiogenesis can be used to randomly vascularize an adjacently placed
hydrogel scaffold, leading to perfusion within 24 h and a doubling of neovascularization. With this compelling
result, we propose to advance the MP method using an emerging in situ microengineering technology. We have
developed granular hydrogel scaffolds (GHS) based on an extracellular matrix mimetic material with controlled
microporosity that improves cell infiltration and guides vascular network formation both in vitro and in vivo.
Our hypothesis is that customized GHS can be synergistically used with MP to hasten and precisely guide
hierarchical microvascular development. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following three independent
specific aims: 1) To design and optimize GHS to guide microvascular development, 2) To evaluate the effect of
MP characteristics to hasten microvascular development and 3) To evaluate the coupling effects of MP and GHS
to hasten and precisely guide hierarchical microvascular development. The successful completion of these
studies should markedly improve the vascularization of scaffolds used in soft tissue reconstructive surgery. Also,
it sets the platform for further investigation in building a hierarchical microvasculature that is cornerstone to blood
flow regulation, oxygen diffusion, and immune cell modulation. Consequently, our novel approach holds
immense potential for broadly advancing regenerative medicine."

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) increases with age and occurs when a single mutant
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) contributes to a significant clonal proportion of mature blood lineages. CHIP is
associated with increased risks of developing hematological malignancies. TP53 mutations rank in the top 5
among mutations identified in CHIP and clinical studies showed that expansion of TP53 mutated HSCs with
age predisposes individuals with CHIP to myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
During the previous funding period, we found that mutant p53 utilizes a cell intrinsic mechanism to drive clonal
hematopoiesis through enhancing EZH2 activity and increasing H3K27me3 in HSCs. However, there is a
significant gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which extrinsic factors drive TP53 mutant clonal
hematopoiesis. In the competitive renewal, we will focus on determining the impact of inflammatory stress on
TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis and developing novel strategies for preventing the progression of clonal
hematopoiesis to MDS. Infection activates inflammatory response and induces chronic inflammation. We
discovered that bacterial infection confers a competitive advantage to p53 mutant hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) via activating the NLRP1 inflammasome and increasing the secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we found that some p53 mutant mice developed MDS with age and
that there are increased levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the BM of aged p53 mutant mice. We hypothesize that
mutant p53 enhances inflammatory stress via activating the NLRP1 inflammasome and increasing the secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby generating a chronic inflammatory microenvironment that inhibits wild
type (WT) HSPC fitness in a paracrine fashion. We further speculate that reducing chronic inflammation will
prevent or delay the progression of TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis to MDS. To test the hypothesis, we will
determine the mechanisms by which inflammatory stress drives TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis. We will
develop novel strategies that block TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis from progression to MDS. Delineating
the impact of inflammatory stress on p53 mutant HSPC expansion will fill a significant knowledge gap
regarding the mechanisms by which extrinsic factors drive TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis and promote the
development of MDS."

In the Continuation of the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN II), the
investigators will advance the subtyping of study participants with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) with
the expectation that clinically useful patient subtypes will be identified. Research efforts will include continued
analysis of data and biospecimens from LURN I and development of additional, new and novel collaborative
studies to further improve our understanding of lower urinary tract dysfunction, both designed to generate
findings that may inform future clinical studies (e.g., clinical treatment trials) and ultimately improve clinical
management and patient outcomes.
Studies will also refine and evaluate the longitudinal performance of clusters identified in LURN I for patient
subtyping, including response to treatment. We will incorporate insights from the LURN I organ-based
diagnostics pilot study and biomarker pilot studies. We will evaluate the LURN Comprehensive Assessment of
Self-reported Urinary Symptoms (CASUS) instrument in populations with lesser severity of LUTS than seen in
the tertiary care setting in LURN I.
Consistent with the description in the RFA for this second funding cycle of LURN, the primary goal of this
proposal is to better define clinical phenotypes of patients with LUTS, to better describe the impact and
diversity of symptoms, and to develop new patient-centric tools for improved measurement of clinical
symptoms, all with the goals of informing future clinical studies and improving patient care and outcomes. It is
anticipated that the network will consist of up to six clinical sites and a single data coordinating center (DCC).
The DCC for the LURN study is charged with providing coordination, communications and logistical support,
clinical study design, centralized data management, biosample management, quality assurance, and analytical
support to the research sites and the NIDDK Project Scientist for all LURN studies. The proposing team is
submitting this response to RFA-DK-18-511 to continue as the DCC for the network.

As we age, the intrinsic ability of stem cells to self-renew and differentiate to maintain tissue integrity dramatically declines.
Therefore, understanding the processes leading to stem cell dysfunction with age is essential for the future development of
novel, effective stem cell-based therapies to treat disorders associated with aging. Therefore, my long-term goal is to
elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms of stem cell aging, manipulate them to rejuvenate aged tissue, and promote healthy
aging. More specifically, the insight provided by this proposal would be used to devise strategies to rejuvenate muscle and
hematopoietic stem cell function, and therefore promote skeletal muscle recovery and reduce age-associated systemic low-
grade chronic inflammation. To accomplish this objective, we will utilize mouse genetic models, models of skeletal muscle
degenerative injury and moderate exercise (voluntary wheel running; VWR), cell culture systems, imaging analysis, small
molecule inhibitors, flow cytometry analysis, physiological measures of recovery, genomics, and epigenomics (Cleavage
Under Targets and Tagmentation; CUT&Tag). In aged mice, both muscle stem cell (MuSC) and hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cell (HSPC) quiescence is disrupted, leading to reduced regenerative capacity. Recent studies used VWR to
restore quiescence and rejuvenate both MuSC and HSPC function in aged mice. The epigenetic landscape in both stem cell
populations changes dramatically, yet the mechanisms underlying these events as well as their contribution to age-associated
dysfunction remain understudied. The lysine methyltransferase 5a (Kmt5a) is the sole enzyme catalyzing monomethylation
of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me1), which is required for subsequent di- and tri-methylation by Kmt5b and Kmt5c,
respectively. Methylation of H4K20 is critical for chromatin organization and regulation of transcription, yet its role in adult
stem cells is entirely unknown, especially in the context of aging. Our preliminary data show that Kmt5a and H4K20me1
decrease in aged MuSCs. Specific deletion of Kmt5a in MuSCs recapitulates aging phenotype by decreasing the pool of
stem cells, suggesting disruption of quiescence and impaired self-preservation of the pool. Using the recently developed
epigenomic technique CUT&Tag, we assessed H4K20me1 in adult and aged quiescent MuSCs and found that H4K20me1
is mostly located at the genes’ transcriptional start site and significantly decreases with age. Further analysis revealed that
age-associated loss of H4K20me1 silenced numerous Notch genes including Rbpj, critical to maintaining MuSC quiescence.
Significantly, Kmt5a inhibition and subsequent loss of H4K20me1 in MuSCs led to decreased RNA Polymerase II serine 2
phosphorylation, suggesting the impaired release of promoter-proximal pausing and therefore potent gene silencing. Thus,
we propose to examine if the loss of Kmt5a, and consequently H4K20me1, in aging MuSCs contributes to the disruption of
their quiescence state. Also, we will determine the role of Kmt5a in regulating RNA Polymerase II promoter-proximal
pausing, and how this proposed mechanism contributes to controlling MuSC fate and function. Last, we will determine if
moderate exercise using a VWR model can rejuvenate MuSC and HSPC epigenome through the restoration of H4K20
methylation. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Determine the role of Kmt5a in MuSC quiescence regulation during
aging and 2) Determine the impact of VWR on Kmt5a-mediated epigenetic remodeling in aged MuSC and aged HSPC."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The precision and accuracy of vertebrate movement is mediated, in part, by the cerebellum. Two primary
divisions of the cerebellum – the cortex and nuclei – are clearly delineated modules that contribute to
behaviorally-relevant computations. Sensorimotor information is first processed by the cortex and is then relayed
to the nuclei by Purkinje cells (PCs). The resultant output of the cerebellar nuclei has profound influence on
downstream motor control, motivating questions of how nuclear activity is controlled by PCs. In a model behavior,
mouse reaching, reach endpoint dysmetria, a hallmark of cerebellar damage, is attributed to the dysfunction of
anticipatory braking signals from the cerebellar interposed nucleus that slow the limb near the intended target
location. This proposal builds on observations in the previous cycle that the firing rates between Purkinje neurons
and their targets in the interposed nucleus are inverse of one another, consistent with a population rate code
mediating information transfer. However, in addition to inverse rate coding, we find, as in other species and
behaviors, that Purkinje neurons synchronize simple spike firing selectively during behavior. Our proposed
studies investigate the sufficiency of PC rate and temporal coding to generate behaviorally relevant adjustments
to reach kinematics in mice.The objective of this proposal is to testthe central hypothesis that cerebellar cortical
circuits selectively transmit population activity through a synergistic rate and temporal code, imparted by local
cortical inhibition, and that this code is refined by learning. We propose to delineate the behavioral significance
of PC population coding, how it is generated by cerebellar circuitry, and how motor learning engages the dual
nature of this synergistic rate and temporal code. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Future therapies targeted
at ameliorating cerebellar disease will increasingly leverage understanding of computational mechanisms of the
structure, thus identifying those principles, the goal of this proposal, is of central importance."
11088314,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Parent Grant)
Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature infants. PHH is triggered
by germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
in the brain, compression of surrounding brain tissue, and permanent neurological deficits. While PHH is
clearly caused by an altered balance of CSF production and removal, the mechanisms are poorly understood,
limiting our ability to guide rational therapies. Here, we propose to examine two processes that could be
manipulated therapeutically to alleviate PHH: (1) ion and fluid transport by the choroid plexus (ChP), and (2)
ventricular blood clearance by macrophages. In adults under normal physiological conditions, sheets of
specialized ChP epithelial cells secrete CSF via an incompletely understood set of membrane proteins
including NKCC1, a phosphorylation activated bi-directional Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Strikingly, we recently
discovered that NKCC1 participates in CSF removal rather than CSF secretion during early stages of brain
development. CSF-K+ levels are significantly higher in embryos than adults, likely explaining this opposite
direction of NKCC1 water transport. Experimental introduction of blood into the ventricles during development
appears to further elevate CSF-K levels, and to drive intracellular calcium activity in ChP epithelial cells,
expression of the immediate early gene c-fos, and increased expression/phosphorylation of NKCC1. Our
findings suggest a novel counter-regulatory response to IVH in premature infants: ChP absorption of CSF via
NKCC1, driven by K+. We will test this hypothesis by determining if NKCC1 activation either worsens or
mitigates hydrocephalus in our mouse IVH model (Aim 1; preliminary data suggests the latter). We also found
that following IVH, blood products linger in the developing ventricles and may account for the persistence of
PHH. The brain's ventricles and the apical surface of the ChP are home to specific macrophages known as
Kolmer cells. While Kolmer cells have been implicated as responders to brain hemorrhage, their scavenging
and other functions have remained elusive. Our data suggest that during early stages of brain development,
ventricular macrophages/Kolmer cells are activated and recruited to the site of blood leakage within the
ventricle (Aim 2A) and that these macrophages are necessary and sufficient to clear blood and/or inflammatory
signals from the ventricles (Aim 2B, C). Collectively, our data suggest that the ultimate severity of PHH
depends on a developmental stage-specific interplay between blood products, ion gradients (e.g. [K]), immune
and inflammatory reactions, and NKCC1 expression levels. An estimated 20% of infants that experience
intraventricular bleeds develop PHH. We suspect this is due to insufficient endogenous compensatory
responses. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes by laying the groundwork for
development of clinical treatments that boost endogenous removal of CSF and blood that drive the pathogenic
processes that lead to PHH. This proposal should also guide therapies for adult IVH and other conditions with
disrupted extracellular ionic homeostasis."

 The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how
they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are
characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only
for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation
has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting
and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called
“jumping genes”). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain
critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. “junk DNA”), and their high
copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in
health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging.
In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between
males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity.
However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and
across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we
propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells),
and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group
will use a unique combination of ‘omics’ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal
models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful
genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I
have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will
decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex-
chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of
transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic
tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as
a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to
prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation
landscapes.

to support NIH program staff in development of HEAL CDEs, continued participation in the HEAL Collective
Board, and preparation of nal data sets suitable for deposit in NIH-designated repositories for incorporation into
the HEAL Data Ecosystem. Our continued collaboration with ERN investigators and integration with the other

11088677,"It is crucial to understand how infants learn to progress from spontaneous movements into goal-directed, refined
motor skills. Infant learning is the focus of early intervention programs, and the need for effective early
intervention is great. Until we understand the mechanisms of development and what promotes or inhibits
successful infant learning, we cannot design optimal early intervention. Our specific objective is to longitudinally
study infant experience (infant and environmental factors) and underlying neural substrates
(electroencephalography (EEG)) as infants learn arm reaching, an early, foundational motor skill.
Current theories suggest that infants learn through a repeated perception-action process and that experiencing
error is the key mechanism for successful infant learning. Thus, Aim 1 will measure error rate longitudinally
across the emergence and refinement of reaching. In Aim 1 we will determine the relationship between error rate
and the development of reaching skill. We hypothesize that infants will demonstrate a high error rate
(errors/attempts) near reaching onset that decreases as they refine the skill, supporting the idea that making
errors is a key experience in order for learning to occur. Aim 2 will focus on individual infant and environmental
factors that predict age of onset of reaching. In Aim 2 we will identify infant and environmental factors related to
the age of reaching onset. Infant factors are motor experience (amount and type (unilateral or bilateral) of daily
arm movement experience) and cognitive development status. Environmental factors are level of maternal
education, quality of caregiver-infant interactions, nutrition, and sleep. We hypothesize that these factors are
related to the age at which infants are observed to begin to reach, and we will determine the strength of the
associations and characteristics of infants reaching at different ages. The results will identify targets for
intervention that are most likely to be successful. Aim 3 will use EEG to determine how brain function changes
as reaching is refined from an unstable skill to a successful, lateralized (typically right arm preference) movement.
Using EEG will allow us to collect data in the home, both resting state and during arm movements. In Aim 3 we
will identify patterns of concurrent brain activity that differentiate between spontaneous arm movements, early
reaching attempts, and skilled reaches in infants with typical development. Based on our pilot data, we
hypothesize that frontal-parietal connectivity increases, interhemispheric connectivity decreases, and sources of
EEG activity shift from bilateral to unilateral as reaches become more goal directed, successful, and lateralized.
Aims 1–3 focus on infants with typical development; exploratory Aim 4 contrasts our findings with a population
likely to show impairment in learning to reach: infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. In exploratory Aim 4 we will
describe patterns of concurrent brain activity during spontaneous arm movements, early reaching attempts, and
skilled reaches in infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. Our results will determine the most relevant factors
related to an infant’s ability to refine his brain function and neuromotor control as he learns to reach."
11085507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the proposed research is to develop, validate, and apply measures of state-level structural
stigmatization and discrimination (SSD) for Latino/a/e (“Latine”) and sexual and gender minority (SGM)
populations. Latine SGM persons, specifically men and transgender women who have sex with men, face
inequities in HIV prevention and treatment outcomes. Latine SGM experience multiple, intersecting forms of
stigmatization and discrimination, which research by our team and others has shown to impact HIV-related
outcomes. However, most work has focused on the individual level, while measuring and mitigating these
phenomena at the structural level is a key strategy for Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States. Studies
of SSD in Latine populations are hampered by a lack of validated measures of anti-Latine SSD, with existing
measures focusing on immigration policy alone. Research on SGM SSD has expanded in recent years but the
field lacks consensus on which domains, constructs, and items to include in analyses and on methods to
ensure rigor and reproducibility of the research. Over this 4-year project, the investigative team led by MPIs
Scheim and del Rio-Gonzalez will work with Scientific and Community Advisory Boards to build consensus on
the domains and constructs needed to assess state-level Latine and SGM SSD through systematic reviews
and a modified Delphi study (Aim 1); draw on the consensus developed in Aim 1 to develop and validate
multidimensional indices of state-level Latine SSD and SGM SSD (Aim 2); and take a structural
intersectionality approach to examine relationships between SSD and HIV prevention and treatment outcomes
among Latine SGM persons (Aim 3). This study will advance the science of SSD by using community-
engaged, rigorous, and reproducible approaches to develop SSD measures for Latine and/or SGM health
equity research across multiple domains of health. We will make the validated indices and their underlying
datasets publicly available for the research community, alongside consensus-based guidelines for selection
and application of SSD measures. A multipronged dissemination and policy translation strategy will ensure the
utility of study products and results for community organizations, researchers, and policymakers working to
improve the health of Latine and/or SGM populations."
11087452,"Background: CKD is the 4th most common diagnosis among Veterans. Each year 13,000 Veterans transition
to ESRD. VHA supports over 52,000 ESRD Veterans on dialysis. The care of CKD costs VHA over $18 billion
dollars annually. Transition care of these Veterans is uncoordinated and suboptimal as most receive their pre-
ESRD care within VHA but over 90% are outsourced for their dialysis, on fee-basis. Thus, the majority of
Veterans progressing to ESRD have limited awareness of CKD and its management options including the
dialysis modalities. This leads to gross underuse (7%) of home dialysis (HoD). Professional renal societies and
VHA national CKD program advocate informed dialysis choice, and greater use of HoD for all patients
transitioning to ESRD. European and Canadian reports show that CPE empowers informed choice of dialysis,
increases HoD use, and improves the quality of CKD care. However, availability of CPE within VHA is limited
and HoD utilization is low. To address these issues, we have developed and pilot-tested a concise CPE model
in two different universities and affiliated VA in Florida and Arkansas. Our preliminary findings show that CPE
improves patient informed dialysis choice, and increases HoD selection to 74% and HoD use to 61%. In a
separate pilot study, we found that tele-CPE is as efficacious as F2F-CPE. Objectives: The overall goal of this
RCT is to investigate the impact of CPE on patient knowledge and confidence, HoD selection and use, and
patient-reported, health services and clinical outcomes in a cohort of Veterans who were diagnosed with CKD
and receive CKD treatment from the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NF/SG VHS). The
study aligns with HSR&D major research priorities including “patient-centered care, care management, and
health promotion” and “health care systems change.” The 4 Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Compare the impact of
CPE on Veterans’ knowledge of CKD, their confidence in dialysis decision making, and their selection of
dialysis modality, between the CPE and usual care groups. Aim 2: Compare Veterans’ actual use of HoD
(Primary Outcome) between the CPE and usual care groups. Aim 3: Examine Veterans’ perceived satisfaction
with CPE, explore their preferences for F2F- or Tele-CPE, and investigate barriers and facilitators in the
selection and use of their preferred dialysis modality. (Qualitative) Aim 4: Compare the following post-ESRD
secondary outcomes between the CPE and usual care groups. Patient reported outcomes: 1) health-related
quality of life and 2) satisfaction with dialysis; clinical outcomes: 3) time to ESRD, 4) estimated glomerular
filtration rate at ESRD, 5) need for inpatient initiation of dialysis, and 6) vascular access status at ESRD; and
health services utilization outcomes: 7) number of inpatient stays, and 8) number of outpatient visits, from
enrollment to 90-day post ESRD period. Methods: In this mixed method RCT, we will enroll 800 Veterans with
stage 4 or 5 CKD, ≥18 years of age, English speaking, and not yet on dialysis who receive CKD care from
NF/SG VHS. In 1:1 ratio, all the consented Veterans will be randomly allocated into intervention (CPE) or
control (enhanced usual care or EUC) group. For Aim 1, multiple regression analysis will be applied to model
the risk-adjusted post-intervention CKD knowledge and confidence in Veteran dialysis decision making; For
Aim 2, logistic regression will be used to compare the HoD selection and use between the CPE and EUC
groups. Aim 3 will be a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to obtain in-depth data on Veterans’
satisfaction with CPE, preference for CPE delivery, and barriers and facilitators to HoD selection and use as a
dialysis. For Aim 4, multiple regression analysis will be applied to model the risk-adjusted effects of CPE, HoD,
and the group-modality interaction on outcomes. Expected Results: We anticipate that CPE will enhance
Veterans’ CKD knowledge and confidence for informed dialysis selection, and increase HoD use, leading to
improved Veterans’ and health services outcomes. Next Step: If successful, this study may deliver a ready to
roll-out strategy to meet the CKD care needs of the Veterans and reduce VHA healthcare costs."

This is an application for a Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research for the parent
grant, “Dissecting spinal interneuron circuits to augment neurological recovery in Degenerative Cervical
Myelopathy (DCM)” (R01NS134644). DCM is a debilitating neurological condition caused by progressive
compression of the spinal cord, resulting in a wide range of devastating symptoms like loss of fine motor function,
compromised gait, sensory impairment, and chronic pain. The primary goal of the parent grant is to understand
and define the neural circuitry affected by DCM to develop strategies that improve patient functional outcomes.
The aims of the parent grant examine the anatomical and functional role of Dorsal type-3 interneurons (dI3 INs)
on forelimb function and plasticity in DCM and recovery. This diversity supplement request is for Ms. Allison
Brezinski, a highly qualified and ambitious PhD candidate whose long-term goal is to become an independent
neuroscience investigator. The research aims of this supplement examining dI3 interneurons in the role of
respiratory ability in DCM expand on the research within the parent grant and will provide Ms. Brezinski an
invaluable opportunity to lead and execute an independent research project. The training and experience
provided will hone her leadership skills while also expanding her expertise in neural circuits and neurological
disorders. Under this supplement, Ms. Brezinski will have full access to the co-investigators of the multi-
institutional parent grant to develop her networking skills and expand her scientific network for future
collaborations. Altogether, the award and completion of this supplement will be a crucial step in Ms. Brezinski’s
career and support her goal of becoming an independent academic researcher."
11088611,"Effective measurement of cognitive abilities is fundamental to effective diagnostics, risk assessment and
evaluation of interventions targeted towards older adults (OA) and in particular those with Alzheimer's Disease
and related dementias (ADRD). With the ubiquitous availability of smartphone/tablet technology in modern
society a proliferation of mobile cognitive assessments from companies, healthcare providers, and researchers
are being developed. However, a difficulty in evaluating such interventions, and in particular making comparison
between them is the lack of standardization/interoperability of assessment tools. This is especially the case for
early stage/mechanistic studies where it is common for investigators to each use their own labs' toolset to
evaluate intervention outcomes. Here we address particular needs in the field of cognitive training, as well as for
other longitudinal assessments focused on OA, where the limited standardization and accessibility of cognitive
outcome measures makes it difficult to evaluate effectiveness of interventions. This R21/R33 infrastructure
proposal seeks to develop shared tools to facilitate effective translation and sharing of cognitive assessment and
training procedures. We accomplish this by leveraging technologies, existing assessment batteries, and know-
how from 3 groups that have each independently developed robust systems for cognitive assessment and
training that can run on mobile devices (UCR Brain Game Center, UCSF Neuroscape Center, and UCI Working
Memory and Plasticity Lab). We target development of systems that allow for interoperability of assessments,
enrollment/participant tracking systems, data visualization, and participant compliance systems. In the R21
phase, we aim to develop such systems and demonstrate that they can be effectively shared across labs, and
in the R33 phase, these systems will be both tested for robustness in large scale-research projects that will now
be able to share outcome measures, and for developing personalized, precision training approaches for
participants based upon these assessments. Further, these systems will be documented and will be shared with
other scientists groups to reduce the barrier of entry for other groups. The long-term impact of this work will be
an infrastructure that will support better comparison across studies of cognitive training, as well as other
interventions that are increasingly being used to ameliorate cognitive declines in older adults such as those
related to ADRD. The key value of this system compared to others is that it will simultaneously support the
flexibility required for basic research, by facilitating groups to continue to use their own lab's software systems,
while at the same time providing them with a powerful infrastructure for sharing that allows them to incorporate
assessments, server infrastructure and compliance tools into their own studies. This will facilitate comparisons
across studies using common outcome measures as well as the ability to use the same assessments in
numerous other domains including risk-assessment and longitudinal testing in older adults at risk for ADRD."
11088521,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Controversy exists over the risk-to-benefit ratio of medical marijuana (MM) for adults with chronic non-cancer
pain (CNCP) on chronic opioid therapy (COT). Approximately 50 million adults in the United States suffer from
CNCP, a debilitating medical condition that is complex to manage. The majority of those with CNCP are
treated with COT, but the evidence supporting long-term effectiveness of opioid drugs for pain and improved
functional status is weak, and high-dose COT greatly increases risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid
overdose death. Because of the complex medical needs of this patient group, there has been enthusiasm over
the potential to treat CNCP with MM. However, evidence to support the effectiveness of MM to either treat
chronic pain, or to reduce opioid use, is weak, and there are risks associated with MM. Thus, the issue of
whether CNCP patients using opioids should use MM as an adjuvant therapy to COT remains controversial,
and there have been no randomized studies that have directly addressed this question. We propose to enroll
250 adults who endorse >6 months of CNCP with neuropathic pain, have received COT at a dose of 50-300
MME/day for >90 days, who have not used but are considering use of MM, and who report interest in tapering
their COT dose, into a randomized, pragmatic 3 site trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to begin MM
at enrollment or to a waitlist control condition (WL), and not initiate MM for 24 weeks. All participants will be
offered a 24-week, manualized behavioral prescription opioid taper support (POTS) program. We will evaluate
whether patients with CNCP on COT who are assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those assigned to
WL+POTS, show (1) greater COT dose reduction (MME/day), and/or greater improvement in pain severity on
a pain numeric rating scale (co-primary outcomes), (2) improved quality of life, (3) improved pain interference,
depression, and anxiety; and (4) improvement in cognitive functioning (working memory, attention, and
executive function performance), from baseline to 24 weeks. We will also assess the development of CUD in
those using MM. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed quantitatively for cannabis metabolites. The
proposed study will answer a timely and significant public health question regarding whether MM use with
behavioral support, compared to behavioral support alone, is beneficial or harmful for this population. This
information is critical for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers to evaluate the risks and benefits of
MM as an adjuvant treatment to COT for CNCP."

Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consume alcohol as an attempt to alleviate symptoms,
which can increase the risk of developing a drinking problem. However, well-adapted coping responses to stress
may protect against development of PTSD and mitigate subsequent alcohol use. Further, not only are women
twice as likely as men to suffer from PTSD, but certain individuals may be more susceptible or resilient in
adapting to stressful events. This suggests specific brain mechanisms that mediate sex differences in response
to stress and also individual differences in coping responses may mitigate against lasting consequences of stress
such as alcohol consumption. In this proposal, I will investigate how failure to engage in adaptive coping
strategies to stress may be driven by hypofunctioning between corticolimbic regions specifically the prelimbic
(PrL) cortex and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and whether increases in endocannabinoid signaling can
restore this maladaptive behavior. I utilize an animal model of stress exposure to the predator odor TMT, which
produces distinct coping behaviors between male and female rats, as well as individual differences in subsequent
increases in alcohol self-administration. Using this model, I will utilize a variety of chemogenetic,
electrophysiological and optogenetic techniques to directly manipulate the PrLBLA circuit and examine its
functional role in driving adaptive responses to stress and alcohol self-administration in male and female rats.
Further, I will investigate the direct role of endocannabinoid signaling in modulating maladaptive versus adaptive
coping responses and whether this signaling can act as a protective mechanism against later escalations in
alcohol self-administration. The K99 portion of this proposal involves extensive training using chemogenetic and
cell-specific molecular approaches and advanced electrophysiological techniques to probe both functional
changes and in vivo neuroadaptive responses. This training will provide me with a stronger neuroscience
foundation which will be critical to increase my competitiveness on the job market and will be important in my
independent career. Uncovering the neural mechanisms that drive maladaptive coping behavior and subsequent
alcohol self-administration within the K99 portion will provide future directions for the R00 phase. Studies within
the R00 phase will specifically assess whether endocannabinoids can directly restore PrL hypofunctioning that
leads to dysregulated neuroadaptations within the BLA and central amygdala (CeA) circuitry that drives
behavioral outcomes to stress. Together, completion of these aims will establish corticolimbic circuitry and
endocannabinoid mechanisms that drive coping strategies during predator odor stress and alcohol drinking.
Additionally, studies in this application will further my long-term research goal which is to elucidate
neurobiological mechanisms that underlie sex differences in comorbid alcohol use and PTSD."

7. PROJECT SUMMARY
Cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based structures that protrude from the apical cell surface to
perform important biological functions, ranging from signal transduction to fluid movement. The sperm flagellum
is a modified motile cilium that is essential for locomotion and fertilization of the egg. As such, abnormal sperm
flagella are one of the leading causes of male infertility. Although not completely equivalent, analogous
mechanisms are thought to operate during flagellogenesis and ciliogenesis. Defective ciliogenesis is associated
with human disorders, known as ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, and many of the male patients
also show fertility issues. Despite worldwide research efforts to elucidate the role of ciliary proteins in these
diseases, their physiological roles in male fertility remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that
mice lacking the key ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1) exhibit ciliopathy phenotypes. Molecularly, Cby1 interacts
with membrane-binding BAR domain proteins, called Cby1-interacting BAR domain-containing 1 and 2 (ciBAR1
and 2, formerly known as FAM92A and B), to facilitate ciliogenesis. More recently, we found that a Cby family
member, Cby1-Like (Cby1L, also known as Cby3), is expressed abundantly and exclusively in the testis.
Interestingly, Cby1L localizes to the annulus, a septin-based ring structure at the midpiece/principal piece
(MP/PP) junction in the sperm tail, in the testis. To gain insight into the in vivo function of Cby1L during
spermatogenesis, we created Cby1L-/- mice and found that male mice are completely infertile with the majority
of sperm showing kinked tails around the MP/PP junction. Curiously, in the sperm from Cby1L-/- mice, the annulus
is present but fails to stop at the MP/PP junction and progresses into the PP. Although the annulus is tightly
bound to membranes during its migration, in Cby1L-/- testis, the annulus is partially detached from the flagellar
membrane, suggesting that Cby1L is involved in anchoring the annulus to the membrane. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we found that Cby1L physically interacts with ciBAR1 as well as the annulus septin SEPT4.
Furthermore, we found that ciBAR1 localizes to the annulus, and ciBAR1-/- male mice are infertile, producing
sperm with kinked tails. Collectively, our preliminary data suggest an exciting working model in which Cby1L in
a complex with ciBAR1 stably anchors the annulus to flagellar membranes during its caudal migration and
precisely positions it at the MP/PP junction likely via membrane shaping and constriction. The overall goal of this
application is to understand the molecular roles of Cby1L and its binding proteins in spermatogenesis and male
fertility. To achieve this goal, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Investigate the role of Cby1L in
flagellogenesis using a Cby1L-/- mouse model; 2) Investigate the involvement of ciBAR1 in flagellogenesis and
male fertility; and 3) Identify novel Cby1L-binding proteins and characterize their functions during flagellogenesis.
We anticipate that our proposed research will unravel a novel mechanism underlying the proper
compartmentalization of the sperm tail by ciliary proteins."

This proposal targets the design, development and distribution of Bayesian statistical methods and software to study the historical and real-time emergence of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as Ebola, human immunodeficiency, influenza, Lassa, SARS-CoV-2, West Nile, yellow lever and Zika viruses. The proposal exploits novel scalable data integration to equip us for large-scale epidemics and pandemics and help inform actionable public health policy. Our multidisciplinary team carries expertise across statistical thinking, data science, evolutionary biology and infectious diseases to leverage advancing sequencing technology and high-throughput biological experimentation that can characterize 1 000s of pathogen genomes, phenotype measurements, ecological and clinical information from a single outbreak. Our chief innovations are three-fold. First, we will invent and implement scalable Bayesian phylodynamic techniques to integrate phenotypic measurements and study their correlated evolution with disease spread. Second, we will foster biologically-rich evolutionary models to map and understand heterogeneity in disease evolution through new efficient algorithms. Third, we will develop high-dimensional and mixed-type phenotype models to link concerted viral genotype i phenotype changes using massively parallel computing. Although no competing software exists to integrate phenotype and sequence data at this scale, we will compare restricted cases of our models with reduced datasets to current state-of-the-art approaches to evaluate computational performance improvement and bias that these limitations inject using real-world examples. This proposal will deliver low-level toolbox libraries and user-friendly software for deployment across a rapidly expanding range of large-scale problems in statistics and medicine."
11088466,"SUMMARY
Neurons use local translation to preserve the health of axons, dendrites, and synapses that are far from the
soma. Local translation allows them to respond to local needs. While studying the local synthesis of PINK1 in
axons and dendrites, we discovered that the PINK1 mRNA was transported into axons and dendrites by
“hitchhiking” on mitochondria. The association of the PINK1 mRNA with mitochondria was mediated by
synaptojanin2 and synaptojanin2 binding protein (SYNJ2BP). Synaptojanin2, like synaptojanin1, is an inositol
lipid phosphatase, but also contains a predicted RNA-Recognition Motif (RRM); mutation of the RRM in
synaptojanin2 prevents its ability to localize the PINK1 transcript to mitochondria. We know that synaptojanin2
can bind additional mRNA species, not just PINK1, including many for mitochondrial proteins. Thus
synaptojanin2 represents an important addition to the roster of mechanisms that can transport neuronal
mRNA. We therefore propose to study the broad significance of the synaptojanin2/SYNJ2BP mechanism for
mRNA transport in neurons and for the function of neuronal mitochondria. To this end, we have made both
mouse and human iPSC lines with mutations in the RRM of synaptojanin2 (SYNJAAA). In AIM 1 we will catalog
the neuronal mRNA species bound to the RRM of synaptojanin2 and determine the extent to which it is
required for their transport into axons and dendrites. In AIM 2 we will catalog the mRNA present on neuronal
mitochondria. We will determine to what extent synaptojanin2 and SYNJ2BP are needed for this localization.
We will also catalog the mRNA species present in synaptosomes from control and SYNJAAA mice to determine
which presynaptic mRNAs require binding to synaptojanin2 to reach the synapse. In AIM3 we examine the
functional consequences of mutations in the RRM of synaptojanin2 for the protein content of synapses. the
morphology and functioning of neuronal mitochondria, and the health and survival of neurons."
11088420,"Despite recent progress in the identification of mediators of podocyte injury, mechanisms underlying podocyte
loss remain poorly understood, and cell-specific therapy is lacking. Our long-term goal is to elucidate critical
signaling pathways that disrupt podocyte cytoarchitecture in order to identify targets for therapeutic intervention
for glomerular diseases. Our work has identified KIBRA (encoded by WWC1) as a key regulator of glomerular
disease progression, podocyte cytostructure, and podocyte injury via downstream LATS kinase activation and
YAP inhibition in the canonical Hippo signaling pathway. However, little is known about the regulation of
WWC1/KIBRA expression, and therapeutic implications for KIBRA upregulation in FSGS and diabetic
nephropathy remain unclear. Additionally, our preliminary data support non-canonical direct KIBRA downstream
regulation of transcription factors TEAD 1-4. The overall objectives of this application are to define the regulators
of WWC1/KIBRA expression and function in podocytes, test non-canonical KIBRA-TEAD signaling, and to target
LATS and TEAD as novel therapeutic strategies for KIBRA-mediated and diabetic podocyte injury. Based on our
preliminary RNA-seq analysis, our central hypothesis is that WWC1/KIBRA function in podocytes is repressed
by the micro-RNA 200 family and regulated by transcription factors such as SOX4. In addition to canonical KIBRA
regulation of LATS/YAP, KIBRA non-canonically directly suppresses TEAD 1-4 expression. Together, these
downstream signaling events disrupt podocyte structural integrity and podocyte-glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) adhesion, thereby promoting glomerular disease progression. The rationale for the proposed research is
that testing novel regulators of KIBRA, non-canonical KIBRA signaling, and both novel canonical and non-
canonical therapeutic approaches will significantly increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying
glomerular disease progression and advance the quest for new selective treatments. Our hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1 will test novel micro-RNA and transcriptional regulation of
WWC1/KIBRA expression and function and will define the biomechanical sequelae of KIBRA-mediated podocyte
structural disruption. Aim 2 will test downstream KIBRA non-canonical regulation of TEAD 1-4 and the effects of
LATS kinase depletion and inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will test the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacologic
TEAD agonists and LATS inhibitors individually and combined as multi-targeted therapy for KIBRA-mediated
and diabetic disease models in vitro and in vivo. The work proposed here is expected to define disease relevant
regulators of podocyte KIBRA expression and elucidate novel targets and treatment strategies for glomerular
diseases. In this diversity supplement, we will specifically focus on investigation of the therapeutic effects of
LATS inhibitors in KIBRA-mediated and hyperglycemia-induced podocyte injury and the potential benefits of a
multi-targeted TEAD agonist + LATS inhibitor treatment strategy in vitro and in vivo."
11088441,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Population history shapes human biology, genetic variation, and disease risk. Despite its importance, analytical
methods to study history on a genome-wide scale are limited in both their resolution and qualitative ability to
reconstruct aspects of the past. This makes it a priority to develop new methods that are able to model the
major population mixture events that have been documented as a result of the genomic and ancient DNA data
revolutions in the last decade. At present, the world's ancient DNA data suffer from major technical biases that
are not properly controlled for, the analytical toolkit for studying population mixture with modern and ancient
DNA is inadequate, and we are only beginning to develop methods that realize the potential of ancient DNA to
reveal as much about biology as about history. This proposal aims to address these needs by extending
funding for grant R01 GM100233, which from 2012-2020 supported the PIs' central research program on
developing methods for studying human population history and leveraging this information to learn about
biology, resulting in 70 publications linked to the grant. We propose three new Aims:
 (1) To create an unbiased pipeline for processing ancient DNA, and to use it reanalyze the world's data;
 (2) To extend the capabilities of admixture graphs for population history inference;
 (3) To introduce new tools for analyzing population history and biology.
 This grant will be of value in four ways. (a) It will support the development of methods and user-friendly
and well-documented software that will be important for evolutionary and medical genetics. (b) It will support
work that will result in insights relevant to finding disease genes in human populations that are recently or
anciently admixed. (c) It will lead to new discoveries about human history. (d) It will produce a publicly available
reprocessed version of the world's ancient DNA data that will be of broad use to the community.
 The link to medical genetics is important. In the past, we have been successful at drawing a direct
connection between our laboratory's work on detecting and characterizing population mixture, and human
biology including genetic susceptibility to disease. We leveraged the history of admixture in African Americans
to make new disease gene discoveries (for example, risk factors for prostate cancer), to understand variation
in disease risk across populations, and to document differences in the biology of recombination between
African Americans and people who do not have West African ancestry, which are predicted to lead to different
levels of risk for diseases associated with errors in recombination. Our focus on drawing connections between
population history and disease risk also highlighted the opportunities for discovery of recessive disease genes
in thousands of founder groups in South Asia. We anticipate that the methods and resources we develop with
the support of this grant will continue to synergize with the latest research on human variation and disease risk."

Nearly 30,000 US veterans are in the VA system being treated for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disabling disease
that results in motor, sensory and cognitive dysfunction. There is no cure and treatments have limited efficacy.
The overall goal of my lab is to provide a better understanding of the pathologic mechanisms that drive MS in
order to develop new and better treatment options. MS is classically described as a demyelinating disorder
where myelin loss is accompanied by axonal damage and irreversible neurological dysfunction. The prevail-
ing theme is that axonal pathology in MS is consequential of chronic, long term demyelination. Although axon-
al pathology clearly results from long term myelin loss, we propose that axonal pathology is also a primary
event in MS that occurs early in disease and independent of demyelination. Supportive of this idea, axonal
pathology is observed in both normal appearing white and grey matter; MS plaque load does not correlate
with axonal loss; and axonal number is reduced in regions lacking myelin loss . In further support that axonal
damage occurs independent of myelin loss and at very early stages of disease, we recently demonstrated that
axonal pathology is indeed a primary event in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
model of MS. Our findings indicate that the axon initial segment (AIS), the myelin-bare, initial region of the ax-
on responsible for action potential initiation and modulation, is specifically targeted by pro-inflammatory, reac-
tive microglia in the absence of myelin loss resulting in subsequent AIS disruption. Moreover, we showed that
anti-inflammatory treatment not only decreased microglial reactivity and microglia/AIS contact but also result-
ed in amelioration of AIS disruption and in AIS restoration. The clinical relevance of these findings is support-
ed by our most recent observations indicating that a similar AIS disruption also occurs in MS. Based on our
findings, our working hypothesis is that in MS reactive microglia migrate toward injury cues and undergo mor-
phologic change resulting in increased contact with the AIS facilitating the targeting of pro-inflammatory fac-
tors promoting AIS disruption independent of demyelination. Moreover, we propose that inhibition of microglia
response and interaction with the AIS will result in AIS preservation and restoration. Here, we present strong
preliminary data that a novel isoform of the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin (Nfasc) mediates the microglia
response in the MS model of EAE. Based on our findings and known functions of other Nfasc isoforms, we
predict that microglia-specific ablation of Nfasc will 1. inhibit microglial migration, surveillance and cytokine
secretion by disrupting actin dynamics and 2. result in structural and functional AIS preservation in EAE."

via the CCR2 receptor, inducing inflammatory responses, including the release of CCL5, and enhancing the
blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during ischemic stroke. Importantly, it has been shown that astrocytes are
responsible for the exacerbated CCL2 release post-ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that astrocyte-specific CCL2/CCR2 signaling modulates HIV-associated stroke severity and functional
recovery by regulating monocyte recruitment to the BBB, inflammasome activation, and modulating
innate immune responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are: 1) To evaluate the
hypothesis that astrocyte-derived CCL2 plays a critical role in the recruitment of proinflammatory HIV-infected
monocytes/macrophages into the brain, BBB breakdown, and potentiation of ischemic stroke injury in HIV
infection. 2) To evaluate the hypothesis that therapeutic targeting of the CCR2 and CCR5 receptors protects
against ischemic stroke in HIV-infected brain and accelerates functional recovery via astrocyte-specific innate
immunity mechanisms.
The proposed research will involve a novel conditional and astrocyte-specific CCL2-deficient mice, namely,
CCL2flox/flof;GFAP-Cre conditional knockout mice generated in our lab. Mice will be infected with a mouse adapted
to HIV strain called EcoHIV. We will investigate whether conditional ablation of CCL2 in astrocytes can reduce
exacerbated neuroinflammatory response. Moreover, we will therapeutically target the CCL2 signaling in
humanized mouse model of HIV infection by using the dual CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc, which can prevent
BBB dysregulation through NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Next, we will assess both the acute and long-term
effects of cenicriviroc on ischemic stroke outcomes. This proposal is conceptually innovative by being the first to
study mechanism-targeted therapeutic approaches for BBB protection in the context of stroke in HIV infection.
The results of this proposal will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between the
recruitment and infiltration of monocyte subsets into the ischemic brain and the severity of ischemic stroke
outcomes in HIV patients. The findings resulting from this proposal will help to establish associated pathways
that may be identified as promising new therapeutic targets."

The human gut microbiome is inhabited by trillions of bacteria that encode over 150-fold more genes than
the human genome itself. The inter-individual differences in microbial composition can be significant, and
the factors contributing to this diversity are not well understood. Metagenomic studies suggest that the
microbiome might play an important role in determining an individual’s predisposition to disease and
responses to treatments. The paucity of understanding how cofactors and other factors influence microbial
composition limit strategies to rationally alter it for therapeutic purposes. Much of our current understanding
of the factors that shape the gut microbial flora composition derives form studies on how bacteria generate
energy, maintain redox balance and acquire carbon and nitrogen. The enzymatic reactions that support
these metabolic processes often rely on cofactors that are in short supply. Vitamin B12 is an example of
one such cofactor that is essential for many bacteria that are unable to biosynthesize it and lack parallel
B12-independent metabolic pathways to circumvent its absence. So, one approach to the targeted
manipulation of the gut microbiome is via altering the levels of available corrinoids. In this proposal, I seek
to elucidate the corrinoid selectivity of transport systems to provide needed insights into how gut bacteria
compete with each other and their hosts for a critical resource in a complex ecosystem. My studies will
focus on Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron, a common gut bacterium, which lacks the genes required for de
novo synthesis of vitamin B12 but encodes multiple B12-dependent enzymes. 5’-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin
is the active cofactor form that is utilized by some B12 dependent enzymes and is synthesized by BtuR in
B. thetaiotaomicron. The chaperone and catalytic activities are uncharacterized and will be addressed in
Aim 1. It also encodes three copies of the outer membrane B12-transporter BtuB with each system
displaying a different preference for corrinoid derivatives. The bacterium also possesses additional
transport machinery that is not observed in E. coli, a model organism in which studies on B12 transport in
gram-negative bacteria have been focused. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical
approaches, I propose to elucidate the mechanism of B12 transport by the B12-uptake (Btu) system in Aim
2. The kinetic and thermodynamic studies in Aims 1 and 2 will define the selectivity of the Btu proteins for
cobamides and provide insights into protein-protein interactions. Combined with the structures determined
in Aims 1 and 2, my studies will furnish mechanistic insights into how a precious and rare cofactor is relayed
from the environment across two layers of bacterial membranes to support the metabolic needs of a
common gut bacterium."

GlyGen is a maturing (five years old) knowledgebase that accumulates data in the glycobiology domain and
connects it with other data types. GlyGen is unique; no other present or prior informatic resource has undertaken
such an integrative mission. In part, the lagging growth of accessible knowledge in the glycobiology domain,
compared to other -omics or biomedical research fields, reflects the inherent complexity of glycan structures,
which, unlike genes and proteins, exist in branched and isomeric forms whose biosynthesis is not attributable to
well-characterized, template-driven processes such as transcription or translation. Rather, glycan biosynthesis
is mediated by the regulated expression of ensembles of glycosyltransferases, substrate transporters, and
secretory pathway regulatory mechanisms that together generate dynamic cell- and tissue-specific patterns of
protein and lipid glycosylation. In addition, each glycosylation site on a glycoprotein may routinely be modified
by one of an ensemble of glycan structures, a glycoprotein feature called microheterogeneity. Importantly,
microheterogeneity is not random, but reflects the intrinsic biosynthetic capacity of specific cells and tissues and
may be modified by disease. These structural and biosynthetic complexities are essential contributors to the
tissue- and disease-specific functions of glycans and glycosylation, and, therefore, need to be captured and
represented in knowledgebases in a way that they can be queried and linked to other types of data. GlyGen
aims to expand its underlying data model to accommodate new and more complex datatypes, augmenting and
integrating new data types, and implementing robust modeling, unified procedures, and tools to improve
discovery and exploration of glycan and glycoconjugate data. Enhancement of the overall resource functionality
will be achieved through front-end improvements to accommodate user preferences and ensure exceptional data
communication and visualization. Improving the interconnectivity of GlyGen and its partner databases as well as
enhancing data-sharing across resources will continue to be core principles of the GlyGen project. All resulting
harmonized data will be available through highly permissive licenses for easy integration into other resources,
such as NCBI, EBI, SIB and other international efforts, as well as for easy repurposing by independent
researchers, educators, bioinformaticians, and commercial entities. By the end of the next project period GlyGen
expects to become the go-to, well-integrated resource for glycoscience data, similar to existing protein and
genomic resources and serving the same broad community of biomedical researchers."

This proposal is highly innovative because it makes available unique resources of the NIH
Clinical Center and intramural NCI programs to the only national and international Martin
Delaney Collaboratory (MDC), the Pediatric Adolescent Virus Elimination (PAVE) MDC
dedicated to pediatric HIV cure research. NIH-PAVE collaboration leverages expertise and
networks in PAVE to identify obstacles to protocol participation in groups currently under-
represented in cure research in the U.S., to recruit such individuals into studies at the JHU and
the NIH Clinical Center, to perform in-depth reservoir characterization with novel tools and to aid
with recruitment into studies of HIV cure. It represents the first nationwide protocol to recruit
young adults with perinatal HIV infection to study HIV reservoirs using contemporary
immunologic and virologic techniques and will establish a registry for long-term evaluation of
facilitating future research. The study will conduct new sampling features and combined
immunologic/virologic approaches to characterize the reservoir and rebound viremia. Once
established, ongoing research studies can be supported through existing mechanisms at PAVE
and intramural clinical programs (Maldarelli) and laboratories (Kearney, Maldarelli). There are
already several similar longitudinal studies of HIV infection in adults have been ongoing for over
25 years at NIH (e.g. NIH 97-I-0072/08-I-0221 Maldarelli, current PI; 88-I-0172, Wright current
PI), and have provided invaluable clinical data and samples for seminal achievements in
understanding the long-term effects of ART and the sources of HIV persistence and clonal
expansion, as barriers to HIV cure."
11090140,"A growing body of scientific evidence demonstrates that secure attachment and sensitive caregiving are
important sources of resilience for children living in stressful environments (e.g., Graham & Easterbrooks,
2000), contributing to children’s mental and physical health (Shonkoff, 2016). Conversely, research indicates
that insecure attachment is an important risk factor for the development of both childhood behavior problems
and physiological dysregulation (e.g., Luijk et al., 2010; see Fearon et al., 2010, and Groh et al., 2012, for meta-
analytic findings). Thus, efforts to prevent insecure attachment are crucial for children’s healthy development.
Although a few promising approaches to preventing insecure attachment, physiological dysregulation, and
childhood behavior problems have emerged (see Berlin et al., 2016), none has achieved widespread
implementation. What is urgently needed is evaluation of a comprehensive theory- and research-based
intervention protocol that can be widely implemented among families whose children are at elevated risk for
developing or maintaining insecure attachments, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems.
 The goal of the proposed study is to conduct an RCT of the Circle of Security – Parenting (COS-P)
intervention within Early Head Start (EHS) programs, in light of evidence that EHS children and families are
characterized by factors (e.g., low income, parental depression, exposure to violence/trauma; USDHHS,
2006a) that leave them at increased risk for insecure attachment and behavior problems. The project
addresses the NICHD CDBB priority of promoting psychosocial adjustment for at-risk children and of
understanding contributors to positive outcomes that can occur despite high-risk environments. Moreover,
the project addresses a critical barrier to progress in the attempt to reduce the risk of negative outcomes among
at-risk children by testing the efficacy of an intervention that was designed in collaboration with families and
staff from the real-world contexts in which it will be implemented. Principal aims are to examine whether the
addition of this brief attachment-based intervention to regular EHS services will (1) reduce child insecure
attachment, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems; and (2) promote sensitive parental responses
to child distress. Additional aims are (3) to examine potential moderators of intervention effectiveness and (4)
to test whether changes in parental response to child distress act as a mechanism of positive change.
 We have chosen HS/EHS as a strong service delivery mechanism because it is a widely available resource
in many communities, with an infrastructure and a commitment to the mental health of children. The HS/EHS
program has shown positive outcomes in some areas, yet evidence of reducing the risk of insecure attachment
is lacking (Spieker et al., 2005). The approach we take is noteworthy in that we consider the broader public
health context in which our attachment-oriented prevention protocol can be widely implemented.
 The RCT includes 249 parent-child dyads from the Harrisburg, PA and Lehigh Valley, PA EHS programs."
11090224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that result in nerve gap (segmental-loss, ablation) defects are the most
common and costly cause of temporary and permanent nervous system dysfunction. The current best clinical
practice to repair ablation PNIs is to suture to host nerves bridging devices such as autografts, acellular nerve
allografts or synthetic conduits. Outcomes are poor because the return of any sensation or behavioral recovery
depends upon slow and imprecise axonal outgrowths, often taking months to years to re-innervate targets. Viable
peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) are rarely used experimentally or clinically due to the risks of
immunosuppressive therapy and graft rejection.
 To greatly improve current treatments for segmental-loss PNIs, our team will translate our synergistic
technologies of localized immunosuppression and polyethylene -induced axon fusion (PEG-fusion) of viable
PNAs. PEG-fusion of PNAs rapidly (within minutes) restores cytoplasmic/electrical continuity and prevents
Wallerian Degeneration to 40-60% of axons, immediately re-innervates denervated tissues and reliably promotes
a highly accelerated return of voluntary behaviors within weeks. PEG-fused chimeric axonal segments within
PNAs are not rejected by the host even without immune suppression (ISN) and tissue matching. Localized ISN
further reduces the immune response.
 Translation of PEG-fused PNAs with localized ISN technologies would produce a paradigm shift from
current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, acellular nerve allografts
or conduits, where the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration. In contrast, repairing
ablation PNIs by PEG-fusion/localized ISN of donor allografts applied within three days of injury would generate
significantly improved functional outcomes (weeks instead of months/years) produced by PEG- fusion axons and
robust regeneration of non-fused axons through the viable PNA enhanced by localized ISN.

The blood-retina barrier (BRB) protects the retina by limiting extravasation of solutes and immune cells and by
providing active transport mechanisms for required nutrients and hormones. BRB dysfunction is implicated in
retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization, retinal occlusive diseases, uveitis,
macular telangiectasia, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and Coat’s disease.
Although the key role of canonical Norrin and WNT7A/B signaling in inducing and maintaining blood-CNS
barriers has been identified, highly potent and therapeutically amenable agonists of these pathways that could
promote or restore BRB function are lacking. Signal initiation by Norrin requires the receptor Frizzled4 (FZD4)
and two co-receptors, low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12).
Here, we use an entirely novel agonist to activate canonical (i.e., beta-catenin-dependent) signaling in
endothelial cells. The agonist is a human antibody modality that functionally mimics Norrin and WNT7A/B. The
mechanism of action and its efficacy in distinct types of BRB defects are not known. We will conduct cell-based
experiments to test the hypothesis that the agonist activates signaling by inducing complex formation of
receptor and co-receptor molecules. To understand which types of BRB defects can be restored by the
agonist, we will use multiple mouse models with BRB defects that have distinct characteristics. We will
determine the efficacy in restoring the BRB in each model, perform transcriptomic experiments and
immunohistochemical analyses to identify mechanism of BRB restoration, and quantify vascular density. BRB
defects, e.g., in macular edema, are treated with anti-VEGF or anti-inflammatory drugs. However, anti-VEGF
therapies are not effective in all patients, and other patients may develop resistance. The novel agonist used
here has an entirely different pharmacodynamic profile compared to anti-VEGF and anti-inflammatory drugs.
Therefore, it is important to evaluate this drug candidate for its therapeutic potential."

 My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these
methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open
source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in
user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of
small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep
learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability
limitations inherent in current approaches.
 We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra-
ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod-
eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties
represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have
desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures
almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and
ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc-
turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further
develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative
process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.
 We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac-
tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the
ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and
diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi-
dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets,
such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications
of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.
 Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools
for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug
discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA,
a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a
Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits.
These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient."

MRCP+ metrics are quantitative markers of the biliary tree which can be used to inform
biliary tree health. These markers have shown promise as dynamic biomarkers which
can be used to support disease monitoring and, by extension, support the assessment
of the effects of pharmacotherapies. In this project, Perspectum Inc. seeks to complete
the necessary evidence to qualify the MRCP+ metric number of strictures as a
monitoring Drug Development Tool for PSC. It is envisioned that this MRCP+ metric
will be used in conjunction with clinical assessments, to identify patients who are more
likely to meet endpoints (including biochemical and imaging endpoints) in clinical trials
signifying appropriate response to treatments.
With the funding from this Drug Development Tools Research Grant, and leveraging
the close collaboration with the FDA, we will perform a retrospective multi-center
longitudinal observational study in 150 participants.
Primary objective:
 1. To collect and analyze MRCP data to generate 3D models and
 associated MRCP+ metrics which will be used to determine the change
 in the MRCP+ metric ‘number of strictures’ in relation to disease
progression.
Secondary Objectives:
 1. To collect clinical data which can be used to determine the
 prognostic utility of change in the MRCP+ metric ‘number of strictures’
 for predicting clinical outcomes (including cholangitis, requirement for
 ERCP, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatobiliary malignancies,
 liver transplant or death).
 2. To collect clinical data which can be used to determine whether
 change in predicts incidence free transplant free survival.
The study will be performed in collaboration with members of the CALiD registry who
will include a representative sample of their patient population. Patients must have at
least two time points of interim duration of 6 months or more with associated clinical

Currently approved therapies for osteoporosis can reduce spine fracture risk by 50-75% and hip fracture risk
by up to 50%. However, due to fears about very rare side effects, use of osteoporosis medications has
declined by 50% since 2008. Therefore, there is a strong need for new therapies that have a strong safety
profile, perhaps with greater efficacy and convenience for the patient. However, new trials require fracture
endpoints and must be very large: as long as 5 years with > 16,000 patients making the development of new
medications extremely expensive and no longer feasible.
The FNIH-ASBMR-SABRE (Study to Advanced BMD as a Regulatory Endpoint) began in 2013 with a primary
goal of qualifying the treatment-related change in bone mineral density (BMD) as a surrogate endpoint in future
trials of new anti-osteoporosis therapies. Successful completion of this goal would prompt innovation and
facilitate new drug development. To this end, we have collected individual patient data from >150,000 patients
in >50 randomized trials and used this unique resource to perform analyses to determine a strong relationship
between larger BMD increase and greater fracture reductions in those trials.
Starting in 2016, we began work with the FDA to obtain formal qualification of change in BMD as a surrogate
endpoint for fracture in future trials. To date, our Letter of Intent and Qualification Plan have been approved by
the FDA and we submitted our Final Qualification Package in August 2023. FDA issued a Reviewability
Memorandum in March 2024, agreeing to complete review by January 2025.
The current proposal will fund our continued work on this project including responding to any questions during
or following the review. If approved, change in BMD would be the first surrogate biomarker qualified by FDA.
Therefore, as part of this proposal, we will also address a number of unique questions regarding the practical
implementation of this, the first FDA qualified, surrogate biomarker.
For this project, we expect to be meeting with FDA to respond to the suggestions in the review of the FQP and
after to advise on the implementation of this surrogate.
The qualification of BMD change as a surrogate endpoint for fracture in future trials of antiosteoporosis
therapies would be a breakthrough in the field that would lead to expedited development of new medications
and enormous benefits for osteoporosis patients and public health."

To prepare ourselves for the aging of our increasingly diverse population, we must increase minority
representation in the sciences, and train young researchers to understand neurocognitive aging and
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), and associated health disparities. CSUF and USC
propose an innovative and transformative program entitled, “Neurocognitive Aging & Analytics Research
Education (NAARE)” that builds upon our current biomedical research education program on data science and
brain health. In the coming decades, the United States and the world will face a rapidly growing aging
population, with an insufficient number of experts trained in ADRD research to accommodate this increase.
Even though ethnic and racial minorities, including African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans/Alaskans
comprise over a third of the U.S. population, they are under-represented in aging studies, leaving us with
insufficient knowledge of the genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute to cognitive decline in these
populations. The representation of minorities in science and biomedical fields also remains comparatively low.
Increasing the number of trained researchers from these underrepresented groups may provide insights into
social contextual issues and other factors related to underrepresentation, which may subsequently promote
access to these important populations in order to subsequently improve health disparities related to
neurocognitive aging in these vulnerable populations. Therefore increasing the number of underrepresented
aging researchers continues to be a high national priority. The NAARE program addresses this gap as follows:
Aim 1: Provide NAARE scholars hands-on research experiences: Engage three consecutive cohorts (n =
10 per year) of predominantly underrepresented minority undergraduates (50% female) in a 1.5 - year faculty
mentored, student-driven research focusing on neurocognitive aging, ADRD, and related health disparities
and modifiable risk factors. Aim 2: Develop educational curricula: Traditional and multimedia curricula will
be developed for NAARE scholars and also targeted towards a larger diverse student audience (n = 4,500) on
the following: basic science behind normal brain aging and ADRD; health disparities, modifiable risk factors
and neurocognitive aging; neuroimaging and analytics; and research methods in neurocognitive aging. Aim 3:
NAARE Scholar Graduate/Career Preparation: To ensure sustainability and student success, NAARE
students will engage in ongoing faculty advising, receive exhaustive graduate school application support via
hands-on guidance, and explore first-hand, research intensive universities. In-depth mentored, yet student-
owned research experiences that integrate intensive neurocognitive aging and ADRD training, and belonging
in the broader scientific community will result in successful future scientists. This program will lead to a greater
number of students from underrepresented backgrounds choosing careers in neurocognitive aging and
succeeding at them. Our students will become diverse role models for future students for generations to come."

Dr. Jonathan Santoro is a clinician-scientist focused on exploring the interface between vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and inflammation in persons with Down syndrome (DS). This five-year
mentored career development award will provide him with advanced training and skills in population-based
data analysis, biostatistics, neuroimaging, and clinical trials development to ensure a successful transition to
an independent research career. The outlined proposal builds on previously published work by Dr. Santoro and
leverages a mentorship team of experts in DS, neurodevelopment, vascular disease, and cerebrovascular-
inflammatory disorders in persons with DS at his home institution and other large academic DS centers.
Research Context: Persons with DS have an increased risk of early CeVD, specifically moyamoya syndrome,
and the initial presentation is often irreversible neurologic insult secondary to cerebrovascular accident. For
persons with DS, there exists no validated means of assessing risk for CeVD. This K23 career development
builds on previous work by Dr. Santoro who identified non-invasive ways to screen for CeVD in children with
DS. This study will prospectively asses blood pressure (BP) in persons with DS and subsequently use this to
predict pre-symptomatic CeVD (Aim 1). Next, this study will compare gold standard CeVD neuroimaging
studies to various non-invasive, low-cost, biometric tools such as repeated BP measurements, transcranial
Doppler ultrasound and neurocognitive testing to assess internal and predictive validity of these measures in
the prediction of CeVD (Aim 2). As persons with DS are established to have immune dysregulation and
systemic inflammatory profiles, we will also explore the role of systemic and vascular inflammatory biomarkers
in the development of CeVD with the goal of identifying contributory inflammatory cascades that could be
targeted with therapeutic interventions geared towards preventing CeVD in subsequent studies (Aim 3).
Career Development Plan: Dr. Santoro will complete coursework in healthcare and science communication,
data analysis, epidemiology, clinical trial design and biomedical informatics. This plan also will strengthen his
competence in both bioinformatics and neuroimaging and be supplemented by institutional workshops and
seminars. This experiential learning is designed to promote knowledge and skillset development needed to
both execute his research and ensure that skills are developed for his transition to an independent researcher.
Dr. Santoro’s career development goals will be supported through close mentorship by an experienced and
committed interdisciplinary team and a combination of didactic, experiential, and team-based learning. This
proposal and subsequent R01 proposals seek to improve the neurologic care of young persons with DS."
11090776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Functional activation of the cerebral cortex creates a robust increase in local temperature by increasing blood
flow and metabolism because of neurovascular coupling. Changes in surface brain temperature while an awake
patient performs a motor, sensory, or language task can be used to infer spatial patterns of activity to create
functional maps. Awake neurosurgery is used in the management of drug-resistant epilepsy, glioma, and
neurovascular malformation, in order to localize seizure and/or physiologic activity. Protection of key functional
areas is imperative to avoiding postoperative neurologic deficits. Currently, direct electrical stimulation (DES) is
the most commonly used method of intraoperative surgical mapping, which identifies functionally critical brain
regions so they are not resected. However, DES has low spatial resolution (~1 cm), may provoke seizures, and
can only test one area at a time. This project investigates a new method of intraoperative functional mapping
based on infrared thermography, which has high resolution (~100 micron) and simultaneously monitors the
entire exposed brain surface without risk for seizures. The Intraoperative Mapping System will be developed
and tested on glioma patients, as tumors have relatively static impact on brain temperature compared to
epileptogenic foci and vascular malformations. Preliminary data in motor and language mapping cases shows
large (~0.5oC) positive thermal activation of contralateral motor cortex and language regions that have strong
agreement with DES. Aim 1 will develop a mapping system (hardware and software) required to conduct real-
time thermal-based brain mapping during awake craniotomy. We will optimize and integrate the infrared
recording procedure within the surgical workflow, to maximize signal quality while minimizing treatment
interference. The central piece is a mobile cart containing a powerful workstation and an articulating arm to
locate the IR camera over the craniotomy. The computer will deliver stimuli, monitor and collect behavioral data
(audio, video, and a wireless haptic glove), record the IR images, and display the real-time functional map.
Patient tasks currently used during DES will be adapted for thermographic recording. Aim 2 will explore the
temporal and spatial properties of the thermodynamic response to optimize the infrared mapping procedure.
The thermal response function (TRF) is the thermal equivalent of the hemodynamic response function (HRF)
that is used in fMRI. Through modeling and high resolution (spatial and temporal) IR data, we will estimate the
thermal impulse response and use it to develop an efficient multi-task mapping protocol. The result will be a
rapid, efficient, high resolution assessment of brain function to optimize the resection and improve patient
outcomes. Aim 3 will compare the functional mapping methods (DES and infrared thermal imaging) to determine
optimal synergy between them to provide the best information for the safest resection. If successful, this project
will create a new method for intraoperative functional mapping during awake neurosurgery. Ultimately, we hope
to improve the precision of intraoperative brain mapping while increasing the safety and efficacy of surgery for

Type-1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in pancreatic islets. Autoantigens exposed on the cell surface are the earliest targets in the autoimmune process and thus useful markers for disease initiation and progression. At present, none of the clinically used diagnostic autoantibodies can recognize autoantigens on the beta-cell surface. Zinc Transport-8 (ZnT8) is a major islet-specific membrane protein with a dynamic subcellular distribution. ZnT8 on the cell surface is a major antigenic target of islet autoimmunity and also a cell-identity marker of pancreatic beta-cells. Hence, surface-directed ZnT8 autoantibodies could be used to develop bioanalytical tools to address unmet needs in diagnostics. In this proposed work, we will develop a membrane-reconstituted ZnT8 biosensor to detect cell-surface ZnT8 autoantibodies in the peripheral blood and evaluate their diagnostic value in patients with type-1 diabetes; The proposed research will yield new bioanalytical technologies that can enable detecting cell-surface autoantibodies in the earliest phase of islet autoimmunity development. The applications of these technologies to clinical practice will help establish evidence-based medicine for type-1 diabetes."
11089066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pharmacogenomics has the potential to dramatically improve health care outcomes but is currently failing on
diversity among its research participants. As a consequence, we do not fully understand all of the factors
influencing pharmacological response in underrepresented populations, including those that contribute to
racial/ethnic differences in drug efficacy and safety as reported by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug
labels. For example, the clinical validity of genetic variants that are common in research participants from
historically excluded populations (e.g., lower proportions of European genetic ancestry) but rare in well-
represented study populations remains unknown. In addition, gene expression studies have already provided
insight into the underlying biology of disease susceptibility for numerous conditions beyond what genome wide
association study (GWAS) results alone have discovered but have not been fully applied to studies of
pharmacogenomic discovery. Furthermore, social determinants of health may impact pharmacological drug
response from a biological standpoint even after taking into account the effects of these factors on drug
adherence, access, and utilization (e.g. social determinants of epigenetics). Addressing this gap in knowledge
has the potential to prevent future healthcare disparities that may be exacerbated as the infrastructure to support
clinical pharmacogenomics continues to gain traction across health institutions nationwide. Furthermore,
elucidation of the genetic and nongenetic contributors to differences in drug response across race/ethnicity will
obviate the use of this population descriptor as a proxy for these factors. Pharmacogenomic studies using large,
diverse datasets are necessary to ensure that advances in this field benefit individuals equitably.
Our primary goal in this project is to identify genetic and social determinants of pharmacological drug response
among racial/ethnic minorities. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage data from the Kaiser Permanente
Research Biobank (KPRB) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All Of Us research program, which are two
of the largest electronic health record-linked biobanks in the United States. These cohorts are ideal for the
proposed studies because they are large (>400,000 participants each), diverse (>25% racial/ethnic minorities),
linked to genome-wide genetic data, and capture social determinants of health.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the relative contribution of genetic ancestry versus social factors on race/ethnicity-
based differences in drug efficacy and safety. In Aim 2, we will identify genome-wide polymorphisms predictive
of drug effects in historically excluded populations from large pharmacogenetics studies. In Aim 3, we will use
ancestry-specific gene expression results to identify genetic determinants of drug response. The aims will be
carried out by an established multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical pharmacology, cardiovascular
epidemiology, and molecular genetics. These findings from the current study will help to inform clinical decisions
impacting communities historically excluded from biomedical research."
11089075,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects
on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S.
adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to
ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are
a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment
paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms.
Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported
symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making.
Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS
symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated,
and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract
Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to
categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s
approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using
a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and
clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS
through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients,
community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on
the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a
new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380
participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used
to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women
with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported
outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN
I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize
the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of
urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes
researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS."
11089745,"Intrathecal oxytocin (OT) is in clinical trials as an opioid alternative for chronic pain treatment. Our work in mice
suggests that coupling intrathecal oxytocin with manual therapies (i.e. massage) optimizes the analgesic
properties of oxytocin. This project provides the framework to support this combination therapy by concentrating
on the spinal cord circuit mechanisms by which oxytocin alleviates pain. Our preliminary studies suggest that
oxytocin-specific spinal cord circuits are embedded within a previously uncharacterized dorsal horn
nociceptive/affective touch circuit. We will carry out three complementary sets of experiments to test the overall
hypothesis that oxytocin alleviates pain by balancing excitation, inhibition, nociception, and affective touch to
sculpt the activity of spinal projections systems that carry both negative valences (associated with noxious
stimuli), and signals associated with positive valence (like the pleasurable properties of touch). Pharmacological
and behavioral studies in rodents suggest that spinal cord oxytocin receptors (OTRs) mediate intrathecal
oxytocin-induced analgesia. In Aim 1 we map the distribution of OTR+ interneurons within the dorsal horn of
female and male mice, rats, and humans. In Aim 2, we map the specific input/output profiles of OTR+INs. Here
we test the hypothesis that inhibitory and excitatory OTR+INs integrate peripheral nociceptive/affective touch
information with OT to differentially regulate the activity of molecularly defined Lamina I projection neurons. In
Aim 3 we assay the contribution of OT spinal cord circuits to both sensory-evoked reflexes and affective-
motivational pain. For Aim 3 we implement our recently developed computational approaches to scale sensory-
reflexive and affective-motivational pain. Results from our human tissue studies will inform how our
interpretations of our rodent studies may be applied to human therapies. Based on our unique expertise in touch-
specific spinal cord circuits, access to a large repertoire of spinal cord-specific tools, and behavior analytics that
match the granularity of our circuit dissection techniques, we are uniquely poised to provide the theoretical
framework for this combination therapy. In addition to informing context and condition for OT delivery, this work
may also be used in the clinic to adjust OT dosage and delivery method. This project is impactful for several
other reasons: 1) using computer vision/machine learning we will uncover the specific aspects of the pain
experience that are alleviated by spinal cord OT, and assess efficacy against other analgesics; 2) our
computational approaches to objectively scale rodent pain can be easily shared and implemented across
research groups, serving as a blueprint to standardize rodent pain assessment (see Resource Sharing); 3) our
general approach and model can serve as a basic blueprint for testing how other neuromodulators are
functionally integrated into spinal cord circuits of touch and nociception; and; 4) this type of foundational work
informs innovative approaches to disentangle the sensory from the emotional experiences of pain, inspiring new
therapies to treat each uniquely."

This application is for renewal of funding for the Utah Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (UCEER). Our
Center has received funding under a P20 grant from 2014 – 2016 and under an RM1 grant from 2016 – 2020.
UCEER is primarily focused on ELSI issues in population-based genetic testing and screening. For the current
funding cycle, UCEER has had a strong emphasis on newborn screening, prenatal screening and carrier
screening. For this renewal, we propose extending this focus to also address issues with genetic disabilities,
including cost- effectiveness of treatments, adaptation and support within families and the community, and
legal/policy issues. In addition, we propose to address issues arising from population-based heritage testing
by direct to consumer genetic testing companies. We propose to maintain a robust set of efforts to involve
faculty from a broad range of disciplines and students from the undergraduate to post-doc levels. UCEER has
received a R25 award from NHGRI, linked to our RM1 funding, that supports undergraduate and graduate
students who identify with a disability. UCEER has developed an efficient administrative structure and

11089196,"Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery.
While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on
predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be
even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer
chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some
cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac
contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart
and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+
can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate
arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins.
Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to
cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage,
calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable
to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cellby-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes,
but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high
throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile
motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will
be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated
microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test
compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will
develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs
representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response,
30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and
specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based
preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models
and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research."

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent up to
90% of cervical cancer cases by preventing HPV infection when administered prior to exposure to HPV and it
is recommended for girls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low in low- and middle- income
countries (LMICS) where risk of dying from cervical cancer is high, especially in Zambia (site of parent grant;
UO1CA275033). REACH aims to increase access to and uptake of the vaccine using implementation science
methods. However, implementation science is a field developed in the U.S. and only recently has started to
recognize the importance of explicitly recognizing equity in the implementation process. Transposing
approaches from high income countries risks failure when misunderstanding contexts, relying on leadership
and expertise from HICs, and maintaining colonization practices This supplement project, responding to the
call for Administrative Supplements for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research (NOT-CA-24-028), is a
methods study aiming to explicitly investigate how equity and decolonization practices can be embedded in
capacity building practices and implementation process. This is a methods-focused study aiming to strengthen
Dr. Asante's knowledge and skills on implementation science with a focus on team collaboration. To achieve
these goals, we will adapt an evidence-based matrix mentoring model for global collaboration, including self,
senior, scientific, staff mentors and sponsors. We conceptualize equity as a process aimed at reducing
disparities and its root causes, including social, structural, and political determinants. Centering equity in
implementation entails building trusting relationships, dismantling power structures, and investing in strategies
that advance equity. We will use methods of reflexivity based on Alexander et al's. model to enhance personal
and team awareness of their own positionality. The model proposes that three reflexivity practices (reflexivity
in, on, and underlying action) are tied to five actions from the Ottawa Charter: a) building healthy public policy,
(b) creating supportive environments, (c) strengthening community actions, (d) developing personal skills, and
(e) reorienting health services. Based on this model, Dr. Asante will: (1) Center equity in the REACH team
using Alexanders' three types of reflexivity, and (2) Center equity in the development of the
implementation strategies. The project will produce a needed outline of methods for the field of
implementation science on how to explicitly outline reflexivity and center equity during the implementation
mapping process. This supplement will also strengthen Dr. Asante's skills in global research leadership as an
implementation scientist, supporting her to reach her mid-term goal to MPI an R01 in implementing color
cancer screening in Zambia, further enabling her to reach her long-term goal of launching her own independent
research in CRC prevention."
11089253,"Summary
One of the most pressing research goals in neurobiology is to understand how brain circuits develop, and how
these circuits control the behavior of an animal. This problem is of general importance if one wants to
understand, and (therapeutically) manipulate, brain circuitry in a medical setting. A prerequisite to attain this
goal is (1) the detailed mapping of complete neuron assemblies that embody specific circuits, and (2) the
availability of precision tools for functional studies. Both of these conditions are now met for Drosophila.
Complete connectomes (digital maps that contain all brain neurons and their synaptic connections) exist for
both the larval stage (funded in part by this grant in previous years) and the adult. And in addition, genetic tools
have been developed that allow one to manipulate (that is, silence, or activate) virtually every neuron, or at
least neuron class, and test for the effect on specific behaviors that one is interested in. The strategy then is to
extract from the connectome a wiring diagram of a specific circuit, develop hypotheses of how the different
elements in the circuit interact, and use genetic tools to test these hypotheses.
 Studies of this proposal focus on a Drosophila brain circuit involved in navigation. Animals navigate in
response to sensory stimuli in order to find food and mating partners, or avoid danger. Brain centers controlling
navigation require processed, multimodal sensory input (smells, visual cues) which are integrated with
proprioceptive input (feed back from muscles, joints etc) to calculate the commands required to steer the
animal in the right direction. Our analysis of the larval connectome highlights a brain center called the lateral
accessory lobe (LAL) as a focus of interest. We have identified the relevant LAL neuron classes and their
connections, and are in the process to systematically screen for genetic constructs with which we can target
these neuron classes to do functional studies. Larvae have a simple, highly quantifiable navigation behavior
that allows them to find a food source (by odor) or avoid light. We will analyze how the LAL controls motor
circuits that carry out this behavior.
 The second and third objective of the proposal is to study how the larval LAL neurons become
modified and incorporated in the LAL of the adult. Adult flies have a new set of organs (e.g., wings, legs) with
which to move, and receptors with which to sense; but according to our initial data, the larval neurons remain
and have to adapt to cope with their new input and output. Using the connectome of the adult brain and our
genetic tools we intend to identify the descendants of larval neurons in the LAL, and to address their function in
adult navigation."

The fundamental question for the field of Down Syndrome (DS) basic research is how an extra
copy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) translates into the organ-specific pathologies that are
observed in the DS population. Specific types of CHD developed by DS patients affect posterior
cardiac structures more severely and frequently than anterior structures. A mechanistic
understanding of DS-specific organogenesis defects is lacking in most cases, although a rich
descriptive literature sets the stage for concerted mechanistic studies. Specifically, how Trisomy
21 (T21) causes heart morphogenesis defects, causing posterior vs anterior CHD, is poorly
understood. The molecular networks identified by the proposed work, implicated in DS organ-
specific cardiac progenitors, will serve as a template for understanding the molecular ontogeny of
heart defects. We have defined Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as an explicit development timer during
mammalian development, required for maintaining organ-specific progenitor cells and dictating
their differentiation in time and space, independent from developmental patterning or proliferation.
Additionally, during cardiac development retinoic acid is crucial for establishing anteroposterior
polarity and specifically promoting the posterior limits of the SHF. These signaling pathways
together control the balance between organ-specific progenitors and their differentiated
counterparts that is fundamental to complex organogenesis of the heart. The Moskowitz lab found
that when Hh signaling is abrogated in cardiac progenitors, they underwent precocious
differentiation, resulting in morphogenesis failure. Aligned with the parent award, we propose the
transformative hypothesis that a unifying cause of birth defects in DS is failure of heterochronic
timing control of organ-specific progenitor differentiation, resulting in precocious differentiation, a
reduction of organ-specific progenitors, morphogenesis failure and birth defects in multiple
organs."

Nearly 7 million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As people with AD progress
through the stages of this disease, their ability to function independently and carry out activities of daily living
(e.g., household chores and personal care) decreases due to cognitive impairment progressing to dementia,
leading to increased burden on caregivers and the US healthcare system. However, a psychometrically sound,
publicly available measure of cognition-dependent day-to-day functioning for persons with AD has not been
recognized by FDA as fit-for-purpose for use in early-stage AD drug development. We propose the preparation
and submission of a Qualification Plan (QP) to support the qualification of the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity
Assessment Tool-Short List (VRFCAT-SLx) as a performance outcome (PerfO) measure of cognition-dependent
day-to-day functioning in people diagnosed with biomarker-positive, clinical stages 2 and 3 AD.
A measure of day-to-day functioning was accepted into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s (CDER’s)
Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) Qualification Program under DDT #000004 on October 12, 2016. The PRO
Consortium’s Cognition Working Group selected the VRFCAT-SLx as the measure for qualification as it has has
qualitative evidence supporting its content validity. A confirmatory qualitative study is underway in people with
biomarker-positive, clinical stages 2 and 3 AD. Next, a quantitative evidence strategy will be prepared, supported
by a study protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) used to develop a Qualification Plan (QP). The next step
in the qualification process will be submission of the QP to FDA to support qualification of the VRFCAT-SLx for
use in AD drug development.
Our approach includes 4 aims. For Aim 1, we will convene an advisory panel of clinicians and patient participants
to provide recommendations on study design to increase the feasibility of our proposed strategy and to review
the study protocol and other study documents. For Aim 2, we will prepare a description of the proposed
quantitative evidence generation strategy (including development of a protocol and SAP) designed to assess the
VRFCAT-SLx’s measurement properties. For Aim 3, we will develop the QP by compiling the evidence from
literature and qualitative data from two cognitive interview studies and using the protocol and SAP to complete
the relevant sections of the QP, following FDA’s COA QP content outline. Aim 4 will involve compiling and
submitting the QP with all necessary appendices and attachments. The goal of this project will be a publicly
available PerfO measure for assessing cognition-dependent day-to-day functioning in clinical trials for people
with biomarker-positive, clinical stage 2 and 3 AD. Qualifying the VRFCAT-SLx will fill a critical gap in the
measurement of day-to-day functioning in AD treatment trials."

Equitable care for children with seizures is critical to optimize well-being and health outcomes; however, little is
known about existing health inequities in the emergency management and outcomes of children who are
experiencing a seizure. Identifying areas of inequitable care in the emergency management of pediatric seizures
at the patient and community levels in both the prehospital and emergency department settings can inform future
work to determine root causes, interventions, and the development of policies to improve equitable care. Through
this diversity supplement we aim to expand the aims of the parent grant by evaluating associations with risk
factors for receiving inequitable care and the management and short-term outcomes of pediatric patients
experiencing a seizure. The parent grant is a 20-site stepped wedge trial of standardized, age-based midazolam
dosing administration for children in the Emergency Medicine Services (EMS) setting who are experiencing a
seizure. Aim 1 of the supplement will evaluate the association between patient-level risk factors for receiving
inequitable health care and social determinants of health with the frequency of seizure activity on emergency
department (ED) arrival for pediatric patients transported by EMS for seizures. Aim 2 will evaluate the association
between patient-level risk factors for receiving inequitable healthcare and social determinants of health with
prehospital care, ongoing participation in research, ED interventions, and short-term outcomes. We hypothesize
that both individual-level demographics and social determinants of health will be associated with increased
frequency of seizures on arrival to the ED, need for additional interventions in the prehospital and ED settings,
and worse short-term outcomes. The diversity supplement candidate will serve as the principal investigator of
these aims conducted in a multi-site prospective clinical trial, will gain an in-depth understanding of conducting
health equity research in the prehospital setting, and will develop hypotheses for further research on reducing
health inequities in this population."

 Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) occur in 15% of diabetic patients, leading to over 82,000 lower limb
amputations annually in the United States and a 5-year mortality rate of up to 74%. The reasons for impaired
DFU healing are complex, but the downstream effects of chronic inflammation are major contributors. Our
research has shown that while initial pro-inflammatory activation of immune cells is critical for the initiation of
healing processes, prolonged activation directly impairs wound healing. Recognizing that transition from the
early inflammatory phase to the late resolution phase is required for successful healing, we developed a
composite biomarker that uses the change in the ratio of 4 early stage pro-inflammatory gene markers to 3 late
stage inflammation-resolution gene markers over 4 weeks to predict responsiveness to treatment. By using a
ratio of these early-stage to late-stage genes, referred to here as the Inflammation Index, higher values indicate
wounds that are earlier in the healing process (and further from healing), while lower values indicate a wound
that is later in the healing process (and closer to healing). Thus, a decrease in this index over time is linked to
healing, while an increase is linked to exacerbating inflammation and non-healing. In our preliminary studies (3
cohorts of 21 subjects), the change in the Inflammation Index correctly predicted healing in 10 out of 10 healing
wounds (responders), and it correctly predicted non-healing in 9 out of 11 non-healing wounds (non-responders),
with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. This biomarker utilizes debrided wound tissue so that it can be easily
incorporated into standard wound care practice without adding any new techniques or time into the visit.
Expression of the 7 genes that comprise the composite biomarker is measured using qRTPCR, a widely available,
low-cost, and reliable technique. Finally, the use of a ratio self-normalizes the gene expression values to reduce
patient-to-patient variability and increase reproducibility.
 In this project, we will develop and internally validate detection of this composite ratio-based biomarker;
establish proof of concept of its prognostic utility; lay the foundation for a specific Context of Use (COU); and
ultimately ensure that is ready for Phase II clinical trials. The proposed COU is a prognostic biomarker to identify
individuals who are not likely to heal their ulcer when treated with the standard of care, for use in the
personalization of treatment and/or the refinement of entry criteria for clinical trials of new treatments.
 In the R61 phase of this project, we will optimize biomarker measurement and standardization, and
determine the quality control (QC) metrics that can be used to determine if the biomarker is accurately measured.
We will also validate storage/shipping conditions and measure reliability and reproducibility. After meeting
rigorous milestones the biomarker will progress to the R33 phase of the project, in which we will measure its
ability to predict healing in response to the standard of care, in order to ultimately personalize treatment for
patients with hard-to-heal ulcers and to refine entry criteria for clinical trials of new treatments."

Immune Function
Mr. Hector Zepeda, the trainee in this proposal, will lead a new project related to but distinct from
Aim 1 of the parent grant. This project provides enhanced training to Mr. Zepeda, a graduate
student from an under-represented group in science. Microglia, the brain's primary immune cells,
are thought to play a causal role in the risk of developing AD, the most prevalent type of dementia.
According to recent research by the parent grant's principal investigator, Dr. Singer, neuronal
electrical activity at 40Hz frequency alters microglia phenotype and cytokine expression. Because
of its potential to modulate the phenotype of microglia, flicker stimulation is a promising early
intervention in AD. However, the effects of flicker in a preclinical stage are unknown. Thus, this
project will determine how flicker affects microglia and astrocytes in mice that express ApoE4, the
major genetic risk factor for AD. ApoE4 drives microglia into a reactive or overly active state that
ultimately leads to synapses loss and neurodegeneration. In the presence of an immune
challenge and ApoE4, microglia enter a perpetual reactive state and with limited ability to enter
less reactive states. The aim for this project is to determine how to use flicker stimulation to
mitigate this reactive microglia and astrocyte responses in the face of an immune challenge. Mr.
Zepeda will test the central hypothesis that flicker promotes resilience in brain immune cells, such
that these cells become less reactive to immune challenges. Promising results from this research
project will provide the foundation to use flicker as a preclinical therapy for persons susceptible to
Alzheimer's disease due to ApoE4 expression. During this project, Mr. Zepeda will undergo
enhanced training in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, glia responses to neural activity, and
neuroimmune function in health and Alzheimer’s disease with close mentorship of Drs. Annabelle
Singer and Levi Wood."
11088963,"Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and more and more studies indicate their
role in other disease states including inflammation, cancer, and atherosclerosis Platelets express a
number of surface receptors, which through their activation, allow platelets to interpret their local

signaling steps and how their interplay mediates platelet activation. Understanding signaling networks
and their regulation has been my research focus for the past two decades and our group has made
important contributions to the platelet-signaling field. My research goals are to identify novel signaling
molecules that regulate main signaling pathways, characterize novel signaling pathways emanating
from the same signaling molecule, and understand the differences in various tyrosine kinase
pathways in platelets. My additional goals are to understand what changes occur in platelet
composition, including miRNAs, with age and disease, such as diabetes, that make them more
susceptible to thrombotic events. This work builds on our past contributions in the field and a host of
reagents and genetic tools that we have amassed. In this proposal, we place particular emphasis on
the intracellular interactions that regulate a signaling molecule. One of the novelties of the studies
proposed is that the same protein kinase, through differential tyrosine phosphorylation, activates
diverse signaling pathways, which have distinct roles in hemostasis. The studies proposed in this
application will provide further insights into the regulation and identification of novel signaling
pathways in platelets, which may be applicable to other cell systems expressing similar receptors and
could form the basis for novel therapeutic targets to treat thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. In
addition, understanding these signaling cascades in platelets will help us evaluate and predict
possible implications of the therapeutic agents that could interfere with these pathways. For example,
our studies anticipate that Ibrutinib, a Tec kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, will block the CLEC2 pathway in platelets and cause blood flow into lymphatic
vessels. I would like to pursue these goals in the next decade with the same vigor and intensity that
have employed in the past two decades. have been funded by NIH for about 22 years on the platelet
signaling paradigms and have published over 180 papers (on an average of 8 papers a year). The
OIA will alleviate the need to submit separate thematic grant applications to various agencies with
coherent specific aims and will allow us to make significant contributions to the understanding of
platelet signaling networks. Our overarching goal is to understand how the network of receptor-
mediated signaling can be manipulated to control platelet function."
11089162,"Project Abstract (Overall)
The population with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) globally is expected to nearly
triple by 2050. With few effective treatments either to prevent the disease or slow its progression, we are
currently limited to managing established disease and minimizing further negative outcomes, at a cost of $200
billion per year. The National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) was passed with the goal of reducing the burden
of AD/ADRD, not just for persons with dementia but also for the society at large, including the social,
economic, and health system effects. There are large gaps in our knowledge about how policy-makers, public
health planners and healthcare organizations can best prepare for and respond to the broad population effects
of AD/ADRD as we await a cure. The proposed Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s
(CAPRA) at the University of Michigan will be focused on science that informs government and healthcare
organization actions to address the negative impacts of dementia on the health and financial well-being of
individuals and the population. Our focus on public policy and healthcare for persons with dementia falls into
four inter-related themes: 1) healthcare delivery and policy impact on outcomes and quality of care, 2) diffusion
of new technologies, 3) disparities in quality and access to care, and 4) innovative applications of population
data that inform allocation of resources and program development. The CAPRA leadership team is uniquely
positioned to leverage its own expertise across these themes and the depth of institutional expertise at the
University of Michigan across health services, economic, and population research to accelerate and expand
population-based observational AD/ADRD research. The overarching goal for CAPRA is that it will serve as a
national resource to enable and expand research by current and future leaders in the study of healthcare
delivery, economics, and policies to reduce the burden of AD/ADRD locally, nationally, and internationally. To
do so, the Center will act as an “on-ramp” to fast-track junior and established investigators transitioning into
AD/ADRD research by funding pilot studies, providing research training and tools, giving access to unique
secondary data relevant to AD/ADRD, and developing networks of experts with whom to consult and
collaborate. CAPRA seeks to become the leading national resource to promote and accelerate studies that aim
to reduce the social, economic, and health burden of AD/ADRD on the population. The research that emanates
from this new Center will have real-world implications for health systems, payers, and policymakers as they
struggle with designing effective policies to improve outcomes for the growing population with or at risk for
AD/ADRD."
11090071,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA), which together affect >1 million children annually,
are associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Our data show that some systemic
factors are associated with NDI in CM and SMA (e.g., endothelial dysregulation, acute kidney injury), but
others are associated with NDI CM alone (e.g., inflammatory cytokines). Our findings suggest that both shared
and unique systemic pathways contribute to NDI in CM vs. SMA. While our studies to date have advanced
understanding of systemic pathways that may lead to NDI in children with CM or SMA, the central nervous
system (CNS) pathways that contribute to NDI in children after CM or SMA remain unknown. In children with
CM, the relationship of CNS findings to NDI has rarely been assessed, while in children with SMA, there is a
paucity of CNS testing. Without data on how CNS pathways relate to NDI after CM or SMA, optimal
interventions to prevent or mitigate NDI cannot be developed. The central hypotheses of this study are that the
contribution of systemic factors to NDI in CM or SMA is mediated by CNS factors, and that the specific factors
and relative contributions of factors differ in CM and SMA. The proposed study will leverage investment by
Indiana University (IU) in an IU-Global Health Uganda Center for Child Neurodevelopment in Jinja, Uganda. IU
will donate a Hyperfine mobile MRI and BrainAmp EEG to the Center, and provide training in MRI, EEG and
TCD testing. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify CNS risk factors for neurodevelopment
impairment (NDI) after CM vs. SMA; 2) establish systemic risk factors for NDI after CM vs. SMA; and 3) define
the pathways by which systemic and CNS factors contribute to NDI after CM vs. SMA. We will conduct the
study in a cohort of 620 children 6 months to 4 years of age (120 children with CM, 300 with SMA, 100 with
uncomplicated malaria and 100 community children) who will be followed for 12 months after disease/
enrollment and have neurodevelopmental testing at 12-month follow-up. CNS pathways will be evaluated
through bedside MRI testing with the Hyperfine Swoop MRI, quantitative EEG and evoked response potential
testing, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound evaluation of cerebral blood flow patterns. Systemic pathways
identified in prior studies as associated with brain injury, long-term neurodevelopment or both will be tested for
reproducibility. Finally, established and novel statistical models will be used to identify systemic and CNS risk
factors and mediation pathways for long-term NDI. We expect that unique systemic and CNS pathways will
lead to NDI in CM compared to SMA. Identification of these pathways will allow for targeted interventions to
prevent NDI in the millions of children with CM or SMA. The study will constitute a major advance in the
understanding of the pathophysiology of brain injury and recovery in severe malaria, and provide critical new
information on brain biology that will inform studies of other childhood CNS diseases."
11089854,"Cognitive deficits, such as learning and memory impairments, are common in people subjected to chronic
disturbance of the circadian cycle due to shift work, travel, or genetic dysregulation of the circadian clock.
Epidemiological studies have revealed a global rise in cognitive disorders with circadian disruptions comorbidity
such as autism, and Alzheimer’s disease, stressing the need to identify the causal relationship between these
phenomena. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian cycle and cognitive performance in health
and disease remain largely unresolved. Neuronal synapses are the cellular basis for learning and memory
processes. Synapse number, activity, and expression levels of synaptic proteins show rhythmic time-of-day-
dependent changes, yet how these changes are regulated by the circadian clock is poorly understood. A growing
body of work supports a critical role for the glial cells, astrocytes in normal clock function. Astrocytes are
important synaptic regulators, and key for establishment and maintenance of memory and learning. In the
mammalian cortex, the development of astrocytes and synapses coincide, where synapses begin to form only
after astrocytes have been generated. Importantly, the rhythmic expression of molecular clock genes in the
cortex follows similar developmental trajectory. This suggests the hypothesis, that correct establishment of
synaptic connections and rhythmicity is linked to correct development of the circadian clock. Yet, how the
astrocytic clock regulates synaptic rhythmicity and related cognitive performance has not been thoroughly
examined. This critical gap in knowledge must be addressed in order to understand not only the fundamental
functions of the astrocytic clock, but also to characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control circadian
changes in synaptic levels. This supplemental application will define the role of astrocytic clocks in regulating
the development of synapses, synaptic rhythmicity and subsequent learning and memory behaviors in two aims.
Aim 1 investigates how early life perturbation of the astrocytic molecular clock located either in the SCN or
peripheral brain regions (e.g., cortex, hippocampus) impacts astrocyte ability to support synapse formation. In
Aim 2, we will determine how the developmental perturbations to the astrocytic clock impact time-of-day-
dependent changes in synapses and cognitive performance in adulthood. Successful completion of these aims
will uncover the role of astrocytic clock in regulating the establishment of synaptic and cognitive rhythms and
reveal strategies for future manipulation of synaptic rhythmicity through astrocyte-targeting, to restore cognitive
function in people suffering from neurological disorders."
11090156,"Summary of the funded parent grant
Our cells are constantly exposed to (endogenous and exogenous) mutagens that cause DNA damage, which if
left unrepaired, causes mutations. At the cellular level, the progressive accumulation of mutations in somatic
tissues drives carcinogenesis and other diseases. Despite our large body of knowledge of DNA damage and
repair in model organisms, we lack a deep understanding of this process in human tissues. What are the genetic
causes of mutations in human tissues? How do different cell types control DNA damage and repair?
Answering these questions is critical to understand how mutations lead to human diseases, such as
carcinogenesis.
Here we will use a highly innovative approach to build MutSensor, a set of mutation reporters to estimate
DNA mutation frequency in mammalian cells with a sensitivity >50-fold higher than that of existing
methods. The ability to build and precisely deliver these MutSensors is enabled by “Genetic Writing and Delivery”
method developed in the Boeke lab. This novel method will allow functional genetic screening at an
unprecedented scale. Building on our preliminary data, we aim at comprehensively identify all genes that regulate
mutation frequency in different human cell types, including cancer cell lines. To this purpose, we will utilize loss-
and gain-of-function approaches (from the Davoli lab) to determine the effect of genetic perturbations on mutation
frequency in human cells.
These studies will provide an unprecedented map of genes controlling DNA damage and mutations in different
human cell types. In addition, our novel method will represent an important asset for the scientific community
providing an easy way to study genetic and environmental factors that control mutagenesis in health
and disease states, including carcinogenesis."

This K99/R00 NIH Pathway to Independence Award will provide Dr. Cofresí, trained as a preclinical
neuroscientist, with a two-year intensive, mentored training and research experience in translational
neuroscience and three-years of research support that will launch his career as an independent investigator.
The training and research program focuses on bidirectional translation between preclinical and human
laboratory models of neurobehavioral mechanisms that promote alcohol use disorder (AUD). The K99 career
development plan will provide training in AUD psychopathology, human alcohol administration, human
cognitive/affective neuroscience, and human functional neuroimaging methods. Training will include
coursework, conferences, individualized one-on-one mentoring, seminars, and workshops. The K99 research
focuses on a neurobehavioral domain of the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment believed to be critical to the
Addiction/AUD Cycle: the attribution of incentive salience (IS) to alcohol cues. Preclinical and human
neurobehavioral evidence suggests that repeated alcohol intoxication can sensitize IS attribution to alcohol
cues, which may drive the Addiction/AUD Cycle in some individuals. To begin testing this possibility, Dr.
Cofresí will translate a preclinical model of individual differences in propensity to attribute IS to reward-
predictive cues into a human laboratory model of individual differences in propensity to attribute IS to alcohol
intoxication-predictive vs. natural reward-predictive cues, and examine how these individual differences are
associated with future problematic alcohol use. Dr. Cofresí’s development will be facilitated by a team with
collective expertise spanning the areas of training (Drs. Bruce Bartholow, Shelly Flagel, Brett Froeliger, David
Kareken, Denis McCarthy, Ed Merkle, Thomas Piasecki, Kenneth Sher, Todd Schachtman). The K99 phase
will take place at the University of Missouri, a world-class research institution, in the Department of
Psychological Sciences, home to renowned faculty in alcohol and addiction research with human participants
and a premier alcohol research training program (T32-AA013526). The R00 research will take place at a to-be-
determined R1 institution, and will focus on continued testing of IS attribution to alcohol-predictive cues and its
sensitization in the human laboratory. This K99/R00 award will produce research that advances Goal 1
Objective 1a of the 2017-2021 NIAAA Strategic Plan, which involves identifying behavioral and neurobiological
mechanisms underlying AUD, and explaining heterogeneity in how people progress through the Addiction/AUD
Cycle, in order to inform the development of AUD prevention and treatment. This K99/R00 award will also
produce an independent scientist able and committed to conducting basic behavioral and neurobiological
research with human participants that will continue to advance NIAAA’s mission to improve diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of alcohol-related problems, including AUD."
10892313,"ABSTRACT- PILOT PROJECTS PROGRAM 
The ACCEL-CTR Program has established an exceptionally strong network of clinicians and scientists that is 
enhancing clinical and translational research within the state of Delaware. In ACCEL3, our third funding cycle, 
we will continue to broaden our impact while also sharpening our focus in key areas including the creation of 
sustainable infrastructure for clinical and translational research in Delaware, the establishment of a scientific 
culture that values diversity and incorporates health equity as a focus, and the expansion of community 
engaged research. In this renewal, the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) will grow and evolve based on past 
successes, lessons learned, and responding to investigator and community needs. The Specific Aims of the 
PPP are to (1) inspire and support clinical and translational research; (2) facilitate high-impact interdisciplinary 
collaborations; and (3) help investigators overcome barriers in successful translation across the research 
continuum. We will fund a wide variety of types of awards, including standard pilot grants, pilot grants 
specifically targeting community-engaged research, interdisciplinary grants, mentored awards, and larger 
grants for infrastructure. In direct support of the overall mission, the PPP will put in place new requirements 
related to diversity, health equity, and community engagement. Evaluation of applications will be conducted by 
peer-review by qualified and NIH-experienced members of the scientific community using review and scoring 
mechanisms modeled after the NIH. We will prioritize clinical and community engaged research as well as 
projects addressing conditions that affect the medically underserved or disproportionately affect the health of 
Delawareans. The PPP will continue to synergize with the other ACCEL cores to leverage professional 
development opportunities, community engagement and outreach functions, and other facilities and services to 
maximize the training and career development of our pilot awardees. The PPP will be led by Susanne Morton 
and supported by the ACCEL Research Committee, with representation from all partner institutions, and 
administrative staff. In ACCEL3, the PPP will continue to be an integral CTR core, catalyzing collaborative and 
community-based clinical and translational research for the benefit of all Delawareans."
10892317,"ABSTRACT - BERD 
The Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) Core of the Delaware ACCEL CTR has matured 
in the last 9 years into a large, stable yet dynamic core with a repertoire of skills and resources that enables 
quality clinical and translational (C&T) research. BERD’ s accomplishments result from the close collaboration 
between ACCEL partner institutions: the University of Delaware, the Nemours Children’ Health system, 
ChristianaCare Health Services Inc., the Medical University of South Carolina and Delaware State University. 
BERD assembles a diverse core of skilled biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and bioinformaticians from each 
Institution who have the common goal of advancing translational science and assist C&T investigators. The 
BERD team from MUSC was instrumental in helping us launch and develop a strong, sustainable BERD over 
the last nine years, but the DE-based BERD team has matured to a point of independence. Phase 3 BERD 
(without MUSC) will build on this momentum to meet the evolving skills needed for C&T research. With the 
increasing availability of vast amounts of data, we have the potential to provide deeper insight into the 
determinants of disease at the individual and population level. To do so, we must develop new methodologies 
and tools to analyze these data. We will enrich the BERD resources with expertise in Machine Learning (ML), 
Natural language Processing (NLP), cloud computing, geospatial analysis and novel biostatistics methods to 
address health disparities. We propose the following specific aims:1) Expand and enrich consultative services 
for clinical, translational, population health sciences. BERD will leverage the expertise in ML, NLP, cloud 
computing, and geospatial analysis that already exists in some ACCEL-CTR Institutions and will make this 
expertise available to all Investigators; 2) Develop innovative methods in biostatistics and data sciences 
including reducing selections biases, enhancing the power of studies, and developing design and analysis 
plans for studies of vulnerable populations or very small numbers of subjects; 3) Promote virtual self-paced 
synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities. We will continue to offer TechTalks and Innovative 
Discoveries Series lectures and will vet on-line material for posting on our Education hub; 4) Expand the 
biomedical informatics research infrastructure by leveraging expertise and skills acquired in the last nine years 
to establish an integrated network of resources focused on addressing critical healthcare needs in Delaware. 
The BERD specific aims build upon the overall aims of the ACCEL CTR phase 3. By expanding BERD 
expertise to better meet the needs of Investigators, we will improve the scientific infrastructure and culture. We 
will develop Innovative methodologies to foster projects aiming at improving health equity. Access to the cloud 
will allow teams of clinicians and scientists to develop projects that have high clinical impact. Access to 
asynchronous learning will help clinician researchers to sharpen their skills in biostatistics/epidemiology."
10892316,"ABSTRACT – PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORE 
Primary goals of the Delaware CTR ACCEL program include facilitating clinical and translational research 
(CTR) across disciplines and increasing faculty competitiveness for research funding. The ACCEL PDC has 
sought to reach, connect, and support clinician scientists and junior faculty as they pursue their first grants in- 
cluding pass-through funding (e.g., an ACCEL or other IDeA program pilot award) or external funds (e.g., K 
award, COBRE target project, foundation grant, or R grant). The ACCEL-CTR Professional Development Core 
(PDC) was established to support the development of CTR investigators. The PDC has established successful 
programs, including Mentored Research Development Awards (MRDA), sponsorship of a statewide Junior In- 
vestigators’ Network (JIN), and collaborations with the DE IDeA States Clinical Trials Network and the DE IN- 
BRE. In ACCEL3, we enhance our existing programs and add three key programs: (i) integrated mentor train- 
ing to support emerging investigators, expand our base of clinical research mentors, deploy best practices, and 
assure diversity, equity, and inclusion; (ii) tools to help novice investigators identify and navigate regulatory re- 
quirements, administrative processes, and resources for clinical studies; (iii) a more organized and self-suffi- 
cient JIN to enhance peer support and collaborative program development. The PDC in ACCEL3 has three 
Specific Aims. Aim 1: Provide integrated mentor training and support programs. The PDC will provide re- 
sources and training, and “Mentor Champions” will be installed at ACCEL institutions to support local mentors, 
support the engagement of faculty with ACCEL, and assure diversity and inclusion among ACCEL faculty. Aim 
2: Implement a Pathways to Success program. Resources to overcome common barriers to clinical research 
will be deployed as self-guided tools detailing processes relevant to ACCEL faculty and providing coaching in 
areas of need. Aim 3: Develop peer subgroups within our JIN. The PDC will work with the JIN to identify spe- 
cial interest subgroups, especially groups of underrepresented faculty, and to provide peer programs and edu- 
cational resources. Aim 4: Strengthen existing programs to further increase competitiveness for external fund- 
ing. Existing PDC programs designed to help faculty develop strong grant submissions will be enhanced to 
provide targeted support. The PDC is led by Robert Akins and an accomplished team with representatives 
from multiple disciplines across ACCEL. Execution of PDC aims will advance the professional development of 
ACCEL investigators, increase competitiveness for external funding, and support a more effective clinical and 
translational research mentoring that fully embraces precepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion across ACCEL.

11089864,"ABSTRACT
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions are currently classified according to
behavioral criteria. This clinical diagnostic framework does not take into account underlying pathophysiology and
is often insufficient to predict outcomes. The long-term goal is to develop biomarkers that will help cluster
individuals with ASD and related conditions into biologically distinct groups (“biotypes”) and provide the means
to understand the underlying neural mechanisms. Developing biomarkers for use in children is particularly
important so that they can be used from the time symptoms are first recognized. Objective measurement of
sensory processing via electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and scientifically translatable method
to measure function of neural circuits. The proposed project tests the central hypothesis that EEG measures of
sensory processing predict behavioral phenotype (i.e., they are relevant to functional outcome) but also inform
the reclassification of neurodevelopmental conditions by neural circuit pathophysiology to complement
behavioral phenotype. This project uses EEG to measure sensory/neural circuit function in 3-4 year old children
with ASD (n=150), typical development (TD; n=75), and children who do not have ASD but whose caregivers
have concerns about how they process sensory information (Sensory Processing Concerns (SPC) group;
n=150). Aim 1: Determine how circuit-level brain activity, measured in response to sensory stimuli, is altered in
children with ASD vs. SPC vs. TD. Aim 2: Test if sensory EEG endophenotypes predict behavioral phenotype
(e.g., anxiety, attention, irritability, social skills) within and across groups (ASD, TD, SPC). Aim 3: Delineate
neurobiologically-informed subtypes of neural circuit activity in individuals. Rather than relying on behavioral
phenotype as the gold standard, this exploratory aim takes a data-driven approach to cluster individuals in ASD
(and potentially SPC) into biologically distinct subgroups (biotypes) defined by EEG measures of neural circuit
activity to sensory inputs. The proposed project is conceptually innovative because it uses the paradoxical co-
occurrence of sensory hyper- and hypo-reactivity within individuals as the nidus for developing biomarkers that
reflect the granular neurobiological principles underlying sensory processing and ASD. The proposed project is
technically innovative because many of the proposed EEG measures are novel or have never been used to
study ASD. The project is significant because it moves the field from developing biomarkers that reflect
behavioral understanding of ASD towards biomarkers that provide neurobiological understanding of ASD.
Ultimately, this will allow development of diagnostic and stratification biomarkers that guide biologically targeted,
personalized treatments in children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions."
11089871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The parent project, “Toward Restoration of Normative Postural Control and Stability using Neural Control of
Powered Prosthetic Ankles”, R01HD110519, is developed to demonstrate that direct neural control of powered
prosthetic ankle can improve balance, postural stability, neuromuscular control, and coordination without
extensive cognitive processes, compared to daily prescribed passive devices for transtibial amputees.
Due to the amputation, lower limb amputees lack of perception on their prosthetic leg. Because deficits in
perception lead to delayed responses to postural sway, causing over-reliance on visual cues, impaired postural
control, and increased risk of falls, restoring reliable perception of the prosthetic limb is crucial for improving
resilience to disturbances, recovering from disturbances, and improving confidence while navigating dynamical
environments. Although previous studies suggest that improving lower limb perception through sensory
substitution (SS) can enhance postural stability in lower limb amputees, the link between perception and postural
stability is not well-established. One major challenge is that passive ankle joints cannot employ the same balance
strategies as natural ankles capable of producing torque. This forces amputees to adopt asymmetrical postural
control strategies that are hard to quantify. The parent project offers a unique opportunity by reinstating
symmetric ankle strategies and permits a systematical study to understand how lower limb perception affects
postural stability and neuromuscular coordination in postural control.
The objectives of this proposal include 1) evaluate the feasibility of enhancing postural control in LLA through
haptic sensory substitution when using a directly controlled powered prosthetic ankle, complementing the
objectives of the parent project focused on enabling symmetric ankle strategies for postural control; and 2)
providing training opportunities for Mr. Brendan Driscoll, a lower limb amputee himself, to advance his research
career.
This project has clear clinical significance since it addresses the clinical need for improved balance and postural
stability in lower limb amputees. Use of sensor substitution technology provides users with additional resources
to assist with balance stability and improve balance confidence, which, in turn, improves their community
participation and quality of life. At the same time, the proposed project is expected to contribute important
knowledge to the field of prosthesis technology, make scientific contributions to the fields of motor control and
learning, biomechanics, and cognitive-motor interaction, and benefit physical therapy and amputee rehabilitation."
11089659,"Analgesia, the dampening of nociceptive responses to noxious stimuli capable of damaging tissues, is an
adaptive behavioral response for organisms- allowing them to feel less pain in physiologically appropriate
situations. Our parent grant uses the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila to explore the
molecular/genetic bases of opiate-induced analgesic signaling. Our long-term goal in this basic research
project is to identify and characterize analgesic signaling pathways in Drosophila larvae. We have found
previously that the opiate compounds morphine and fentanyl are analgesic for Drosophila larvae and that a
conserved G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), AstC-R1, is required in this organism for opiate-induced
thermal analgesia upon exposure to high-temperature noxious stimuli. This parent NIH grant, like most others,
involves training graduate students. My lab, like the NIH and NINDS, is dedicated to training a diverse scientific
workforce. In February of 2023 we took on a new graduate student, Samantha (Sam) Mota, who, due to her
Latin-American descent, qualifies as a diversity supplement candidate. The aims of the parent grant are to
characterize AstC-R1's requirement for thermal analgesia, to interrogate functional expression of AstC-R1 in
mediating thermal analgesia, and to assess whether the putative receptor's analgesic effects extend to other
sensory modalities beyond heat. Sam's graduate project is two-tiered. She is first driving the completion of our
first analgesia paper- focusing on the cellular locus of action of AstC-R1 and possible analgesic actions of the
AstC peptide. Her more exploratory work (subject of a planned future F31 submission) is primarily related to
our original third aim where we explore deleterious biological side effects of morphine such as constipation.
Sam's aims in this diversity supplement are two-fold and represent an in-scope expansion of the original
project: First, she will build on prior experiments to unravel where AstC-R1 functions in analgesia- trying to
pinpoint which particular nociceptive basin interneurons are required. Second, Sam will explore endogenous
analgesic roles of the AstC neuropeptide ligand for AstC-R1, and, in a substantial but related expansion of the
original aims- tackle possible neuronal connectivity between AstC-R1-expressing and AstC-expressing
neurons. The NINDS diversity supplement we propose here will fund a highly promising graduate student who
is likely to become, upon the successful completion of her graduate project(s), a powerful role model for
female-scientists of Latin-American descent. As her project progresses, Sam will apply for F31 funding focused
on a new research direction that allows her to build her research skills- especially as they relate to assay
design and video microscopy- opiate-induced constipation. Successful completion of her project aims will
enable her to achieve both her short-term and long-term career goals, which eventually include teaching and
research at an institution that serves a minority undergraduate population."
11089047,"Project summary of the funded parent award
Huntington disease (HD) is a slowly progressing genetic disorder caused by an expansion of glutamine repeats
in the huntingtin protein (wtHTT), leading to mutant HTT (mHTT) that is widely expressed throughout the brain
and peripheral tissues. Despite this ubiquitous expression, mHTT shows regional effects by promoting
degeneration of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum and loss of cortical mass. With aging, the effects
spread to other brain areas (1-5). The molecular basis for the regional specificity that encompasses many mHTT
processes is unclear; thus, etiology-based therapies for this devastating disease remain elusive. To fill this
knowledge gap, we will test the hypothesis that Ras-homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) and small
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 signaling circuitry orchestrate striatal vulnerability and HD progression.
This hypothesis is based on our prior finding that Rhes promotes SUMO-1 modification of mHTT (SUMO1–
mHTT) and enhances soluble forms SUMO1–mHTT, leading to toxicity in cell and transgenic animal models of
HD (6-14). However, the downstream mechanisms of the Rhes–SUMO1–mHTT pathway in HD remain obscure.
 Serendipitously, we found that Rhes promotes the formation of actin-containing membrane protrusions
known as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) and that Rhes is transported through TNTs to distant cells (15). Rhes also
transports mHTT, but not wtHTT, via the TNTs that form between cultured cells. This intercellular transport
requires post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as the farnesylation of Rhes and SUMOylation of mHTT,
revealing a new role for the Rhes–SUMO1 pathway in mHTT transmission (15). We now demonstrate that Rhes
can move between MSNs and spread mHTT in vivo. We tested using cell-type specific reporter mice, Flex (“Cre-
On”) and bicistronic viral vectors, and organotypic brain slices and found that Rhes moves from D1R-MSNs to
D2R-MSNs and potentiates mHTT spread from the striatum to the cortex in the brain (16). These results indicate
that Rhes is a major driver of mHTT transport, both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that SUMO1 deletion
diminishes mHTT protein levels and prevents the HD-like phenotype by upregulating autophagic activity in
animal (Q175DN) and cellular HD models (17). Taken together, these new results indicate that the Rhes-
SUMO1 pathway alters mHTT levels and promotes mHTT spread in the brain. However, the mechanisms
of mHTT spread remain unknown. Therefore, uncovering the mechanisms that enable Rhes to spread mHTT
and the in vivo neuropathological role of spread remain essential areas to address. Our preliminary data suggest
that SUMO1 regulates striatal mTORC1 signaling, a major regulator of autophagy, in Q175DN mice. Defining
whether or how SUMO1 contributes to mHTT spread in vivo and its role autophagy dysregulation is therefore
critical both for modeling the disease progression and for drug discovery. Our specific aims in this project are:
 Aim 1. To uncover the role and mechanisms of Rhes-mediated mHTT spreading in the brain. We
found that Rhes moves and spreads mHTT between neurons in vivo. We hypothesize that Rhes spreads mHTT
and promotes neuropathology involving PTM mechanisms and TNT-like routes. We will employ bicistronic and
Cre-On PTM defective mHTT and Rhes expression vectors to investigate mHTT spreading, HD-like behavior,
and neuropathology in vivo. We will use MSNs and glial reporter mice to determine if Rhes can transport mHTT
from MSNs to the cortex and from MSNs to the glia in the brain. We will use live-cell imaging and organotypic
brain slices to establish whether Rhes transportation of mHTT involves TNT-like protrusions ex vivo. These
results will uncover novel mechanisms and the role of Rhes-mediated mHTT spread in the brain.
 Aim 2. To identify the mechanisms of SUMO1-mediated HD pathogenesis. We found that SUMO1
depletion upregulates autophagy, decreases mHTT levels, and prevents HD-like deficits in Q175DN mice. We
showed that SUMO1 and mHTT enhance striatal mTORC1 signaling, a known inhibitor of autophagy. Thus, we
hypothesize that SUMO1–mHTT inhibits autophagy, thereby allowing accumulation and spread of mHTT from
the striatum to the cortex. We will first characterize the SUMO1 role in autophagy flux in cultured cells and HD
animals using autophagy reporters. We will then use Cre-On mHTT reporters and WT;Rgs9Cre and SUMO1-
KO;Rgs9Cre mice and pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition to corroborate a role for SUMO1 and autophagy
signaling in mHTT spread from MSNs to the cortex. Finally, using a mass spectrometry approach, we will identify
SUMO1-dependent mHTT binding partners to further unravel SUMO/autophagy regulators in the striatum.
 Collectively, this study will delineate the mechanisms of the Rhes–SUMO1 pathway in mHTT spread. It
will identify the molecular link between autophagy dysregulation and mHTT spread for potential targeting in HD
therapy."
11089959,"Supplement Summary and Aims
The funded grant aims to determine the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in post-
transcriptional regulation in the context of cerebrovascular dysfunction and blood-brain-
barrier (BBB) disruption, particularly within Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral
amyloid angiopathy (CAA). AD is characterized by an accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ)
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with cerebrovascular dysfunction (CVD) and
neuroinflammation playing key roles in the progression of the disease. In fact, most cases
of AD exhibit Aβ deposition in and around cerebral blood vessels, thus presenting an
additive effect to the pathology of the disease.
The BBB, composed mainly of endothelial cells (ECs), regulates the entry of circulating
substances from the blood to the brain and assists in clearing harmful molecules from the
brain, including oligomeric Aβ. Disruption of the BBB and the accumulation of Aβ in and
around cerebral blood vessels is associated with changes in ECs, yielding a
proinflammatory phenotype and leading to apoptosis. In our preliminary data of the parent
grant, we have found that miRNA-212 is decreased in ECs treated with Aβ. Previously,
we have shown that Aβ treatment leads to EC apoptosis and increase in EC barrier
permeability. We have shown in our preliminary data that several genes involved in EC
apoptosis contain binding sequences for miRNA-212.
Our overarching goal is to test the hypothesis that Aβ promotes cerebrovascular
dysfunction and BBB failure via endothelial cell miRNA-212.
To achieve our goal, during this Supplement I specifically aim to accomplish the following
Aims. Aim 1: measure miR-212 levels in exosomes released from ECs under the same
Aβ conditions as in Aim 1 of the Grant. The release of miRNAs via exosomes may be
essential for regulation in nearby cells of the neurovascular unit and may serve as a
biomarker for AD and CAA diagnosis and progression. Aim 2: assess the impact of miR-
212 downregulation and rescue on BBB permeability in neurovascular unit complex
systems. To ascertain the role of miRNA in CVD and BBB loss of function."

EnClear Therapies is performing research for a National Institutes of Health NINDS Phase I/II
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Parent Grant: 1R44NS135792-01 to develop a
novel CNS drug delivery system. EnClear Therapies’ device precisely controls the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to address the issue of overcoming the blood brain barrier (BBB) for
drug delivery. The system utilizes two access points, the lumbar thecal sac and cerebral
ventricle, and a precision pump for controlling the rate and direction of CSF flow between them.
The system is capable of controlling CSF flow precisely by utilizing our Sensor Array to
understand patients’ physiologic responses and allow the system to adjust drug infusion rate,
CSF flow rate, flow direction and to “oscillate” drug concentration over specific tissue targets
through a rapid flow reversal mechanism. The device will be used multiple types of CNS
therapies including for gene therapies, such as anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) for Frontal
Temporal Dementia.
EnClear Therapies is a small business who will use this supplement to hire a Hispanic male,
who is from a socially disadvantaged group as defined by the U.S. SBA. This Long-Term
employee will contribute to the completion of the parent Phase I/II SBIR award ongoing
research Aims. The immediate impact of this administrative supplement will be to increase
diversity at EnClear Therapies and in the United States Small Business workforce. The long-
term impact of this administrative supplement will be to help this particular individual hired to
contribute to the ongoing research, develop more skills, and launch a successful career as an
entrepreneurial-minded independent engineer."
11087885,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Approximately 13% of African Americans (AA), who suffer disproportionately from kidney and
cardiovascular disease, carry two copies of the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene risk variants (RV). These RVs
contribute to renal and cardiovascular mortality, yet no therapies address gene mechanism. In cell culture and
animal models, inflammatory cytokines increase APOL1 expression and worsen APOL1 high-risk genotype
(HRG) related injury. The degree to which immune activation and resultant increased APOL1 expression
synergizes with APOL1 genotype to precipitate human disease, such as lupus nephritis, is not understood. We
will test the overarching hypothesis that APOL1 HRG SLE patients experience worsened disease features both
due to SLE inflammatory mediators which induce gene expression and to protein coding changes carried on the
variant allele. Importantly, an unprecedented number of biologic therapies are available to pharmacologically
modulate immune pathways. Therefore understanding the relative contribution of specific immune pathways to
APOL1 HRG associated disease may offer new treatment opportunities in this sensitive population.
Preliminary Data: In our unique, AA SLE cohort and Ghanaian replication cohort, our group reproducibly
identified APOL1 HRG associated traits including hypertension, renal dysfunction, and early atherosclerosis.
Both in SLE monocytes and primary monocyte cell cultures, we identified SLE-relevant immune stimuli that
induce APOL1 expression. We showed that HRG monocytes in response to high APOL1 expression exhibit
mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings have clinical implications as they support a strategy aimed at reducing
immune activation to mitigate APOL1 expression and resultant HRG associated disease features.
Methods: To understand APOL1 immune regulation, we will analyze SLE patient monocyte transcriptional
profiles by RNA-seq to assess immune pathway activation. APOL1 genotype, APOL1 transcriptional expression,
and immune pathway scores will be tested for association with clinical outcomes, independently and in
interaction models. We will determine whether increased APOL1 expression synergizes with risk genotype, and
which immune system pathways reflected in the RNA-seq data are associated with APOL1 expression.
We will validate the human transcriptional analysis using in-vitro monocyte cell culture models.
Objectives and Career Development: This proposal leverages unique clinical and laboratory resources, and
highly collaborative environment between experts in statistical genetics, functional genomics, immunology,
cardiology, and rheumatology. It will lay the groundwork to propose future larger-scale studies designed to target
specific immune pathways in APOL1 HRG patients. Furthermore, it will allow the PI to become an expert in the
functional genomics of autoimmune disease and related kidney and vascular comorbidities, genetic modeling in
complex clinical traits, and innovative laboratory and computational techniques. Thus, this will provide a
framework for the PI’s independent translational career."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Indiana University Diabetes and Obesity Training Program began in 1999 and has been funded by the
NIDDK for twenty years, currently at the level of two pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral trainees per year. In
addition, the program supports four medical students each summer who receive short-term training as part of
the NIDDK Summer Medical Student Research Program. The goal of the Diabetes and Obesity Training Program
is to provide excellent training in research relevant to diabetes, metabolism, and obesity to researchers at an
early stage of their careers. This training program is led by two dedicated Co-Directors, Drs. R. Wek and C.
Evans-Molina, who are assisted by outstanding Executive and Selection Committees, with oversight and
guidance provided by an Advisory Committee of key internal advisors and world-renowned external advisors.
Twenty-five faculty preceptors from ten departments and five degree granting programs participate as mentors
in the program. This group of faculty has a strong training and research record and receives a total of $22.2M in
annual direct research funding, with $5.3M of this support coming from NIDDK R- and K-grants and $0.87M from
the JDRF and the ADA. In addition, this outstanding group of faculty has obtained $1.8M of U and P grant support
from the NIDDK. Pre-doctoral students in the training program complete a Minor in Diabetes and Obesity, which
includes a 2 credit Diabetes and Obesity course. Post-doctoral fellows also take this course. Students and post-
doctoral fellows attend and present their research at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases seminar
series and at national meetings such as the ADA Scientific Sessions. To ensure contemporary and well-rounded
training, scholars complete courses on the responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility in
research. Trainees attend a Grant Writing Workshop, where they develop skills to enable them to successfully
apply for future grant funding. Training of scholars is guided by Individualized Development Plans and iterative
Program Evaluation. The program is committed to promoting diversity in biomedical sciences and, in the past
funding cycle, four of fourteen pre- and post-doctoral trainees and four of twenty one medical students were from
historically marginalized backgrounds. By training pre-doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows, and medical
students in an environment and culture that provides strong multi-disciplinary support for diabetes research and
an appreciation of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, this program will educate trainees who have a
sustained interest in diabetes and who will contribute significantly to the field. The Indiana University School of
Medicine is an outstanding forum for such an initiative, as the School has strong traditions in diabetes research
and patient care, as well as comprehensive research training. This program will continue to meet a critical need
by recruiting, mentoring, and training a talented and diverse cadre of scientists who are poised to carry out
cutting-edge basic science and translational research focused on improving the health of individuals with or at
risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity, and their associated complications.

Though synapses are formed between neurons, these structures are contacted with, ensheathed, and
regulated by astrocytes. Period of neuronal synaptic connectivity and that of astrocyte maturation overlaps in
developing brain. Neuronal signals instruct astrocyte differentiation and morphological maturation whereas
astrocytes provide metabolic and trophic factors to support neuronal survival and growth. However, molecular
mechanisms and signals that regulate neuron-astrocyte interactions and their role in neuronal circuit assembly
and functions are largely unknown. We and others have previously shown that astrocytes modulate specific
neural circuit formation, function and plasticity by several secreted proteins including hevin (SPARCL1),
thrombospondins (TSPs), glypicans and norrin. While hevin is needed for assembly and plasticity of VGlut2+
(vesicular glutamate transporter 2) thalamocortical connections, TSPs facilitate VGlut1+ synapse formation.
Intriguingly, expression of these synaptogenic proteins is developmentally regulated and are also altered in brain
pathologies. Although a significant amount of research has been done to identify the neuronal receptors and
mechanism of synapse formation by astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic factors SPARCL1 and TSPs, we do not
know the signals and mechanisms that regulate their expression in astrocytes.
 We have recently found that neuronal contact stimulates expression of SPARCL1 and TSP4 via Sphingosine-
1-Phosphate (S1P)-S1P Receptor 1 (S1PR1). We also found that S1PR1 is primarily expressed by astrocytes
and is localized to the fine astrocytic processes near and around the synapses and drives astrocyte
morphological complexity and morphogenesis. Although, S1P-S1PR signaling is a drug target for many
neurological disorders, its fundamental role in neuron-glia interactions and neuronal circuit assembly is not
known. Our proposed studies will provide novel insight into the neuron-astrocyte bidirectional communication
through S1P-S1PR1 axis in establishing synaptic connectivity and functions. Our detailed mechanistic studies
will identify new signaling pathway downstream of S1P-S1PR1 axis in regulating calcium dynamics, glutamate
sensing and expression of SPARCL1 and TSP4 in astrocytes. These studies will also advance our knowledge
of how neurons regulate astrocyte development, morphogenesis and function. Moreover, these studies will
decipher the mechanistic link between levels of S1P and the expression of SPARCL1 and TSP4 and clarify on
the fundamental role of S1P/S1PR1 axis in the developing and diseased brain. This proposal thus is poised to
provide novel mechanisms of targeting S1P/S1PR1 axis in alleviating neuropathologies."
11089220,"Mitochondrial malfunction is well known to manifest as dysfunction of neurons, due to the high
energetic demands of these highly polarized cells, their remarkable axonal length, and complexity.
However, how neuronal mitochondria precisely control crista structure in response to ever-

function and behavior in multicellular organisms remain elusive. In our Preliminary Studies, we
have discovered an evolutionarily conserved role for MIC60 in maintaining crista structure in
Drosophila. We have found molecular modifications of fly MIC60 (dMIC60) including
phosphorylation and oxidation and their significance in maintaining crista junction plasticity and
resisting oxidative stress. These results demonstrate the vital importance of dMIC60 and its
posttranslational modifications for mitochondrial and neuronal homeostasis. We hypothesize that
molecular regulations of dMIC60 including phosphorylation and oxidation allow dMIC60 to receive
cellular signals to conduct its functions and that their misregulations could lead to neuronal
dysfunction and degeneration. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following Specific Aims.
Aim 1: Roles for dMIC60 in neuronal homeostasis. Aim 2: Crista structure as a cellular

11089224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since 2013, inequities in firearm-related mortality between Black and White youth (ages 1-19) in the United
States (US) have widened. A critical, overlooked aspect of increasing youth firearm-related mortality is a
fourfold increase in firearm-related deaths among Black rural youth. This represents a dramatic reversal from
the historical pattern of lower firearm-related mortality in rural Black youth compared to their urban
counterparts. Four key macro-level factors-structural racism, socioeconomic disadvantage, firearm
availability, and population composition (e.g., migration, age structure}--likely influence recent spatio-temporal
trends in Black youth firearm-related mortality. However, their precise contributions remain unknown. This
project aims to identify state- and county-level factors driving this epidemic of firearm-related mortality
among Black youth, particularly in rural areas. This project has three specific aims. Aim 1: Investigate how
changes in structural racism, socioeconomic disadvantage, firearm availability, and population composition
contribute to increasing Black-White inequities in youth firearm-related mortality in the US in the aggregate.
Aim 2: Compare spatio-temporal patterns in the distribution of these determinants between counties with
higher Black youth firearm-related mortality versus those with lower rates, separately for rural and urban
counties. Aim 3: Explore the extent to which within-county changes in these macro-level factors over time
influence within-county increases in firearm-related mortality among Black rural youth. We will use CDC
restricted-use data for youth firearm-related mortality (1989-2023). A decedent's county of residence will be
linked to county-level demographics from the American Community Survey, population estimates from the US
Census Bureau, and state-level gun ownership data from RAND. Using decomposition techniques, we will
examine how each of the four macro-level factors changed over the course of our study period and the extent
to which change in each factor contributes to changes in Black-White inequities in youth firearm-related
mortality. Next, we will assess the spatio-temporal distribution of these determinants, comparing counties with
higher Black youth firearm-related mortality to those with lower rates, separately for rural and urban areas.
Finally, fixed-effects models will assess the relationship between within-county changes in macro-level factors
and within-county changes in rural Black youth firearm-related mortality. The long-term goal is to eliminate
inequities in youth firearm-related mortality. This timely and urgent project aligns with the goals of NICHD and
its Population Dynamics Branch to improve child and adolescent health and reduce health disparities. It will
also provide insights into how different social and demographic factors operating at multiple levels contribute to
inequities in youth firearm-related mortality. By employing innovative demographic and spatial techniques,
this study will inform how to mitigate the escalating crisis of firearm-related mortality among US Black youth."
11089053,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pharmacogenomics has the potential to dramatically improve health care outcomes, but is currently failing on
diversity among its research participants. As a consequence, we do not fully understand all of the factors
influencing pharmacological response in underrepresented populations, including those that contribute to
racial/ethnic differences in drug efficacy and safety as reported by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug
labels. For example, the clinical validity of genetic variants that are common in research participants from
historically-excluded populations (e.g., lower proportions of European genetic ancestry) but rare in well-
represented study populations remains unknown. In addition, gene expression studies have already provided
insight into the underlying biology of disease susceptibility for numerous conditions beyond what genome wide
association study (GWAS) results alone have discovered, but have not been fully applied to studies of
pharmacogenomic discovery. Furthermore, social determinants of health may impact pharmacological drug
response from a biological standpoint even after taking into account the effects of these factors on drug
adherence, access, and utilization (e.g. social determinants of epigenetics). Addressing this gap in knowledge
has the potential to prevent future healthcare disparities that may be exacerbated as the infrastructure to support
clinical pharmacogenomics continues to gain traction across health institutions nationwide. Furthermore,
elucidation of the genetic and nongenetic contributors to differences in drug response across race/ethnicity will
obviate the use of this population descriptor as a proxy for these factors. Pharmacogenomic studies using large,
diverse datasets are necessary to ensure that advances in this field benefit individuals equitably.
Our primary goal in this project is to identify genetic and social determinants of pharmacological drug response
among racial/ethnic minorities. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage data from the Kaiser Permanente
Research Biobank (KPRB) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All Of Us research program, which are two
of the largest electronic health record-linked biobanks in the United States. These cohorts are ideal for the
proposed studies because they are large (>400,000 participants each), diverse (>25% racial/ethnic minorities),
linked to genome-wide genetic data, and capture social determinants of health.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the relative contribution of genetic ancestry versus social factors on race/ethnicity-
based differences in drug efficacy and safety. In Aim 2, we will identify genome-wide polymorphisms predictive
of drug effects in historically-excluded populations from large pharmacogenetics studies. In Aim 3, we will use
ancestry-specific gene expression results to identify genetic determinants of drug response. The aims will be
carried out by an established multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical pharmacology, cardiovascular
epidemiology, and molecular genetics. These findings from the current study will help to inform clinical decisions
impacting communities historically-excluded from biomedical research."

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most important benign neoplastic threat to women’s health worldwide. As no long-
term non-invasive treatment option exists for UFs, deeper insight into tumor etiology is key to develop more
effective therapies. Accordingly, this proposal is impactful as it suggests a novel etiological basis for the
predominant UF subtype and further offers proof of concept for therapeutic intervention in this specific
genetic setting. UFs arise from the genetic transformation of a single myometrial stem cell (MM SC) into a tumor
initiating cell (UF SC) that seeds monoclonal tumor growth. Notably, recurrent somatic mutations in the RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) Mediator subunit MED12 account for ~70% of UFs, but how these mutations drive cell
transformation and tumor formation is unclear. Previously, we showed that MED12 mutations disrupt CycC-
CDK8 kinase activity in Mediator, revealing the first and heretofore only known biochemical defect arising from
these pathogenic mutations and further implying a new etiological role for CDK8 in UF pathogenesis. This
breakthrough discovery was the basis for our original application which spawned major advances that justify
studies in this renewal application to clarify the molecular basis and therapeutic implications of Mediator kinase
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of MED12-mutant UFs. Herein, we show that MED12 mutations impair CDK8
activity through T-loop destabilization, leading to a profoundly altered phosphoproteome and dysregulation
of cell growth and myogenic gene expression programs that dictate MM SC fate. Further, we show that
MED12 mutation-induced CDK8 inactivation triggers R-loop-dependent replication stress, suggesting a
possible basis for genomic instability and a new therapeutic vulnerability in this dominant UF subclass.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that MED12 mutation-induced Mediator kinase disruption drives tumor initiation
and progression through aberrant MM SC reprogramming and replication stress-dependent chromosomal
instability. We further propose that clinically relevant ATR axis inhibitors will provide therapeutic benefit in a
preclinical model of MED12-mutant UFs. To test this, we will: (1) Elucidate the biochemical basis by which
MED12 mutations disrupt Mediator kinase activity. Using structural biology and biochemistry, we will determine
the impact of mutant MED12 on CDK8 T-loop stability and conformational dynamics as well as CycC-CDK8
substrate binding and catalytic efficiency; (2) Elucidate the molecular basis by which Mediator kinase disruption
drives UF initiation. We will link Mediator kinase-dependent changes in MM SC self-renewal and differentiation
with genome-wide enhancer reprogramming and altered transcriptional output and further ask if Mediator kinase
disruption can reprogram MM SCs to form UF tumors vivo; (3) Elucidate the molecular basis by which Mediator
kinase disruption drives UF progression. We will investigate RNAPII promoter pausing defects as a basis for
aberrant R-loop accrual, determine if R-loop-induced replication stress triggers mitotic chromosomal breaks, and
evaluate the efficacy of ATR axis inhibitors in a preclinical mouse model of MED12-mutant UFs."

(ACTG) and Maternal, Adolescent, Pediatric therapeutics (IMPAACT). We propose the following three aims:
1. Operate a single organization (GHESKIO) CTU with two research sites that is integrated, cohesive,
and able to respond rapidly to a breadth of emerging research priorities. The CTU will maximize
efficiency by having a single research component for administration, communication, evaluation, community
liaison, data management, regulatory assurance, quality management, and training program. Each CRS has its
own pharmacy. The main laboratory is at GHESKIO-North and the downtown site has a satellite laboratory.
2. Conduct adult HIV/AIDS therapeutic trials at GHESKIO-Downtown and GHESKIO-North - ACTG: Haiti
has the highest HIV prevalence in the hemisphere with 2.0% of adults HIV infected. Both GHESKIO sites
(Downtown, North) have large HIV-infected adult ART naïve and ART-experienced cohorts available for
recruitment into trials. Haiti also has the highest rates of TB with a prevalence of 1,066/100,000 in Port au
Prince. GHESKIO treats ~ 2,000 TB patients annually including patients with MDR-TB who are available for
enrollment into TB treatment trials. GHESKIO has established a new cardiovascular disease research unit to
study the chronic complications of HIV.
3. Conduct maternal, adolescent, and pediatric HIV/AIDS trials at GHESKIO-Downtown- IMPAACT:
GHESKIO-Downtown has the expertise, research capacity, and populations for trials of new antiretroviral drugs
in children, adolescents and pregnant women. GHESKIO pediatricians identify and enroll HIV-infected

 How the brain determines cerebral ventricular volume, and how that in turn affects brain function, are
poorly understood. In patients who develop idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) or low pressure
hydrocephalus after intracranial hemorrhage, infection or other brain insults, ventricular volume increases in the
absence of obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, sustained intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations or brain
atrophy. iNPH patients display motor apraxia, dementia and incontinence that are often improved by CSF
drainage, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Numerous studies suggest that ependymal motile cilia
dysfunction somehow leads to hydrocephalus, albeit via unclear mechanisms. Indeed, some investigators have
challenged this notion, suggesting instead that increased CSF production, decreased CSF absorption, or
abnormal brain development are responsible. Here we present evidence for an ependymal chemosensory-
mechanotransduction system that uses motile cilia to convert chemical signals to changes in flow that govern
ependymal cell junction assembly, ventricular wall stiffness and ependymal permeability. By controlling
ventricular compliance and the exchange of CSF between the ventricular and interstitial spaces, this system
regulates ventricular volume, the relative distribution and composition of fluid in the ventricular and interstitial
compartments, and neuronal activity, all without altering ICP. To elucidate why ventriculomegaly and
neurological deficits develop in iNPH, we sequenced DNA from iNPH patients to identify iNPH-associated
mutations. Most of the iNPH-associated mutations involved genes that encode proteins associated with cilia,
and all of the genes showed increased expression in ependymal or choroid plexus cells. iNPH-associated
mutations affecting CWH43 or AK9 occurred in 25% of iNPH patients. Mice harboring iNPH-associated CWH43
or AK9 mutations displayed decreased motile cilia number or motility, respectively, and developed
ventriculomegaly and gait imbalance characteristic of iNPH. We now show that the ventriculomegaly is
accompanied by normal ICP, increased ventricular compliance and permeability, and disassembly of ependymal
cell junctions. We and others have discovered multiple receptors that localize to ependymal motile cilia and
regulate CSF flow by modulating cilia beat frequency. Mutation of these receptors increases ventricular volume.
In normal mice, we find that flow is required to maintain ependymal cell junctions. This process involves activation
of ependymal Piezo1, TRPV4, and PKD2 mechanotransduction channels. Induced conditional deletion of Piezo1
or PKD2 in adult mice increases ventricular size. We observed a diurnal increase in ependymal permeability that
increases exchange between ventricular CSF and interstitial fluid during sleep. We find that ventriculomegaly in
CWH43 or AK9 mutant mice is associated with a task-dependent decrease in neuronal activation in the
hippocampus and parietal cortex that may underlie the dementia and motor apraxia of iNPH. We will examine
how this ependymal chemosensory-mechanotransduction system regulates ventricular size and brain function."

Microsatellite repeat expansions are a growing family of 50+ neurological, neuromuscular, and
neurodegenerative diseases that includes the most common cause of adult-onset muscular dystrophy (myotonic
dystrophy, DM) and large group of rare neurodegenerative diseases spinocerebellar ataxias, SCAs). There are
more than 40 genetically heterogeneous rare SCAs, with the most common forms associated with CAG repeat
expansion mutations. Expression of these repeats leads to translation into toxic polyglutamine expansion
proteins whose pathogenic role is not well understood. The Berglund and Shorrock groups have preliminary data
that supports alternative splicing as a novel CAG-dependent transcriptomic hallmark of SCAs and that targeting
CAG repeat expansions with small molecules could provide therapeutic potential across multiple SCAs. The
focus of this supplement for Caroline Pritchard is a parallel study that seeks to draw potential overlaps in the
transcriptomic dysregulation in CAG SCAs and another repeat expansion disease, myotonic dystrophy type 1
(DM1). In contrast to the SCAs, the mechanism of disease pathogenesis for DM1 is well studied and involves
the expression of CUG expansion RNAs that sequester RNA binding proteins, leading to alternative splicing
dysregulation and a “spliceopathy”. This project, which supports the research and career training of Caroline
Pritchard, will focus on bioinformatic approaches to characterize the interface between these repeat expansion
disorders. The overlap in transcriptomic dysregulation between brains affected by CAG SCAs and CUG DM1 is
expected to reveal underlying common disease pathomechanisms, which will complement the parent grant’s
focus on CAG SCA disease mechanisms. Furthermore, the project will explore if splicing dysregulation
associated with repeat expansion diseases is coordinated at the transcript level by long-read sequencing
technologies. By characterizing parallel alternative splicing disease mechanisms in multiple repeat expansion
disease and the synergy in splicing dysregulation at the transcript level will not only enhance our understanding
of the disease biology of SCAs but also open up new potential avenues for therapeutic development across the
entire family of repeat expansion diseases."

Neuroinflammation has emerged as a critical component of secondary injury following brain trauma. Recent pre-
clinical studies have shed light on the neurotoxic effects of peripheral-derived monocyte/macrophages (PDM).
Our preliminary findings suggest this response may be dampened in the presence of juvenile-derived murine
PDMs, however the cause of this neuroprotective response remains unknown. The research objective of this
application is to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the divergent, age-dependent
PDM response and their role in mediating neurovascular dysfunction following TBI. Our proposal builds upon
extensive preliminary and published data demonstrating a distinct age-at-injury response following TBI. Juvenile-
derived PDMs display reduced pro-inflammatory phenotype, and adult PDM depletion and replacement with
those from juvenile mice confer neuroprotection. Moreover, we discovered that PDM-specific Tie2/EphA4
receptor crosstalk regulates their pro-inflammatory state across the age spectrum. We hypothesize that age-
related differences in the PDM response underlie divergent outcomes following TBI. We will employ cell-specific
depletions, and PDM replacement as well as novel transgenic murine models. These approaches will include
rigorous behavioral, histological and innovative low-input genome-wide omics assessment of the relevance and
mechanism(s) of PDM age on injury outcomes. We will also provide a framework for retooling the
neuroinflammatory response to accelerate pro-recovery and dampen pro-inflammatory processes after TBI."

There is an urgent need for new treatments capable of curing all forms of tuberculosis (TB) more rapidly.
Limitations of the methods currently used to assess treatment effectiveness in human TB drug trials impede
development of new shorter, more potent antibiotic regimens. The legacy pharmacodynamic (PD) marker
(sputum culture) predicts clinical outcomes poorly, fails to detect residual M. tuberculosis (Mtb) that causes
relapse, and requires 6-8 weeks to result. Because of the uncertain predictive value of existing culture-based
outcomes, there is risk that PD signal in Phase 2 trials may not accurately translate to improved relapse
outcomes in Phase 3 trials.
Evidence from recent clinical trials suggest that several new non-culture assays performed at the time of
treatment completion may predict subsequent microbiologic relapse. If validated, these assays could be
developed as novel molecular end-of-treatment outcomes for Phase 2b/c TB trials, thereby assuring that the
best new combination antibiotic regimens are advanced to Phase 3 testing.
Embedded in the Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB (R2D2) Network, the Candidate Clinical
Condition as Prognostic Outcome for TB Study (C3PO) tests pathogen and host biomarkers at the end of
treatment as predictors of microbiologic relapse among Vietnamese and Ugandan adolescents and adults
completing the global standard 4-drug regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. C3PO will ascertain
recurrent TB via intensive post-treatment microbiologic monitoring.
The assays evaluated at the end of TB treatment include the RS ratio®, a novel non-culture sputum assay of
bacterial ribosomal RNA synthesis developed by the Consortium for Applied Microbial Metrics (CAMM) and two
human blood transcriptional signatures. C3PO hypothesizes that measurable residual disease detected by the
RS ratio and a continuing TB-specific blood inflammatory signature at end of treatment will be associated with
increased risk for microbiological recurrence. C3PO is designed to establish new molecular outcomes for use
in TB clinical trials, thereby accelerating development of shorter, more effective TB treatments."
11089140,"Abstract: Environmental exposures to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin isolated from Aspergillus
flavus, are linked to the etiology of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). We propose three aims. The
first examines the role of base excision repair (BER) by the hNEIL1 glycosylase, and ""cancer-
prone"" variants of hNEIL1 in regions of exposure to AFB1, in excising AFB1 damage from DNA.
Deficiencies in repair of AFB1 DNA damage may be associated with early onset HCC, common
in areas of China with high AFB1 exposures, and contribute to the mutagenic signature
associated with AFB1 exposures. We will employ genetically edited mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) to determine how hNEIL1 variants modulate the mutagenic signature. We will employ
crystallography to understand mechanism for repair of AFB1 damage in DNA by hNEIL1 and
variants. Structural and dynamic changes associated with variants may reveal genetic risk
factors for HCC. Our second aim focuses on the mechanism of error-prone DNA replication of
AFB1 damage. The polymerase ζ specializes in extension beyond DNA damage and factors in
the genesis of A to T transversions characteristic of AFB1 exposures. We will employ cryo-EM to
determine structures of pol ζ complexed with AFB1-damaged DNA, accompanied by functional
assays. Crystallography will be employed to probe the mechanism of nucleotide insertion
opposite AFB1 lesions by DNA polymerase pol η. Our third aim focuses on the respective roles
of sequence-specific lesion bypass and formation of AFB1-Fapy-dG lesions in the etiology of
“Signature 24”, a sequence-specific pattern of G to T transversions characteristic of exposures
to AFB1. Fidelity and efficiency of bypass will be tested using sequence-specific substrates
including modeling replication forks. We will examine how the AFB1 mutagenic signature is
altered in Pol ζ-deficient MEFs. Sequence-specific rates of adduct formation will be probed by
competition assays under conditions in which AFB1-epoxide is the limiting reagent. We will
determine if re-arrangement of AFB1-N7-dG to (a) less mutagenic AP sites, or (b) mutagenic
AFB1-Fapy-dG, depends upon DNA sequence. We will examine cytosine methylation to probe
epigenetic contributions to the AFB1 mutagenic signature. We will employ NMR to monitor
complex sequence-specific conformational and configurational equilibria associated with AFB1-
Fapy-dG lesions in dsDNAs, in situ. We will also use NMR to measure sequence-specific
kinetics of DNA base pair opening, which may control rates of base-flipping during repair. AFB1
is an important environmental genotoxin; our work should provide new understanding of
environmental determinants of HCC."

Research goals for the R37 extension (Year 6-10): We maintain the overarching goal of
understanding variation in response to reading remediation in reading disabled (RD) learners
with dynamic brain/behavior tracking designed to yield novel insights into how remediation
modifies brain organization for reading, and why it fails to do so adequately for some RD children.
In the proposed continuation, we leverage major discoveries from the initial phase on reliable
cognitive and neurobiological predictors of differential responsiveness to conventional in-school
treatments (the how and why) to next examine what might constitute a more effective code
training and neurocognitive focus for these low-responders.
The obvious next steps are: 1) to understand the neurocognitive reasons why children exhibit this
component processing variability by systematically examining basic processing capacities for
each component dimension, at both the cognitive and neural levels of analysis. (Aim 2A); 2) to
follow this with targeted adaptive learning experiments (2-3 days) focused on how profiles
(measured in Aim 2A) predict neurocognitive responses to focused code learning experiments
(Aim 2B); and finally, 3) to build upon key neurocognitive insights from both Aims 2A and 2B and
transition to examining realistic short-term treatment opportunities (14 weeks; Aim 2C). These
extended “proto-treatment“ studies will employ Education Technology to deliver varied content
that differentially places the training focus on O, P, or S component processing dimensions at
different points during training, and with neurocognitive predictors and concurrent imaging
during this extended treatment develop and test brain-based models of learner by content
interactions. (The use of Education Technology is encouraged by its successful employment in
the current grant cycle and in two other federally funded projects that our team is conducting.)
We will build upon our progress with both pre-treatment brain imaging (with fMRI/MRS) and
frequent sampling of dynamic brain/behavior changes (with integrated fNIRS/EEG tracking)
during learning opportunities at different timescales to further our understanding of the
dynamics of brain/behavior dependencies in code learning and how treatment modulates these
inter-related levels of analysis. We will recruit waves of TD and RD cohorts (total N = 180; ages 7-
8) to participate in all Aim 2 studies."

 A growing body of evidence implicates oxidative stress in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
Nevertheless, it is currently unknow if it is a cause, a by-product or a consequence of disease. The effects of
oxidative stress on cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species is usually attributed to modifying proteins
and DNA. However, RNA oxidation occurs ten times more often than DNA oxidation. Importantly, high levels of
oxidized RNA are detected in relevant neuronal tissues of patients with ALS while, mouse models of ALS show
increased RNA oxidation in motor neurons of the spinal cord at an early pre-symptomatic stage. What remains
lacking, however, is an understanding of the functional relationship between RNA oxidation and ALS onset and
progression. Thus, there is a critical need to identify which motor neuron transcripts are oxidized in early, pre-
symptomatic stages of ALS and how this dysregulation contributes to neuronal death and other molecular
hallmarks of ALS. I believe that there are many, yet to be discovered, RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) that are
crucial for controlling the fate of oxidized RNAs. We hypothesize that RNA oxidation drives motor neuron
degeneration in ALS by dysregulating proper RNA processing by RBPs. We will test this hypothesis by (1)
elucidating, in iPSC-derived motor neurons, the RNA targets and the consequences of depletion of known RBPs
that interact with oxidized RNAs and identify novel ones; (2) identifying and comparing oxidized RNAs in iPSC-
derived motor neuron models; and investigating, at a single cell resolution, the effects of RNA oxidation on
transcription, translation and RBP-RNA interactions in iPSC-derived spinal organoid ALS models. This project
will generate the foundational methods and insights to enable early, pre-symptomatic-stage diagnostic
approaches and interventions to reduce RNA oxidation levels in high-risk individuals."

Physiological transport of fluid, molecules, proteins, and cells throughout the body is critical for homeostasis.
While transport processes like cell migration and molecular passage across cellular barriers are well
documented, less is known about transport across the interstitial tissue spaces and into lymphatic vessels.
Lymphatic vessels are critical for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and forming the adaptive immune
response, as they are the natural conduit between peripheral tissues and the lymph nodes (LNs), where the
immune response is shaped. Because particulates are primarily shuttled via lymphatic vessels, lymphatics have
received considerable attention in recent years as potential targets for drug delivery, particularly for immune
modulation. Transport across interstitial tissue governs what enters lymphatic vessels vs. blood vessels and thus
understanding extracellular tissues is vital to design therapeutics. However, we do not yet fully understand how
physiological processes and conditions such as interstitial flow or inflammation affect transport across interstitial
tissue spaces and into lymphatics. My research program will answer two key questions: 1) How do
physiological processes affect 1) lymphatic transport and its regulation, and 2) transport across
extracellular tissue? To address the first question, we propose to develop physiologically relevant in vitro model
systems that can recapitulate conditions within peripheral tissues and nanoparticle tools that both allow probing
how specific mechanisms, including fluid flow and inflammation, modulate lymphatic transport specifically.
Results from these studies will provide new insights into regulation of lymphatic transport, new model systems
for studying lymphatic transport, and new design criteria to maximize targeting lymphatic transport for therapeutic
purposes. To address the second question, we will combine two techniques: multiple particle tracking (MPT) and
live ex vivo tissue slice cultures. MPT uses nanoparticle diffusion over time to extract information about tissue
mesh spacing or microrheology and provides a medium for studying physiological processes like flow. Live tissue
slice cultures maintain tissue structure ex vivo and allow for real-time assessment of interstitial tissue structures.
Results from combining these techniques will provide a better understanding of how physiological processes
affect extracellular spaces and provide insights into design criteria for therapeutics to cross extracellular tissue
barriers. In summary, the proposed work will advance our knowledge about physiological processes governing
lymphatic transport and its regulation, and also shed light into how processes like inflammation, interstitial flow,
and edema affect extracellular tissue spaces. Ultimately, the vision for my lab’s research is to design crucial
scientific methods to be used by the broader community, identify design criteria and computational
models to predict transport across biological barriers, and design therapeutics and their delivery
vehicles for treating diseases by harnessing lymphatic vessel physiology."
11090079,"Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments. Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed
to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center (HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant women with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition,
the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-of- the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."

11089996,"ABSTRACT
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions are currently classified according to
behavioral criteria. This clinical diagnostic framework does not take into account underlying pathophysiology and
is often insufficient to predict outcomes. The long-term goal is to develop biomarkers that will help cluster
individuals with ASD and related conditions into biologically distinct groups (“biotypes”) and provide the means
to understand the underlying neural mechanisms. Developing biomarkers for use in children is particularly
important so that they can be used from the time symptoms are first recognized. Objective measurement of
sensory processing via electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and scientifically translatable method
to measure function of neural circuits. The proposed project tests the central hypothesis that EEG measures of
sensory processing predict behavioral phenotype (i.e., they are relevant to functional outcome) but also inform
the reclassification of neurodevelopmental conditions by neural circuit pathophysiology to complement
behavioral phenotype. This project uses EEG to measure sensory/neural circuit function in 3-4 year old children
with ASD (n=150), typical development (TD; n=75), and children who do not have ASD but whose caregivers
have concerns about how they process sensory information (Sensory Processing Concerns (SPC) group;
n=150). Aim 1: Determine how circuit-level brain activity, measured in response to sensory stimuli, is altered in
children with ASD vs. SPC vs. TD. Aim 2: Test if sensory EEG endophenotypes predict behavioral phenotype
(e.g., anxiety, attention, irritability, social skills) within and across groups (ASD, TD, SPC). Aim 3: Delineate
neurobiologically-informed subtypes of neural circuit activity in individuals. Rather than relying on behavioral
phenotype as the gold standard, this exploratory aim takes a data-driven approach to cluster individuals in ASD
(and potentially SPC) into biologically distinct subgroups (biotypes) defined by EEG measures of neural circuit
activity to sensory inputs. The proposed project is conceptually innovative because it uses the paradoxical co-
occurrence of sensory hyper- and hypo-reactivity within individuals as the nidus for developing biomarkers that
reflect the granular neurobiological principles underlying sensory processing and ASD. The proposed project is
technically innovative because many of the proposed EEG measures are novel or have never been used to
study ASD. The project is significant because it moves the field from developing biomarkers that reflect
behavioral understanding of ASD towards biomarkers that provide neurobiological understanding of ASD.
Ultimately, this will allow development of diagnostic and stratification biomarkers that guide biologically targeted,
personalized treatments in children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions."
11090088,"Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disease, costing the healthcare system approximately $15.5
billion annually and negatively impacting quality of life. The incidence and prevalence of epilepsy peaks over the
age of 55—a group that is particularly vulnerable to accelerated cognitive and brain aging, placing them at
increased risk for progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Given that the
most rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population is adults over the age of 55, the number of older
adults living with epilepsy will dramatically increase over the next several decades, presenting a major
public health concern. Therefore, there is a critical need to characterize cognitive and brain aging in older
adults with epilepsy, identify underlying mechanisms of accelerated aging, and target modifiable risk factors that
would prevent or mitigate cognitive decline and progression to dementia. We propose the first longitudinal,
multi-site investigation of cognitive and brain aging in older adults (55-90 years) with epilepsy in efforts
to identify vascular, genetic, biomarker and demographic risk factors for accelerated aging. We will
accomplish this goal by obtaining state-of-the-art neuroimaging, comprehensive neuropsychological, vascular
risk, and genetic/biomarker data on 100 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and frontal lobe epilepsy
(FLE) from three geographically and racially/ethnically diverse epilepsy centers. We will follow these patients
longitudinally, examine their imaging and cognitive trajectories over 5 years, and compare their trajectories to
100 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 100 normal aging controls. We will then examine the
influence of vascular, genetic (apolipoprotein 4), and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker (i.e, amyloidβ and tau) risk
profiles on cognitive decline and identify baseline factors that increase risk for progression to dementia. Our
scientific premise is that older adults with focal epilepsy will show age-accelerated cognitive and brain
aging comparable to that seen in MCI. We propose that elevated vascular risk and the presence of AD-
associated pathology will underlie the association between accelerated brain aging (i.e, regional
atrophy, white matter injury, and hypoperfusion) and cognitive decline in vulnerable patients.
These goals are aligned with the 2014 NINDS Benchmarks for Epilepsy Research, which prioritize limiting or
preventing adverse consequence of seizures and their treatment across the lifespan. They are also aligned with
the AD/Alzheimer’s Dementia Related Dementias (ADRD) research goals of identifying risk factors (i.e.,
seizures) for progression to dementia. The current project has strong implications for public health because it
aims to identify individual predictors of cognitive decline that could help to prevent disabilty and progression to
dementia, which would have an immediate and sustained impact on patient care. Furthermore, this grant will
explore the bidirectional link between AD and epilepsy, would could lead to therapeutic opportunities for both
diseases and other disorders of aging."

Kidney transplantation is the main therapy for end stage kidney disease (ESKD),1 however, 3-5% of grafts fail
yearly and only 50% remain functioning at ten years.2,3 The most common manifestations of graft loss are
poorly characterized histologic findings of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), 4-7 which are present in
up to a third of biopsies 6-month after transplant.8 Furthermore, endothelial cell injury is common in kidney
transplantation due to ischemic injury during procurement,9 and leads to impaired vessel integrity and
peritubular capillary loss, which have been shown to lead to IFTA.9-12 In addition, vessel integrity has been
proposed to have a protective impact on kidney function by reducing microvascular leakage of albumin13, and
reducing the recipient alloimmune response to damaged endothelial cells.9, 10, 14, 15 For this reason, we propose
to evaluate two vascular markers in the Angiopoietin family capturing blood vessel integrity [Angiopoietin-1
(Angpt-1), and -2 (Angpt-2)] in the setting of deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Activation of the Angpt-1
receptor, Tie-2, maintains vessel stability and integrity, but Angpt-2, a competitive antagonist to Angpt-1,
interferes with the Angpt-1-Tie-2 axis, and promotes vessel leakage.16 The balance of Angpt-1: Angpt-2
production determines the integrity of blood vessels.17 The goal of this proposal is to evaluate if blood
vessel integrity as measured by Angiopoietins will be prognostic of short and long-term graft function
in an effort to identify pathways for future intervention. The candidate hypothesizes that maintaining
vessel integrity (as measured by Angpt-1 and Angpt-2) will be associated with less fibrosis, and better graft
outcomes. In aim 1, we will prospectively enroll deceased donor transplant recipients as well as use a pre-
existing cohort of recipients to evaluate and externally validate the associations of perioperative Angiopoietins
with 1-year graft function. In aim 2, we will evaluate if Angiopoietins measured at a single time point are
associated with long-term graft failure (mean follow up of about four years) by using bio-specimens from the
pre-existing FAVORIT trial. In aim 3, we will test the associations of perioperative Angiopoietins with tissue
pathology on 6-month graft biopsies using our prospective enrollment cohort. More specifically, we will
evaluate if Angpt-1 and -2 are associated with 6-month IFTA, peritubular capillary loss and vessel permeability
on histology. Understanding the role of vessel integrity as measured by Angiopoietins in allograft outcomes
may help identify pathways for future intervention and risk stratify recipients for more targeted trials and clinical
care."

successful treatment of precancerous cervical lesions in primary care for women in Kenya. We propose in this
supplement application to explore acceptability, barriers, facilitators and strategies to integrate cervical cancer
screening into outpatient emergency departments. The proposed study will provide an opportunity for research
training and mentorship of Dr. Rita Arogo, a Gynaecologist at Kenyatta National Hospital and Honorary lecturer
at the University of Nairobi, provide preliminary data for her K43 application and will complement the currently
ongoing U54 award by accessing women missed by current screening approaches.
 Kenya's guidelines recommend cervical cancer screening for all women, but coverage remains low at
16%. Cervical cancer screening is primarily offered in maternal-and-child health, family planning, and HIV
comprehensive care clinics, leaving out women not seeking care in these clinics. Outpatient emergency
departments offer an opportunity to reach these underserved women. Understanding barriers and facilitators to
integrating screening in outpatient emergency departments can inform strategies to optimize screening.
 The specific objectives of this mentored research are to: To assess the acceptability of cervical cancer
screening among women presenting to 3 outpatient emergency departments within Nairobi County, explore
barriers and facilitators of integrating cervical cancer screening services in the outpatient emergency
departments within Nairobi County and to identify feasible, and effective strategies to promote integration of
cervical cancer screening in the outpatient departments and develop roadmaps for implementation.
 We will employ an explanatory sequential design, conducting 369 quantitative surveys followed by 36
qualitative in-depth interviews at three Nairobi County health facilities' outpatient emergency departments.
Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct 15 in-depth interviews with
healthcare workers to grasp their perceived barriers and facilitators to the integration. Key stakeholders will
then convene in a 2-day workshop to prioritize identified barriers and propose implementation strategies. This
approach aims to promote cervical cancer screening uptake, capturing missed women and bolstering national

Saharan Africa. We advocate investigating cancer interception strategies using appropriate medical treatments
to interrupt or reverse the impact of these HCC-causing infections. We will accomplish this objective by
developing local capacity and performing important research. Consortium activities are designed to enhance
both the clinical, population and translational research infrastructure and individual African investigator capacity
to conduct high-level, collaborative investigation of HIV, chronic infections and HCC. First, we will form a large,

clinical responses, and characterize breakthrough HCC, while investigating novel biomarkers. To understand
our data demonstrating synergistic interaction between chronic HBV and Sm infections, we will examine HBV

11089993,"PROJECT SUMMARY (of the Parent Award)
Spontaneous pregnancy loss is the most common early obstetric complication, affecting 1 in 4 women worldwide.
While ~50% of cases are due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities, the causes for the other ~50% remain unclear,
although there is increasing evidence that a dysfunctional maternal endometrium may play a role. Bacterial and
viral infections have been associated with ~15% of early pregnancy losses, as well as later gestational
complications such as preterm birth and preeclampsia. However, how the maternal endometrium intrinsically
responds to infection remains unclear, highlighting a major gap in knowledge. Endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs)
are the major cellular component of the endometrium and they undergo a specialized differentiation process,
termed decidualization, monthly in anticipation of pregnancy. If pregnancy ensues, EnSCs play key roles in
regulating blastocyst implantation and placental trophoblast invasion at the maternal-fetal interface. Thus,
appropriate EnSC function is crucial to the establishment of a healthy pregnancy. EnSCs are likely to affect
trophoblast function through a combination of soluble factor secretion and production of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) which mediate intercellular communication through their protein, nucleic acid, and lipid cargos. This
research proposes to take a focused mechanistic approach to investigate how a viral infection affects EnSC
decidualization, EV production and interactions with trophoblasts using viral dsRNA [Poly(I:C)] as a model. In
preliminary studies, we found that Poly(I:C) reduced EnSC decidualization whilst increasing senescence and EV
production. Poly(I:C)-exposed EnSCs also had reduced capacity to chemoattract trophoblasts. Based on this,
our central hypothesis is that viral infection prevents adequate EnSC decidualization and accelerate senescence,
leading to increased EV production by EnSCs. Together, this results in altered EnSC interactions with
trophoblasts, impairing implantation and placentation. Our specific aims are to: examine the mechanisms by
which Poly(I:C) affects EnSC decidualization and senescence (Aim 1); determine the effects of early Poly(I:C)
exposure on pregnancy progression and outcome in vivo (Aim 2); and determine how Poly(I:C) affect EnSC EV
production and subsequent effects on trophoblasts (Aim 3). This project enables the candidate to combine her
backgrounds in reproductive immunology, early placental development and endometrial biology with her
interests in EVs as a novel mode of intercellular communication at the maternal-fetal interface. These studies
are significant because they will provide novel mechanistic insights into how infection impacts EnSC
decidualization and their subsequent interactions with placental trophoblasts, establishing a strong link between
infection, endometrial dysfunction, implantation failure and the myriad of obstetric complications associated with
impaired placentation. Thus, successful completion of this project may contribute to the identification of novel
preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve pregnancy success for women worldwide."

models and integrates advanced AI to improve early identification and management of heart failure, especially
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, for which timely initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy
(GDMT) can significantly improve outcomes. Second, the project will analyze trends in GDMT prescribing
within a longitudinal cohort of symptomatic heart failure patients, using mixed effects logistic regression to
understand prescribing practices at the RRHs (Aim 2). By integrating advanced echocardiography training with
comprehensive analysis of GDMT prescribing, the project aims to improve clinical outcomes and establish
sustainable healthcare practices that address broad sociodemographic disparities in HF care across Uganda,
aligning with National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute priorities and enhancing cardiovascular management in
a setting with profound healthcare delivery challenges. In this diversity supplement, the candidate, an assistant

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is neurodegenerative movement disorder that causes a series of motor deficits. Due
to the degenerative nature of PD, effective management of motor symptoms requires frequent and accurate
motor assessment. Current approaches for PD motor assessment rely on subjectively rated clinical scales or
research-grade equipment that is expensive or data-limited. These limitations significantly restrict the ability to
perform frequent, granular assessments of motor function and highlight an important need for new approaches
that enable objective motor assessments in any setting with minimal costs of time, money, or effort.
Here, we propose an automated, video-based approach to PD motor assessment by using a state of the art
pose estimation algorithm. Briefly, pose estimation is an emerging technology that is capable of quantitatively
tracking human movement from simple digital videos recorded using common household devices (e.g.,
smartphones, tablets). The development of pose estimation algorithms for tracking human movement has
progressed rapidly in the artificial intelligence community, and there is now significant untapped potential for
leveraging this technology to perform rapid, automated motor assessments directly in home or clinic.
In Aim 1.1, we will test a pose estimation approach for gait assessment in persons with PD. Gait dysfunction is
common in PD, but it remains difficult to assess gait quantitatively in the home or clinic. Gait assessment is not
represented adequately in clinical scales of motor function in PD, and there are no good methods for objective
measurement of whole-body gait kinematics that can be used directly in the home or clinic. We will address
this need by using a video-based pose estimation workflow to perform gait assessments in persons with PD.
We will compare these results to motion capture measurements to examine how well the pose estimation
approach approximates ground-truth measurements.
In Aim 1.2, we will use our pose estimation approach to track repetitive movements in persons with PD. PD
often causes difficulty in performing repetitive movements (e.g., finger tapping); accordingly, assessment of
repetitive movements constitutes a significant portion of the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(the standard clinical scale for motor assessment in PD). This assessment is done through subjective human
ratings; here, we will test an automated, objective, video-based approach for tracking repetitive movements in
persons with PD and again compare to ground-truth motion capture measurements.
In Aim 2, we will compare and contrast motor deficits identified by pose estimation and human assessment.
Subjective visual assessment is the most common means of assessing motor function in PD, but computer
vision approaches (e.g., pose estimation) have significant potential to automate and objectivize this process.
Here, we will compare how well deficits in gait and repetitive movements detected by our pose estimation
approach align with neurologist ratings of these tasks on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale."
11089843,"Project Summary/Abstract
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and causes a
combination of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The clinical manifestations of PD
are highly variable, and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that drive this variability
remain unknown. Dementia in PD is associated with neocortical accumulation of alpha-
synuclein in Lewy bodies, which likely contributes to impaired function of cortical neurons.
However, PD also affects a number of subcortical nuclei including noradrenergic (NA) neurons,
which have diffuse projections to cortical and limbic regions. Thus impaired function and
degeneration of both cortical neurons and subcortical NA neurons may contribute to nonmotor
symptoms in PD, including dementia.
We hypothesize that levels of synaptic and noradrenergic proteins in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) are lower in PD. The loss of cortical synaptic terminals and cortical noradrenergic
neurons in PD brain tissue would likely correspond to reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) analytes derived from cortical synapses and noradrenergic neurons. Thus, such CSF
analytes would be useful as biomarkers reflecting either disease progression or
therapeutic targets and have the potential to act as indicators for the effectiveness of
disease-modifying therapies. Our preliminary data from cross-sectional analysis of CSF and
post-mortem brain tissue samples supports our strategy to utilize these CSF analytes as
indicators of PD disease progression.
The primary objective of the proposed study will determine whether CSF analytes derived from
cortical synaptic terminals (aim 1) and noradrenergic neurons (aim 2) differ between PD and
control participants and whether levels change longitudinally as disease progresses. We will use
both traditional and single-molecule immunoassays and liquid chromatography to quantitate
CSF analytes of interest. The second objective is to determine whether levels of the CSF
analytes correlate to motor, cognitive, and psychiatric features of PD (aim 3). The final objective
for the candidate is to continue authoring manuscripts and generate preliminary data towards a
K23 application, where the candidate would continue to develop and validate CSF biomarkers.
Although with independent aims, the present study leverages existing data collected as a part of
multiple large-scale longitudinal studies with established funding. Scientifically, we envision a
combination of CSF biomarkers that may be used to track the progression of motor, cognitive,
and psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson disease. These CSF biomarkers will provide information
on disease prognosis and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of novel disease-modifying
therapeutics."
11089624,"Project Summary/Abstract
Like all mammalian vascular beds, the central nervous system relies on a functional vascular system (the
neurovascular system) to maintain the developmental and metabolic activities of its resident cells.
Neurovascular compromise thus imparts direct and indirect consequences to parenchymal tissue, and those
consequences impair central nervous system function. Brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a human
neurovascular disease characterized by abnormal blood vessel morphology and organization – these
abnormalities lead to feed-forward changes in hemodynamics that increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke,
chronic disability, and death. Currently, there are no Food & Drug Administration-approved pharmacological
treatments for brain AVM; thus, understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this disease will inform on
molecular-based therapies.
Through the Funded Parent Project, we are using in vivo and in vitro approaches to examine whether
Adrenomedullin signaling is required for vascular abnormalities associated with Rbpj-deficient brain AVM in
mice and for cellular perturbations caused by RBPJ deficiency in cultured human brain endothelial cells. The
experimental aims in this Diversity Supplement will use our in vitro human brain endothelial cell system to
determine whether cytoskeleton dynamics are affected in RBPJ-deficient endothelial cells and whether small-
molecule inhibition of Adrenomedullin signaling can prevent cytoskeleton dysfunction.
We will test the hypothesis that inhibition of Adrenomedullin signaling, in the context of endothelial RBPJ-
deficiency, will normalize cytoskeletal organization and function, and thereby prevent those abnormalities from
promoting endothelial cell dysfunction. This hypothesis will be addressed in two supplemental aims that will
determine whether inhibition of Adrenomedullin signaling, via administration of the small-molecule inhibitor
NSC16311, prevents dysregulation of F-actin polymerization dynamics (Supplemental Aim 1) and prevents
dysregulation of F-actin turnover rate (Supplemental Aim 2) in cultured, RBPJ-deficient human brain
endothelial cells.
These studies will advance our long-term research objectives, which are to understand how loss of RBPJ leads
to brain endothelial cell dysfunction and how such dysfunction contributes to neurovascular pathologies like
brain AVM. Our work will also inform on the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition to normalize aberrant cell
signaling, to prevent endothelial cell dysfunction, and thereby to promote neurovascular health."
11087972,"The Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) is a longitudinal study using a national sample of community-dwelling
adults aged 50 and older in urban and rural Mexico. Six waves of data collection over 20 years have
been completed. Since its inception, the protocols and survey instruments are highly comparable to the U.S.
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), A key ancillary study of the MHAS is the Mex-Cog, part of the
Harmonized Cognitive Aging Protocol (HCAP), conducted in several countries to study Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias (ADRD) around the globe using population-based surveys like the MHAS. Two waves of
the Mex-Cog have been completed.
The long-term goal is to create new knowledge on aging and ADRD for Mexican older adults using a
population-based life course perspective. The MHAS is uniquely positioned to sustain research on emerging
themes such as COVID-19 and the related social inequities it revealed, providing a strong rationale for adding
follow-ups of the MHAS and Mex-Cog, and incorporating new themes to address these knowledge gaps, The
specific aims are to: 1) Support further research on the dynamics of aging in Mexico, by extending and
improving an existing national panel study, the MHAS. 2) Support further research on the dynamics of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias around the globe, by extending an existing panel of Mex-Cog, an
ancillary study of the MHAS; and 3) Foster research on the dynamics of Mexican aging by expanding the
knowledge about and promoting the use of the databases and its related products. We will carry out waves 7
and 8 of the MHAS and Wave 3 of the Mex-Cog, We will add a rural over-sample, and incorporate new
themes: COVID-19, discrimination, use of languages, and use of technology for health care. We will collect
saliva samples in Mex-Cog 3 to support research on genetics of Alzheimer's disease. We will continue the
user-friendly web-based platforms and launch a new virtual data enclave to enhance global public access to
the data and project documentation.
The analytical significance of the new MHAS data will be exceptional, producing a national longitudinal study of
aging that spans over twenty-six years, which is unique for a low or middle-income country, The data platform
will enhance research on aging in general and ADRD more specifically, and related changes of physical and
mental health; physical and cognitive functionality; COVID-19 and other environmental risks; health behaviors
and health care use; family support; aging and the life course; wealth, income, labor and retirement; Mexico-U.S. migration; and mortality in a country aging fast with limited institutional support for individuals in old age,
and with close social and economic ties to the United States. The data will enable cross-period and cross-cohort
analyses, as well as short- and long-run effects on health and aging, and will continue to be highly
comparable with similar studies in other countries."
11089654,"One of the greatest mysteries in biology concerns how life has perpetuated, and continues to 
perpetuate, from generation to generation. A key feature of the mammalian germline is 
its sexual dimorphism: spermatogenesis and oogenesis. These dimorphic developmental 
processes are inherently complex, and this complexity poses significant challenges to 
understanding the perpetuity of life and the development of treatments for various germline-derived 
genetic and epigenetic diseases. Thus, in this R35 application, our research directions converge 
to address the following question: How do epigenetic mechanisms govern distinct sexually 
dimorphic processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis, culminating in the generation of functional 
sperm and eggs? Since I became independent ten years ago, I and my team have worked to construct 
 a detailed picture of the epigenetic mechanisms that govern mammalian spermatogenesis. We 
have shown that the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in germ cell development is notable for not only 
global changes in gene expression but the dynamic reorganization of the epigenome; in brief, we 
have revealed that meiosis itself is a process of global epigenomic reprogramming. My research 
program has pioneered these concepts and developed innovative approaches to decode germline 
mechanisms crucial for preparing the next generation, providing a rigorous foundation for future 
research.
To understand key sexually dimorphic processes, we focus on fundamental 
processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. In spermatogenesis, postnatal germ cells enter a stem 
cell stage, undergo meiosis, and sustain long-term production of sperm. We will elucidate the 
global epigenetic mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis from the stem cell stage to sperm 
production, with an emphasis on dynamic changes in the epigenetic machinery and their 
importance to the next generation. Since, in males, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) 
functions as a key sexually dimorphic process, we will also determine the molecular functions of 
DNA damage response pathways-which direct MSCl-in the epigenetic regulation of the sex chromosomes. 
In contrast, female germ cells undergo meiosis in embryos and enter a prolonged stage of 
meiotic arrest-spanning decades in humans-prior to oocyte maturation. We will determine 
epigenetic mechanisms underlying critical stages of oogenesis to complement our study of 
male germ cells. Ultimately, we will reveal distinct features and unifying principles of 
spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Taking all of this together, we are uniquely positioned to clarify 
how fundamental germline mechanisms intersect to ensure genome maintenance, genome defense, and 
epigenetic gene regulation on a systemic level. The research directions proposed in this 
application are cohesive and synergistic, with high potential to sustain research 
progress and inform significant, transformative advances in germline biology, human 
reproduction, and reproductive health in general."
11087976,"ABSTRACT
Heart failure is a major worldwide health problem, with a prevalence of over 6.2 million in the United States (US),
and over 26 million worldwide. Heart failure is associated with signs and symptoms such as breathlessness with
exertion, shortness of breath, fatigue, tiredness or weakness, difficulty breathing when lying down, sleeping
problems, swollen legs or ankles, and weight gain, which can negatively impact health-related quality of life and
physical function. Although multiple clinical outcome assessments (COAs), specifically patient-reported
outcome (PRO) measures, have been developed to assess heart failure symptoms, tested against the scientific
processes of their time, and widely used in evaluating heart failure interventions, they each present their own
limitations with respect to recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) COA-related guidances.
A new measure of CHF symptom severity was accepted into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s
(CDER’s) COA Qualification Program under DDT #000112 on May 3, 2019. As requested by FDA in the Letter
of Intent response, a Qualification Plan (QP) was prepared and submitted to FDA on March 24, 2023, that
documents the development of and content validity evidence supporting the CHF-SS, along with the CHF
Working Group’s research plan for obtaining the quantitative evidence necessary to support qualification of the
measure for a limited context of use in CHF drug development. A reviewability assessment memo was
subsequently received, indicating that the QP was determined to be reviewable by FDA on October 2, 2023. An
amended statistical analysis plan (SAP) was submitted to FDA on March 20, 2024, to reflect the evolution in our
approach to these analyses in light of recent FDA feedback on other qualification submissions and current
thinking regarding the best practices in our field. Once FDA feedback on the QP is received, additional
modifications to the SAP may be necessary.
Our application includes 3 aims. For Aim 1, we will finalize the SAP for cross-sectional analyses in response to
FDA feedback. For Aim 2, we will analyze the available cross-sectional dataset containing CHF-SS data, in
accordance with the QP and the final SAP incorporating FDA feedback. For Aim 3, we will prepare a quantitative
study report for the CHF-SS for future submission with the CHF-SS Full Qualification Package. The long-term
result of this project will be to qualify the CHF-SS for the assessment of symptom severity in CHF treatment trials
according to the most recent, rigorous standards and best practices to develop fit-for-purpose COAs for
regulatory decision making."
11087823,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Globally, COPD prevalence is estimated to be 11.7%, and COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the
United States (US). The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD is double in rural (8.2%) compared to urban areas
(4.7%). Rurality is associated with worse COPD outcomes, such as more severe dyspnea, poorer self-
rated health, lower health-related quality of life (HRQL), and increased risk of acute exacerbations. Significant
geographical disparities exist in treating and managing COPD in the United States. Less than 8% of rural
patients have access to pulmonary rehabilitation, a critical treatment for COPD patients that improves
all outcomes and decreases health care utilization. This project addresses an important SDOH
problem: access to proper care. It will provide pulmonary rehabilitation that promotes physical activity and
exercise, as well as customized education with personalized support through health coaching for patients with
COPD in rural areas. Our prior NIH-funded research in the delivery of Home-based rehabilitation, in addition to
the current literature, supports the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed
hypothesis.
This application aims to test the uptake, effectiveness, and patient-caregiver-provider experience of home-
based pulmonary rehabilitation with health coaching for COPD patients in rural communities.
The proposed research that addresses access to care as the main social determinant of health will consider
patient/community priorities, needs, and preferences through a personalized approach through health
coaching. The program has been tested effective in two large NIH-funded randomized studies but not
specifically tested in rural settings. The comprehensive qualitative assessment of the intervention will inform
any necessary adaptation.
The proposed intervention will address two aspects of social injustice in COPD: inadequate COPD care and
lack of support (factors that make living with COPD more difficult than it should be, i.e., social isolation in rural
areas). If the project aims are achieved, an increased pulmonary rehabilitation uptake and improved physical
and emotional quality of life will advance the scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice
of rural patients living with COPD. Our results may inform the remote care for other chronic conditions in rural
patients (heart failure, hypertension, obesity, diabetes)."

A lack of visual experience may affect language development in the domains of word learning and vocabulary
development in ways that necessitate specific instructional approaches and interventions for blind children.
Compared to sighted children, blind children may learn more words from the auditory modality (i.e., speech)
because they do not casually perceive writing in their environment and often experience reading delays. They
may also learn fewer words from direct perceptual experience because they cannot acquire the meanings of
words by perceiving their referents visually. Cumulatively, these word learning differences may affect the tra-
jectory of vocabulary development in early and middle childhood. An improved understanding of vocabulary
development could improve education for this underserved population. Unfortunately, word learning and vo-
cabulary are understudied within the area of blind children’s language development. This observational analytic
study employing a cross-sectional design directly compares self-reported modes (perceptual or linguistic) and
channels (spoken or written) of word learning for individual words in blind and sighted children. It also com-
pares their trajectories of vocabulary development from age 5 to 12. Specific aims are 1) Determine whether
vocabulary development in blind children is delayed relative to sighted children; 2) Examine whether
mode and channel of word learning in blind children differ from those in sighted children; and 3) Present a
dataset of age-of-acquisition, mode-of-acquisition, and channel-of-acquisition norms for future use in
research. The approach is innovative because objective age-of-acquisition norms (obtained from children
themselves rather than subjective adult estimates) are by definition more reliable and valid than subjective
norms and are exceptionally rare, even for sighted populations. The verbal administration of tasks that are typi-
cally administered visually will make them accessible not only to blind children, but to any child with a reading
or learning disability. Finally, the virtual approach to data collection will allow the researchers to reach more
individuals from a population that is historically difficult to study. The project is an instrumental part of the PI’s
long-term goal of understanding how vocabulary develops without sight and applying this understanding to im-
prove educational strategies and outcomes in blind children."
11089903,"Project Summary
As cannabis legalization continues to spread across the United States, average Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
concentrations in recreational products have significantly increased, with THC levels as high as 90-95%. Our
preliminary data suggest that concentrate use elicits blood THC levels more than twice as high as cannabis
flower use, and that concentrate use is associated with greater withdrawal, tolerance, and Cannabis Use
Disorder (CUD), prompting concern about the risks of these high potency products in relation to problem use
and CUD. No prior study has evaluated effective treatments to reduce cannabis use in this high risk group.
Several previous studies have found that the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), which may
antagonize the effects of THC on CB1 and CB2 receptors, reduces cannabis use and CUD-related symptoms,
such as affective disturbance and withdrawal. Results of these studies are promising, but limited to synthetic or
isolated forms of CBD that are not widely available. There have been no tests of the hemp-derived CBD that is
widely available without a prescription across the U.S. Importantly, hemp-derived CBD comes in two forms, one
with a small amount of THC (~0.3% THC, full spectrum; fsCBD) and one without THC (0% THC; broad spectrum;
bsCBD). It is possible that a small amount of THC may confer additional benefits with respect to withdrawal and
related affective disturbance, and in turn be beneficial for reducing THC use overall. Consistent with this
hypothesis, pilot data from our lab suggest that CBD, that also contains low levels of THC, reduces THC drug
reward, withdrawal, anxiety, and overall THC use in heavy concentrate users, supporting the potential for hemp-
derived CBD to reduce THC use and mitigate withdrawal in this high risk group. However, no placebo-controlled
trial has been conducted comparing hemp-derived CBD with and without THC on reducing THC use.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT comparing the effects of
hemp-derived CBD (fsCBD vs. bsCBD vs. placebo) on reducing THC use in concentrate users with CUD.
150 adult treatment seeking concentrate users with DSM5 CUD will be recruited to complete an eight-week
protocol. Participants will be randomly assigned to take 400 mg of either hemp-derived bsCBD (contains no
THC), hemp-derived fsCBD (contains low levels of THC), or matched placebo (50 participants per group) daily
for eight weeks. All participants will receive a multi-session empirically supported psychological intervention to
support cannabis use reduction during the trial. Participants will be assessed for changes in THC use [self-
reported mg of THC used and levels of THC’s metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-THC (THC-COOH)] and CUD
symptoms, as well as levels of CBD and CBD’s metabolite, 7-Carboxy-Cannabidiol (CBD-COOH) to monitor
medication adherence. Primary outcomes include reduction in THC exposure [via self-reported amount used
and urine THC-COOH (standardized for creatinine)], CUD symptoms, and withdrawal symptoms, including
affective, physiological, and physical symptom facets, across the 8 week study."

The Molecular Basis of Altered Natural Kill Cells in Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial
Lung Disease
Project Summary
An activated, cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cell population was identified in scleroderma-associated
interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) that showed upregulation in several genes, including Granzyme
B, Amphiregulin, and Interferon-gamma. Because the genes are suspected to play a critical role in
the pathogenic effects in the lungs, this project will use single cell technologies, including single
cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) and Multiome-seq (combined single nuclear RNA-seq and
snATAC-seq), to understand how these genes are regulated. By assessing the state of open
chromatin across the genome using computational analysis, transcription factors (TF) can be
predicted that are regulating this process. Experiments will be utilized to better understand the
pathways that cause NK cell activation in SSc-ILD by comparing TF regulating SSc-ILD NK cells
from lung with TF activated by cytokine simulation in vitro of NK cells purified from blood and
healthy lungs. We hypothesize that open chromatin in NK cells will implicate key transcription
factors (TFs) that regulate NK cell activation in SSc-ILD lungs, and that alteration of these TFs drive
expression of AREG, IFNG and GZMB, as well as other key genes in their aberrant pathway of
differentiation."

 This proposal centers on uncovering intrinsic physical properties of DNA duplex (i.e., DNA shape) and
elucidating their roles in CRSIPR Cas9 and Cas12a target discrimination. CRISPR (Clustered-Regularly-
Interspaced-Short-Palindromic-Repeats) systems have been adapted into versatile and programmable agents
for manipulating nucleic acid targets in a genome-wide fashion, unleashing a revolution in genome editing and
manipulation that is still rapidly advancing. CRISPR-based technology is built upon specific recognition of nucleic
acids, and a major obstacle hampering its applications in therapeutic settings is the off-target effect, in which
uncontrolled and undesired actions of CRISPR on aberrant gene targets result in deleterious consequences.
Significant improvement of CRISPR specificity is required, and this depends on further in-depth understanding
of mechanism of CRISPR target discrimination.
 Proposed work focuses on Cas9 and Cas12a that are most widely used for engineering DNA genomes. Cas9
and Cas12a both use an effector protein-RNA complex to cleave double-stranded DNAs, and select their
cognate targets based on: (i) base-pairing between the RNA guide and a segment of the DNA target-strand
designated as protospacer and (ii) a short protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) within the target DNA. Ca9/Cas12a
target discrimination rely on intrinsic DNA shape, which is determined collectively by the local core base-pair(s)
and many other factors including (distal) peripheral sequences and topological constraints (e.g., supercoiling).
However, current studies on Cas9/Cas12a target selection focus on DNA features at the core segment spanning
the PAM and protospacer, and have not yet accounted for impacts of peripheral sequences beyond direct
RNA/DNA pairing or DNA topological constraints.
 We have developed unique site-directed spin labeling methods to obtain sequence-dependent conformation
(shape) of free duplexes as well as DNAs bound by proteins including Cas9 and Cas12a. Our recent work shows
that DNA sequences not involved in RNA/DNA pairing can modulate Cas9-induced DNA unwinding and cleavage,
and the information enables gene editing in cells with short RNA guides that are known to enhance specificity.
Building on these findings, we will investigate how DNA peripheral sequences and supercoiling modulate
Cas9/Cas12a target discrimination as well as affect the shape of free DNA core segments. Information learned
will be incorporated into algorithms for enhancing CRISPR targeting specificity, as well as for predicting three-
dimensional DNA shape from the linear one-dimensional sequence in a genome-wide setting. The project will
advance understanding on DNA specific recognition that is fundamental to biology, and will contribute to
development of the next generation of scientific workforce."

Language “nutrition” or access to rich language exposure nourishes children's language development. In turn,
“healthy” language outcomes lead to academic success. Despite widespread agreement on the importance of
direct exposure to primary caregivers' language (direct input), there is a limited understanding of the multiple
input sources and types that promote bilingual development. Yet, given Latino cultural values of family
interdependence and cohesion, Latino children's language nutrition comes from multiple sources (primary,
secondary, other caregivers) and involves multiple input types, including overheard and direct speech. Thus, in
the parent R15 grant, we aim to establish whether and how multiple language input sources and types contribute
uniquely to Latino children's bilingual language outcomes. This supplement proposes research and career
development activities for Ms. Selena Carbajal that will add to and inform the parent grant. Applying a culture-
centered approach to studying bilingual language development, the two aims are to: 1) identify the extent to
which Latino children's bilingual outcomes and language input—within dyadic interactions with caregivers—vary
based on their caregivers' cultural orientations and values and 2) examine how naturally occurring one-on-one
and group interactions—providing direct and overheard speech—vary based on caregivers' cultural orientations
and values to promote children's bilingual development. To meet Aim #1, we rely on the parent grant's video-
recorded structured play task between children and their primary and secondary caregivers (n=60). To meet Aim
#2, we leverage the rich existing audio data collected for the original R15 grant (n=41) that captures children's
naturally occurring language interactions with multiple caregivers throughout the day. For both aims, we will
code for culturally salient caregiving behaviors within language-based interactions. The primary analyses will
examine how Latino caregivers' language use varies based on their cultural orientations and values to promote
their children's bilingual outcomes. The overall objective is to better understand the culture-specific
socioemotional contexts and linguistic experiences that jointly support children's healthy bilingual language
development. In meeting these aims and with structured mentoring from Dr. Perla B. Gámez (PI) and Dr.
Francisco Palermo, Ms. Carbajal will refine and gain the research and career development skills necessary for an
independent research career in the health-related sciences. To better prepare Ms. Carbajal for an Assistant
Professor position, she will (1) engage in hands-on research activities to expand her content knowledge as well
as develop proficiency in coding, analyzing, and interpreting longitudinal and multi-method language data, (2)
disseminate findings by publishing journal articles and presenting at conferences, 3) apply for a K99/R00 NIH
Pathway to Independence Award, and 4) engage in professional development activities to expand her network of
scholars and potential collaborators. The supplement will enhance diversity by fostering innovative and
culturally responsive research with Latino families and their young children."
11090162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced,
generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there
is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic
information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk
is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data
misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease
prevention opportunities, and premature death.
We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of
whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for
improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National
Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the
proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1).
Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of-
results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates
sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of
uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial
among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative
process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking
patients and for patients with ACMG/cardiogenetic risk (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new,
moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that
providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and
find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2)
integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as
interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network
information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum,
this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of
clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information,
connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to
improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of
our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice."
11089875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dopamine is produced by a small but impactful subset of neurons in the eye and brain. Because this
neuromodulator plays a critical role in a host of mental illnesses and diseases, it is vital to understand how
dopamine neuron subsets are established and maintained. Our preliminary data show that the serine-threonine
kinase LKB1 is required to restrict the number of dopaminergic neurons in the retina. In addition, we identify
new dopaminergic cell subsets and show that LKB1 is cell-intrinsically required in inhibitory interneurons to
modulate dopamine neuron diversity using molecular and neurogenetic approaches. This is a compelling result
because factors that control the number and type of neurons that produce dopamine have remained elusive.
To understand how LKB1 regulates dopamine neuron diversity, we have devised a strategy encompassing
neural identity and connectivity mapping, cell-type specific intersectional genetic and viral strategies, molecular
and biochemical studies, and functional analysis. We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we ask whether LKB1 is
spatially and temporally sufficient to instruct dopamine neuron diversity by modulating this kinase in specific
locations and at particular times. In Aim 2, we identify the mechanism through which LKB1 functions and test
the hypothesis that LKB1-AMPK signaling plays a critical role. In Aim 3, we extend our analysis to the midbrain
to test whether LKB1 is similarly required in this disease-relevant brain region to limit dopamine neuron
diversity. Identifying a kinase pathway that precisely controls dopamine neuron diversity is surprising, so
completing these aims will markedly advance our understanding of how dopaminergic neurons are endowed
with their unique properties. In addition, these results will provide new therapeutic avenues for restoring
dopamine production in the context of disease."
11088992,"The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important regulator of bone, and may contribute to bone
pathology during aging. SNS activity is also heightened in post-menopausal women, causing reduced bone
formation by osteoblasts and increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, which leads to bone loss. Large meta-
analyses, osteoporosis cohort studies (preliminary data from co-I Dr. Lary) and new prospective trials,
consistently show that β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) antagonists (i.e. β-blockers) are associated with reduced
fracture risk, increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced bone resorption. However, mechanistic
studies have focused largely on the osteoblast as the target of SNS activity. Humans and mice have three
βARs: β1AR, β2AR and β3AR. The gene encoding β2AR (Adrb2) is highly expressed in bone, which also
expresses lower levels of Adrb1, but does not express Adrb3. In mice, Adrb2 deletion in osteoblasts improves
bone formation and prevents receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast
recruitment after stimulation with a β-agonist. In humans, β1-selective β-blockers are used most often, but their
selectivity is not absolute, and many still bind β2AR. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, increases BMD in
the majority of preclinical studies. Results from our laboratory show that propranolol can limit bone resorption
directly in vitro, and in vivo without changing RANKL levels. This is in contrast to the established dogma that
osteoblast expression of β2AR regulates osteoclasts only indirectly via RANKL. Our proposed work will resolve
the outstanding mechanistic questions of how β1AR and β2AR directly influence osteoclast differentiation and
what their contributions are to age- and SNS-related bone loss. We propose a novel hypothesis that βAR
signaling in osteoclasts promotes differentiation and resorption and contributes to bone loss in vivo. To fully
characterize βAR receptor subtypes and novel signaling mechanisms in osteoclasts, and to determine the
contribution of βAR subtypes to in vivo phenotypes of bone density and bone remodeling, we propose a
combination of genetic and pharmacologic in vivo and in vitro approaches in the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: We will identify signaling mechanisms activated by specific βARs in osteoclasts. We expect
that we will identify novel and established target pathways to test in vivo for efficacy in modulating bone
resorption. Specific Aim 2: We will test the relative contributions of osteoclast β1AR and β2AR to SNS-
mediated and aging-related bone loss in vivo. The SNS has been implicated in osteoporosis, but the role of
βARs in osteoclasts has never been investigated in this condition. We hypothesize that both deletion of β1AR
and β2AR, specifically in the osteoclasts, will attenuate βAR agonist-induced and aging-related bone loss in
mice. Our work will provide a more complete understanding of the role of SNS signaling in age-related bone
loss in vivo, and will lead to studies targeting specific osteoclast βARs and downstream signaling pathways for
treatment of bone diseases."

Skin, muscle, joints, and internal organs encapsulate specialized sensory neurons that detect mechanical cues
in the form of touch and movement. The ability to perform most, if not all of the essential activities of daily living
depend on information from these somatosensory, proprioceptive, and visceral sensory neurons. Thus, a better
understanding of their function and sensitivity to mechanical and chemical stress is of vital importance for
health. This research program focuses on the skin-neuron composite tissues responsible for touch and seeks
to decipher how mechanical force is translated from the skin surface to embedded sensory neurons and

simple invertebrate (C. elegans nematodes) with high-performance tools (self-sensing cantilevers,
microfluidics-based devices) for delivering mechanical stimuli and for optically monitoring tissue deformation
and neuronal activation with electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The research team includes biologists,
engineers, and physicists and integrates experimental work with theory and simulation. In addition to seeking a
comprehensive understanding of mechanosensation by skin-neuron composites, the research program will
continue to address the outstanding question of how neurons bend without breaking. Based on preliminary
work, we also plan to leverage our knowledge of touch sensation and its molecular basis to investigate how
chemical stressors linked to diabetes (glucose) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) affect the function and
morphology of skin-neuron composites. The knowledge we seek to acquire is relevant to all animals, including
humans that rely on skin-neuron composites for touch sensation."

American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) concerns about genomics are well documented but are too often left
unaddressed. The failure to authentically engage AI/AN communities about their research priorities continues to
compromise participation of Indigenous Americans in genomics and contributes to barriers that may still be
resolved. There are substantial opportunities to change these dynamics by investing in community-led research
on ethical, legal, and social implications, but this requires a concerted effort to build the infrastructure for this
work, both in the academy and in the community. Since 2016, the Center for the Ethics of Indigenous Genomic
Research (CEIGR) has established a consortium whereby Tribal research enterprises and community-based
investigators, together with university research partners, jointly lead research that draws upon practices of
community engagement, Indigenous research methods, and successful mentoring and training practices to
continue addressing important and under-studied questions about genomic research among AI/AN people. Our
Center continues to be at the forefront of advancing community-engaged scholarship in ethical, legal, and social
implications research specifically, but also by the rapidly growing application of deliberative processes, to which
we have made substantial contributions in the way of adapting deliberative approaches to AI/AN contexts. We
are requesting a supplement as an extension with funds to finalize ongoing ELSI work of our Center addressing
the following aims:
SA1: To extend a network of AI/AN communities leading empirical ELSI research a) to advance dialogue on
genomic research, biobanking, and data sharing, b) to stimulate work in new communities nationally through a
pilot research program;
SA2: To advance thinking about current ELSI concerns in AI/AN communities a) by working with community
partners to identify unresolved ELSI questions b) by convening academic and community partners to advance
scholarship in these areas;
SA3: To train the next generation of leaders for AI/AN ELSI research a) through ongoing integration with the
University of Oklahoma’s NHGRI Diversity Action Plan R25, b) through a postdoctoral fellowship program, c)
through a program to develop and support community research leaders.
Our Center’s empirical and normative efforts, combined with our model of partnership and respect for Tribal
sovereignty, have produced resources, guidance, and a replicable approach to community engagement around
ELSI issues in AI/AN contexts that continues to serve our collective efforts and others finding value in our
approach."

The calcium (Ca2+) release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels mediate Ca2+ influx in response to Ca2+ store
depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), generating Ca2+ signals critical for many cellular processes.
Activation of CRAC channels requires the interaction of Orai and STIM proteins, which are the plasma membrane
Ca2+ channel and the Ca2+ sensor in the ER membrane; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains
incompletely understood. Mammals, including humans, have three Orai channels (Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3) and
two STIM proteins (STIM1 and STIM2), whereas Drosophila has only one set of Orai and STIM. Both loss- and
gain-of-function mutations that underlie human diseases have been identified in human Orai1 and STIM1. The
physiological roles of Orai2 and Orai3 are less well understood, but there is emerging evidence showing that
they could form heteromeric channels with Orai1, which might play roles distinct from channels formed by Orai1
and STIM1. The long-term goal of my research program is to study the molecular regulation of the CRAC channel
signaling pathway in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of the diverse functions the CRAC channels
play in different tissues and cells under physiological and pathological conditions. Initially, we are prioritizing
structure-function studies of the Drosophila Orai-STIM complex and human CRAC channels to launch my
research program. In this proposed research, we aim to address key knowledge gaps in (1) the biochemistry
and structural biology of the Orai-STIM interaction, (2) the structure and function of human CRAC channels, and
(3) regulation of CRAC channels by cellular factors and channel modulators. We will bring innovative approaches
and apply the Principal Investigator’s experience in structural biology and ion channel structure-function studies
to address these questions. Specifically, we will determine the atomic structure of the Drosophila Orai-STIM
complex as well as structures of human Orai channels and human Orai-STIM complexes. We will also develop
novel functional approaches and tools for structure-guided functional analysis of CRAC channels. In addition,
we propose to study the regulation of the channel structure and function by small molecule modulators including
lipids and pharmacological drugs. Finally, we will use functional, biochemical, and structural biology methods
(including both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy) to validate and characterize the protein-
protein interaction of Orai or STIM with a multitude of endogenous protein regulators. In the next five years, we
aim to gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the CRAC channel signaling pathway and
construct the foundation of knowledge and research tools to understand and study the broader signaling network
in which the CRAC channels reside."

Despite an increase in the diversity of the United States (US) population, women from an underrepresented
race/ethnic minority group remain underrepresented in higher education, particularly in the biomedical
research workforce. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) will be the home institution of this diversity
supplement and is a designated Minority Serving Institution (MSI) striving to reduce the barriers that minority
students such as Filipinos have when obtaining higher education. This application aims to build upon the
parent U01 grant to provide mentored research training in community-based participatory research (CBPR)
and mixed-methods research for a pre-doctoral and Filipino woman to promote diversity in the field of early
childhood obesity (ECO) prevention, particularly among food insecure populations. ECO in young children
under the age of three is a public health crisis in the US. The proposed research project builds upon the lessons
learned from the U01 parent grant creating the Early Nurturing Care for Food Security (EARN-FS) multi-level
intervention to promote maternal-child food insecurity to (a) analyze an existing secondary dataset from the
U01 parent grant to assess the risk of nutrition insecurity (i.e., increased consumption of ultra-processed food
and lack of food diversity, including vegetables and fruits) among children who reside in food insecure
households and (b) conduct a scoping review to assess whether and how interventions aiming at food and/or
nutrition security integrate responsive feeding approaches (i.e., child-caregiver interactions during feeding) as
a mechanism to prevent ECO; (c) compile programmatic and policy opportunities within individual, service,
and community-levels to integrate food security, nutrition security, and responsive feeding approaches to
prevent ECO. Through this diversity supplement, the candidate will get direct mentoring from the U01 parent
grant PI and an additional six experts at UNLV to complete five goals: 1) gain mixed-methods research and
advanced CBPR experience, 2) build scientific knowledge on ECO and health disparities, 3) expand her ECO
network and conference presentations, 4) increase her publication record by improving her writing skills, and
5) advance in a PhD in the Public Health program to obtain a terminal degree. The expected outcomes for the
candidate include publishing two peer-reviewed manuscripts as first-author, applying for an NIH F99/K00
Fellowship, expanding her scholarly network, and successfully progressing toward a PhD terminal degree."

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are heterogenous and usually present with complex etiology. Individuals
with these conditions present with cognitive impairment accompanied by lifelong deficits; yet remarkably little is
known about their neurological basis. Patients and their families are in desperate need for disease-modifying
therapies. However, to develop effective treatments, it is imperative to understand the dysregulation of molecular
and cellular processes leading to these conditions. PACS1 Syndrome is a NDD caused by a single R203W
substitution in the Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting 1 (PACS1) protein in over 200 patients. Moreover,
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the human PACS1 locus as a susceptibility gene in severe
early-onset obesity, developmental delay, and bipolar disorder, suggesting a broader role in brain development.
PACS1 encodes a multifunctional protein which canonical cytosolic function in the secretory pathway is to direct
its cargo to the trans-Golgi Network.However, PACS1 also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), shuttles
to the nucleus during S phase, and, at least in highly proliferative cancer cells, regulates chromatin stability
through interaction with HDAC proteins. Despite previous studies have revealed critical PACS1 functions, the
role of PACS1 within the nucleus as well as the effect of the PACS1 R203W variant in the nervous system yet
to be determined. Thus, we have generated patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral
organoids to investigate the transcriptome of a developing patterned, three-dimensional neural structure with the
patient genetic background. By performing single cell RNA Sequencing in organoids during early development,
we generated a preliminary dataset that strongly indicate that regulates a gene expression program important
for Glutamatergic/GABAergic fate specification. Altogether, evidence regarding nuclear localization of PACS1,
in addition to our preliminary data, suggests that PACS1 has an unexplored nuclear function, possibly by
regulating gene expression in neural progenitors. Therefore, we hypothesize that PACS1 regulates
Glutamatergic/GABAergic balance through a non-canonical nuclear function that decreases as neurogenesis
proceeds. Thus, PACS1 deficits result in a shift towards GABAergic fate, generating ectopic GABAergic neurons,
subsequent Glutamatergic/GABAergic imbalance, and finally NDD phenotypes. We will test this hypothesis by
addressing whether PACS1 possesses context specific functions that differ across neural differentiation (aim1),
and deficits in PACS1 nuclear function alter Glutamatergic/GABAergic specification balance (aim2). Results from
this proposal will greatly enhance our understanding of how the PACS1 deficits affect the developing nervous
system, by uncovering a currently disregarded nuclear function. Moreover, our work will expand our knowledge
of the molecular underpinnings and consequences of the Glutamatergic/GABAergic imbalance, that has
repeatedly been described as a precursor of many NDDs, pointing towards a possible common mechanism from
genetically heterogeneous origins and may ultimately reveal convergent therapy targets."

In patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), early life seizures and intellectual
disability are frequently accompanied by disturbances in arousal/sleep, communication/social reciprocity,
feeding and/or sensory integration. These neurobehavioral comorbidities are hypothesized to reflect a synergy
of two independent but intertwined processes: (i) an inciting lesion (genetic or structural) capable of itself altering
neurodevelopmental trajectories, and (ii) periods of frequent seizures, particularly early in life, that further
exacerbate developmental delays. In many patients, behavioral deterioration may begin prior to seizure onset
and may persist despite complete seizure control (or spontaneous remission). With whole exome sequencing,
we now recognize a rapidly expanding list of genetic DEEs, which have lent to genetically informed mouse
models that are critically poised to develop the urgently needed precision therapies that extend beyond seizure
control. Today’s models are actively revealing novel mechanistic insights into molecular and circuit-level
pathophysiology, thanks to the latest advances in genome manipulation and measurements of omics, functional
connectivity and calcium imaging, as well as continued ergonomic improvements in rodent electro-
encephalography. In contrast, there have been few technical and conceptual innovations within preclinical
assays for neurobehavioral impairment, leaving the field reliant on behavioral batteries that may be confounded
by primary disturbances in sleep/arousal, seizure recency, motor deficits and human olfactory interference. In
this application, we apply the latest advances in homecage instrumentation and automated video-tracking to
define endpoints for DEE-related neurobehavioral impairment that are derived under experimenter-free
conditions (remote behavioral telemetry). We describe a mouse model of DEE with early life seizures that
displays a robust multifaceted behavioral syndrome with core features of hyperactivity and insomnia. Using this
model system, this proposal tests the central hypothesis of genetic DEE, that the neurobehavioral consequences
of the causative genetic lesion can be dissociated from the behavioral aftereffects of recurrent early life seizures.
In Aim 1, we examine a transcription factor that is activated by seizures in the hippocampus, and which is known
to shape a range of emotional and cognitive behaviors. In Aim 2, we test the importance of early life seizures by
comparing behavioral and epileptic consequences of an early versus late genetic ablation. In Aim 3, we connect
hyperactivity and insomnia in our mutant mice to primary disruptions in 5h ultradian rhythms of activity, and test
whether pharmacological or behavioral interventions to restore ultradian rhythms exert therapeutic benefits. In
the short term, these experiments will build molecular and circuit-level insights while delivering a set of novel
neurobehavioral endpoints to facilitate drug discovery in DEE models. In the long term, this work develops the
preclinical foundation for digital neuropsychiatry, where subjective measures of behavioral wellbeing are
supplemented with continuous, in situ wearable-derived endpoints that inform clinical trials and patient care."
11089683,"PARENT GRANT ABSTRACT
Given their physiochemical properties, medications and dietary supplements often require active transport
using solute carriers (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to cross trophoblast barriers. These
same transporters are also involved in the delivery of nutrients to the fetus and one unintentional consequence
of drug therapy during pregnancy can be disruption of these shared systems. Therefore, understanding the
interplay between SLC and ABC transporters in the placental disposition of drugs and nutrients is one key step
to optimizing therapeutic interventions that improve perinatal healthcare. Our research team has championed
the advancement of novel approaches to study SLC and ABC transporters in the placenta. To expand these
efforts, we have created the Integrated Transporter Elucidation Center (InTEC) which leverages translational
research expertise across 4 academic institutions. Our central hypothesis is that novel regulation and functions
of placental transporters can be elucidated using integrated experimental, epidemiological, and modeling
approaches. Together, data and models generated can predict the placental disposition of therapeutics and
nutrients and their subsequent effects on fetal development. To accomplish this goal, we will 1) identify critical
factors that regulate placental transporters using state-of-the-art quantitative targeted absolute proteomics and
genetics in a US-based birth cohort; 2) develop a novel computational modeling framework that predicts
maternal-fetal chemical disposition according to placental transporter functions and regulation; and 3) evaluate
SLC and ABC transport in novel placenta-on-a-chip microphysiological systems. We will test nutrients,
supplements, drugs, and toxicants as substrates and inhibitors of placental transporters. InTEC will enable
rapid acceleration of placenta transporter research and establish best practices for transporter biology.
Resources and datasets will be disseminated via our CIIPro webportal created in 2017. Unique training
opportunities will be provided to early career scientists (undergraduate students, MS/MPH/PhD students, and
postdoc fellows) and clinicians (obstetrics residents and fellows) at the intersections of pharmacology,
computational biology, public health, maternal-fetal medicine, and biomedical engineering. Through innovative
research and training, InTEC will lead to novel breakthroughs in the field of placental transport and ensure a
well-trained workforce to improve maternal and perinatal health."
11089805,"Summary
No single gene exists in isolation, rather the genes in the genome make up an intricate network of interacting
components that come together in different pathways and processes to generate a phenotype. Even small
genetic changes can have far reaching consequences for an organism's phenotype, let alone when large
numbers of genes are different between strains, which is the case for those species with a pan-genome. For
instance, a strain of the bacterial pathogen S. pneumoniae on average contains ~2100 genes, while the entire
species harbors >4400 genes, which means that two random strains may differ by the presence and absence of
hundreds of different genes. Within a biological network, many genes are dispensable, which within a pangenome
are mostly those genes that are variably present. In contrast, about 10-15% of genes in a bacterial
genome are essential and keep an organism's functionality intact under any circumstance. Due to their acute
importance, essential genes are generally seen as rigid and largely immutable, consequently making them
excellent targets for, for instance, antimicrobial therapies. However, by computationally interrogating thousands
of S. pneumoniae strains, and 17 clinical strains experimentally, we have created a large dataset that shows that
not all essential genes are 'created equal'. Specifically, essential genes do not always seem to be present in all
strains, and depending on a strain's background, can sometimes be experimentally deleted. This raises the
hypothesis that the essential gene concept is much more fluid than assumed and indicates that, under the right
circumstances (i.e., genetic background), essential genes are evolvable and can switch to non-essential. In this
proposal we aim to understand why some genes are essential, while others are not, we experimentally explore
how essentiality can evolve, whether it is predictable, what the possible functional, phenotypic and/or
evolutionary consequences are, and how we can take advantage of evolvable essentiality."
11089952,"Parent Grant Abstract. The use of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased substantially since they were first
introduced in 2003. E-cig devices aerosolize e-liquids that typically consist of humectants with variable levels of
nicotine and flavoring chemicals. Although there are thousands of commercially available flavor mixtures, they
routinely overlap in individual flavor chemicals (flavorants), which are far fewer in number. Many of these
flavorants belong to common chemical classes and are generally recognized as safe for ingestion. However,
their direct and indirect cardiac effects following heating and inhalation, particularly in combination with nicotine,
remain mostly unknown. Direct exposure to nicotine alone distinctly affects the cardiac action potential waveform,
potentially contributing to the high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death among smokers. Recent
evidence also suggests that nicotine in e-cigs may similarly promote adverse cardiac outcomes. Yet, the
influence of flavorants on the cardiac effects of e-cig aerosols remains untested. In our ongoing work, we found
that exposure to nicotine-containing e-cig aerosols of various flavors acutely and differentially altered the
electrocardiogram (ECG) in mice, variably inducing QT interval prolongation, increasing heart rate, and evoking
arrhythmia. As well, two separate e-liquids with the same characterizing flavorant consistently increased
ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, we observed in cardiomyocytes that treatment with several flavorants
common to e-cigs directly altered contractility, rhythmicity, and action potential duration. Nonetheless, it remains
unknown how individual flavorants in e-cig aerosols exert direct or indirect cardiac effects in vivo. Considering
the growing popularity of e-cigarettes and the urgent need for studying the in vivo toxicological profile of
constituents in these products, we propose to test the hypothesis that e-cigarette flavorants modify the effects of
e-cig aerosol exposures on cardiac electrophysiology, leading to arrhythmias and functional remodeling of the
heart. To test this, we will systematically identify both acute and long-term effects of flavorant exposure on cardiac
electrophysiology using a combination of state-of-the-art in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches. Specifically,
we will: 1) Identify the acute effects of flavored e-cig aerosol inhalation on cardiac electrophysiology in
vivo, 2) Examine the direct impact of flavorants on cardiac electrophysiology in vitro and ex vivo, and,
3) Elucidate deleterious impacts of acute and chronic flavorant aerosol exposure on cardiac
electrophysiology, structure, and function. These studies, which are responsive to the research priorities of
the FDA/CTP, will provide new data showing how different flavor chemicals affect cardiac excitability and
potentially promote arrhythmogenesis. Such results would aid in formulating policies regulating the manufacture,
distribution and marketing of flavored e-cigarettes."
11089880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microglia are phagocytic cells that play multiple critical roles in retinal development and ocular diseases. In
parallel, they display remarkable diversity in their functional and molecular states. This suggests that a diverse
portfolio of microglial subtypes is needed in the retina, but the molecules that link microglia state to their function
remain unknown. The objective here is to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms that specify microglia state
changes in the retina. The central hypothesis is that microglia phagocytic states are specified by neurons via a
particular neuron-derived receptor-ligand pair – signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and CD47. This receptor-
ligand pair constitutes a key “don’t eat me” anti-phagocytic signal in microglia. Preliminary data surprisingly show,
however, that neuron-derived SIRPα is also crucial for regulating microglial phagocytic function and phagocytic
state. Neuronal SIRPα appears to achieve this by acting as a decoy receptor to prevent microglial CD47-SIRPα
signaling, thereby permitting microglia phagocytosis during retinal development. To understand the mechanisms
by which microglia phagocytic states are specified, and to test the neuronal SIRPα-CD47 signaling hypothesis,
three Specific Aims are proposed. First, we will determine when and how neuronal SIRPα alters microglia
diversity and plasticity. These studies will establish whether neuronal SIRPα alters microglia state by
regulating their maturation or by post-developmental changes. Second, we will define how microglia
reconcile conflicting cues that promote different physiological states. These experiments will causally
establish the relationship between ‘eat me’ and ‘don’t eat me’ cues during microglia state selection. Third, we
will Identify developmental events that depend on SIRPα-driven microglial state changes. This aim will
define functional consequences of microglial state changes driven by neuronal SIRPα. In particular, we will test
whether astrocyte death depends on neuronal SIRPα signaling, a hypothesis supported by our preliminary data.
This work will be significant because identification of a neuron-derived mechanism that dictates microglia state
plasticity is unexpected. Thus, completion of this work will change the way we understand how developmental
signals program microglia outcomes. This study will also lay the groundwork for new therapeutic options to
modify retina microglia state and function."
11089113,"Classic galactosemia (CG) is a potentially lethal genetic disease that is one of the most common metabolic disorders identified by newborn screening in the United States. Despite neonatal detection and lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, which is the current standard of care, most babies born with CG grow to experience a constellation of lifelong speech, cognitive, motor, growth, female reproductive, and/or other deficits thought to result from chronic exposure to endogenously produced galactose. The mechanisms that underlie these many long-term complications remain unknown, including which of the galactose metabolites that accumulate in the blood and tissues of patients – galactose, galactose-1P, and galactitol – may be causal of each outcome. This makes candidate interventions designed to lower one metabolite, e.g., galactose-1P or galactitol, without addressing the others, uncertain to provide broad rescue. Further, the possibility of enzyme replacement therapy is complicated by the location of the missing enzyme: galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase (GALT) is cytoplasmic but not lysosomal. Combined, these factors point to GALT gene therapy using an established viral vector as perhaps the best near-horizon approach to improved intervention. The goal of this 2-year study is to test whether AAV9-based GALT gene therapy is sufficient to prevent representative long-term complications in an existing GALT-null rat model of CG. In short, we propose preclinical studies testing the long-term biochemical and phenotypic efficacy of a single dose of scAAV9-hGALT administered intravenously to neonatal GALT-null rat pups. The results of this work will set the stage for more extensive pre-clinical studies and will help to inform future clinical trials in patients with CG."

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in a variety of fundamental physiological processes,
and dysfunction in these receptors is associated with many human disorders. The structure and function of
human nAChRs have been extensively studied; however, the combinations of different nAChR subunits
making various nAChR subtypes as well as their extracellular regions binding a structurally diverse range of
ligands, pose challenges in understanding and characterizing a specific nAChR. Fortunately, animal venom
toxins provide a unique tool to study the structure and function of nAChRs because throughout millions of
years of natural selection, animal venom toxins have been fine-tuned to endue with high selectivity towards
specific targets such as neuronal nAChRs in prey organisms in order to quickly paralyze and capture their
prey. Our goal is to identify animal toxins that selectively interact with human nAChR subtypes and decipher
the molecular mechanisms underpinning their interactions for characterizing the downstream signaling
pathways. The objective of this project is to empower and inspire rising undergraduate students through
biomedical research activities designed to engage students early in their career in human health-related
sciences. After submitting the NINDS R15 research proposal, we identified strong interactions of snake D49-1
PLA2 with nAChR β2 and β4 subunits. Therefore, in this project we will structurally map both D49-1 and human
nAChR β2 and β4 subunits to identify the segment(s) involved in the interaction. The project is designed to
prepare the next-generation of scientists to pursue human health-related research. Student, Christine Vega, a
senior undergraduate student (UG) in biology department, will be the mentee. Christine has already
participated in venom research since Spring 2022, published one peer-reviewed paper, organized several
posters, and obtained internal UTRGV funds. Christine’s career goal is to work in medical science, and she will
be involved in all aspects of this project and conduct most experiments under PI’s instruction. The expected
outcomes of this project will 1) generate a unique tool (polypeptide) for probing the stages of gating cycle of a
specific nAChRs, and 2) help Christine make the successful transition to human health-related research. The
project is impactful because: 1) it will lead Christine into medical science throughout one-year training in
biomedical research; 2) Christine will become a role model of UTRGV UGs for transitioning their discipline into
medical sciences; and 3) the project will attract more underrepresented UGs to our program for their early
career in medical disciplines."

health concern that impacts offspring. The aims of the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) parent grant are: 1) to examine behavioral, cognitive, biological, social, and emotional aspects of child development prenatally to 10 years of age; and 2) to examine the impacts of sociodemographic factors, stress and mental health, genetics, and prenatal substance exposure on child development. The proposed work will use the first distribution of HBCD data (July 2024) and existing data from the Prevention and Early Adversity Research Lab’s (PEARL) Pregnancy Project, both of which examine the impact of perinatal experiences of adversity on Black women’s postnatal outcomes and the outcomes of their young infants. For Aim 1, the Candidate will examine disparities between Black and White women with substance use histories, using HBCD data from the first data release. We hypothesize that Black women with substance use histories will experience greater prenatal levels of economic stress, food insecurity, adverse neighborhood conditions, and intimate partner violence, as well as lower levels of social support and positive experiences than their white counterparts. We further hypothesize that these adverse experiences will be related to greater postnatal levels of maternal physical health concerns, depression, and stress, and higher levels of infant prematurity and morbidity. For Aim 2, the
Candidate will examine the moderating role of discrimination in the relation between Black women’s prenatal experience of adversity and postnatal maternal functioning. Using the PEARL Pregnancy Project data set of Black women from low-income backgrounds, we hypothesize that discrimination will moderate the relation between an index of adverse experiences during pregnancy (i.e., demographic risks including household size, immigration status, marital status, education level, receipt of Public Assistance; maternal exposure to trauma; and environmental chaos) and maternal health outcomes (i.e., physical health, depression). For the HBCD dataset, we hypothesize that discrimination will moderate the link between adverse experiences during pregnancy (i.e., economic stress, food insecurity, neighborhood safety, intimate partner violence, social support, positive experiences) and maternal functioning (i.e., physical health, depression, stress). The Candidate’s work will provide a better understanding of Black/White racial disparities with respect to the experiences and outcomes of women with substance use histories, as well as the unique experiences of Black women that lead to adverse maternal and infant outcomes. This training project will help accelerate the Candidate’s transition to doctoral studies and her research career trajectory.

is the world’s heaviest, women living with HIV (WWH) continue to also bear a heavy burden of
cervical cancer (CC). WWH still present with cervical cancer at advanced stage and little is known
about their treatment outcomes and the impact of a cancer diagnosis on HIV care and vice versa
as well as barriers to screening, early detection and diagnosis of cervical precancer and cancer.
Findings from this study will provide actionable information about the impact of HIV on CC as well
as the barriers to and facilitators of cervical-related care for WWH. This information has the
potential to inform CC prevention and treatment policy and practice in Rwanda and elsewhere in
SSA, in turn impacting the morbidity and mortality of CC in this high-risk population. This mentored

severe the patient experiences pain, less so modulating whether they experience pain in the first
place. This same strategy could in principle be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders that
have a strong affective component. In particular opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause
of morbidity and mortality worldwide with a strong affective component. Traditional treatments like
buprenorphine or methadone often fail to address the mood disturbances associated with OUD,
leading to high relapse rates. Specifically, the withdrawal/abstinence period of OUD is associated
with a negative affective state, dubbed ‘hyperkatifeia,’ that predisposes to relapse later. Like in
the chronic pain application, ketamine uncaging targeted to a critical brain region could treat the
affective component of substance use disorders, including OUD, to break the cycle of binge,
withdrawal, and relapse that defines the disorder.
In this training period, the candidate will explore the use of ultrasonic ketamine uncaging to
modulate affective behaviors in rodent models of chronic pain as well as of OUD. This activity will
better define the protocols for ultrasonic ketamine uncaging to be used in the clinical trial phase
of the parent award, guide interpretation of the clinical and physiologic data in that clinical trial
phase, and generate data to suggest further applications of ketamine uncaging, and the use of
ultrasonic uncaging more broadly to treat affective disorders and the affective component of
neuropsychiatric disease. During the preclinical phase of the parent award, the candidate will gain
training in in vivo application of therapeutic ultrasound, neurobehavioral assay development and
implementation, quantitative video behavioral analysis, functional ultrasound imaging, and
neuroscientific data analysis. For the clinical phase of the parent award it is anticipated that the
candidate will stay with the investigatory group, with or without a successful extension of this
funding, to gain training in the clinical use of therapeutic ultrasound and neuropsychological trial
implementation."

Cellular mechanisms mediating the transition from a state of general anesthesia to an awake state are not
understood. Patients emerge from anesthesia passively without the use of mechanistically targeted
interventions, creating an unpredictable clinical outcome marked by behavioral phenomena like emergence
agitation and delirium. Many anesthetics act either directly or indirectly to change excitatory/inhibitory balance
in the brain, highlighting the importance of understanding inhibitory networks in emergence. My research
program focuses on the effects of general anesthesia on inhibitory plasticity during the transition from
anesthetized to awake state in mice. My prior work examines neuroligin-2, a central organizer of the inhibitory
synapse, using cell-type and circuit specific manipulations. Neuroligin-2 is a cell adhesion protein that acts as a
scaffold to regulate general inhibitory synaptic function and is recently implicated as an independent regulator
of intracellular signaling and disease. I demonstrated that neuroligin-2 manipulation modulates agitation and
related behaviors in mouse models. My established expertise in stress-induced inhibitory synaptic plasticity
provides a strong foundation for the following three complementary research areas investigating general
anesthesia emergence. (1) Inhibitory cell plasticity in emergence from anesthesia: Research area 1 will
focus on effects of general anesthesia emergence on inhibitory cell plasticity, starting with an investigation of
key inhibitory postsynaptic genes, like neuroligin-2, using targeted knockdown and electrophysiology studies.
Single cell sequencing transcriptomic investigations will characterize all cell types and synaptic constituents
modified by emergence. (2) Brain-wide cell type-specific circuit activity in emergence: Research area 2
will investigate whole brain circuit changes induced by general anesthesia emergence using activity mapping
and light sheet microscopy at single cell resolution, along with recordings of neuronal activity using genetically
encoded optical sensors expressed in anesthesia-regulated circuits. (3) Preclinical models for emergence
delirium across the lifespan: Research area 3 will develop and validate preclinical rodent models of
emergence delirium using machine learning approaches, in order to study vulnerability to anesthesia-induced
delirium across the lifespan. Together, these three projects form an overarching research program to
understand mechanisms of emergence from the inhibitory cellular to circuit to behavioral levels of analysis,
providing a holistic view of emergence. We must understand the mechanisms of anesthetic emergence across
all levels in order to design interventions to bring about safer and predictable emergence."

provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."
11090668,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the U.S., 8.37 million adults over age 65 will experience a hospital stay during the next year, which often
has serious and long-lasting consequences including profound deterioration in physical function. Following a
hospital stay, around 1.35 million patients with deconditioning require rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility
(SNF) each year to address the deleterious musculoskeletal and functional deficits from deconditioning.
Unfortunately, current rehabilitation paradigms in SNFs do not adequately restore physical function, which
directly contributes to poor community discharge rates. Strikingly, only 52% of all patients admitted to SNFs
are discharged to a community setting (e.g., home), which suggests a paradigm shift is required to optimize
rehabilitation within SNFs. Currently, usual care rehabilitation in SNFs consists of low-intensity rehabilitation
interventions, which are physiologically inadequate to induce meaningful changes in skeletal muscle strength
and physical function. To address these pitfalls, a high-intensity resistance rehabilitation paradigm has been
shown to improve outcomes including better physical function, increased community discharge rates, and
cost-effective reductions in length of stay. The proposed pragmatic study seeks to apply this rehabilitation
paradigm to multiple SNFs to further evaluate the effectiveness of high-intensity resistance rehabilitation (Aim
1), while evaluating processes, mechanisms, and determinants of successful implementation (Aim 2). We
propose a cluster randomized pragmatic trial design in which a high-intensity intervention (15 SNFs) will be
compared to usual care (15 SNFs). Effectiveness in terms of physical function will be determined via change
in patient gait speed (primary outcome) from admission to discharge. Implementation strategies will be
evaluated by reach (proportion of patients treated with the intervention), adoption (proportion of therapists
appropriately adopting the intervention), implementation (fidelity assessments), and maintenance (long-term
fidelity assessments) of the intervention. This study will provide the first large-scale evaluation of high-
intensity rehabilitation for patients admitted to SNFs following hospitalization. Additionally, through systematic
comparison and in-depth analysis of implementation across a variety of SNFs, this study will provide critical
insight regarding barriers and facilitators of implementation. Overall findings from this study have the potential
to 1) shift SNF rehabilitation care paradigms; 2) optimize patient outcomes and independence and 3) critically
inform future work aimed at wide-scale implementation of high-intensity rehabilitation across post-acute
settings."
11090933,"Defects in laterality are observed in more than 1 in 8000 live births and have significant clinical implications.
The embryonic heart starts as a straight cardiac tube along the midline of the embryo, which is subsequently
transformed into a c-shaped heart loop reliably toward the right side of the body. This cardiac c-looping is
considered as the earliest evident event of left-right (LR) asymmetry breaking (also called chirality or
handedness) of a human organ. The inversed lateralization of cardiac looping often leads to severe clinical
outcomes, including dextrocardia, septum defects, double outlet right ventricle, and even death of fetuses and
infants. Accumulating evidence suggests that asymmetric cardiac looping derives from an unknown tissue-
intrinsic mechanism. Recently, we have recapitulated chiral morphogenesis on micropatterned surfaces and in
3D hydrogels and demonstrated that cardiac cells have a definite chirality before asymmetric looping. Protein
kinase C (PKC) activators can reverse both cell chirality and cardiac c looping. Our rationale is that novel cell
chirality based high-throughput platforms, together with a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of
cell chirality, can facilitate the LR symmetry research. We propose to use a combination of micro-fabrication,
hydrogel technology, live-cell imaging, molecular assays, traction force microscopy, high-throughput screening,
ex vivo culture, and genetic mouse models as tools to elucidate the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms.
Our objectives are to determine biomolecular and biomechanical mechanisms of PKC regulated cell chirality
and asymmetric looping and to identify cytoskeletal mechanisms of cell chirality during cardiac c-looping.
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Identify components and signaling pathways that regulate cardiac chirality with high-
throughput screening and validate with ex ovo embryo culture. We will screen inhibitors/activators of PKC
isoforms, their downstream effectors, possible substrates, and a small-molecule kinase library, determine
mechanisms of action, and validate the findings with the whole-embryo ex ovo culture.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the biomechanical role of cell chirality in multicellular morphogenesis. We
will examine whether chiral mechanical forces are sufficient to induce cardiac c-looping using traction force
microscopy and whether the cells on ventral myocardium exhibit intrinsic chiral biases.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine cytoskeletal mechanisms in cardiac cell chirality during c-looping. We will
analyze the chirality of actin dynamics of cardiac cells, observe its change under drugs of interest, and confirm
the findings with ex ovo whole-embryo culture and genetic mouse models.
If the project is successful, we will be able to establish a set of novel high-throughput platforms for studying the
biophysics of asymmetric cardiac looping by measuring cell chirality, and further our understanding of
congenital heart disease. Also, this proposed research is transformative, and potentially open a new field of
research: cell chirality, a fundamental cellular property defining symmetry breaking in tissue development."
11090277,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal is a request to purchase and install collapsible pen housing for groups of nonhuman primates that
support the NIH priorities for HIV-related research. HIV-related research often involves long term housing of
macaques that can last for up to years. Currently these animals are housed in pairs in socialization cages. To
improve socialization opportunities, provide a more complex housing environment, and increase enrichment we
aim to institute group housing in pens for animals on HIV/AIDS projects. Housing these animals in pens rather
than individual cages improves overall animal welfare in two ways: Socialization in groups provides significantly
improved psychological well-being when compared to single housing or even pair housing, and the increased
total space (horizontal and vertical) in pens compared to cages improves both physical and psychological well-
being.
One challenge to housing research animals in pens is the need to access animals for research procedures or
sampling. The proposed pens are designed to attach to one-over-one caging enclosures on both sides. Animals
will be trained to enter these enclosures voluntarily. Once within the enclosures, noninvasive samples may be
obtained voluntarily, or animals may be sedated for other procedures as required."

Background: Escalating rates of childhood obesity have become a global health crisis, with significant impacts
on long-term health. Approximately 19.2% of children in the United States are now affected by obesity.
Returning genetic risk scores for obesity is an innovative approach to obesity intervention that may help
improve prevention and management. This project examines the effects of communicating genetic risk
information to parents regarding childhood obesity and its potential psychosocial impact, perceived value, and
expected response to relevant recommendations.
Objectives: The parent electronic medical records and genomics (eMERGE) program is returning to each of
>4000 pediatric participants a Genomic Informed Risk Assessment (GIRAs) for obesity plus three other
conditions (asthma, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes). Approximately 140 children will receive a GIRA
indicating high risk for obesity. The primary objective of this supplement is to evaluate how the disclosure of
genetic risk information impacts parents' perceptions, psychological responses, and behavioral intentions
concerning management of their children's weight.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore parental responses to the genetic risk
information. Interviewees are parents or guardians of three sub-cohorts: 1) obese child (per electronic health
record (EHR)) with HR obesity [N=15], 2) non-obese child (per EHR) with a HR obesity GIRA [N=15], and 3)
obese child (per parent report and EHR) whose GIRA does not indicate HR for obesity [N=30]. Themes related
to understanding the genetic information, psychosocial impacts, and behavioral intentions will be identified
through thematic analysis.
Expected Results: We anticipate identifying a spectrum of parental responses, from motivated health behavior
changes to feelings of anxiety and guilt about their child's predisposition to obesity. The study will provide
insights into the effectiveness of genetic information in fostering behavior change and the psychological impact
of such disclosures on parents.
Conclusion: This research will enhance our understanding of the role of genetic risk information in managing
childhood obesity. It will contribute to the development of guidelines and interventions that effectively use
genetic information to support health-promoting behaviors, while also considering relevant ethical implications.
Relevance: The findings from this study will inform best practices in genetic counseling and pediatric
healthcare, specifically addressing the ethical, psychological, and practical considerations of disclosing genetic
risks to parents. This is essential for developing interventions that not only prevent obesity but also minimize
potential psychological distress associated with genetic risk communication."
11090831,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the bacterium Escherichia coli, ~40% of transcription termination is factor-dependent termination, mediated
by the ATP-dependent RNA translocase Rho, and ~60% of transcription termination is intrinsic termination,
mediated by sequences at which transcription yields an RNA hairpin followed by an RNA U-tract.
In the archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, most transcription termination is factor-dependent termination,
mediated by the endoribonuclease and processive exoribonuclease aCPSF1 (archaeal cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor 1).
Bacterial and archaeal transcription initiation and transcription elongation and their regulation are well
understood, but bacterial and archaeal transcription termination and its regulation are poorly understood.
Structures of a minimal functional factor-dependent pre-termination complex, a minimal functional intrinsic
pre-termination complex, and a post-termination complex have become available only very recently, and no
structural information whatsoever is available for steps in termination between formation of a pre-termination
complex and formation of a post-termination complex.
We propose to determine structures of intact, complete functional bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent
pre-termination complexes, to determine structures of intact, complete functional bacterial intrinsic
pre-termination complexes, and, most important, to obtain structural and functional information for
intermediates in termination between formation of a pre-termination complex and formation of a
post-termination complex. Our results will test directly the ""RNAP hypertranslocation,"" ""RNA extraction,"" and
""allosteric"" hypotheses for termination, will distinguish directly between ""external force"" and ""invasion"" models
for termination, and will define, comprehensively, the protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-protein
interactions in factor-dependent termination, intrinsic termination, and Q-dependent antitermination.
The proposed work will use cryo-EM, single-molecule picometer-resolution nanopore tweezers (SPRNT), and
deep sequencing to address three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of factor-dependent transcription termination
Aim 2: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of intrinsic transcription termination
Aim 3: Define the structural and mechanistic basis of Q-dependent transcription antitermination
The proposed work will contribute directly to understanding bacterial and archaeal transcription and
transcriptional regulation. Because bacterial RNAP and, especially, archaeal RNAP show sequence, structural,
and mechanistic similarities to eukaryotic RNAP, the results also will contribute to understanding eukaryotic
transcription and transcriptional regulation."

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes are neurodegenerative diseases in which
symptoms include movement disorder, often autonomic dysfunction, and sometimes dementia. Due to high
symptom overlap, patients with these diseases often are misdiagnosed leading to high levels of anxiety and
depression, and to difficulty in developing therapeutic intervention. The parent grant examines candidate
biomarkers for these diseases in serum and CNS-originating extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the
serum. However, these candidates are based on current knowledge whereas other, perhaps superior
biomarkers may not yet have been discovered. Unbiased proteomics-based biomarker discovery is a
promising approach but is practically challenging in CNS-originating EVs. Therefore, we will use EVs isolated
from the culture media of iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same parkinsonian diseases, and
healthy controls. These studies may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers that will further aid the diagnosis,
monitoring, prognosis, and treatment of parkinsonian diseases. The supplement will support a talented
graduate student co-mentored by the PI and a proteomics expert. The student already has generated
preliminary data demonstrating that the experiments are feasible and promising. The co-mentoring, formal
classes, interaction with collaborators, and multiple professional-development opportunities will help preparing
the student for a successful and productive career as a scientific researcher."

Transgender men who have sex with men (trans MSM) are at-risk of HIV acquisition in the US and require
gender-affirming culturally responsive biobehavioral HIV prevention strategies. The goal of the proposed study
is to assess the ability of digitally delivered peer-based strategies to improve PrEP uptake in PrEP-indicated
HIV-negative adult trans MSM (defined behaviorally as sex with a person who has a penis). This study
proposes a digital open-label randomized 2x2 factorial trial (1:1:1:1 randomization) of peer-delivered HIV
prevention strategies designed to increase PrEP uptake in trans MSM residing in high HIV incidence
geographic hotspots in the Eastern and Southern US. The specific aims are to: (1) Compare the efficacy of
individual (PrEP4T: one-on-one peer navigation) and group-based (LifeSkills for Men: small group-based
behavioral intervention) peer-delivered HIV prevention strategies implemented over 6 mo to increase PrEP
uptake (primary outcome) in 300 PrEP-indicated HIV-negative adult trans MSM; (2) Examine mechanisms by
which peer-delivered interventions impact PrEP uptake focusing on healthcare empowerment, trans
community support, and information, motivation, and behavioral skills; and (3) Explore PrEP decision-making
and intervention experiences qualitatively. Biobehavioral assessments will be conducted every 3 mo for 21 mo
with self-administered surveys; remote HIV self-testing (4th gen tests) and biologic measures of PrEP via
emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP) and tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) using dried blood spots (DBS) to
evaluate uptake of approved TFV-based PrEP regimens in this population; and STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia,
syphilis) via electronic medical record (EMR) releases. The team will use a participatory population perspective
to work “with” not “on” trans MSM ensuring meaningful participation of trans MSM. The proposed study is
significant by addressing HIV prevention in an underserved NIH health disparities population and will fill critical
gaps in biobehavioral HIV prevention and peer-engaged approaches. The study is aligned with US national
priorities to implement integrated strategies for HIV prevention in at-risk populations in high HIV incidence
geographic hotspots and will advance the 2021-2025 National Strategic Plan to End the HIV epidemic."
11091113,"ABSTRACT
Autoimmune diseases affect 1 in 10 people. Commonly, patients needlessly suffer for years due to delays
in diagnosis and referral delays to specialists. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a classic example due to its
nonspecific symptoms and potential to mimic other diseases. It affects women 9 to 1 with average
diagnostic delays of over 5 years, increasing the chances of life-limiting end-organ damage. A diagnosis
typically requires an experienced rheumatologist to carefully consider and integrate various data sources.
This need for a specialist creates health equity concerns which are further compounded by the
disproportionately higher prevalence of lupus in Black and Hispanic women.
This project will develop a unified multimodal representation learning technology that will allow 1) using
many different datatypes (e.g., electronic health records, omics-data, full-body imaging, clinical
measures, tabular data, and data from activity monitors); 2) adding data sources to the multimodal model
as needed; 3) supporting missing modalities by cross-modal generative learning; 4) providing inherent
end-to-end interpretable results; and 5) patient-specific disease predictions and patient-personalized
multimodal information acquisition plans. The project will use a holistic design approach where a model
will account for population imbalances during training and model design and will incorporate debiasing
approaches directly into the modeling.
Our approaches will be generally applicable to multimodal learning. They target significantly earlier
diagnoses for autoimmune diseases, strategies to recommend suitable additional diagnostic tests, and the
ability to identify patients at greatest risk for the worst outcomes for which more aggressive treatments
may be recommended."
11088520,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The timely and precise progression of a genetic program along a cascade of regulatory steps is critical to
execute a developmental process. However, gene expression is a highly stochastic process due to inevitable
fluctuations in the kinetics of complex biochemical reactions; this randomness leads to substantial cell-to-cell
variability (gene expression noise). The resulting phenotypic fluctuations can only be detected and quantified at
the single cell level within isogenic populations. One of the most intriguing questions in science is how
developmental pattern formation is executed so precisely and reproducibly despite these unavoidable
fluctuations in gene expression. Presumably, mechanisms that buffer stochastic gene expression must exist.
 Vertebrate somitogenesis provides a paradigm system for studying this question. Somite segments (the
embryonic precursors of vertebrae) are produced sequentially and periodically from the presomitic mesoderm
(PSM) at the tail end of the embryo. The period of somite segmentation is controlled by the segmentation
clock. The segmentation clock exhibits oscillatory expression of Hes/her-family “clock” genes due to an
autoinhibitory intracellular negative feedback loop. Oscillating Delta ligands activate Notch receptors in
neighboring cells and establish an intercellular positive feedback loop that synchronizes oscillation phases
among neighboring cells. Disruption of these synchronized oscillations results in birth defects. The time-course
of somite segmentation and epithelization occur along the posteroanterior direction in the PSM. The
coordinated expression of multiple genes along the PSM are controlled by three interconnected signaling
gradients (Fgf, Wnt and retinoic acid). Somitogenesis is both precise – embryos of a given species develop
certain number of segments with species-specific rhythmicity – and versatile –total number of segments and
their periodicity vary widely among species. Somitogenesis is also robust as embryos form segments with a
certain size distribution, scaling the sizes of segments with body size, even when total cell numbers, cell sizes
or growth rates are altered experimentally. These characteristics indicate that the expression noise within the
oscillating segmentation network is efficiently buffered.
 Our overarching goal is to decipher how expression noise in gene regulatory networks is buffered during
developmental pattern formation. We aspire to reach a mechanistic understanding of this buffering by
combining mathematical/computational/statistical modeling with different genetic and chemical perturbations to
modify dosage of multiple genes or modulate signal feedback strength."
11088543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is a fundamental gap in our ability to monitor antimicrobial use (AMU) at the individual animal
level in dairy cattle nationally. The continued existence of this gap hinders the development of data-driven
antimicrobial stewardship and understanding of the relationships between AMU in dairy cattle and antimicrobial
resistance—one of the most pressing One Health challenges we face today. AMU monitoring requires an
approach to collecting and quantifying data on AMU. Also, most herds must participate in data sharing for an
AMU monitoring system to succeed. However, farmers lack the incentive to participate in monitoring, the labor
involved in data collection is prohibitive for already busy farmers, and they have concerns about the loss of
privacy and business advantage through sharing their AMU data via a monitoring system. These major
bottlenecks are impeding the establishment of AMU monitoring in dairy cattle in the US. Thus, there is an
urgent need for a system approach to animal-level AMU monitoring in dairy cattle that provides private value to
the participating farmer, automates laborious data collection tasks, protects farmers’ privacy, and advances
One Health goals. Our long-term goal is to deploy a functional and efficient system for monitoring AMU in food
animals. Thus, the overall objective of this application is to develop a system for monitoring AMU in dairy cattle
that provides farmers with actionable clinical and business insights, automates data collection, and protects
their proprietary information. The rationale that underlines the proposed research is that such an AMU
monitoring system will incentivize dairy farmer participation and enable One Health to benefit from the national-
level AMU monitoring. This objective will be achieved by systematically building the three pillars of an effective
AMU monitoring system: Data, Models, and People. Specifically, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1)
Collect detailed, complete, and validated multi-year animal-level AMU data on dairy farms; (2) Develop a
system approach to animal-level AMU monitoring in dairy cattle; and (3) Evaluate perceptions of farmers and
veterinarians about AMU monitoring in dairy cattle. The AMU monitoring system developed in Aim 2 will have
four innovative elements: (i) instant private clinical/business insights for the farmer to incentivize their
participation in data collection and sharing, (ii) standardization and automation to ease the data collection
burden on farmers, (iii) augmentation with synthetic data, and (iv) privatization techniques that give the farmer
the governance over their AMU data while allowing peer learning, further incentivizing participation in AMU
monitoring. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to enable scaling up monitoring
animal-level AMU on dairy farms in the US with a system approach and technology that are tailored to the dairy
farming industry and have translational value to other food animal sectors. In addition to technological
innovations, the project will generate multi-year AMU data in dairy cattle and data about farmers' perceptions of
AMU monitoring, which will be instrumental in developing a use-inspired AMU monitoring system."
11090588,"Dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Our
studies discovered that plasma hypercholesterolemia results in suppression of endothelial inwardly-
rectifying K+ (Kir) channels and that Kir channels play a major role in endothelial response to flow. Our long
term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for cholesterol-induced regulation of endothelial ion
channels and determine the impact of cholesterol-induced suppression of Kir on vascular function and
atherosclerosis development. During the previous funding period of this grant, we discovered a new mode
of cholesterol-Kir2 interactions via multiple dynamic contacts, provided direct evidence that Kir2.1 plays a
crucial role in flow-induced vasodilation and NO release, and showed that hypercholesterolemia-induced
impairment of flow-induced vasodilation can be attributed to Kir2.1 suppression. In the current proposal, we
extend these studies to address three new goals: In Aim 1, we address the fundamental question of how
cholesterol binding to the specific binding sites that we have already identified translates into the inhibition
of channel gating. Specifically, we address a novel hypothesis based on our computational studies
predicting that cholesterol binding uncouples specific residues within the channels, crucial for the gating
process. This hypothesis will be addressed using a combination of multi-scale Molecular Dynamics
simulations, a state-of-the-art computational approach, followed by site-directed mutagenesis, functional
analysis of the channel function by high throughput electrophysiology, and biochemical and neutron
scattering studies to evaluate direct cholesterol interactions with Kir2 channels. In Aim 2, we will extend our
studies to determine the role of cholesterol suppression of Kir2.1 in two major endothelial flow responses: 1)
activation of PECAM1/Src/VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt signaling axis and 2) cytoskeleton remodeling. This aim is
based on our RNA sequencing analysis that revealed a major role of Kir2.1 in flow-sensitive gene
expression including the expression of PECAM1/VEGFR2 mechanosensor complex. Specifically, we will
test the hypothesis that suppression of endothelial Kir channels by hypercholesterolemic conditions impairs
flow-induced activation of VEGFR2 and activation of a small GTPase, RhoA, and alters flow-induced
cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the role of endothelial Kir2.1 in lesion formation
of dyslipidemic mice. We have already established that the global deficiency of Kir2.1 exaggerates lesion
formation in dyslipidemic ApoE-/- mice. In the proposed study, we will determine if the effect is specific for
endothelial Kir2.1. Furthermore, we will also employ a new model of Kir2.1 rescue, a transgenic CRISPR
mouse that expresses a cholesterol-insensitive Kir2.1 mutant. We believe that taken together, these studies
will make a significant contribution to the understanding of cholesterol regulation of ion channels,
dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, and the mechanisms of lesion formation."

Antimicrobial use (AMU) is the primary selective force behind the emergence of resistant bacteria. Improving
antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in human and animal health is essential for maintaining the effectiveness of
available antimicrobials and is an essential component of efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. Most AMU
data that are being collected globally are in the form of antimicrobial sales volumes; most countries do not
currently have systems in place to collect nationally representative AMU datasets on-farm. Without any
knowledge of the incidence of disease in specific herds or flocks nor the intended use of the antimicrobials
included in the sales data, it is not clear how national antimicrobial sales data alone are useful in assisting with
AMS activities. Systems must be developed for collecting on-farm AMU data. These data should include the
principal indications for use and details about administration (dose, route, duration, age of animals) of specific
antimicrobial compounds, and ideally, would also collect information on therapeutic outcomes. This proposed
project will focus on expanding an ongoing, nationally representative, and sustainable system for collecting on-
farm quantitative AMU data in the broiler chicken, turkey, and table egg industries of the U.S. This program
functions as a public-private partnership and currently collects data from approximately 85% of annual broiler
production, 70% of annual turkey production, and 50% of table egg production in the U.S. This proposed
project will expand the current effort but also includes several additional objectives. First, a multi-disciplinary
Expert Working Group will continue to evaluate metrics for analyzing, reporting and summarizing the data. This
working group will also explore several key data gaps that we have identified during our 10-year collection of
U.S. poultry data. These data gaps include 1) methods for estimating the background incidence of key
bacterial diseases in the U.S. poultry industry, 2) methods for evaluating health and production outcomes
following antimicrobial therapy in poultry, 3) approaches for standardizing the disease definitions recorded by
veterinarians, and 4) methods for linking antimicrobial prescriptions given to the same flock so that the
regimens can be linked. This project addresses all of the key characteristics, as identified by FDA-CVM in the
RFA, that are needed in a sustainable and representative system for collecting on-farm antimicrobial use data.

11088644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV-1 does not persistently infect macaques due to restriction by several species-specific host factors
necessitating the use of chimeric SIV/HIV-1 viruses (SHIVs) as surrogates to model HIV-1 infection in macaques.
Infection of macaques with SHIVs is the most preferred model system for vaccine and prevention studies
because SHIVs encode HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) – the sole target of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies.
Because the goal of vaccines is to prevent new infection, SHIVs based on circulating, transmitted forms of Env
variants are desired as challenge viruses. Existing SHIV/macaque models typically employ SHIVs that encode
HIV-1 Env from laboratory-adapted viruses, whose neutralization sensitivities differ from circulating Env variants.
This significantly limits the ability of the existing SHIV/macaque models to predict efficacious intervention(s) in
humans. Development of SHIVs encoding circulating Env variants has been extremely challenging, mainly
because such SHIVs replicate poorly in macaques, if at all. To increase their replication and pathogenicity, SHIVs
require extensive adaptation in vivo via serial passage in macaques. The process of serial macaque passage
results in accumulation of adaptive mutations in Env that facilitates robust replication.
 Serial passage is typically performed within the first two weeks of infection, a time during which macaques
mount a robust type-I interferon (IFN) response to infection. The host IFN response presents an early barrier
against infection because production of IFNs upregulates expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs),
which results in induction of an ‘antiviral state’. Proteins encoded by certain ISGs, referred to as restriction
factors, act as potent barriers against cross-species lentiviral transmission. Thus, macaque restriction factors
have the potential to block SHIV infection as they can antagonize HIV-1 Env. We recently identified macaque
interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) as ISGs that selectively restrict replication of SHIVs
encoding circulating HIV-1 Env variants.
 Our preliminary results suggest that unpassaged SHIV is potently inhibited by IFN in macaque lymphocytes.
In contrast, serial passaged SHIVs are resistant to IFN. We found that the loss to two N-linked glycans in Env
upon serial passage is sufficient to increase replication and confer resistance to IFN. This research proposal will:
1) characterize the adaptive changes in Env of serial passaged SHIVs that increase replication and IFN
resistance; 2) determine the role of N-linked Env glycans in SHIV infection of primary macaque immune cell
subsets ex vivo, and mucosal transmission and pathogenicity of SHIVs in vivo; and 3) evaluate the contribution
of five macaque IFITM homologs, which are upregulated by IFN, in restriction of unpassaged, IFN-sensitive
SHIVs. Upon completion, this study will provide mechanistic insights at the host-viral interface that drive
selection, adaptation, and pathogenicity of SHIVs in macaques."
11088667,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Parkinson’s disease (PD) presents complex challenges, including
dysphagia, which affects 33-80% of patients and significantly impacts their quality of life.
Dysphagia in PD is strongly linked with disease severity and can lead to severe health issues,
such as malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia—a common cause of death. Additionally, up to
70% of PD patients suffer from sialorrhea, a condition exacerbated by reduced natural
swallowing frequency which further complicates dysphagia by causing drooling due to saliva
accumulation. Current management primarily involves rehabilitation with speech-language
pathologists, yet there remains a substantial unmet need for technologies that can continuously
and accurately monitor dysphagia and related symptoms in real-life settings. Existing diagnostic
tools like FEES and VFS show poor correlation with patient-reported outcomes, underlining the
necessity for objective measurement tools in clinical trials and therapeutic management. Sibel
Health has developed the ADAM sensor, a novel wireless device designed to measure both
swallowing and respiratory patterns using advanced sensor technology and machine learning
algorithms. This device, placed at the suprasternal notch, has shown promise in initial studies
with PD patients, demonstrating the ability to effectively monitor dysphagia and respiratory
coordination. Our proposed project aims to extend this technology to support drug development
by providing reliable, sensitive, and objective measurements of swallowing behavior. The
comprehensive validation of the ADAM sensor will involve technical verifications such as
biocompatibility and software testing, followed by clinical validations with Parkinson's patients at
Northwestern University. These studies will refine the sensor's algorithms to accurately
distinguish swallowing from other motor activities and validate it against established clinical
standards. The broader goal of this initiative is to enhance therapeutic strategies for PD and
potentially other neurological, muscular, and oncological conditions associated with dysphagia.
By achieving this, we aim to facilitate the development of more effective treatments that can
significantly improve patient outcomes. This proposal is aligned with the FDA's emphasis on
innovative device development for managing complex diseases like Parkinson’s."
11099506,"ABSTRACT
In this proposal we apply somatic cell gene editing strategies to enhance pancreatic beta cell replacement
therapies for type 1 diabetes (T1D). We have formed a team that combines expertise in beta cell biology,
synthetic and systems biology, and islet transplant immunology to address key impediments for efficient
immunosuppression-free transplantation of pancreatic islets. We propose two orthogonal yet complementary
aims to address two critical challenges in islet transplantation - islet survival and immune rejection. Most of the
transplanted islets die before revascularization can occur, which limits the efficacy of the therapy. We have
shown hypoxia and nutrient deprivation during ischemia independently and synergistically kill transplanted islet
cells. Aim 1 of this proposal addresses the hypothesis that peri-transplant death can be alleviated by deleting
negative regulators of beta cell survival or by over-expression of positive regulators. We will take both targeted
and unbiased approaches to test candidate regulators and to identify novel regulators of human islet survival.
Our team has already performed high-throughput screens using RNAi in primary human islets using in vivo
transplant survival as a readout. We are ready to apply our expertise to CRISPRi and cDNA screens of primary
human islets. Previous clinical islet transplant experiences show that stronger immunosuppression is associated
with higher rate of insulin independence after islet transplantation. The immune system deploys multiple
redundant mechanisms to eliminate transplanted foreign tissue. This, combined with the fragility of the
transplanted islets and heightened immune functions in T1D recipients, forms a formidable immunological barrier
to beta cell replacement therapy. We hypothesize that multipronged approach of minimizing islet cell
immunogenicity, neutralizing inflammation in the graft, and blocking cellular infiltrate will shield the islets from
immune rejection without the need for systemic immunosuppression. In Aim2, we will test this hypothesis by
gene edit human islets to ablate the expression of polymorphic human leukocyte antigens. We will test dominant
strategies that block innate inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1 and type 1 and type 2 interferons. We will also
target adaptive immune cells by blocking their trafficking, activation and effector function. Successful
confirmation of our hypotheses will provide proof-of-principle data to support efforts of clinical translation as next
steps. We envision that these strategies may be applied to primary human islets, stem cell-derived beta cells,
and even xenogeneic islets. While these CRISPR modalities are powerful research tools for screens and proof-
of-concept experiments in the laboratory, base editing and/or prime editing may be preferred embodiments in
the clinical setting. Our end goal is to generate game-changing strategies to address these key impediments,
with a vision towards clinical translation."
11096841,"Targeting neutrophils to harness myeloid responses for wound healing
Chronic wounds represent a significant health problem in the United States. Delayed or non-resolving
inflammation is a hallmark of the chronic wound and is sustained by myeloid cell accumulation and upregulated
myelopoiesis. Metabolic conditions such as obesity contribute to this growing problem and influence myeloid
response to wounds. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that obesity and diabetes dysregulate myeloid
responses and thereby impairs wound healing. Our preliminary study using mouse models suggests a
mechanistic link of neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow with myelopoiesis. We propose a translational study
involving both mouse models and human specimens with three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanism by which neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow regulates myelopoiesis, with the hypothesis that
neutrophils release extracellular vesicles that regulate myelopoiesis during their clearance. In Aim 2, we will
determine the mechanism of inhibited neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow in chronic wounds and obesity,
with the hypothesis that chronic wounds and obesity increase glutamine utilization in neutrophils and inhibit their
clearance in the bone marrow. In Aim 3, we will bioengineer a nano-drug that target neutrophils and modify
myeloid response. To achieve this, we will utilize a well-defined versatile telodendrimer to selectively deliver
glutaminase inhibitor to neutrophils and will test the nano-drug in the preclinical mouse model of impaired wound
healing in obesity. The proposed experiments will improve knowledge of myeloid responses during wound
healing. The impact of these studies lies in the potential for translation to therapies that stimulate healing
responses in hard-to-heal wounds. Also, the studies could lead to the development of assays that involve
monitoring blood neutrophil survival as cellular biomarkers to aid in the selection of treatment options for patients
with chronic wounds and/or obesity.

11092953,"Older women experience dramatic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and female
reproductive hormones, producing vasomotor symptoms (VMS), sleep problems, cognitive changes, and
cardiometabolic risks, which increase susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia. VMS occur
in 85% of women and persist in one-third for 10+ years after menopause, potentially leading to prolonged
disruption of quality of life, sleep disturbance, cardiometabolic risk, and extended VMS treatment, conferring
further risk for CVD and dementia. Such health outcomes may also be influenced by stress exposures across
the lifespan and during pregnancy, which may exert their effects through neural mechanisms. Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS) seek to establish a SCORE to advance our
understanding of stress exposures and neural regulation of reproductive aging health outcomes, and to
catalyze growth of translational women’s health and sex-differences research in aging women. We will pursue
novel translational science through three Projects: Project 1 (Joffe/Mahon; clinical science) will define evoked
stress responsivity, stress-related activation of neural networks on functional brain imaging, and GABA
concentrations as markers of VMS occurrence and persistence, including compounding effects of poor sleep
and stress exposures. Project 2 (Oken/Chavarro; population science) will determine whether perimenopausal
women with higher exposure to social stressors across the lifespan and physiological stressors across
pregnancy have greater cardiometabolic risk, sleep, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Project 3
(Kaiser/Navarro; basic science) will characterize the role of kisspeptin, neurokinin, and dynorphin (KNDy)
neurons and upstream GABAergic neurons in mediating the effects of stress and corticosteroids on the HPG
axis, VMS, and sleep disturbances in a rodent model. These scientific efforts will receive critical support from
our Cores: The Sleep Resource Core (Klerman) will extend our scientific impact by investigating sleep
outcomes in humans and rodents. The Career Enhancement Core (Rexrode/Rich-Edwards) will promote early-
career and new sex-differences investigators by supporting Scholars, Pilot Projects, Travel Exchange
Fellowships, and a robust educational program. The Leadership Administrative Core (Joffe/Manson) will
provide scientific and administrative oversight and engage with the SCORE Consortium. Building on existing,
fruitful collaborations, our outstanding interdisciplinary team of investigators—leaders in women’s health, sleep
medicine, neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, stress science, cognition, cardiometabolic, and reproductive
epidemiology—will leverage robust resources at the Connors Center for Women’s Health and Gender Biology
and across synergistic women’s health and sleep programs at BWH. This SCORE will produce a significant
public health impact by advancing our understanding of the role and mechanisms of stress in producing
reproductive aging health outcomes that are linked with CVD and dementia susceptibility in aging women."
11091847,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a critical problem in patients infected with HIV, but it is also commonly
seen in patients with diabetes, early Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and many other conditions,
and in its mildest form is also a feature of healthy aging. Over six million Americans are currently living with AD
spectrum conditions (i.e., AD/MCI) and roughly half of patients infected with HIV are cognitively impaired, not to
mention the vast numbers with other etiologies. Thus, there is a clear and immediate need to understand the
neurophysiological basis of these impairments and, in the context of HIV, these needs are central to PAR-24-091,
which calls for innovative approaches to identify how HIV specifically primes the system for cognitive decline.
While the mechanisms that underlie cognitive impairment are poorly understood, many studies have probed the
systems-level brain circuits that appear to play a prominent role. These studies have been largely successful in
identifying the circuits, yet we still have a limited understanding of the physiology and dynamics within these
networks, and the level of specificity to HIV related neuropathology versus cognitive impairment more generally.
Quantifying the neural dynamics in affected circuits is critical, as different oscillatory responses (e.g., theta, alpha,
gamma activity) have been found to code for distinct cognitive faculties, even when they occur in overlapping
regions of the brain. Further, current approaches have generally not probed the dynamics, and have not had the
sensitivity or specificity to reliability distinguish HIV-related pathology from similar conditions and/or healthy
aging. Thus, new tools and approaches are needed. Herein, we use an emerging dynamic functional mapping
method based on next-generation magnetoencephalography (MEG) to quantify oscillatory responses serving
cognitive task performance and spontaneous neural activity during rest in three demographically matched groups
(i.e., cognitively impaired adults with HIV, patients on the AD spectrum, and cognitively normal healthy aging
adults). Our novel dynamic mapping approach uses the latest in MEG instrumentation to provide spectrally
resolved maps with excellent temporal and spatial precision, which we will integrate with high-resolution structural
maps of areal brain architecture based on multimodal parcellation, maps of amyloid PET deposition, and a battery
of domain-specific cognitive assessments. Specifically, we will identify the oscillatory dynamics serving visual
attention and visuo-spatial processing (Aim 1), as well as neural entrainment (Aim 2), and quantify spontaneous
cortical activity at rest (Aim 3). Our overarching hypotheses are that these dynamic neurophysiological maps will
delineate unique pathological features underlying HIV-related cognitive decline relative to that observed in AD
spectrum conditions and healthy aging and predict domain-specific cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, our team
has extensive experience working with these patient populations and developing circuit-level markers of brain
pathology using advanced multimodal neuroimaging."

Genomic basis of phenotypic variability of complex disorders
Extensive phenotypic variability has complicated our understanding of complex disorders. We study the 520-
kbp deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 as a paradigm to dissect the genetic basis of complex disorders.
Originally identified in children manifesting developmental delay, the deletion is inherited in >95% of cases
from a parent with mild neuropsychiatric features, conferring differential susceptibilities to disease among
carriers in the same family. We found that carrier children were more likely to carry another large CNV or rare
deleterious mutation (“second-hit”) elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents, indicating that
the deletion sensitizes the genome for a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the ultimate phenotype
is determined by variants in the genetic background. Our long-term goal is to understand how specific
combinations of second-hit variants, in concert with the 16p12.1 deletion, lead to distinct clinical outcomes. In
the previous funding period, we analyzed the genomes and quantitative phenotypes of 150 families with the
16p12.1 deletion, and tested individual as well as 214 pairwise interactions of homologs of 16p12.1 genes in
Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models. We found that patterns of rare variants correlated with
the severity of clinical features, which were contingent upon family history of neuropsychiatric disease and
assortative mating profiles of parents. Furthermore, knockdown of individual 16p12.1 homologs in Drosophila
and X. laevis resulted in distinct developmental defects and these homologs interacted synergistically with
patient-specific second-hits to modulate neuronal and cellular defects. Here, we propose to fine-map genetic
and familial factors in larger cohorts, assess deeper cell type-specific effects, and identify generalizable
principles for phenotypic variability of complex disorders, through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Perform
whole genome sequencing and detailed phenotyping on an additional 250 families carrying the 16p12.1
deletion, and leverage the increased sample size to identify effects of single and combinations of genes and
variant classes as well as polygenic risks towards variability in families, including anticipation across
generations; Aim 2: Assess patterns of second-hits across different proband phenotypic profiles, family
histories, disease ascertainments, and unselected populations of 1,281 unrelated 16p12.1 deletion carriers,
and compare results with 2,200 individuals with other rare CNVs, such as 16p11.2 and 15q13.3 deletions, to
identify patterns of second-hits that are common or unique to different CNVs and ascertainments; Aim 3:
Perform functional studies to assess interactions of 16p12.1 genes with second-hits within neuronal cell types
in Drosophila and quantitative neurological assays in Danio rerio models. Ultimately, our study will improve
strategies for genetic diagnosis, counseling, and development of therapeutic strategies for complex disorders."
11091400,"Objectives: The long-term goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of pressure injury prevention
education by clinicians and self-management by Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI) through a methodical
development and testing of a mobile platform based pressure mapping system called “Comprehensive Mobile
Assessment of Pressure” (CMAP). The targeted risk-reduction behavior in this project is the effective use of
weight shifts when sitting in a wheelchair by improving consistency, frequency, duration, and quality of
movements to redistribute pressure. CMAP provides visual cues as well as individually customizable reminders
that are designed to compensate for the lack of sensation that prevents the use of natural cues to redistribute
pressure, by wheelchair users. An updated CMAP system will serve two important objectives: 1) assist clinicians
in assessment, individualized goal-setting, and monitoring the Veteran with SCI’s progress toward pressure
injury prevention behavior goals while in the hospital setting; and 2) assist clinicians with individualized setup
and education of the Veteran with SCI for using the CMAP system in the home setting as a self-management
strategy for pressure injury prevention.
Specific Aims: The specific aims of this study include: 1a) hardware expansion to improve functionality of the
CMAP system to add a docking and charging station and use of CMAP on a smartwatch based on Veteran
preferences and 1b) software expansion to enhance clinical education for pressure injury prevention education,
with requirements provided by clinicians; 2) determine usability of the refined CMAP system when it is integrated
into patient education for Veteran’s with acute SCI during their inpatient rehabilitation stay, and 3) a determine
usability and efficacy of the refined CMAP system for clinician-delivered pressure injury prevention education,
followed by Veteran use of CMAP in their daily routines at home.
Study Design: This four-year study will have multiple stages and will use a mixed methods approach that includes
iterative focus groups and interviews with Veterans who have SCI and with clinicians who provide pressure injury
prevention education to Veterans with SCI; self-efficacy and usability surveys for both Veterans and clinicians;
pilot testing of CMAP during inpatient rehabilitation and testing during outpatient visits. Repeated measures will
be used to evaluate changes within subject for completion of weight shifts while using CMAP, compared to
periods when not using CMAP.
Methods: During the first two years, improvements to CMAP hardware and software will be guided by experience-
based design guided requirements learned about through iterative focus groups including Veterans with SCI/D
(n=10) and clinicians (n=10). Usability will be measured at each iteration of development using the System
Usability Scale (SUS) and the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). The focus groups will be repeated to
ensure alignment between development progress and the requirements identified by the focus groups. During
the inpatient pilot test, clinician (n=3) and Veteran (n=6) self-efficacy will be measured. Veterans will complete
selected sub-scales from the Skin Care Belief Scale and clinicians will answer survey questions developed
specifically around providing education for performing weight shifts effectively. Veteran progress toward weight
shift goals will be measured through performance monitoring within the CMAP app; Actual performance will be
assessed against the individualized goals set by the clinician. During the outpatient testing, Veterans (n=20) will
use CMAP at home for 2 weeks after receiving education and individualized goals for weight shift performance
by clinicians. While at home, trunk movements will be monitored via actigraphy to monitor weight shift frequency
to compare to baseline trunk movement data, weight shift performance data within CMAP app, and finally,
compared with individualized goals for performing weight shifts. Self efficacy and usability (SUS and UEQ) of
the overall system in both settings will be measured."

Military personnel are exposed to intense noise during their active duty careers from weaponry, explosions and
military vehicles such as tanks, helicopters and other aircraft. Exposure to intense noise causes hearing loss
and may also cause vestibular dysfunction. Although hearing loss and cochlear synaptopathy are well studied,
peripheral vestibular synaptopathy and vestibular dysfunction are less often studied and poorly characterized.
Furthermore, age related balance deficits are a significant public health problem for veterans in the United States.
Agrawal et al. reported that 35% of adults older than 40 had evidence of postural instability and balance
dysfunction increased with age so that by 80 years, 85% of adults reported balance problems. Vestibular
dysfunction can increase the likelihood of falling; in the US falls are responsible for significant decrements in
quality of life, and more than 50% of accidental deaths. Although the causes of postural instability are complex
and multifactorial, several studies demonstrate a linkage between noise induced hearing loss and vestibular
dysfunction in humans. Noise exposure as a risk factor for vestibular loss has obvious and significant veteran
health implications, but there are few, if any studies that (1) provide insights into the physiology that underlies
noise-induced vestibular loss and (2) provide guidance for preventative or rehabilitative strategies for veterans
with balance disorders. The proposed studies will show in a rat model, that noise exposure at levels encountered
by veterans during their military service and during daily life can cause vestibular dysfunction that includes
deficits in vestibular reflexes and vestibular signaling that increase fall risk and reduce head stability and visual
acuity during movement.
We hypothesize that intense noise exposure sufficient to attenuate vestibular nerve responses to linear
acceleration (as assessed by the Vestibular short latency Evoked Potential (VsEP) will also cause significant
functional deficits in three vestibular dependent behaviors, (1) control of balance during locomotion; (2) deficits
in vestibulocollic reflex function that reduce head stability; and (3) deficits in vestibulo-ocular reflex function
sufficient to reduce visual acuity during locomotion.
Specific Aim 1. Assess balance, head, and visual stability in rats exposed to intense noise sufficient to abolish
VsEP responses for at least 28 days. We will use this time window to probe the time course and nature of
deficits in vestibular dependent behaviors caused by noise exposure. Specific Aim 2A. Determine whether or
not the same behaviors are impaired by a single noise exposure that induces temporary loss and recovery of
VsEP responses within 28 days. This Aim will determine if there is a functional vestibular impact from a single
noise exposure after which peripheral synapses and VsEP responses recover. Specific Aim 2B. Determine
the extent to which and the time course over these behaviors are impaired by multiple noise exposures that
initially induce temporary attenuations of VsEP responses. This Aim will determine the cumulative vestibular
impact of repetitive noise exposures (as would typically be experienced by Veterans during their service years)
on potential peripheral and central recovery mechanisms that can be targeted by rehabilitative strategies."

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are 1–6 bp repetitive and highly polymorphic DNA sequences. Expansions in
dozens of STRs are associated with genetic disease. However, STRs are challenging to sequence and interpret,
meaning that individuals with STR disease often go undiagnosed. In rare disease studies, it is now standard to
prioritize candidate pathogenic SNVs, indels and SVs by excluding variants that have high allele frequencies in
population-scale databases such as gnomAD. However, there is no such genome-wide database available for
large STR expansions. I will produce a publicly available STR variation community resource, stratified by
ancestry, to enable prioritization of candidate pathogenic STR expansions.
Long-read sequencing technologies from PacBio and Nanopore have been heralded as the solution to accurately
genotype long repeats because their reads can span the repetitive region. However, there are several challenges
when genotyping STRS in long-reads that are not adequately addressed by existing approaches. I will develop
a method to genotype STRs from long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. It will discover informative reads
using a combination of alignment and identifying repetitive regions in reads. It will then infer the genotype by
integrating evidence from multiple reads, informed by my investigation of biases in these technologies.
Drawing together new short and long-read computational approaches to calling STR expansions, and my
population-scale STR catalog, with an emphasis on diverse and under-served populations, this proposal will
establish a genetic diagnosis for hundreds of patients, while searching for new STR disease loci. I will analyze
patient cohorts enriched for phenotypes associated with STRs from the UDN, University of Washington, Harry
Perkins Institute of Medical Research and Children’s Mercy Hospital to solve cases and discover new disease-
associated STRs in both short and long-read sequencing."

11097534,"Summary
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) is traditionally viewed as an adaptor molecule that helps ribosomes synthesize
proteins by decoding nucleotide triplets linking mRNA sequence to amino acid sequence of protein. Recent
findings demonstrate that tRNAs also serve as a major source of small non-coding RNAs, so called tRNA-derived
fragments (tRFs). The emerging concept in molecular biology is that these tRFs perform regulatory functions,
although relatively little is known about their precise roles in cell physiology.
 Work from our and other laboratories has shown that in response to a variety of abiotic stresses (e.g.
oxidative or nutrient stress), the vertebrate-specific ribonuclease (RNase) angiogenin (ANG) is activated to target
the anticodon loops of tRNAs to produce a specific subclass of tRFs, known as tRNA-derived stress-induced
RNAs (tiRNAs). Since their discovery in 2009, tiRNAs have been found to play roles in stress adaptation, cell
survival and apoptosis. One of the relatively well studied roles of selected subset of tiRNAs (derived from tRNAAla
and tRNACys) is inhibition of translation initiation via interference with functions of the cap-binding complex eIF4F
(Ivanov et al. Mol Cell 2011).
 The work based on our funded proposal will further investigate functions of novel, previously unexplored,
tiRNAs in regulation of translation. Our preliminary data suggest that alternative mechanisms of translation
modulation exist that are different from the mechanisms used by tiRNAAla/Cys. Aim 2 of the R01, will identify and
characterize mRNA targets of tiRNAs by employing candidate and unbiased approaches. Our preliminary data
suggest that specific tiRNAs target specific pool of mRNAs thus reprogramming cellular translation. By
employment of ribosome profiling, we can search for the mRNA candidates regulated by tiRNAs in unbiased
manner. By employment of microscopy approaches, we will analyze colocolaization of tiRNA targets with stress
granules and P-bodies.
 Our proposal is highly innovative and will broadly impact RNA biology. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will result in characterization of novel translational control mechanisms acting during stress.
Our studies are also important from a therapeutic point of view because multiple pathophysiological conditions
are linked to changes in tiRNA production. Mutations affecting the RNase activity of ANG are found in patients
with the neurodegenerative diseases Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Also, ANG is over-
expressed in multiple cancers and its expression correlates with misbalanced tiRNA production, indicating a
necessity to understand the function of tiRNAs. Finally, this proposal will generate many resources for the entire
RNA/tRNA community and we will ensure that these resources are available for future use."

In the United States, the average American will undergo seven surgical operations during their lifetime. Each year
150,000 surgical patients die, and 1.5 million develop a complication after surgery. Progress in medical Artificial
Intelligence (AI) remains halted by limited datasets and models with insufficient interpretability, transparency, fairness,
and reproducibility that are difficult to implement and share across institutions. The overall objective of this
administrative equipment supplement is to develop a new conceptual framework that includes digital pathological
images from surgical biopsies for “Explainable, Fair, Reproducible, and Collaborative Medical AI”. The widespread
adoption of electronic health records (EHR) leading to digital data has enabled the proliferation of AI/ML tools for risk
surveillance and diagnosis. However, progress in the field remains halted by limited datasets (such as lack of digital
pathological images) and models with insufficient interpretability, fairness, and reproducibility that are difficult to
implement and share across institutions. The lack of explainability and transparency of black-box AI models is
challenging for the high-risk medical environment and has delayed clinical implementation of AI on a large scale.
The overall objective will be achieved by incorporating digital pathology images into three specific aims: (1) External and
prospective validation of novel interpretable, dynamic, actionable, fair and reproducible algorithmic toolkit for real-time
surgical risk surveillance. (2) Developing and evaluating explainable AI platform (XAI-IDEALIST) for real-time surgical risk
surveillance using human-grounded benchmarks. (3) Implementing and evaluating a federated learning approach with
advanced privacy features for collaborative surgical risk model training. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve
patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications.
With the requested equipment, Leica Versa 200 we will aim to scan 500 pathology slides per week for our retrospective
data and approximately 3700 slides that will be used during our validation stage. Additional institutional resources
provided by the University of Florida College of Medicine Office of Research will pay for a trained technician, equipment
maintenance, and digital storage fees for the life of the grant."

The goals of the Northwest Genomics Center (NWGC) for All of Us (AoU) are to provide high-
quality, cost-effective genotyping and whole genome sequence (WGS) data; to return genomic
results for medically actionable and pharmacogenomic genetic variants; to enhance the scientific
value of AoU by adding innovative -omic technologies; and to expand the value returned to AoU
participants by leveraging long-read sequence data. The NWGC brings together three
internationally recognized Principal Investigators–Gail Jarvik, Chia-Lin Wei, and Evan Eichler–
with decades of expertise in high-throughput clinical genomics. Together with their Co-
Investigators—Christina Lockwood, Brian Shirts, Colin Pritchard, Phil Empey—they have
returned tens of thousands of variant interpretations to patients including AoU participants. Since
August 2020, the NWGC has delivered genotype array data for 169,414 samples and genome data
for 61,606 samples to the AoU Data Research Center (DRC). We have completed variant review
and classification resulting in genomic return of results reports for more than 15,000 AoU
participants including 411 medically actionable reports (i.e., American College of Medical
Genetics pathogenic or likely pathogenic classifications). As we have done since November 2018,
we will continue to coordinate our efforts with All of Us partners including the DRC, the Mayo
Clinic Biobank, and the other Genome Centers.
To advance the core business goals and objectives of AoU, the NWGC will generate high-quality
genotyping array and whole genome sequence data for up to 50,000 AoU participants per year. In
addition, we will interpret and classify variants for individuals who request genomic return of
results (gRoR). We will continue to lead and support expanding gRoR content to participants (i.e.,
additional genes and medications) and leverage long-read -omics projects for investigators in the
Researcher Work Bench (RWB). We will contribute our in-depth experience in sequencing
technologies to support the FDA IDE supplemental validation plans for the NovaSeq X Plus
platform and construct long-read resources in the discovery of pathogenic variants in medically-
relevant genes and PGx targets. We will participate in analysis working groups and work with the
DRC to improve genotype imputation and phasing tools, when funding is available, we will deploy
innovative multiomics technologies to expand variant interpretation and functional annotation.
As we have demonstrated in the past six years, the NWGC is ideally positioned to support and
maximize the potential of AoU and its central mission to understand human genetic variation that
impacts disease prevalence among the diverse United States population."

This exploratory proposal will be the first to characterize glycosylated RNAs in the context of human prostate
cancer (PCa). PCa is the most prevalent form of non-skin cancer in males and second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths among men. 20% of men diagnosed with PCa will progress to fast-growing, advanced
disease. There are no curative treatments for PCa that has spread to distant sites and the 5-year survival rate
for metastatic disease is only 30%. As high-grade PCa often leads to poor prognoses, it is imperative to better
understand these pathologies and improve patient stratification methods as well as therapeutic treatment
options to increase patient survival. Noncoding RNAs are widely misexpressed in PCa patients and act as key
tumor suppressor genes, pro-oncogenic factors in the prostate. Noncoding RNAs harbor a large range of post-
transcriptional modifications (m6A, inosine, pseudouridine, 2'-O-Me, A-to-I editing, 3’ uridine tailing) that are
important for RNA maturation, folding, expression, and nuclear transport. Dysregulation of these post-
transcriptional modifications are associated with tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, immune response and
disease recurrence. Noncoding RNAs were serendipitously discovered to carry glycosylation modifications
when cultured human and mouse cells were metabolically labeled using bioorthogonal chemistry methods
normally employed for glycosylated protein and lipid enrichment. Glycosylation is an intricate process that
typically involves the covalent attachment of carbohydrates onto proteins and lipids as the biomolecules move
through the secretory pathway. Aberrant protein/lipid glycosylation contributes to tumor growth, metastasis,
and immunosurveillance evasion and is being utilized as cancer biomarkers. We hypothesize that RNAs
require glycosylation for cell signaling to maintain prostate homeostasis and cancer prevention and therefore
the glycosylated state of RNA will correlate with prostate tumorgenicity. In support of this rationale, we
confirmed using click chemistry and northern blotting that glycoRNAs exist and with differing abundance in
human prostate cells. Specific Aims: This proposal will use two independent methods, metabolic labeling with
azide click chemistry and lectin-based purification, to classify glycoRNA distribution from a panel of human
prostate cell lines differing in their metastatic potential and hormone sensitivity. Aim 1 will unbiasedly determine
if small versus large noncoding RNAs are preferentially glycosylated in the prostate, if these glycoRNAs share
features for N- or O-linked sugars, and identify these species using RNAseq. In Aim 2, fractionation methods
and chemical inhibitor studies will determine the PCa-associated glycoRNA subcellular localization, possible
exosome enrichment and characterize these carbohydrate moieties via mass spectrometry. In Aim 3, the
Ptenpc-/- Smad4 pc-/- double knockout mouse model will be employed to characterize glycoRNAs from living
animals throughout a prostate cancer progression time course. This work will lead to novel insights into how
RNA modifications impact PCa progression and identify first-in-class clinical tools to improve patient outcome."

Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear a disproportionate burden of the global HIV epidemic. Conducting
studies in the most affected areas of the world is critical to the international HIV research agenda. The Johns
Hopkins University-Blantyre, Malawi Clinical Trials Unit (JHU Blantyre-CTU) and its clinical research site (CRS)
in Malawi, located in one of the most affected regions of the world, propose to continue and expand high-
impact research collaborations with four NIAID Clinical Research Networks in order to prevent, treat, manage
and potentially cure HIV and AIDS in adults, key populations, and children. With more than 30 years of HIV
research experience and the strong backing of the host institutions (Johns Hopkins University and College of
Medicine, University of Malawi), the CTU and CRS leadership will be responsible for the conduct and
management of clinical trials at the Blantyre, CRS in accordance with the Research Networks and NIAID
policies. The CTU aims to advance the scientific agenda of the proposed Clinical Research Networks for HIV
prevention, treatment and vaccine research among adults and children by generating hypotheses and
developing new scientific concepts; continuing implementation of active study protocols at the Blantyre CRS
under the current CTU; making available the efficient and flexible local research infrastructure to quickly
respond to emerging needs of the Networks; and by engaging protocol-specific populations. The CTU will
emphasize quality, oversight, cohesiveness and efficiency in all operations as it works to achieve these aims.
During the current CTU cycle (2013 to present), the Blantyre CRS has been involved in 35 studies at various
stages, from initiation to completion, for four existing Division of AIDS/NIAID Clinical Research Networks. The
CRS has established effective institutional and community collaborations and has been responsive to both the
Network agendas and the national health research agenda for Malawi. The goal of this application is to
describe scientific, leadership and administrative strengths of the proposed JHU-Blantyre CTU and its CRS in
Blantyre, Malawi, which will ensure successful implementation of the NIAID international clinical research
agenda. The sub-sections (A-L) of this application provide a scientific overview of the proposed CTU and
describe its administrative and financial management structures; plans for communication, evaluation and
training; and the roles, responsibilities and resources of each CTU element and CRS technical department,
including community engagement, pharmacy, laboratory, quality and regulatory assurance, and data
management. Our CTU arrangement that encompasses a single CRS has demonstrated capacity and
promotes efficiency."

The major long-term objective of this research program is to understand the mechanisms of regulation of RNA
polymerase II transcription in animals. Why is it important to study gene expression? The basis of a diverse
range of biological phenomena, including many human diseases, can be traced to the proper or improper
expression of a gene or set of genes. Thus, new insights into the mechanisms of gene expression will have a
far-reaching impact upon the biological sciences. Specific emphasis will be placed upon the study of the RNA
polymerase II core promoter, which is the short stretch of DNA that directs the initiation of transcription. Why is
it important to study the core promoter? First, the core promoter is the ""gateway to transcription"" – the site of
convergence of the signals that lead to transcription initiation. In this regard, the core promoter is at a key
strategic position in the transcription process. Second, the core promoter is a central and integral component
of the RNA polymerase II transcription system that comprises the signals in the chromatin (including DNA
sequence motifs) and the factors that read those signals and carry out the transcription process. At present,
core promoter elements are best understood in organisms other than humans. The human core promoter,
which is complex and difficult to decipher, is the next challenge. Hence, future goals include the elucidation of
the components of the human core promoter and the identification and analysis of the transcription factors that
function with specific sequence elements to mediate the regulation of gene expression in humans. This work
should provide new and important insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in humans. A
second objective of this research program is to understand the diverse functions of chromatin – the natural
form of DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus. Because DNA is the genetic material and is thus of the utmost
importance, there is a strong and broad interest in the factors and mechanisms that affect chromatin and DNA
structure and integrity. In particular, these processes will be investigated at the interface of chromatin and
DNA – that is, in the context of chromatin rather than with DNA alone. One particular area of interest is the
study of factors that protect DNA from damage by binding to nucleosomes. New insights into the protection of
DNA against damaging agents such as reactive oxygen species would not only provide important fundamental
knowledge of cellular function, but would also be relevant to the understanding and prevention of cancer."

 O-linked protein glycosylation orchestrates diverse signaling events in plant development in response to the
changing environment. We have discovered the first nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase, SPINDLY (SPY)
in Arabidopsis, which together with its paralog SECRET AGENT (SEC), an O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), post-
translationally modify the conserved DELLA family of transcription regulators, such as RGA, to control their ability
to modulate multiple signaling pathways. SPY-catalyzed O-fucosylation of RGA enhances the RGA interaction
with key transcription factors to suppress plant growth, whereas SEC-mediated O-GlcNAcylation weakens RGA
activity and promotes plant development. Despite their functional significance, how these two homologous
glycosyltransferases, SPY and SEC, have evolved distinct substrate specificities and how these two types of
glycosylation, O-fucosylation by SPY and O-GlcNAcylation by SEC, regulate the RGA conformation to influence
plant development at the molecular level have remained unknown. We propose to elucidate the molecular details
of SPY, SEC, and their substrate and product complexes, as well as the distinct structural and functional
consequences of RGA O-fucosylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Recent proteomic analysis has unveiled hundreds
of SPY and SEC substrates beyond RGA, highlighting the broad implication of protein glycosylation in regulating
cellular functions. In order to overcome the potential pleotropic effects brought by spy and sec mutations in planta
and decipher the functional consequences of O-fucosylation and O-GlcNAcylation for specific target proteins,
we will develop nanobody-fused SPY and SEC variants for precise target modification. Collectively, our study
will fill the critical knowledge gap about the structural and functional consequences of protein glycosylation in
plants. As SPY-like genes are conserved in diverse organisms, including plants, bacteria, and parasitic protists,
and as SEC-like (OGT) genes are broadly distributed in plants and animals, a molecular understanding of these
enzymes and their distinct structural and functional consequences will have a profound impact in plant biology,
agriculture, and human health and diseases."

In metazoan, the presence of double-stranded (ds)DNA in the cytosol signals serious problems, which range
from radiation damage to pathogen invasion. The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense
against cytosolic dsDNA by initiating inflammatory signaling pathways. Cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways are
integral to host defense against numerous pathogens, and their malfunctions also result in various human
maladies.
Our research program is poised to resolve several long-standing mechanistic questions in understanding how
human cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways are activated and regulated at the molecular level. We will also test
new concepts as to how these sensors might be stigmatized as autoantigens, and explore the mechanical
forces that drive and regulate their higher order assemblies. Our approaches include X-ray crystallography,
rigorous biochemical measurements, cell-based assays, electron microscopy, and single molecule methods.
Here, we will determine how cGAS coordinates different nucleotide substrates and metal co-factors at the
active site to specifically generate 2'-5'/3'-5' linked cyclic G/AMP. We will also investigate how dimerization is
allosterically coupled to activation. We will then determine how cGAS and ALR sensors selectively recognize
and signal through dsDNA. Next, we will test the role of phase-separation/transition in the normal and aberrant
activities of cytosolic dsDNA sensors. Finally, we will delineate mechanical forces and structural mechanisms
that underpin the activation and regulation of cytosolic dsDNA sensors. The molecular insights resulting from
the proposed studies will provide a foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies that target various
human diseases caused by dysregulated cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathways."

Proposed are complementary studies on the mechanisms and regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
(CME) and actin force generation during CME in budding yeast and human stem cells. CME is responsible for
uptake of molecules from a cell's environment through the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane and
for selective removal of plasma membrane proteins. It is also one of the main routes for COVID-19 to enter
cells. Therefore, this process is crucial for determining how cells respond to their surroundings and has
heightened translational significance. Many proteins and lipids that mediate CME have been identified and
their functions determined biochemically and in living cells. Imaging of fluorescently labeled CME proteins in
live cells has revealed the intricate recruitment timing and order for some 60 CME proteins. However, how
cargo capture is coordinated with vesicle formation, how correct protein recruitment order and timing are
achieved, which events and molecules play critical roles in the pathway, and how forces curve the membrane
and drive vesicle scission, are not fully understood. The following key questions will be addressed in budding
yeast and human stem cells: 1) How does membrane curvature affect biochemical reaction rates? 2) How
does CME become specialized for different cell types during differentiation? 3) How does a checkpoint sense
cargo and regulate CME progress? and, 4) How does actin assemble at CME sites and how does its
ultrastructure contribute to CME force production and adapt to increased membrane tension? Yeast studies will
be empowered by a rich legacy in the lab of elucidating actin assembly and force production mechanisms.
Human cell studies will be empowered by over 120 stable human tissue culture and stem cell lines generated
using genome editing to express CME and actin cytoskeleton proteins as fluorescent protein fusions at native,
endogenous levels. Because CME proteins are highly conserved in structure and function, principles learned
from studies of yeast and humans will complement and inform each other. Together, these studies will provide
a comprehensive mechanistic understanding that could not be achieved by studies in only one cell type.
Because the actin cytoskeleton has been adapted by evolution for diverse, essential activities including cell
motility, organelle transport, adhesion, and cell polarity development, what is learned will apply broadly for
many cellular processes and will join the growing armamentarium of possible defensive measures against the
pandemic."
11091402,"Impaired executive function, such as impaired decision making and impulsivity, has been identified as an
important contributor to the transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt. To address the epidemic of
Veteran suicide in the United States, we propose to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
effectiveness of a five day transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) augmented executive functioning
training intervention. This intervention will be delivered to high suicide risk inpatients who have been
hospitalized following a suicide attempt. The ultimate goal is to reduce future suicide events (ideation,
attempts, deaths) and improve quality of life (e.g. social relationships, health resource utilization).
Our intervention combines two existing interventions: tDCS and cognitive training. tDCS is a simple, low cost,
easy to use non-invasive neuromodulation technology demonstrated to enhance brain plasticity and accelerate
learning. Executive function training is a proven intervention that improves executive functioning in clinical
populations. When tDCS and executive function training are combined, learning rate, executive functioning,
and transfer to other functions is improved compared with executive function training alone.
We propose to test the feasibility and acceptability of a five day intervention consisting of ten sessions of tDCS
augmented executive function training in a high suicide risk population: Veterans admitted to a hospital
following a suicide attempt. Inpatients have the highest risk of suicide attempts within the initial weeks following
discharge with 50% occuring within 12 weeks of discharge. This suggests that the time prior to hospital
discharge could be a critical intervention period. Additionally, we will collect longitudinal and daily real-time data
on help-seeking, suicide risk, and related factors in the month after discharge using Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA). Given that help-seeking and suicide risk fluctuate during the week, EMA offers an
improvement over existing research that relies on retrospective and cross-sectional methods. Our Aims are:
Aim 1: Determine feasibility and acceptability of the tDCS augmented executive function training intervention.
Feedback will be obtained from patients and clinical staff through questionnaires, interviews, and debriefs to
examine their experience and satisfaction with the intervention and study methods. We will also use
participants’ performance data to assess engagement with, and ease of use of, the training exercises.
Aim 2: Assess preliminary effects of the intervention on 1) the behavioral treatment target of executive
functioning, and 2) reduction in suicide events (ideation, attempts, deaths) and improvement in quality of life.
Variability and precision estimates (95% confidence intervals) will be calculated.
Aim 3: Explore between- and within-person variability of cognitive factors (executive function task
performance), help-seeking, and suicidal thinking and behavior in the one month post-discharge via in-person
visits and daily Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).
Significance. Reducing Veteran suicide has been the top clinical priority of the VA for the last few years.
However, the total number of suicides among Veterans has continued to increase. There is a critical need for
targeted treatments to reduce the risk of suicide in Veterans. The low cost, simplicity, and safety of this
intervention makes it easy to deliver and scale to clinical settings. If this pilot trial is successful, it would set the
stage for a larger trial to test the effectiveness of this intervention for reducing suicide events in a high suicide
risk population."

CAR-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of liquid tumors, including leukemia and lymphoma, and
hold enormous promise for treatment of solid cancers as well. However, despite their unprecedented clinical
success, widespread utilization of this therapy is hampered by the lengthy and labor-intensive manufacturing
procedures. CAR-T cell manufacturing takes weeks, results in very high costs of therapy (~$500,000). The long
manufacturing time creates delays of weeks or months to infuse CAR-T cells to patients with rapidly progressing
disease. Finally, the extensive ex vivo manipulation creates cell products with heterogeneous composition and
terminal differentiation that limit CAR-T cell engraftment and persistence. Effort to overcome these limitations
have focused on closed and automatic manufacturing devices to contain the labor needed to manufacture CAR-
T cells ex vivo, and allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-T cells have been proposed to overcome the need of CAR-T
cell manufacturing for each single patient. These technologies are promising, but reducing the time, costs and
regulatory burden of manufacturing or eliminating ex vivo procedures entirely remains a critical unmet need. In
vivo generation of CAR-T cells would eliminate the need for ex vivo procedures, prevent the terminal differenti-
ation of ex vivo expanded CAR-T cells and ensure the potency and longevity of autologous T cells as compared
to allogeneic CAR-T cell products that are extensively manipulated to prevent rejection and graft-versus-host
disease. This proposal outlines the first steps in a highly innovative high-risk/high-reward effort to develop bioin-
structive biomaterials scaffolds that generate CAR-T cells entirely within the patient and produce CAR-T cells
with improved efficacy and persistence. Our endeavor is built on significant published and preliminary data
demonstrating that our biomaterial scaffolds already efficiently activate and mediate CAR-T cell transduction in
vitro and efficiently recruit and release CAR-T cells in vivo and reduce CAR-T manufacturing times from weeks
to a single day. We propose that the biocompatible alginate biomaterial scaffolds can be modified to encapsulate
T cell-attracting chemokines to recruit T cells to the scaffold. After recruitment, the biomaterial scaffolds will
provide αCD3/CD28 signaling to activate the T cells. After activation, T cell-specific viral particles either already
present in the biomaterial or administered to the biomaterial as a separate step will transduce the T cells, gen-
erating tumor specific CAR-T cells in situ in manner compatible with irradiative lymphodepletion. Finally, inter-
leukin signaling in the scaffold will expand and promote release of formed CAR-T cells for systemic function. If
successful, this approach could have enormous clinical impact by significantly reducing therapy costs and dra-
matically expanding the patient population benefiting from CAR-T-cell therapy. We expect that these studies will
provide a foundational technology for CAR-T cells manufacturing and promote widespread patient access. In
addition to the clear application in cancer, however, this rational, materials-based approach for cellular manu-
facturing could be adopted to program therapeutic lymphocytes in solid tumors and for other diseases."

Approximately ~7% of alcohol-consuming individuals engage in chronic heavy drinking (CHD), which is
associated with increased susceptibility to infections as well as impaired wound healing and tissue repair
resulting in poor post-operative outcomes. Evidence suggests that many of these defects are mediated by
excessive inflammatory responses originating from myeloid cells, notably circulating monocytes and tissue-
resident macrophages. These data were primarily generated from in vitro studies where monocytes from healthy
donors or cell lines are treated high doses of ethanol. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of CHD
cannot be fully understood by in vitro studies because immune cells carry out their functions in a multicellular
environment in which alcohol has widespread effects. Due to a lack of studies utilizing reliable in vivo models,
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CHD
remains incomplete. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose to leverage a rhesus macaque model of
voluntary ethanol self-administration that accurately mirrors human physiology and recapitulates complex human
drinking behavior. Using this model, our lab has recently demonstrated that CHD results in transcriptional and
epigenetic rewiring of circulating monocytes and splenic macrophages, resulting in aberrant responses to LPS
stimulation. However, the functional implications of this reprogramming and the epigenetic mechanisms
controlling it remain unknown. Importantly, because monocytes are short-lived circulating cells under constant
repopulation from the bone marrow, these observations suggest perturbations of the hematopoietic niche.
Preliminary single-cell analyses of hematopoietic progenitors point to a shift in differentiation potential towards
more mature myeloid progenitors with alcohol. However, a link between this observation in progenitor cells and
their differentiated states in blood and tissue remains unclear. In this application, we propose to test the
hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption reprograms the epigenetic landscape of monocyte
progenitors in the bone marrow giving rise to circulating monocytes poised towards a hyper-
inflammatory response. We will first examine the impact of CHD on functional reprogramming of circulating
monocytes, implementing assays to test their ability to migrate, phagocytose, and generate proper metabolic
responses. We will next examine the effect of stimulation on the monocyte epigenetic landscape through
assessment of chromatin accessibility and abundance of specific histone modifications. Finally, we will determine
the effect of CHD on the differentiation potential, transcriptome activation, and epigenetic rewiring of bone
marrow myeloid progenitors and integrate these data with those obtained from peripheral blood monocytes.
Completion of this proposal will provide novel insight into the impact of CHD on myelopoiesis and mechanisms
by which it compromised immunity and host defense as well as design interventions to mitigate these adverse
events and improve immunological outcomes."

Notice NOT-GM-24-021 under the parent grant R35 GM139537-01, “Exploring cyclic di-nucleotide signaling

(OD600) of bacteria in four 96-well plates. The LogPhase 600 will be used to measure bacterial growth curves,
which is one of the most common and fundamental phenotypes assayed in a microbiology laboratory is
measuring growth kinetics by tracking optical density, usually at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600), over time. A
growth curve can yield the growth rate of bacteria, their lag time at the initiation of the culture, when they enter
stationary phase and stop growing, and the maximum yield of the population. Such values are fundamental in
understanding the overall physiology of bacterial cells. We also use such growth curves to study the interaction
of bacteria with their cognate viruses known as phage. When phage infects a bacterial population, it leads to
lysis of the bacterial cells, which can be measured by a drop in the OD600. To survive the onslaught of phage that
bacteria encounter in the natural world, they have evolved a myriad of molecular defense systems. Some of
these systems, like restriction enzymes and CRISPR, have been studied for decades and are now fundamental
molecular tools for modifying and manipulating DNA. However, over the last ~10 years, a wide range of diverse
defense systems has been described, including three from my lab, resulting in several publications since the
start of the R35. A major bottleneck for this research is access to a plate reader that can track OD600 over time
in a high-throughput fashion. I chose the Agilent BioTek LogPhase 600 microbiology plate reader as it is a simple
device that does one thing well-measure OD600 over time in 96-well plates. The most exciting part about this
piece of equipment is that it can analyze four plates simultaneously. This allows up to four members of my lab
to perform growth curves or phage infection studies at the same time, or one member to do multiple replicates
of one experiment. Having access to the LogPhase 600 would significantly advance the progress of research in
my lab, and at a cost of only $34,245.70, it is a relatively low-cost piece of equipment that will be give a large
“bang for the buck”. The investment in this equipment by the NIH would greatly enhance the return on my R35
GM139537-01 award."
11096807,"Project Summary and Relevance
 The goal of this project is to develop mechanisms by which ordinary proteins can be turned into ligand-
activated conformational switches. When naturally-occurring proteins of this type are discovered, their
engineering can result in technologies that transform biology. For example, CRISPR-associated protein
catalytic activity is switched on by binding of guide RNA, and calmodulin undergoes a large conformational
change upon ligating calcium. Developing these proteins into DNA manipulation tools and fluorescent calcium
sensors, respectively have revolutionized gene editing and the study of calcium signaling. The current proposal
asks the question, “what else is possible if other proteins and enzymes can be made to switch on/off by binding
of DNA, RNA, or other ligands?”.
 The proposed project takes a combined biophysical, computational, and cellular approach to develop a
general mechanism for linking protein function to ligand binding. Three families of protein switches will be
created. The first is a biosensor that plugs into existing DNA tools (such as aptamers and toehold-mediated
strand displacement hairpins) without any modification to the sensor, to detect a DNA or RNA sequence of
choice. The output is ratiometric (blue/green) luminescence that can be detected by cell phone camera. The
second family employs fibronectin 3 ‘monobodies’ as the input domains and fluorescent proteins as the output
domains to provide a ratiometric FRET response, or large increase in fluorescence intensity, when
encountering an intracellular target. In the third switch design, the enzymatic activity of a bacterial RNase is
turned on by cytomegalovirus (CMV) RNA to kill CMV-infected human cells. This last aim addresses the
pressing need of preventing transplant-related CMV disease.
 Relevance. This study will open the biological activity of the human proteome to potential regulation by
binding of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. The modular design allows mixing and matching of
different proteins to generate molecules with functionalities not found in nature. Examples include biosensors
for pathogens and disease biomarkers, and an enzyme that kills virally-infected human cells while leaving
uninfected cells unharmed."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease with a prevalence of 25%
in the general population. NAFLD is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, where it shows a prevalence up to
80%, and a strong progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, and advance stage of NAFLD). To date,
there are no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. However, thiazolidinediones (TZD), which
are effective anti-diabetogenic drugs, may be used to treat NAFLD/NASH. Specifically, TZD activate peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) in adipocytes, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells (HSC),
and they should reduce insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrogenesis, respectively. Despite having some
positive effects, TZD are not currently used to treat NASH, and it is possible that their true potential as anti-
NASH drugs are indeed reduced by direct negative actions on hepatocyte function. In fact, our preliminary
studies show that hepatocyte PPARg is a relevant factor in the regulation of hepatic gene expression that
contributes to the progression of NASH, and reduces the therapeutic effects of TZD in the liver of mice with
NASH. In this proposal, we hypothesize that hepatocyte PPARg is a negative regulator of
phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT),
disrupts methionine metabolism, and promotes NASH. In our Aim 1, we will define the contribution of hepatocyte
PEMT and BHMT in the TZD-mediated reversal of NASH. Specifically, we will restore the expression of PEMT
or BHMT with adeno-associated viruses in PPARg-intact mice after the development of NASH and treat these
mice with TZD to reverse NASH. Also, hepatocyte PEMT and BHMT will be restored in mice with hepatocyte-
specific loss of PPARg expression without a TZD treatment. This aim will show how PEMT and BHMT improve
liver health, and reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis to enhance the therapeutic actions of TZD in the
reversal of NASH. In aim 2, we will determine if PPARg directly disrupts the metabolism of methionine in
hepatocytes. Briefly, we will use targeted metabolomics in mouse and human primary hepatocytes or in perfused
livers of controls and mice with hepatocyte-specific loss of PPARg expression that are treated with TZD. These
experiments will identify how TZD alters the use of methionine in hepatocytes, and contributes, in a hepatocyte-
specific PPARg-dependent manner, to sustain steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis despite the positive actions
of TZD on adipocytes, macrophages, and HSC. Overall, in this proposal we will describe how hepatocyte-specific
PPARg negatively regulates methionine metabolism to promote NAFLD, and to limit the potential of TZD as a
therapy for NASH. The outcomes of this project will lead us to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance the
use of TZD, and to develop new treatments for NAFLD and the care of NASH patients."

ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, gated by intracellular nucleotides ATP and ADP, couple cell energetics
with membrane excitability to govern a wide range of physiological processes vital to energy homeostasis. KATP
channels are unique hetero-octameric membrane protein complexes of four inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir6.1
or Kir6.2) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) subunits. Various Kir6.x/SURx
combinations generate KATP channel isoforms with distinct tissue distribution, nucleotide sensitivity, and
pharmacology. The most prominent KATP channels are those of Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.1/SUR2B
combinations, representing the major pancreatic, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle isoforms, respectively.
Genetic mutations in the various KATP channels underlie a number of endocrine, cardiovascular, and neuronal,
and muscular diseases, as exemplified by Cantú syndrome, a severe pleiotropic systemic hypotension disorder
caused by gain of function mutations in the vascular Kir6.1/SUR2B KATP channel. A central goal in the KATP
channel field is to understand the structure-function relationship of KATP channel isoforms in order to develop
mechanism-based, isoform-specific therapies for disease caused by KATP channel dysfunction. A key barrier to
progress has been a lack of high resolution channel structures. Recently, we have broken this barrier by resolving
3D structures of the pancreatic Kir6.2/SUR1 channel to near atomic resolutions using cryoEM. In this new
application, we seek to carry this momentum and determine structures of the other KATP channel isoforms. We
hypothesize that comparing and contrasting related KATP channel complexes will reveal the general design
principles that allow KATP channels to operate as ATP/ADP sensors and the specific mechanisms that underlie
the unique gating properties and pharmacology of different KATP channel isoforms. We will test the hypothesis
using a multipronged approach that combines single-particle cryoEM, molecular dynamics simulations, in silico
compound screening, and functional assays in three independent but integrated Specific Aims. (1) Determine
cryoEM structures and conformational dynamics of KATP channel isoforms in apo, inhibitors-bound and activators-
bound states. (2) Test mechanistic hypotheses on KATP channel isoform-specific biophysical properties,
nucleotides sensitivities, and pharmacology. (3) Conduct proof-of-concept structure-based drug discovery
studies towards targeted pharmacology for Cantú mutations in vascular KATP channels. The scientific premise of
the proposal is built on a wealth of KATP channel literature and rigorous preliminary and published studies from
the applicant and her co-investigator and collaborators. The proposal is innovative as it aims to generate new
structures, establish new concepts in KATP gating regulation mechanisms, and discover new vascular KATP
channel inhibitors for Cantú patients. Successful outcome will advance structural knowledge of KATP regulation
in health and disease, and shift KATP pharmacology towards a structure-based paradigm to significantly impact
the field. It will also have broad implications for other ABC transporters and ion channels critical for human health."

 The goal of this proposal is to reveal mechanisms by which gene regulatory proteins overcome chromosome
structural barriers, to change cell fates. The work will provide foundational insight into gene regulation and more
efficient ways to generate new cell types for therapy and disease modeling. The proposal extends from 38 years
of research on my R01 grant, to dissect the interplay between pioneer transcription factors and initially targeted

complexity of mammalian heterochromatin states. Work on both grants revealed that after the initial closed
chromatin binding by pioneer factors, a rate-limiting step of cell reprogramming is the inefficiency of activating
genes in H3K9me3 heterochromatin. We defined pioneer transcription factors by their ability to target a DNA
motif, or a partial motif, on a nucleosome, and thereby initiate cooperative events in DNase/ATAC-resistant,
transcriptionally silent chromatin bound by linker histone. Yet despite the ability to target linker histone-
compacted chromatin in vitro and in vivo, we and others found that some, but not all, pioneer factors are impeded
from binding H3K9me3 heterochromatin, leading us to investigate how certain pioneer factors can target such
heterochromatin. In the past grant period, our biochemical, structural, single molecule tracking, genomic, and
long-read sequencing approaches revealed that pioneer factors interact with core histones to facilitate
nucleosome binding and chromatin opening, that pioneer factors use unstructured domains for opening and
linker histone displacement, and that a pioneer factor licenses a nucleosome remodeler to further open local
chromatin. Having genetically identified amino acids on pioneer factors for binding nucleosomes, not free DNA,
in vitro allows us to assess, in vivo, truly pioneering events by the factors. We discovered diverse proteins
functionally bound to heterochromatin that repress genes and DNA repeats and are associated with varying
H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks, thereby defining heterochromatin subtypes. We propose to categorize pioneer
factors by the subtypes of heterochromatin that they target. We will use transcription factor binding to in vitro
heterochromatin reconstituted on nucleosome arrays, pulldowns between transcription factors and biochemically
fractionated heterochromatin, and genetic approaches in mice and cell cultures to define protein domains on
pioneer factors that enable heterochromatin subtype targeting and local chromatin opening, and that can be
transferred to other proteins to enhance reprogramming. We will use our dual-degron technology and knock-
downs to reveal how mammalian H3K9me3 heterochromatic domains are established and can be disassembled
selectively, to enhance reprogramming. We will determine the basis for, and utility of, our discovery of a transient
global disruption of heterochromatin elicited by reprogramming pioneer factors. The work will be performed in a
research environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our approaches will reveal basic genetic
mechanisms and will be applied to improving directed cell fate changes for biomedical purposes."

11094633,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In response to PA-20-272, this supplement requests funds to upgrade the computer infrastructure of the
Scalable Informatics for Biomedical Imaging Studies (SIBIS). SIBIS has been daily used by National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence to Adulthood (NCANDA-A) since it started
recruiting its 831 participants in 2013. NCANDA-A annually acquires data on these participants (age 12 to 21
years at baseline) across 5 sites. Each site uses SIBIS web applications for data acquisition (e.g., self-reported
questionnaires) or upload (e.g. MRI, DTI, resting state fMRI). The data are then managed, quality controlled,
harmonized, analyzed, and distributed by the NCANDA-A Data Analysis Resource (DAR) via SIBIS.
NCANDA-A has 4 main aims. With respect to Aim 1, the consortium has been investigating the impact of
excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on subsequent developmental
trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and psychopathology. For Aim 2, NCANDA-
A identifies neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which alcohol’s effects on brain structure and
function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3 focuses on data-driven analysis to
identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g., age of drinking onset) that forecast
excessive drinking during early adulthood. Regarding Aim 4, NCANDA-A has been quantifying the impact of
the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and their relations with
alcohol use patterns. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history, impact of
alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors are tested.
The DAR, whose mPIs are Drs. Pohl and Pfefferbaum, manages the data in line with five aims. Aim D1
ensures that procedures for collection and quality control of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical
assessment data are standardized. For Aim D2, the DAR has been advancing the existing informatics
infrastructure for integrating data collected across all sites. Aim D3 targets enhancing macrostructural,
microstructural, and functional neuroimage processing and analysis. Regarding Aim D4, the DAR creates
machine (deep) learning frameworks identifying predictive markers of early adulthood drinking. Finally, for Aim
D5, they maintain data sharing and distribution systems for consortium PIs and the scientific public at large.
The DAR has been supporting these aims in part with a computer infrastructure that was purchased over 10
years ago. Within the next 12 months, this hardware will be insufficient for preserving the high level of security
and fulfill the computational and storage needs of NCANDA. The DAR therefore requests funding for upgrading
the computer infrastructure of SIBIS (Aim S1). Continuing the stable management of data will be central for
NCANDA to continue with thoroughly tracking its participants, whose longitudinal data are critical for tracking
the impact of heavy alcohol drinking on brain development during adolescence and adulthood."
11095491,"The proposed supplement is relevant to the INCLUDE project, by enhancing our understanding
of hearing loss, a co-occurring condition in Down Syndrome (DS), specifically in children. We
focus on an aspect of INCLUDE Component 1: Targeted, high risk-high reward, basic
science studies in areas highly relevant to DS. The parent grant has shown success to date
in recruitment and testing of young adults with DS, however, there is also a paucity of auditory
studies in children with DS. The incidence of hearing loss in infants and children with DS is
higher than in the general population. While the Center for Disease Control reports that up to
75% of children with DS are affected by hearing loss (Data statistics on Down Syndrome, 2019),
screening is not standard. Many children with DS who pass universal newborn hearing
screenings are identified with significant hearing loss at older ages, thus, hearing loss can go
undetected during development. If detected, the type/degree of hearing loss and thus treatment,
need to be incorporated into clinical practices that serve children with DS. The compounded
impact of hearing loss on developmental delays that occur in children with DS remains
unknown. The goal of the supplement is to collet pilot data in children with DS,
establishing feasibility for a new parent R01 on auditory function and its association with
cognition, language and brain structure and function in children with DS. The research will
be conducted at the Waisman Center, a premier research institute at the University of
Wisconsin Madison, where the PI’s lab is situated. Waisman is one of the named Intellectual &
Developmental Disabilities (IDD) Research Centers in the US, where scientific discovery is
aimed at advancing knowledge and developing treatment in developmental disabilities. This
project will leverage important, unique resources at the Waisman Center: (1) Auditory
perceptual measures of hearing speech in noise, spatial hearing and brain function using EEG
were developed for young listeners in the Litovsky lab, recently implemented in the parent R01
for young adults with DS, will be piloted and revised as needed for a younger population of
children with DS. (2) Cognitive measures and MRI neuroimaging to evaluate brain structure are
well established in the Hartley’s lab, and in the Alexander lab, respectively. (3) The Waisman
Center will be launching a new research cohort development project, under Hartley’s leadership,
that will bring dozens of children with DS to the Waisman Center, providing a robust participant
pool for this supplement."
11096925,"This supplemental grant will remove the significant bottleneck in the 3-D imaging of cleared brains.
We request a Keyence BZ-X810 automated fluorescent microscope ($182,860). The considerable advantage
of this microscope is that it uses a structured UV light, which performs the optical sectioning as a confocal
microscope does, while at a significantly faster speed by using a CCD sensor instead of point scanning,
resulting in 20x faster scanning in BZ-X810 comparing with Leica SP8 confocal microscope, which we are
currently using. The current confocal setting (Leica SP8) would spend 40 hours per brain, but the proposed
system can scan it in 2 hours, and much less photobleaches fluorescent signals of the samples. The
scanning speed is a significant bottleneck for the proposed Specific Aim 2-2, “addressing if the dopaminergic
and/or GABAergic nervous systems are dysregulated in cavefish comparing with surface fish, and whether
these neural disregulations are adjusted under the ketogenic diet treatment”. We plan to scan 116 brains in
the Aim 2-2 as a minimum; thus, 232 hrs (10 full-days in BZ-X810) vs. 4,640 hrs (over 6 months in Leica
SP8) of scannings. We are able to reduce the duration of 3-D scanning with the current SP8 system by
restricting the imaging field. However, since we have discovered the brain-wide hyperactivities in the asocial
cavefish population, restricting the imaging fields will significantly limit our ability to identify the activity
signatures of neurons associated with stereotypic repetitive behavior. Above all, the requested equipment will
remove the current bottleneck in the 3-D imaging of cleared brains. In addition, since this microscope is easy
to use, we also offer spot uses of this BZ-X810 to microscope users. After our quick survey, we have heard
from a few potential users about quick 3-D scans of their samples. Our department chair is highly favorable to
support this supplemental grant, too."

Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling pathways respond to a wide variety of stress conditions,
including DNA damage, oxidative stress, heat shock, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hyper- and hypo-osmotic
stress, shear stress, and a growing number of chemical toxins. We are interested in two general questions.
First, how do diverse stressors activate a small number of evolutionarily conserved SAPKs? We have
developed evidence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that a multitude of stress signals stimulate the two yeast
SAPK pathways – the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway and the High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway –
through intracellular inputs at various points along these pathways, rather than signaling from the cell surface.
Second, how does the cell mobilize coherent, stress-specific outputs from an activated SAPK? The canonical
stress pathways respond to cell wall stress (CWI pathway) and high external osmolarity (HOG pathway), but
many stresses require the activated SAPKs to drive unrelated responses. We use the two SAPK pathways of
yeast as models for understanding the complexity of stress inputs to SAPKs, as well as stress-specific outputs
from activated SAPKs. This proposal is focused on identifying and characterizing the stress-specific
components and pathways that feed into the two yeast SAPK cascades. Aim 1 is to understand the role of
SAPK Hog1 in the intracellular activation of SAPK Mpk1 by heat shock. We have found that heat shock signals
both through the canonical CWI SAPK pathway and, independently, through a Hog1-dependent input to either
Mpk1 itself or its immediately upstream kinase, Mkk1. We propose a combined, biochemical, mass
spectrometric approach, together with a genetic screen to identify and characterize the pathway between Hog1
and Mpk1. Aim 2 is to identify and characterize intracellular inputs to the HOG pathway cascade by curcumin,
a promising cancer and Alzheimer’s therapeutic. We have identified two separate curcumin-induced inputs to
the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway, one at the MEK kinase Ssk2 and the other at Ypd1, a component of the
HOG pathway phospho-relay. We propose a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches
and a genetic screen to identify novel pathway components to these two inputs. Aim 3 is to identify and
characterize the intracellular input to the HOG pathway by acetic acid stress. We have identified an input to the
HOG pathway from acetic acid that activates Hog1 either at the level of its MEK Pbs2, or at Hog1 itself. We
have also found that acetic acid stress is unusual in that it induces a stable interaction between Hog1 and its
MEK Pbs2. Our favored hypothesis is that this stress activates Hog1 through recruitment of a scaffold protein.
We propose a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches to understand the basis for
Hog1 activation by acetic acid, as well as the stress-specific Hog1 output elicited by this stress. Completion of
these aims will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which these stress signals activate SAPKs."

11094166,"Project Summary/Abstract
Early blindness results in dramatic neuroplasticity within the human brain; anatomical and functional organization
is altered at almost every level, ranging from neurotransmitter balance to neural function. I plan to combine
psychophysics, computational functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion-weighted MR imaging
(dMRI), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the anatomical, neural, and computational constraints of
plasticity following early blindness. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that cortical plasticity resulting from
early blindness may share many of the same underlying mechanisms as ‘neuronal recycling, whereby the
development of novel cortical functions (such as reading in sighted individuals) relies on the ‘recycling’ of
evolutionarily older circuits that originally evolved for different, but similar, functions.
I plan to examine this idea in the context of cross-modal plasticity within the visual motion area hMT+. Area
hMT+, which processes visual motion in sighted individuals, responds selectively to auditory motion in early blind
individuals. In Aim 1, using a combination of dMRI and fMRI, I will examine if the cross-modal responses to
auditory motion within hMT+ in early blind individuals co-localizes with pre-existing anatomical connectivity
between hMT+ and the auditory motion area right planum temporale (rPT). In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis
that auditory motion processing in EB is influenced by the spatiotemporal tuning within hMT+, using a
combination of psychophysics and fMRI. In Aim 2, I will also examine whether the recruitment of hMT+ for
auditory motion processing in early blind individuals results in a loss of sensitivity to auditory motion in rPT.
Finally, in Aim 3, using a combination of psychophysics and fMRI, I will see if auditory motion responses in hMT+
can be explained by a classic model of divisive normalization that has been extensively used to model hMT+
visual motion responses in sighted individuals. By including MRS GABA measurements, I will further test whether
the lower signal to noise associated with auditory rather than visual motion input results in an adaptive reduction
in suppression, mediated by lower GABA concentrations.
The training will focus on computational fMRI, dMRI, and MRS, which will augment my background in
characterizing diverse human perceptual experiences using psychophysics and modeling. My mentors at the
University of Washington (Drs. Ione Fine, Ariel Rokem, and Scott Murray) will provide excellent training in all the
techniques used in this proposal. The award will provide an important opportunity for me to uniquely position
myself in the field as an independent researcher with a strong research program that investigates the
neuroanatomical basis of plasticity following visual deprivation."

Peroxisomes are ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles that form a focal point for multiple metabolic pathways. Lipid
metabolism, and in particular, fatty acid transport related to it, depend heavily on peroxisomal membrane
proteins that have specifically evolved for such purposes. The ATP-dependent cassette (ABC) transporters of
‘D’ subfamily’ reside in the peroxisomal membrane and are responsible for fatty acid import into the
peroxisomes, defects in which process are related to various metabolic disorders. Mutations in ABCD1 cause
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) which manifests as mild to severe central nervous system (CNS)
demyelination. Dysfunction of ABCD3 and/or peroxisome biogenesis factors (PEXs) may cause Zellweger
syndrome (ZS), a heterogeneous group of peroxisome assembly disorders. In addition to inherited diseases,
reduced peroxisomal function is associated with aging and pathogenesis of age-related acquired diseases like
diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders. Key gaps in understanding the function of ABCDs in metabolism and
disease are due to lack of structural details, particularly of their conformational plasticity during substrate
transport, and how this is compromised during aging and disease. My goal is to understand the involvement
of peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, specifically
Alzheimer’s disease and ultimately to lead a research group as an independent researcher in this area.
I propose to elucidate the structural basis for function of ABCDs at atomic level using CryoEM in the absence
and presence of substrate, and ATP (Aim 1a and 1b, mentored), coupling between ATPase and thioesterase
activity, and fatty acid binding and transport (Aim 2a and 2b, mentored). I will determine atomic structures of
ABCDs in complex with PEXs (Pex3 and Pex19) using CryoEM (Aim 3a, mentored) and assess alterations in
peroxisomal morphology using Cryo-Electron Tomography; function and membrane composition of ABCD(1-3)
knockdown cell lines, aged cells and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model cell lines (Aim 3b, 3c, 3d mentored/
independent phase). These aims foster my long-term aim of studying peroxisome function and its relation to
cellular physiology and disease, while obtaining training and experience in forefront tools of structural
biophysics. For executing these aims, I have support of a very strong team of mentors, consultants and
advisors. My mentor Prof. Robert Stroud is a pioneer in membrane protein structure and mechanism, my co-
mentor Prof. Peter Walter is a pioneer in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and specializes in cell and
organelle biology. My co-mentor Dr. Adam Frost is at the forefront of CryoEM/CryoET. Consultant Prof. Eric
Verdin is a leading scientist in aging. Consultant Prof. Martin Kampmann is discovering new molecular players
in AD. Scientific advisors Prof. Yifan Cheng pioneered CryoEM and Prof. Charles Craik has developed
antibody and Fab libraries as tools. Together, this proposal will utilize their expertise in the respective fields,
while leveraging my passion to study organellar biology through a structural lens."

PROJECT SUMMARY
G-qudruplex (G4) is a noncanonical secondary structure that can form in both DNA and RNA. Human genome
contains over 400,000 potential G4 forming sequences (PQS) and they are highly enriched in upstream of
oncogene promoters and regulatory genes, strongly suggesting a switch-like function with programed positioning.
PQS is also prevalent in e. coli genome, located in important regulatory regions. Indeed, many studies have
demonstrated the role of G4 in up or downregulating genomic processes including replication, transcription and
translation. Our recent study demonstrated that in transcription, G4 forming sequence located in the non-
template strand leads to a robust formation of R-loop (mRNA annealed to template strand), which in turn, induces
G4 structure in the non-template strand. Remarkably, such R-loop/G4 structure drives enhanced transcription
by a mechanism that involves successive formation and release of R-loop. We show that when positioned in a
plasmid i.e under torsional constraint, such G4/R-loop structure can tune the transcription activity up or down
depending on the distance from the transcription start site. Furthermore, 5’UTR-G4 bearing mRNA (RG4) leads
to over 10-fold enhanced translation in a cell-free system and in e.coli cells. Upon testing several plausible
hypotheses, we propose that the RG4 structure promotes translation by blocking ribosomes from sliding off the
mRNA. Building on these exciting new findings, we propose to investigate the impact of G4, R-loop and
supercoiling in transcription and translation primarily in T7 RNAP system and in e. coli cells. By combining
quantitative biochemical tools and newly developed single molecule platforms suited to measure stepwise
progression of transcription in a linear or plasmid DNA, we will examine how different sequence, length and
position of G4 forming sequence leads to R-loop formation, mRNA output and protein production. Accomplishing
the proposed goals will reveal the structure-function relationship of how G4, R-loop and supercoiling regulates
transcription and translation activity.

11096910,"Trauma is responsible for 180,000 deaths annually in the United States and accounts for 59% of deaths in the
population younger than 45 years. 86% of preventable deaths are related to sequalae of massive torso
hemorrhage. Rapid precision diagnostic tools are needed to triage patients for early activation of massive
transfusion protocols and urgent surgical or angiographic hemostatic intervention to circumvent the vicious
cycle of acidosis, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and death resulting from exsanguination. Whole-body CT
angiography (WBCTA) is the workhorse screening and surgical planning modality for torso hemorrhage. Lethal
but preventable hemorrhage typically arises from pelvic fractures and organ lacerations, manifesting on
WBCTA as foci of contrast extravasation and pooled cavitary hemorrhage (e.g., pelvic hematoma, hemothorax,
or hemoperitoneum). Rapid assessment of WBCTA can result in earlier intervention, with associated survival
benefit, but interpretation delays are common and increase with severity of injury, transfusion requirement, and
mortality risk due to the increasing complexity of polytrauma. Round-the-clock expertise in trauma imaging is
concentrated in select high-volume level I trauma centers, and community or teleradiology practices may lack
experience interpreting trauma WBCTA studies. Clinical indices such as the Shock Index have limited
sensitivity as screening tools for forecasting actionable hemorrhage-related outcomes. WBCTA computer
aided diagnosis (CAD) tools that detect bleeding pelvic fractures and organ lacerations, classify severity grade,
and deliver precise voxelwise volumetric measurements of multicavitary hemorrhage burden will accelerate
and standardize image analysis, reduce turnaround time for reporting of critical results, improve the accuracy
and objectivity of clinical decision making, and ultimately reduce time to life-saving hemorrhage control
interventions. To capitalize on the benefits of point-of-care CT-based CAD tools in the fast-paced, and safety
critical trauma care setting, such tools must be rapid, accurate, generalizable, and elicit a high level of end-
user trust. To minimize bias, ensure clinical utility, and maximize robustness for turn-key deployment in future
multicenter clinical trials, tools must scale to large diverse populations, and achieve human factors engineering
goals established through expert target user input. Our team will bring to bear combined technical and clinical
expertise in trauma radiology, medical image processing, and human-centered software design to create an
orchestrated suite of rapid, accurate, clinically relevant, and user-centered CAD tools for torso hemorrhage. In
Aim 1, we will leverage AI-assisted annotation to curate a uniquely large dataset of consecutive admission
trauma WBCTAs. In Aim 2, we will use human-centered design principles to develop a suite of interactive high-
trust CAD tools. In Aim 3, we will assess generalizability with a large out-of-sample dataset and assess user
acceptance with simulated deployment. The work will result in rapid, robust, and human-centered CAD tools
for detection, precision diagnostics, and personalized decision support for hemorrhage-control interventions."

 Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a major public health burden. Over
500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. alone, with as many as 64% complicated by
CSA-AKI. Those who develop CSA-AKI have a 6- to 18-fold higher acute mortality compared to those without
CSA-AKI. No pharmacologic therapy reliably prevents or treats CSA-AKI. Based on a strong pathophysiologic
rationale from both animal models and human studies, we propose that hepcidin and other heme/iron
regulatory proteins play a key role in CSA-AKI.
 In Aims 1 and 2, we will leverage the CABG Genomics Project, a large prospective cohort study of adult
patients who underwent cardiac surgery. CABG Genomics collected detailed clinical data and biospecimens,
including plasma/serum samples pre- and postoperatively at multiple time points. In Aim 1, we will measure
plasma hepcidin preoperatively in 2,000 patients to test its association with CSA-AKI. We will use multivariable
models to adjust for potential confounders, including plasma IL-6. We will externally validate our findings using
samples from the TRIBE-AKI study, which enrolled 1219 high-risk adults who underwent cardiac surgery at 6
sites in North America. In Aim 2, we will measure plasma hepcidin, free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, hemopexin,
transferrin saturation, and ferritin longitudinally in a nested 1:1 case-control study (n=600) to test whether early
changes in these markers are independently associated with CSA-AKI.
 In Aim 3, we will enroll 250 high-risk adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at three major hospitals
in Boston. We will isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells pre- and postoperatively to investigate the
relationship between monocyte expression of ferroportin and other heme/iron regulatory proteins, examined by
flow cytometry, with CSA-AKI. We will also assess whether early postoperative changes in monocyte
expression of ferroportin and other heme/iron regulatory proteins are associated with CSA-AKI.
 Investigating the hepcidin-ferroportin-iron axis and other heme/iron regulatory proteins in the setting of
CSA-AKI could have actionable implications for the design of future trials to prevent CSA-AKI. Unlike many
other markers previously examined in CSA-AKI, those proposed here are directly involved in the pathogenesis
of CSA-AKI and are targetable. This proposal will help determine the therapeutic strategy targeting disordered
iron homeostasis that has the highest likelihood of success. If low preoperative hepcidin is confirmed as an
independent risk factor for CSA-AKI, prophylactic administration of hepcidin agonists, which are currently in
development, could be tested in future studies of CSA-AKI prevention. Alternatively, if the proposed studies
reveal that other heme/iron regulatory proteins (e.g., haptoglobin, CD163, HO-1) have a greater influence on
CSA-AKI than hepcidin/ferroportin, therapeutic strategies targeting these proteins could be tested."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We will continue our study of biopolymers and their interactions at two levels. At the molecular
network level, we will study the A) probability landscape of stochastic networks of molecular
reactions. We will develop efficient computational tools to construct exact probability landscapes in
high-dimension, quantify probability discrete fluxes, and characterize their exact topology. These
powerful tools will be applied to gain mechanistic understanding of stochastic control of network
phenotypes in a number of important biological problems. At the (sub)cellular level, we will study B)
biophysics of 3D chromatin folding. We will develop algorithms to identify driver interactiomes that
can generate large ensembles of accurate models of single-cell 3D chromatin conformations
consistent with Hi-C and single-cell experimental data. Our methods will be applied to study
foundational problems of 3D genome to gain understanding of principles of genome organization.
In A), we will study stochastic reaction networks of molecules to gain mechanistic understanding of
their behavior. Many important cellular processes involve a small copy number of molecules of
transcription factors, enzymes, and signaling molecules. Stochasticity and rare events arising from
such low copy number reactions are important for processes such as embryonic development, stem
cell differentiation, and nongenetic heterogeneity. Our approach will be based on the fundamental
framework of the stochastic kinetic processes and the discrete chemical master equation (dCME).
The central tasks are: 1) constructing the probability landscape of the network, and from which to 2)
gain analytical insight into mechanism of network behavior. For 1), we have developed the ACME
method that can construct the exact probability landscapes of a large class of complex stochastic
reaction networks and will make further improvement. For 2), we will develop landscape analysis
tools using persistent homology that can compute the exact topology of the high-dimensional
probability landscape. We have also developed the concept of discrete fluxes and methods for its
computation. We will further formulate and generalize the concept of discrete rotational flux to higher
dimension. These developments will enable global and mechanistic understanding of the behavior of
stochastic networks through accurately constructed probability landscape and exactly computed
topological structures. Our work will open up new frontiers for investigations, many of which are
currently not computationally feasible. Specifically, we will construct probability landscapes of
networks, study how global flux maps evolve and how phenotype switching occur. We will generalize
the discovery of stochastic oscillation and investigate higher-order oscillatory behavior of networks,
where probability mass may be transferred through higher-dimensional k-channels. In addition, we
will carry-out in-depth analysis on a selected set of important biological problems, including stochastic
control of mRNA splicing/transcription at single-cell level, initiation of protein fibril aggregation,
network architectures for multi-stability and maintenance of epigenetic states, and switching of
cellular phenotypes.
In B), we will study the biophysical principles of 3D genome organization. We will develop
computational tools to generate thoroughly sampled large ensembles of coarse-grained polymer
models of 3D chromatin structures based on experimental Hi-C and other data. We will develop
strategies to study a number of fundamental problems: We will determine and uncover the minimal
sets of critical driver interactions sufficient to determine folding of chromatin at specific loci and at
whole chromosome level. We will further investigate how chromatin-nuclear envelope interactions,
along with chromatin driver interactome, nuclear bodies, and speckles, orchestrate the overall 3D
genome organization. We will decipher the persistent driver interactomes at different genomic loci,
which are preserved across different tissues and are responsible for the formation of common
genomic structural scaffolds and folding landscapes. We will also identify adaptive interactomes that
differ among tissues and inferring how they evolve and rewire during development. We will further
infer how these temporally evolving structural interactomes spatially arrange genomic elements and
how they may influence structural gene accessibility at genome scale.

 Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is thought to be among the most prevalent central nervous system
disorders and contributes significantly to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. However, our
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms is limited due to technical constraints hindering direct
examination of cerebral small vessel integrity. Currently, we rely on MRI scans to detect white matter
hyperintensities as a marker of CSVD, but this method lacks sensitivity and specificity. Although it is difficult
and expensive to use imaging tests on the brain, it may be possible to detect CSVD by imaging the eye,
specifically the retina. The retina and brain share similar anatomic and physiologic features, and retinal
changes can be easily detected. Our research aims to a novel imaging technique which will detect precise
changes in capillary function by tracking high-order hemodynamics in retinal capillaries. To achieve this, we
will develop a new high-speed wide-field adaptive optics near-confocal ophthalmoscope (AONCO) with a
green light capable of precisely assessing higher-order flow dynamics in retinal capillaries to detect and
monitor CSVD. Our research has three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a new high-speed wide-field AONCO,
which is capable of precisely assessing higher-order flow dynamics in retinal vessels of various sizes, from
the largest arterioles to the smallest capillaries. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate AONCO-measured retinal
capillary pulsatile hemodynamics as a sensitive biomarker of CSVD. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel
machine learning (ML) approach for fully automatic analysis of flow dynamics in retinal vessels using
AONCO and compare the ML measurements to conventional measurements. Our research has the potential
to offer groundbreaking insights into microcirculation at the capillary level, providing crucial information about
the vascular health of the central nervous system. This is particularly important given the prevalence of small
vessel abnormalities and their impact on microvascular health, with significant implications for our
understanding of CSVD."

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)
have different underlying pathophysiological substrates. It follows, then, that these disorders may
affect the visual system in different ways. Structural and functional changes in the visual system
are critical to understanding and treating symptoms and impairments that impact quality of life.
Structure, as revealed by imaging of the retina, an outgrowth of the brain that is amenable to
direct visualization, can provide potential biomarkers to aid in the monitoring of disease
progression. Advances in in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging over the past few
decades have shown that eyes of patients with AD and PD have generalized thinning of inner
retinal layers associated with the ganglion cells, and microvascular changes. However, such
changes likely do not directly reflect the primary pathology across the spectrum of
neurodegenerative diseases.
Deciphering different manifestations of the ocular component to neurodegenerative disease
requires a clear step forward in the level of detail provided by approaches to image the retina. To
achieve this, we propose to develop and optimize the next generation of visible light optical
coherence tomography (OCT), with 1 micrometer depth resolution, and associated machine
learning tools, for imaging and quantifying ocular neurodegeneration. Our visible light OCT
instrument achieves 3-5x better resolution than commercial near-infrared OCT systems. The
improved resolution provides a uniquely stratified view of cellular architecture in the inner nuclear
layer (INL) and of synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), potentially providing in vivo insights
into circuit- or cell-specific retinal changes that have been reported in both AD and PD.
Performing OCT in the visible light range is also significant because macular pigments, which are
associated with cognition, are detectable and quantifiable through novel approaches. In addition,
hyperspectral information in the visible light range purportedly detects protein deposits in the
retina. In fact, our preliminary results suggest the ability to both localize hyper-reflective features
in an amyloid AD mouse model and to decipher their hyperspectral signatures.
Guided by basic studies in mice that verify the relationship of imaging features to disease
pathophysiology, we will investigate the potential for visible light OCT measures and markers to
distinguish eyes of persons with MCI (AD) and PD, both between disorders and with comparison
to cognitively and neurologically normal controls of similar age. Based on the premise that
oculomics is enhanced by placing the eye in the context of the entire visual pathway, our research
plan, supported by our team’s expertise, will integrate advanced imaging with visual function
testing and quality of life measures."
11093654,"Abstract. The New York City area has faced a surge of cases early on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United
States leading to destabilization of multiple health care systems that could not keep up with the high demand for
critical care use and mortality. The heterogenous evolution among critically ill COVID-19 patients, high mortality
and prolonged ICU stay highlights the need to better understand individual’s endotype that could expose
treatable traits among these septic patients. As the first set of cases arrived to NYU, we built a biorepository of
samples from the lower airways and blood from these critically-ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We have
already explored the lower airway microbial environment including the virome, bacteriome and host immune
response. In our recent report using cross sectional lower airway samples from 142 critically ill COVID-19
patients published in Nature Microbiology we identified microbial and host signatures associated with poor
outcome, predominantly driven by poorly controlled viral replication, blunted anti-Spike/anti-RBD IgG response
and distinct host transcriptomic profile. However, in order to understand the mechanism underlying this poor viral
control we need to study samples at earlier time points and longitudinally. We are currently using these samples
to characterize the longitudinal viral and host transcriptome dynamics. However, the critical molecular immune
mediators need to be explored using metabolomic approaches while the distinct cellular immune responses may
require single cell approaches. In this application we will use our existing biorepository and expand it with new
cases to test the hypothesis that airway and systemic endotyping with novel scRNA sequencing and
metabolomic approaches predicts poor outcome in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thus, we propose to
expand and optimize our biorepository of airway and systemic samples in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients (R21
phase) in order to perform scRNA sequencing and metabolomic approaches in order to endotype the airway
and systemic environment to evaluate for associations with poor clinical outcome (R33 phase). To accomplished
these aims we will use our expertise in the characterization of the lower airway microbiome (including the viral
fraction) and the host immune profile. Therefore, this is an unprecedented opportunity to conduct the necessary
exploratory investigations on paired lower airway and systemic samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Lay summary. Acute COVID-19 infection has had unprecedented effects on human health with critically ill
patients suffering high critical care resources and mortality. In this project, we will use and expand our
biorepository of lower airway and blood samples to explore novel ways to determine molecular signatures that
can predict patients’ poor clinical outcomes."
11094220,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of healthcare- and community-associated infections. Moreover,
K. pneumoniae is frequently resistant to last line antibiotics like third generation cephalosporins and
carbapenems. In fact, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella is considered an Urgent Threat by the CDC requiring
aggressive, immediate action. One of the five core actions proposed by the CDC to combat antibiotic resistance
is for continued investment and development of vaccines to prevent K. pneumoniae as well as other drug
resistant bacterial infections. As such, VaxNewMo developed a multivalent conjugate vaccine targeting the
majority of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. Conjugate vaccines, composed of a polysaccharide covalently linked
to a carrier protein, are life-saving vaccines used to prevent disease from multiple bacterial pathogens.
Conventionally, conjugate vaccines are manufactured using chemical conjugation, which is notoriously complex,
labor intensive, and imprecise, hindering the development of new conjugate vaccines against existing and
emerging bacterial threats, like K. pneumoniae. Well aware of these drawbacks, VaxNewMo has been advancing
an alternative method for manufacturing conjugate vaccines that utilizes prokaryotic glycosylation systems in a
process termed bioconjugation. VaxNewMo’s proprietary bioconjugation platform relies on a conjugating enzyme
to transfer a bacterial polysaccharide to a carrier protein all within the lab safe bacterium E. coli. Moreover, since
bioconjugation is an enzyme driven process, the conjugates produced are non-derivatized and are therefore
structurally identical to those presented to immune cells by the pathogen itself. Bioconjugation can be used to
rapidly produce many conjugates simply by introducing new genetic information encoding for a different
polysaccharide serotype into a bioconjugation competent strain of E. coli. As an example of this, we developed
a multivalent O-antigen bioconjugate vaccine targeting >80% of K. pneumoniae isolates encountered in the clinic.
In this Fast-Track application, we will validate the vaccine for immunogenicity and subsequently determine
optimized doses in mice and rabbits, assess functional antibody responses as well as vaccine efficacy by
performing challenge studies. In Phase I, we will assess immunogenicity of monovalent and multivalent O-
antigen bioconjugate formulations by performing dose-escalation studies in mice. Immunogenicity will be
assessed by ELISA for serotype-specific total IgG and IgG subtype antibody concentrations pre- and post-
immunizations to each O-antigen formulated into the vaccine. Once validated for immunogenicity, we will
proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will produce the vaccine in larger batches using a scalable microbial
bioreactor system. Subsequently, we will assess functional antibody responses via a serum bactericidal assay
(SBA) and an opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPKA) as well as perform challenge studies in mice vaccinated
with a mouse optimized dose of the multivalent O-antigen bioconjugate vaccine. Finally, we will confirm
immunogenicity and functional antibody responses (SBA and OPKA) of monovalent and multivalent O-antigen
bioconjugate formulations in rabbits, a widely utilized animal model for conjugate vaccine development."
11096407,"Project Summary / Abstract
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates the activity, localization and stability of thousands of
proteins in the cell. By catalyzing the covalent attachment or removal of ubiquitin to target proteins, the
enzymes of the UPS regulate virtually every cellular process, including cell signaling, cell survival and cell
division. The widespread influence of the UPS on biology also has important consequences for human health,
as mutations in components of the UPS cause diseases such as cancer. Encouragingly, the vast number of
enzymes and protein-protein interactions in the UPS are also providing new drug targets to treat disease.
There is growing interest in developing drugs that either inhibit the UPS or harness its ability to eliminate
harmful proteins. For these reasons, mechanistic studies of the UPS have the potential to reveal new insights
into biological regulation and may also help us understand mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and reveal
opportunities for therapy.
The focus of this proposal is to discover new substrates of the UPS and to characterize the specificity and
regulation of enzymes that add and remove ubiquitin to these proteins. Although many components of the UPS
are well-studied, we still have little insight into the molecular targets for hundreds of UPS enzymes encoded in
the genome. This study will help fill this critical gap in our knowledge by identifying new enzyme-substrate
relationships and providing new insights into how the enzymes of the system are regulated. It will apply
modern quantitative proteomic methods to identify proteins that are modified by ubiquitin, and how these
modifications change during cell division. This study will systematically examine the ability of deubiquitylating
enzymes (DUBs) to remove ubiquitin from substrates, identifying new functional roles for these enzymes. The
study will also examine the substrate specificity and regulation of specific ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and
ubiquitin ligases, the proteins that conjugate ubiquitin to other proteins. Together, the experiments outlined in
this study will identify new enzyme-substrate relationships in the UPS and provide new insights into how the
UPS controls cell division. By defining these important regulatory pathways, the findings will provide a
framework for understanding how these pathways are altered in cancer and may provide new targets for the
development of drugs to treat disease."

The chromatin landscape of eukaryotic cells is decorated with landmarks characterized by covalent
modifications and variant nucleoprotein structures. In this proposed project, we aim to investigate the
R-octasome, a nucleosome-like particles but with a core made up of four H3 and H4 histones. We
recently solved the cryo-EM structure of the R-octasome and detected its presence in yeast using in
vivo crosslinking techniques. However, the biological function of R-octasomes remains unknown.
Preliminary data suggest that R-octasomes are associated with the telomeric repeats. Using a mutant
that disrupts R-octasome formation, our data suggest that its integrity is crucial for sub-telomeric gene
silencing. We hypothesize that R-octasomes are integral components of telomeric heterochromatin.
We proposed three aims to further study the biological roles of the R-octasome. Aim 1: Develop a
methodology to purify native R-octasomes from yeast for biochemical, genomic, and structural
studies. Aim 2: Investigate the role of R-octasomes in telomeric gene silencing and their function as
substrates of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Aim 3: Explore the role of R-octasomes in
higher-order chromatin organization. Our structural data suggest that R-octasomes can nucleate the
concatenation of additional H3 and H4 histones. Overall, the outcome of this research will provide
new insights into how eukaryotes use the highly conserved H3 and H4 as multi-functional substrates
to modulate genomic functions."
11097650,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Compared to non-Latinx White individuals, Latinx individuals (gender-inclusive term; includes Hispanics,
Latino/a/e) have 2-times the risk of kidney failure and face a disproportionate burden of structural racism and
kidney health disparities. Latinx individuals are less likely to receive pre-dialysis nephrology care compared to
non-Latinx White individuals and as a result, are less likely to initiate person-centered kidney replacement
therapy (KRT), such as kidney transplantation or home dialysis. Latinx individuals are instead more likely than
non-Latinx White individuals to begin KRT with a central venous catheter (CVC), which has a higher risk of
mortality (1.4-1.5-fold) and fatal infection (1.5-2-fold) compared to an arteriovenous fistula or graft. Our
community-partnered research team developed and tested NAVIGATE-Kidney, a multi-level, language and
culturally concordant community health worker (CHW) intervention for Latinx individuals with kidney failure who
receive maintenance hemodialysis. We hypothesize that our NAVIGATE-Kidney intervention will reduce the
composite primary endpoint, defined as time to transition to KRT and CVC use or death. Our funded parent
grant (U01 DK137272-01) allows us to move beyond dialysis center interventions by providing support to
Latinx individuals with chronic kidney disease stage 4. As part of the ERASE-KD consortium, the NAVIGATE-
Kidney protocol was reviewed by the NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP). The NIH ODP stated that this
study should be modified to an individually randomized group treatment (IRGT) trial to account for the
intraclass correlation (ICC) induced by the nesting of patients within the CHWs; otherwise, the analysis will
lead to an inflated type 1 error. The team modified the study design and it is now an IRGT; however, without
supplemental funding, we can only account for an ICC of 0. When clustering exists, it is very unlikely that the
ICC will be 0. To account for an ICC, we must increase our power by increasing the number of CHWs from 4
to 6. This will allow the team to detect a hazard ratio of 0.50 for a range of ICCs. There is no preliminary data
nor literature available to provide a reasonable estimate of the ICC of time to event endpoints of participants
with the same CHW for the population of our study. Findings from this IRGT will inform the ICC of future CHW
interventions including those interventions that are part of the ERASE-KD consortium. The team will work with
the ERASE-KD consortium and the NIH ODP to develop research methods for time-to-event IRGT. This
change constitutes an opportunity to advance kidney disease health equity science."

11097108,"EUCOMM Conditional Vector and ES Cell Clone Collection
Acquisition and Procurement Plan by the MMRRC at UC Davis
ABSTRACT
The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of California, Davis (MMRRC) is pleased
to submit this administrative supplement for support during the current grant year (ending January 31, 2025) in
response to EMAIL . This application proposes the procurement and acquisition of data, molecular vectors,
and ES cell clones for 2,751 genes targeted as knockout-first alleles produced by the EUCOMM project at
Helmholtz Zentrum Munich for the original EUCOMM Program. These genes are unique to the set of
conditionally-targeted genes produced by KOMP2 as part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium
(IMPC), are not already in the MMRRC, and are not readily available and accessible by the US research
community. Further, because the US research community continues to actively express interest in mouse
models expressing conditional alleles for use in their NIH-funded R01 research and other scientific projects,
ensuring availability and access to the EUCOMM collection is paramount. However, support for the
maintenance and preservation of this collection is being discontinued which puts their future availability for
research in jeopardy despite their continued use and interest. The cost to transfer ownership and stewardship
of this resource is a very small fraction (~3%) of what it would cost to recreate it using CRISPR-mediated
gene-targeting in ES cells. Once fully imported and incorporated into the MMRRC, the collection would be
available for distribution to the biomedical research community, especially NIH funded investigators who
continue to express interest in conditional, lacZ tagged alleles. As a result of the activities funded by this
administrative supplement, procurement and acquisition of the EUCOMM conditional alleles will exert a
sustained, powerful influence on research field(s) using conditional mouse models and the overall ORIP
mission to support a variety of resource and research centers that develop animal models of human biology
and disease for biomedical researchers not only in the US, but around the world. The costs to execute this
project are beyond the available support provided by the parent MMRRC grant to UC Davis. If awarded, funds
will be used to complete this project during the current grant year (ending January 31, 2025). A budget of
$534,139 total direct costs ($681,529 total costs) is requested to fund activities that all fall within the scope of
the parent award."
11098144,"Supplement Summary
I am requesting an administrative supplement for the purchase of a Cytiva ÄKTA Pure fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC) system. This FPLC system is capable of operating a variety of chromatography
columns, including preparative and analytical size exclusion, ion exchange and affinity columns. This equipment
will be crucial for completing the goals of my NIGMS R35 grant (R35GM144341) by allowing us to conduct
detailed biochemical and hydrodynamic analyses of at least three key protein complexes involved in the Wnt5a-
Ror morphogenetic pathway. Specifically, 1) during the course of our study of WNT5A mutations found in
Robinow syndrome patients, we discovered that the mutant proteins form aberrant disulfide bonds that result in
WNT5a dimerization or multimerization. High-resolution size exclusion chromatography is required to further
analyze the formation of these higher-order Wnt5a oligomers, and understand how they alter protein function
and contribute to Robinow pathogenesis. 2) In our ongoing analysis of the Wnt5a-Ror signaling target
Dishevelled (Dvl), it has become essential to separate the different Dvl complexes that mediate different modes
of Wnt signaling, including the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the noncaonical Wnt5a-Ror signaling.
A combination of high-resolution ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography is need to perform these
experiments. 3) Lastly, through affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS), we recently identified several
novel binding partners of the Wnt5a-Ror signaling target Kif26b. To investigate how these binding partners
interact with Kif26b and participate in Wnt5a-Ror signaling, we need to isolate and analyze the native Kif26b
complex from cell and tissue extracts. These experiments also critically depend on the use of the ÄKTA FPLC
system. My lab previously inherited an old FPLC system from a senior colleague. However, the old system, now
more than 25 years old, has deteriorated to the point that it is no longer in working conditions. It is also no longer
serviceable by the manufacturer. Therefore, the purchase of a new FPLC is crucial for the continuation and
successful completion of our R35-funded projects. It will likely also benefit other NIH investigators in the
department. My home department (Cell Biology and Human Anatomy at UC Davis School of Medicine) is
committed to provide space to house the new FPLC system, as well as funds for instrument maintenance."
11097896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Our program is devoted to understanding the function of biologically central transition metals. We here
focus on three key roles of transition-ion centers, and have assembled outstanding multidisciplinary teams to
attack them. The approaches to each incorporate a suite of advanced paramagnetic resonance techniques,
EPR/ENDOR/ESEEM, many of which we have developed. (a) 'Radical-SAM (S-adenosyl methionine)'
Enzymes: This enzyme superfamily is Nature's most widespread means of performing essential radical-based
chemistry. (i) With Broderick, we have demonstrated that throughout the superfamily, reductive SAM cleavage
generates an organometallic intermediate, , central to catalysis. We will probe the properties and reactivity of
 through EPR/ENDOR studies of multiple 's, in parallel with studies of synthetic -analogs prepared by
Suess. (ii) We revealed that regioselective cleavage of the SAM S−C5' bond to generate  upon SAM
reduction is Jahn-Teller (JT) enabled and active-site controlled. To understand this phenomenon we will study
it with a selected suite of SAM analogues bound in a correspondingly selected suite of RS enzymes, while
computationally exploring the fundamentals of the process with Mosquera. (iii) We will expand the study of the
RS catalytic mechanism, examining substrate transformations by epimerases and spliceases. (b) Mechanism
of Nitrogenase activation: With Dean, Seefeldt, and Raugei we have revealed how the nitrogenase MoFe
protein is activated to carry out perhaps the most challenging chemical transformation in biology, the reduction
of the N≡N triple bond, and have shown that the alternative V- and Fe-nitrogenases employ the same
mechanism. This latter finding will enable us to explore the structure of nitrogenase intermediates throughout
the entire catalytic cycle, using 1,2H/14N ENDOR of substrates. A remarkable achievement of Dean enables us to
monitor the 13C ENDOR of carbide central to the FeMo-co active center, as well. This study is enhanced through
the use of site-selectively 57Fe-labeled FeMo-co in enzyme prepared by Suess, a major advance in integrating
structure and function. (c) in vivo Mn2+ Speciation: We earlier established that EPR/ENDOR/ESEEM
provide an otherwise unavailable means of characterizing Mn2+ complexes in live cells. Our collaboration with
Daly now has shown that Mn2+ speciation is the strongest biological indicator of cellular resistance to ionizing
radiation (IR) throughout the tree of life. In the coming period we will explore a discovery of and correlation
between in vivo Mn2+ speciation, IR resistance, and aging, and test the hypothesis that our spectroscopies can
be used to devise optimized radiotherapy regimens for human tumors. In a dramatic new venture, a
collaboration with O'Halloran surprisingly indicates that Mn2+ ions play an important role in fertilization of
amphibian oocytes, and we will broaden and expand our studies of Mn2+ speciation by examining fertilization in
mammals. Synergy: Each of the enzyme systems addressed a problem of fundamental importance, while the
diversity of these Aims synergistically benefits each one."

Broad Objective: Maintaining anatomical symmetry in vertebrates is essential for proper
physiological function, and loss of symmetry in ribs and vertebrae can lead to serious conditions
such as scoliosis and impairments of appropriate breathing and posture. This project will
explore the developmental emergence of left-right symmetry, combining biological experiments
on wild-type mice and a model of early loss of symmetry with mathematical models of gene
expression and molecule distributions. Through these studies, the project will provide new
important insight into the determinants of body (a)symmetry.
Specific Aims and Research Design: The somites are the embryonic structures giving rise to
the vertebrae and rib cage. They are formed at early phases of embryonic development and
emerge progressively in pairs of paraxial mesoderm blocks on both sides of the midline in a
highly symmetric manner. The symmetry of the somites is actively maintained through
mechanisms controlled by retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Indeed, animals deficient in RA exhibit
an asymmetric somite formation. This proposal will investigate this RA-mediated symmetry
maintenance mechanisms by combining experiments on RA-deficient mice with mathematical
models of somitogenesis.
In Aim 1, to investigate the dynamical mechanism of somite formation in wild-type and RA-
deficient embryos, we will characterize finely the somite formation timing, period, and positions
in mouse embryos through live imaging techniques coupled with and topological data analysis.
In Aim 2, to study the genetic mechanism involved in the segmentation clock, which controls the
spatio-temporal formation of somites, the same live-imaging setup will be leveraged to extract
the dynamics of the segmentation clock in mouse embryos. This data will be used to develop
and specify a theoretical model of somitogenesis which will in turn allow exploring the
determinants of symmetry maintenance and its breakdown. To explore how asymmetry may
arise and be buffered by RA, Aim 3 proposes to study the origin of asymmetry in RA-deficient
mouse. It will rely on the development of computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyze
the global distribution of key signaling molecules as they are transported in fluids driven by cilia
movements. This will be coupled to reaction-diffusion systems and their dynamics will be
explored to investigate how RA-mediated mechanism can buffer any initial asymmetry in
molecular concentrations."

 This MIRA proposal presents my vision for how my research will evolve over the next five years and
culminates from our long-term, rigorous studies of the diverse structures and properties of supercoiled DNA
and its interaction with topoisomerases. Within cells, DNA is supercoiled and often constrained into small DNA
loops that can be experimentally recapitulated with supercoiled DNA minicircles small enough for use in a wide
range of biophysical and biochemical assays. The methods we have developed and extensive knowledge
acquired thus far will be invaluable for our proposed studies of DNA topoisomerases, actions of important
antimicrobial and anticancer agents that target them, the utility of engineered DNA minicircles as gene therapy
vectors, and supercoiling-induced noncanonical DNA structures that are implicated in human disease. We will
first utilize state-of-the-art electron cryo-microscopy and cryo-tomography to determine the 3-D structure of
topoisomerases bound to physiologically relevant DNA substrates. This approach will be coupled with
comprehensive quantitative assays using electrophoretic and fluorescence techniques and analytical
ultracentrifugation to characterize how DNA supercoiling so strongly affects topoisomerase-drug interactions.
Many topoisomerases, particularly those that are important drug targets, preferentially act on positively
supercoiled DNA. Consequently, corresponding anti-topoisomerase drugs interact with positively supercoiled
DNA as well, although research of chemotherapeutics that target topoisomerases has largely disregarded the
effect of supercoiled DNA on drug action. We plan to identify new inhibitors of validated drug targets by
screening, for the first time, active topoisomerase bound to positively supercoiled DNA against a library of over
5 billion diverse compounds. We will next apply our innovative tools and compelling data of how supercoiling,
curvature, and sequence dictate DNA conformation to design and construct DNA nanoparticles with specific,
desired shapes that are ideal for cellular uptake needed in a variety of clinical applications. Existing
nanoparticles, such as those composed of gold or monosaccharides, are inert; therefore, we propose utilizing
DNA minicircles, as both the vehicle and cargo in one, for gene therapy to overcome many of the barriers to
effective gene delivery. Finally, we will employ DNA minicircles to investigate how supercoiling promotes the
formation of non-B-DNA structures, which are known to impact DNA replication, repair, transcription, yet their
in vivo frequency is controversial. This work is transformative, as our novel DNA minicircles, advanced imaging
tools, and quantitative analyses will enable us to achieve unprecedented and previously unattainable insights
into the structure and function of supercoiled DNA. Our fundamental research will continue to challenge the
paradigm that DNA is passively acted upon by topoisomerases but instead drives numerous critical cellular
processes. Moreover, this project has substantial human therapeutic applications related to anti-topoisomerase
drug efficacy, improved gene therapy delivery, and mitigating genomic instability caused by non-B-DNA forms."
11091409,"Parkinson's disease (PD) culminates in dementia, immobility, and death at a huge societal cost. Even early in
the course, motor and cognitive dysfunction impairs instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Non-motor
symptoms due to fatigue, mood, sleep, and autonomic disorders further reduce quality of life (QoL). DTI shows
progressive decline in brain tissue integrity. Usual care of PD centers on medical and surgical treatments
relieve motor symptoms, but these cause side effects and lose efficacy over time. Usual treatment for non-
motor manifestations with pharmaceuticals (e.g., antidepressants) is symptomatic and not specific for PD.
Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors exert modest symptomatic benefits on dementia, but there is no approved
treatment for mild cognitive impairment. Physical Therapy is usually prescribed in later stages when mobility
impairment ensues. There is no approved standard exercise regimen for PD. There is no cure or disease
modifying treatment. Thus, there is a critical need for treatments that provide broad spectrum of benefits and
slow PD. Preliminary research suggests that aerobic exercise has potential to meet this need. However,
aerobic exercise is demanding and carries some risks. It is unknown if aerobic exercise is more beneficial than
usual care in PD in long term due to gaps in our knowledge about the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)
on brain tissue integrity, motor function, cognition, IADL, QoL, and disease progression. Limitations of current
studies include short duration, small sample size, lack or inadequacy of controls, lack of outcome measures for
cognition and IADL, and lack of biological markers to measure progression. Our objective in this application is
to fill the translational gap by determining the biological, clinical, and functional effects of long term aerobic
exercise (LTAE) in PD. Our overall hypothesis is that LTAE improves brain tissue integrity and slows
down PD. Our FIRST AIM is to determine the effects of LTAE on clinical features and functional abilities in PD.
Our prior 6-month, uncontrolled trial showed preliminary evidence that aerobic exercise improves aspects of
motor function, cognition, and QoL in PD, but long term outcomes and implication for functional abilities are
unknown. We hypothesize that LTAE will provide sustained improvement in motor function, cognition, and non-
motor symptoms with translation of benefits to QoL and IADL. We will test this with a one-year randomized
controlled trial (RCT) that compares the effects of moderate aerobic exercise vs usual care. We will use driving
as the outcome for IADL. Driving represents an important symbol for independence, and depends on integrity
of cognitive and motor systems. Our SECOND AIM is to determine the mechanism of LTAE effects in PD. CRF
reflects complex improvements in vascular, cardiac, and metabolic health from aerobic exercise. There is
preliminary evidence that higher CRF is associated with better brain health and motor/cognitive function, and
that aerobic exercise improves these outcomes. For example, our preliminary study showed improvement of
microtissue integrity in the striatum and white matter on DTI, but it is unclear how these changes counteract
PD progression over long term. Our hypotheses are: 1) LTAE will improve brain tissue integrity as indexed by
DTI, 2) LTAE effects on motor and cognitive function are mediated by changes in brain tissue integrity on DTI,
and 3) physiological processes leading to improved CRF from AE are critical to the benefits on the brain tissue
integrity and motor/cognitive function. We will test these hypotheses determining the effects of LTAE on CRF
and DTI, and the association between individual differences in training-related changes in motor and cognitive
function, DTI, and CRF. In summary, our proposal leverages our diverse interdisciplinary team, strong
preliminary data and past work, and unique infrastructure to determine if LTAE slows down neurodegeneration
and clinical disability in PD."

Each year, approximately 400 million people are infected with an arboviral disease from the bite of an Aedes
spp mosquito. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a leading public health threat due to their high competency to vector
multiple pathogens, their preference to bite humans, and their ability to adapt to new domestic environments. In
the US, reintroduction and establishment of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito populations has
resulted in local epidemics of Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the past decade. Unfortunately, mosquito control
programs in the US generally operate with limited budgets, forcing the majority of insecticide spraying to be
conducted in reaction to population exposure instead of targeted prevention, which has also contributed to
considerable growth of insecticide resistant populations, yielding a widening gap of infrastructure vulnerability.
Our current proposal aims to leverage existing technologies from non-health disciplines to advance mosquito
detection and abatement. We propose to validate the use of technology-driven mosquito traps that allow for high-
throughput identification and counting of Aedes mosquitos at various life stages to inform decision making when
selecting areas for insecticide spraying and abatement. Additionally, we propose to develop rigorous remote
sensing workflows for identification of neighborhood-level Aedes abundance risk and rapid detection of individual
Aedes mosquito breeding habitats on a household-level. This innovative proposal uses multi-year and real-world
mosquito data from two different metropolitan areas to statistically adjust for variances in geographic ecologies,
urban microclimates, seasonal climate patterns, and annual weather events. Our study will result in low-cost
tools immediately ready for broad distribution and integration by vector control agencies nationally. The
outcomes of our study have promise to directly impact vector control agency’s decision-making processes for
mosquito trapping site selection, inform preventative abetment protocols, and shorten the time required for
mosquito collection and identification. Further, integration of our proposed technology traps and informed site
selection maps will increase overall collection volumes while preserving scarce resources for local vector control
agencies. This proposal has the potential to create a paradigm shift in how we approach vector control globally,
with a targeted intervention resulting in significant economic, environmental, and clinical benefits."

Severe pain caused by osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 15 million individuals in the United States alone. This
degenerative joint disorder not only poses a significant healthcare burden for the country’s aging society, but
also fuels the national opioid crisis, as no effective treatments exist to treat OA-induced joint pain. Disease-
modifying therapeutic development for OA typically involves mechanistic and preclinical studies in small animal
models (mouse, rat), followed by studies in large animal models (horse, pig) to confirm effectivity and safety.
Unfortunately, pain-modifying therapeutic development for OA has thus far been hampered by a limited
knowledge of the types of neurons that innervate the joint, the connections they form, and their functional or
circuit dynamics in the presence of joint disease. The RE-JOIN consortium strives to fill these knowledge gaps
by adapting and optimizing cutting-edge, multidisciplinary technologies to label, image, and profile joint-
innervating neurons and by applying them in small animal models and patients with OA. Here, we propose a
set of experiments that will be complimentary to RE-JOIN’s ongoing efforts. In this proposal, we aim to
leverage neuronal tracing and profiling technologies developed under parent grant (UC2-AR082200), applying
them to the equine carpal joint to identify and characterize joint-innervating neurons. We aim to identify the
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that harbor carpal joint-innervating neurons (Viral neural tracing; Aim 1), develop
high-quality, complete transcriptomes of these DRGs that identify all tissue-specific isoforms (long-read RNA
sequencing; Aim 2), and perform multi-omic analysis of these DRGs to develop a spatial single cell reference
map that identifies the tissue’s individual cell types and their molecular fingerprints (spatial transcriptomics and
single nucleus RNA sequencing; Aim 3). The equine osteochondral chip model of post-traumatic OA has been
an excellent bridging translational model from small rodent to humans. The successful completion of research
proposed here will yield high-quality resources that will be shared with the scientific community, enabling future
studies to identify pain-mediating molecular and cellular changes that occur in the equine carpal joint
innervation during the development of joint disease. These resources will also enable translational researchers
to expand preclinical studies in equine models of OA to also include studies with chronic joint pain-modifying
therapeutic candidates, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding relevant new therapeutic targets to
effectively treat joint pain and/or solve the national opioid public health crisis."

Project Summary
During mitosis, the mother cell divides by the formation of a cleavage furrow, leaving two daughter cells
connected by a thin intercellular bridge. The resolution of this bridge, abscission, leads to the separation of the
two daughter cells. During ingression of the cleavage furrow, the central spindle microtubules are compacted
to form a structure known as the midbody (MB). It is now well established that MB regulates cytokinesis by
recruiting abscission-mediating proteins, such as ESCRT complex, as well as several regulators of abscission
checkpoint. Until recently, the MB was thought to be discarded after division by releasing it into extracellular
space. However, recently it was shown that MBs accumulate in stem and cancer cells after mitosis has been
completed (called MBsomes) and it has been proposed that MBsomes function as novel signalling platforms
that regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. Recently we developed a protocol for purification of post-
mitotic MBs and completed their proteomic and RNAseq analyses that led to identification of several mRNAs
and mRNA-binding proteins that accumulate at the MB. Importantly, MB-enriched mRNAs encode several
ESCRT complex subunits, as well as proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that these
MB-enriched mRNAs can be transferred to the neighboring cells via post-mitotic MB internalization. Based on
all of these findings, we hypothesize that targeting of selected mRNAs to the MB during cytokinesis play
a key role in regulating cell abcission and post-mitotic MBsome signaling. Here we propose three
specific aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will map and characterize the domain(s) within 3'-UTR that are
needed for mRNA targeting during cytokinesis. We will then use candidate approach, as well as proteomic and
CRISPR screens, to identify RNA-binding proteins that interact with these 3”-UTR domains and regulate
mRNA targeting and localized translation at the MB. Second, we will test the possibility that MB
accumulation/translation of ESCRT mRNAs mediates ESCRP complex targeting to the MB. Third, we will test
whether MBsome-dependent transfer of specific mRNAs, such as mRNA encoding proliferation regulator
CENP-E contribute to MBsome-induced cell proliferation."

quality single cell omics datasets using individual frozen mouse pituitaries. Together with the accompanying
advances in single cell bioinformatic analysis platforms developed by us and our collaborators, these
capabilities and results provide the foundation to achieve comprehensive insight into the layered epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms underlying cell physiology and disease processes, spanning from single genes
resolved in detail in each cell type to the global gene regulatory responses across the diverse cells of the
pituitary. Results to date suggest an expected plasticity of cell state and cell type across pituitary cell systems
during the reproductive cycle and during development of an important pathophysiological condition, primary
hypothyroidism. We will study the overall hypothesis that a profound and previously unappreciated plasticity of
mature pituitary cell types underlies normal physiology and disease. Because regulation of alternative gene
splice site usage is important in pituitary cell type function, we will incorporate comprehensive study of the
dynamics of pituitary cell type alternative splice usage, alternative promoter usage and lncRNAs into our single
cell platforms using single cell long read methods. We propose to test hypotheses identified in single cell in
vivo datasets for the signaling and epigenetic mechanisms regulating Fshb, a key
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulator gene that is transcriptionally controlled (Aim 1). We will elucidate
the coordination of regulatory processes across multiple pituitary endocrine cell types underlying pituitary
plasticity during the reproductive cycle, using both single cell short read and long read and refined analysis
methods (Aim 2). Focusing on a pituitary disease that causes transdifferentation among pituitary cell types, we
will apply these single cell methods to delineate the multi-cell type mechanisms mediating pituitary adaptations
to primary hypothyroidism in mouse models and investigate the underlying mechanisms for these processes
(Aim 3). This research will address key questions relevant to normal physiological processes and disease and
provide data and methods to advance research for both endocrine researchers and the broader community."

 This project will advance the re-positioning of a novel therapeutic agent, fasudil, for the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently there is a huge unmet need for safe and effective disease modifying
therapies to treat and prevent AD. This study will generate preclinical pharmacological outcomes to prepare for
the USA FDA application for AD clinical trials and extend our studies of the mechanism of action (MOA) of
fasudil in cells and the 3X-Tg AD mouse model of disease. Both PIs have extensive experience in the
molecular biology and pathology of AD, the biological activity of fasudil and Wnt signaling, and in preclinical
drug development; we are ideally positioned to evaluate the efficacy and the MOA of fasudil and test our
hypothesis that fasudil down-regulates non-canonical (Planar Cell Polarity (PCP)) Wnt signaling and the
downstream effects of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), leading to reduced Tau phosphorylation. Specifically, we will
achieve three Aims. Aim 1. To determine PK of fasudil in WT and 3X-Tg AD mice after acute and chronic
oral dosing (PO). We will determine the brain/plasma ratio of novel fasudil metabolites after IV delivery of
fasudil to mice, and then determine the time of maximum concentration observed (Tmax), half-life (t1/2), peak
plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), and bioavailability of fasudil after PO dosing. We will
determine steady-state fasudil exposure in plasma and brain in a multiple-PO dosing paradigm, and finally
confirm PK profile in 3X-Tg AD transgenic mice. We will specifically identify the most permeable fasudil
metabolites and establish the active pharmaceutical ingredient for monitoring PK profiling. Data from acute
dosing of fasudil will be used to model chronic dosing paradigm, and steady state fasudil levels in transgenic
mouse brains under variable dosing paradigms will be established. Aim 2.To determine PD of fasudil and
establish PK-PD relationship in transgenic mice. We will quantify brain levels of Aβ (Aβ38, 40, 42), total
Tau, and pTau in 3X-Tg AD transgenic mice after a single dose of fasudil as well as multiple doses of fasudil
over a two-week interval. We will determine efficacy of chronic fasudil dosing on memory tests performed on
transgenic mice and establish PK-PD relationship and calculate the therapeutic index. Aim 3. To determine
the mechanism of action for effect of fasudil on Aβ/Tau/pTau. We will examine the effect of fasudil on the
Wnt-β-cat and Wnt-PCP pathways and phosphorylation of Tau. In addition, we will establish a causative
relationship between regulation of Wnt pathway and reduction of Aβ/Tau/pTau. We will measure the dose-
dependent impact of fasudil on β-catenin, p-β-catenin, and promoter assays for both Wnt pathways. Results
will be correlated with reduction of Aβ/Tau/pTau. We will also activate the Wnt-PCP pathway in HEK293 cells
with Dkk1 and then treat with fasudil to determine the effect of fasudil on Aβ/Tau/pTau during PCP Wnt
ac tivation."

11094449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common causes of death in cancer
patients. Guidelines recommend the use of VTE risk-stratification to identify ambulatory patients with
cancer at high-risk of VTE who may benefit from primary VTE prevention with prophylactic
anticoagulation. However, our preliminary data suggest that VTE risk assessment and primary
prophylaxis are substantially underused.
Aims and Methods: The overall objective of this project is to develop a feasible, effective, and
sustainable implementation strategy to promote the uptake into clinical practice of evidence-based
guidelines for VTE prevention in patients with cancer. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to:
Aim 1: Conduct formative research to develop an implementation strategy (PREVenT-APC)
 promoting the uptake in clinical practice of a guideline-recommended, risk-based approach
 to primary VTE prevention for ambulatory patients with cancer;
Aim 2: Using a randomized trial, assess effectiveness of the refined PREVenT-APC strategy as
 compared with usual care, to start and maintain thromboprophylaxis for identified high-risk
 patients with cancer; and
Aim 3: Explore implementation outcomes and the contextual factors associated with variability in
 adoption, fidelity, effectiveness, and acceptability of the PREVenT-APC implementation
strategy.
To carry out the study, I will develop the PREVenT-APC strategy and conduct usability testing to refine
the strategy (Aim 1); test the PREVenT-APC strategy via a randomized trial (Aim 2); and, using mixed
methods, evaluate additional implementation outcomes, and explore variability in outcomes of the
PREVenT-APC strategy (Aim 3).
Career Development and Future Work: Through the objectives of the K23 Mentored Career
Development Award, I will acquire advanced knowledge and apply skills in mixed method research,
behavioral intervention clinical trial design, and dissemination and implementation science, which will
further my goal of becoming an independent physician scientist with expertise in developing,
implementing, and evaluating strategies to improve cross-specialty hematology care. The study findings
will serve as a foundation for future R-level proposals to tailor and test adaptations and dissemination of
the PREVenT-APC implementation strategy in different settings. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the
proposed research is to reduce VTE and improve outcomes for patients with cancer."

Regulated exocytosis – stimulus-dependent exocytic vesicle fusion – mediates a broad range of fundamental
biological processes including nutrient homeostasis, cell-to-cell signaling, and elimination of transformed or
virally infected cells. Imbalances in these exocytic pathways lead to major forms of human disease. The long-
term goal of this project is to uncover the protein networks governing regulated exocytosis. A major model
pathway we use is insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis, a physiologically important but poorly characterized
regulated exocytic pathway. We also examine key aspects of other exocytic pathways, aiming to establish
conserved and divergent mechanisms of regulated exocytosis. In our previous research, we carried out CRISPR
genetic screens to systematically dissect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis and other exocytic pathways, and
identified a large number of new regulators. In this proposed research, we will carry out in-depth biochemical
and genetic studies to characterize new exocytic regulators isolated in the screens. We will also investigate how
exocytic vesicle fusion is coupled with other cellular processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME)
and intracellular signaling to achieve an appropriate exocytic response. In particular, we will examine how AP2
adaptor, a central player in CME, is assembled in the cytosol with the assistance of dedicated assembly
chaperones. Besides these in-depth mechanistic studies, we will continue to identify and validate new regulators
based on candidate genes isolated in our CRISPR screens. The mechanistic studies and CRISPR screens are
fully complementary and will provide a comprehensive understanding of regulated exocytosis that neither
approach alone could generate. Successful completion of this proposed research will fill major gaps in the
knowledge of regulated exocytosis and will serve as a springboard for understanding the molecular basis of
membrane trafficking in general. Ultimately, insights gleaned from this work will facilitate the development of new
therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by dysregulated exocytosis."
11097657,"SUMMARY
Different regulatory pathways work together to coordinate gene expression, and our guiding philosophy
has been that exploring the interface of different types of regulation is thus a good way to discover new
and important biology. Building on discoveries from our previous MIRA award, we propose to focus on
understanding how different strategies for post-transcriptional regulation—mRNA decay, translation, and
protein decay—act together to control gene expression.
 In the ﬁrst of our two themes, we will explore the idea that protein decay acts as a meta-regulator
of the post-transcriptional landscape of the early embryo. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model
system, we will investigate one of the earliest steps of development, the maternal-to-zygotic transition.
During this process, maternal gene products are replaced with zygotic ones, and we have discovered
that removal of three maternal RNA binding proteins is critical and determined how their destruction is
developmentally controlled. We propose to extend this line of investigation to other RNA binding proteins
that are destroyed by distinct and unknown mechanisms in the early embryo. We want to answer three
critical questions: what are the mechanisms by which these other RNA binding proteins are destroyed?
How is their degradation developmentally controlled? How does their degradation in turn change post-
transcription regulation? Our research is signiﬁcant because our results will reveal how destruction of
maternal proteins shapes the regulatory landscape of the early embryo, and they will likely provide a
conceptual framework applicable to other types of developmental transitions.
 In the second theme, we will explore how the open reading regulates mRNA decay and
translation. Poor (or “nonoptimal”) codons lead to reduced protein output, and understanding the
underlying mechanisms remains an open area of research for the ﬁeld. We have excitingly found that
nonoptimal codon usage represses translation initiation in human cells. This pathway is at least as potent
as previously described pathways like mRNA decay. Our proposed program will build upon these results
at a mechanistic level and will answer the following three important questions: What is the role of the
poly(A) in translational repression due to nonoptimal codons? What factors mediate translational
repression? How does codon-mediated regulation change during early development? This last question
represents a new direction for our lab and leverages our unique combination of skills in the Drosophila
MZT and codon-mediated regulation. Our research will reveal the molecular basis for a major repressive
pathway mediated by nonoptimal codons. The systems we establish have the potential to reveal other
types of developmentally-coordinated translational control, and we anticipate that our research will
provide a launching point to explore the how gene regulation changes in biological space and time."
11097132,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mitochondria are best known as the “powerhouses” of the cell, due to their predominant role in generating
cellular energy through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS). Beyond energy generation, these essential organelles also play central roles in apoptosis,
calcium handing, innate immunity, cell signaling, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Human health therefore
depends critically on mitochondrial function. The research program proposed here seeks to understand
three homeostatic mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial health. The first mechanism is mitochondrial
fusion and fission dynamics. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose physiology is regulated by the
balance between the opposing processes of membrane fusion and fission. Second, the quality of the
mitochondrial population is maintained by selective degradation of excessive or defective mitochondria
through mitophagy, the autophagic pathway that shuttles mitochondria to the lysosome for destruction.
Finally, mitochondrial quantity and function are regulated by biogenesis programs that control expression of
mitochondrial genes, ensuring that appropriate levels of mitochondria are maintained in response to a
specific cellular state. This research project targets key gaps in knowledge in each of these fundamental
homeostatic mechanisms. For mitochondrial fusion and fission, we are using mouse genetics and cell
biology to understand how mitochondrial dynamics regulates mitochondrial function. The least understood
of the core mitochondrial dynamics genes is Fis1. We have found that Fis1 plays essential functions in
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. We are pinpointing the cellular
functions of Fis1 and determining which function is responsible for the in vivo phenotypes. Our preliminary
data suggest that Fis1 serves as a link between mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, we are
determining the elusive mechanism through which the balance between fusion and fission is regulated.
There is evidence that each fusion event is coupled to a future fission event, and we will determine the
molecular mechanism of this coupling. To study mitochondrial degradation, we are performing whole-
genome CRISPR interference screens and have discovered the integrated stress response as a key
regulator of mitophagy. We will elucidate the molecular mechanism through which this cell stress pathway
tunes the level of mitophagy. Finally, we are using CRISPR interference screens to identify how
mitochondrial density and function are regulated. These studies have identified two chromatin remodeling
complexes as critical for mitochondrial function. By determining how these chromatin remodeling complexes
regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through control of gene expression, we will gain insight into how cells
dynamically adjust mitochondrial density to fit cellular demands. All together, these studies will provide a
comprehensive understanding of how mitochondrial health in cells is maintained."
11098153,"Abstract (taken from the parent grant)
We aim to understand the normal biology of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), as well as to use NMPs to
model cellular and molecular mechanisms in vivo. NMPs are basal progenitor cells located in the tailbud of
vertebrate embryos that continue to make a germ-layer decision after gastrulation to generate ectoderm and
mesoderm. As a primary source of cells generating the spinal cord, skeletal muscle, and other mesodermal
derivatives, NMPs are a key cell type contributing to the formation of the vertebrate body plan. Studying NMPs
has advanced our understanding of how body plans are generated, improved techniques for in vitro tissue
generation, and provided critical insights into signaling pathway mechanisms. I discovered zebrafish NMPs as
a postdoctoral fellow and my lab continues to focus on them. Our recent work has uncovered important roles
for the transcription factor Sox2 in maintaining NMPs in an undifferentiated state through interactions with the
canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This, combined with the past research showing the Wnt signaling effector
bcat physically interacts with Sox2, indicates Wnt signaling can modulate gene expression and biological
activity directly via Sox2. Little is known about this exciting branch of the Wnt/ bcat pathway. We will interrogate
this pathway of Sox2 and Wnt/ bcat interactions at a number of biological levels, focusing on direct physical
interactions between Sox2 and bcat, as well as genome wide analysis of Sox2/ bcat mediated transcriptional
regulation. We hypothesize that Sox2/ bcat signaling represents a new arm of the Wnt/ bcat pathway distinct
from the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factor family mediated signaling. We also recently developed a new
Cyclin Dependent Kinase biosensor transgenic zebrafish and observed that NMPs and some of their
derivatives exist in restricted cell cycle phases. The NMPs are held primarily in the G2 phase, while
mesodermal notochord progenitors are restricted to the G1 phase. Cell cycle phase is broadly implicated in
various aspects of stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and cell migration and invasion. We will
manipulate the cell cycle in NMPs and their derivatives to understand how the cell cycle phase impacts normal
NMP development. We hypothesize that the G2 phase restriction of NMPs is essential for maintenance of the
undifferentiated state and for receipt of Wnt signaling based on G2 dependent receptor activation. We also
hypothesize that the G1 phase of notochord progenitors is essential for their morphogenetic behavior of
convergence and extension. Together, our work will shed important light on not only NMP development and
vertebrate body plan formation, but also basic principles of cell biology and signaling. Wnt/ bcat signaling and
Sox2 are found together and play important roles in numerous normal and diseased cellular contexts, including
stem cells and cancer. The cell cycle is a fundamental aspect of normal development and is dysregulated in
diseases such as cancer. Understanding how cell cycle phase impacts cell fate and morphogenetic behaviors
in vivo will provide essential insight into normal and disease states.
Justification of the need for a new epi-fluorescence microscope
There are two main areas of research in this project related to neuromeosdermal progenitor development, both
of which rely heavily on the use of epi-fluorescence microscopy. In the first area, we are investigating how the
canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the Sox2 transcriptional factor interact to control call fate and
morphogenesis of the neuromesodermal progenitors and their descendants, including the spinal cord and the
paraxial mesoderm. To do this, we use transgenic zebrafish reporter lines that allow us to visualize Sox2
expression levels and canonical Wnt signaling activity based on fluorescence levels. We also perform mosaic
analyses of host embryos containing mutant or transgenic cells in which the Sox2 or Wnt signaling levels are
manipulated. This involves long-term time-lapse imaging and cell tracking of morphogenetic behaviors and cell
fate commitment. In the second area, we are determining how the cell cycle state of neuromesodermal
progenitors influences their morphogenesis and cell fate commitment. We generated transgenic biosensor
lines that detect cell cycle state based on ratiometric distribution of fluorophores between the nucleus and
cytoplasm. We also perform time-lapse analysis of mosaic embryos to determine how manipulating the cell
cycle impacts morphogenesis and cell fate. In both projects, we use additional reporter and biosensor lines to
monitor such things as cell-type specification and F-actin regulation, among many others. These two projects
require heavy daily use of epifluorescence microscopy with advanced capabilities such as fast acquisition
times, multi-wavelength detection, and a scanning stage for multi-embryo time-lapse capture.
When I started my lab at Stony Brook University in 2012 I used my startup to purchase an automated Leica
DMI600B epi-fluorescence microscope. It has a motorized turret for multiple-color acquisition as well as a z-
motorized stage and appropriate software for collection of image stacks, embryos at multiple stage positions,
and time-lapse imaging. We also use this for fixed embryo analysis such as multi-color hybridization chain
reaction to visualize mRNA expression in embryos. This has been the workhorse piece of equipment in the lab
since I started and gets daily use. Unfortunately, this microscope has been discontinued by Leica, making it
difficult to service, and has been showing the signs of many years of heavy usage. We had to replace the
computer, and some of the motorized components have failed. Additionally, it cannot meet some our current
needs, such as the ability to image more than 6 colors, and to rapidly acquire multiple wavelengths for live-cell
colocalization. The current instrument also does not eliminate the need to also use confocal microscopes to
capture high resolution subcellular images, due to out of focus light capture typical of epi-fluorescent
microscopes.
Proposed replacement instrument
The Leica DMi8 is the current version of our DMI6000B, and it comes as part of the new Leica Thunder
package. The THUNDER Imager 3D Live Cell system provides real-time imaging with exceptional clarity, even
in deep areas of the sample, eliminating out-of-focus blur. This is made possible by Leica Microsystems'
Computational Clearing method. It minimizes photobleaching, ensuring optimal physiological conditions while
delivering high-performance imaging and efficient data throughput, enhancing workflow and statistical analysis.
Thus, not only does this microscope replace the capabilities of our old microscope, it also will eliminate much
of our need to utilize shared confocal instruments. The replacement instrument also has improved abilities over
our current instrument that will greatly enhance our research output. These include an 8 channel LED light
source that will allow rapid switching between wavelengths for fast multi-color image capture, as well as the
ability to use 8 different fluorophores instead of our current limit of 6."

11096927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis kills an estimated 11 million people worldwide every year. Sepsis also contributes to as many as 50%
of US hospital deaths. Early treatment is the only universally recognized modifiable factor for improving sepsis
mortality. Thus, current treatment guidelines focus heavily on early sepsis care immediately following hospital
presentation. However, today, little is known about even earlier, pre-hospital, opportunities to predict,
recognize, or treat sepsis. Our research program has deployed innovative translational informatics approaches
to elucidate the presentation, pace, and profile of infection in pre-sepsis patients that could enable novel pre-
hospital approaches designed to mitigate, or even prevent, sepsis. These pre-sepsis opportunities are now
being recognized as a key new frontier of sepsis research and care. In this renewal, we are extending
successful research that has begun to identify and characterize pre-sepsis opportunities for early, targeted
intervention. To achieve this goal, we have already leveraged granular and extensive electronic health record
(EHR) data and machine learning methods. This supplement seeks to enhance our computing capabilities by
leveraging powerful GPU architecture and high-speed storage/networking to now incorporate imaging, text,
and time series data into our predictive models through applying open-source deep learning and large
language model techniques. This will augment our capability to develop pre-sepsis predictive models that are
efficient, effective, and equitable. Our findings will have broad and immediate implications for patients,
clinicians, and health systems to address this devastating condition. These results will also inform the design of
sepsis public health programs and future prospective interventional studies aimed at improving outcomes for a
condition that remains common, deadly, and costly."
11093635,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The immune system at mucosal sites must be tightly regulated to mediate rapid immunity
to invading pathogens, while limiting over-reactive responses that drive chronic
inflammation. In particular, type 2 immune responses in the airway or gastrointestinal tract
are essential to protect from helminth parasites, but if dysregulated, drive asthma and
allergic inflammation. Despite this knowledge, we do not yet fully appreciate the complexity
of cellular and molecular signals that control these responses, which will be critical for
developing the next generation of preventative, therapeutic or curative treatments. The
fundamental focus of this renewal application for the Mucosal Immunology Studies Team is
to define novel pathways by which the type 2 immune response harnesses signals
associated with the nervous system to regulate rapid mucosal immunity and inflammation.
In this context, we will define: (i) the pathways that induce and regulate these neuronal
signals, (ii) the functional significance of these pathways in type 2 mucosal immunity and
inflammation, and (iii) whether it is possible to therapeutically target these signals to boost
immunity to helminth infection or reduced chronic allergic inflammation. We will employ
innovative approaches and develop new tools to address these fundamental gaps in
knowledge, and where possible, translate our findings from mice into human samples.
Results from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the
pathways that are essential to mediate rapid type 2 immunity and inflammation at
mucosal sites and could provoke the next generation of preventative, therapeutic and
curative treatment strategies."
11094232,"Abstract The patient-clinician interaction is central to most therapies and is supported by key interpersonal
mechanisms of action such as clinician empathy, therapeutic alliance, and trust. However, the neural
underpinnings of this effect are mostly unknown. Our recently published study applied functional MRI (fMRI)
hyperscanning (i.e. simultaneously neuroimaging chronic pain patients and clinicians in synchronized MRI
scanners) demonstrated that brain-to-brain concordance in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is up-regulated
following a clinical interaction and associated with patient analgesia. Our study also found that greater facial
expression mirroring is associated with higher therapeutic alliance and greater evoked pain analgesia.
Interestingly, the TPJ is known to be a key region for theory-of-mind processing (ToM, i.e. mentalizing,
perspective-taking), defined as the ability to infer and understand others’ mental states - a cognitive function
critical for social communication, empathy, and social mirroring. Furthermore, ToM training protocols have been
found to improve mentalizing ability, which can generalize to other cognitive / quality of life functions. We
propose that patient/clinician TPJ concordance, linked with ToM processing, is a key aspect of therapeutic
alliance, and thus ToM training for fibromyalgia patients will increase alliance, facial expression mirroring, and
TPJ concordance, with the latter mediating improvements in pain outcomes following acupuncture therapy, an
established non-pharmacological therapy for chronic pain. Fibromyalgia is a nociplastic chronic pain disorder
showing a deficit in ToM processing, potentially contributing to the difficulties in social functioning
characterizing this condition, and in great need of novel therapies. Our study will evaluate the impact of a novel
multimodal therapy, a type of approach known to improve pain outcomes and recommended by the Institute of
Medicine report for chronic pain management. Our study design will also allow us to evaluate a neural model
supporting therapeutic alliance for pain outcomes for fibromyalgia wherein combined ToM training and
acupuncture will synergistically target a critical therapeutic pathway - i.e., patient-provider alliance, instantiated
by TPJ concordance. Our Aims will: (1) Determine behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ToM training,
(2) Evaluate the impact of ToM training on brain-to-brain concordance with fMRI hyperscanning, and (3)
Assess if brain/behavioral markers mediate the effect of ToM training on longitudinal acupuncture outcomes."
11094408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Across the tree of life species interact. This includes interactions between animals and microorganisms that
colonize them. Many animals harbor microbes inside their cells and form endosymbiotic associations.
Endosymbionts can have profound effects on host biology and fitness, but the consequences of these effects
depend on endosymbiont prevalence in host populations. While some endosymbionts evolve obligate
relationships, many associations are facultative, with both infected and uninfected host individuals. Wolbachia
bacteria play both roles, but they usually form facultative relationships with arthropods. Indeed, facultative
Wolbachia variants infect most insects making them the most common endosymbionts in nature. Despite this
taxonomic prevalence, Wolbachia frequencies vary widely within and among host systems. The mechanisms
underlying this variation remain unknown. Filling this gap in knowledge is crucial to understand the abundance
of Wolbachia in nature and to improve the efficacy of Wolbachia biocontrol, where vector-control groups are
attempting to establish pathogen-blocking Wolbachia variants in mosquito populations to reduce human
disease transmission (particularly dengue). To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms
that govern Wolbachia spread, research in our lab will advance in three directions. First, many Wolbachia
cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that kills embryos when infected males mate with uninfected females.
This promotes Wolbachia spread in natural and in vector systems. However, CI-inducing males rarely kill all
offspring when mated with uninfected females such that CI strength varies from very weak (most eggs hatch)
to complete (no eggs hatch). We will determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for this variation.
Second, while Wolbachia are maternally transmitted, transmission rates vary significantly. We recently
discovered that cold temperatures disrupt maternal Wolbachia transmission. We will leverage this discovery to
dissect the cellular-genetic basis of transmission rate variation. Third, our research has demonstrated rapid
Wolbachia host switching with Wolbachia that diverged thousands of years ago infecting hosts that diverged
many millions of years ago. This implies that Wolbachia regularly occur at initially rare frequencies in novel
host species and must increase host fitness to spread and ultimately establish. We will compare effects of
“old” and “young” infections on host fitness—in both natural and divergent host backgrounds—to quantify how
much Wolbachia may diverge and still successfully spread in novel hosts. Together, these projects will
leverage nearly 50 million years of Wolbachia divergence distributed across the Drosophila genus to
understand the mechanisms that govern Wolbachia spread. More broadly, this research will promote a deeper
understanding of the causes and consequences of endosymbiont prevalence in nature."

Air pollution is a ubiquitous environmental exposure that is consistently linked to adverse developmental
trajectories in animal and human studies. However, the definitive mechanisms for these effects are currently
unknown, limiting our biological understanding and delaying interventional and therapeutic efforts to protect
children from this widespread exposure. The placenta oversees prenatal development through regulation of
fetal growth and its endocrine functions. In the parent R01 study (R01ES032818), we proposed to explore
post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, i.e., the epitranscriptome, as potential mediators of black carbon-
related neurotoxicity. In this diversity supplement, we will build on the outlined aims of the parent grant by
expanding the exposure to a mixed composition of diesel exhaust pollutants and the placental molecular
evaluations of to include overall transcriptome-wide expression changes and content of extracellular vesicles.
We hypothesize that air pollutants alter expression profiles of miRNAs housed within placental cells and shed
from placental cells in extracellular vesicles (EVs). To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a series of in
vitro studies in the JEG-3 trophoblast cell line. In Aim 1, we will determine the association between diesel
exhaust exposure and transcriptome-wide alterations in placental miRNA expression. In Aim 2, we will
determine the association between diesel exhaust exposure and transcriptome-wide alterations in placenta-
derived EV miRNA expression. This project will provide novel evidence on the role of the placenta as a
conveyor of developmental toxicity due to prenatal air pollution exposure. Importantly, this supplement will also
support training opportunities for an engaged and motivated Master of Public Health graduate student who is
interested to cultivate his burgeoning interests in the field of Environmental Health, further ensuring that our
research team includes those traditionally underrepresented in this area of research."
11094261,"Project Summary
 Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons degenerate after functional decline in glaucoma, a circumstance potentially caused,
but certainly exacerbated by, energy deficit, indicating that metabolic dysfunction contributes to glaucomatous
degeneration. High intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma results in hypoxia that promotes glycolysis through
upregulation of glycolysis-associated genes, but also mitochondrial recycling, and downregulation of genes encoding for
oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). A critical question is whether RGC metabolic reprogramming from OxPhos to
glycolysis is initiated by IOP-associated hypoxia, and whether repeated reprogramming and development of
pseudohypoxia underlies the significant energy stress and dysfunction observed in the glaucomatous retina.
 The long-term goal of this work is to leverage our understanding of retinal metabolism to maintain visual function
despite the stressors inherent in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine
the impact of IOP-mediated damage on retinal and optic nerve head metabolic resilience. Our central hypothesis is that
ocular hypertension (OHT)-associated hypoxia transitions into pseudohypoxia, destabilizing neural and glial metabolism
and mitochondrial homeostasis, with downstream negative impact on RGCs in the retina and ONH. This hypothesis
derives from our recent analysis indicating that mitochondria and availability of energy substrates, both targets of
hypoxia-associated regulation, contribute to the metabolic challenges of RGCs. The rationale for the work is that
investigating metabolic cooperation and dysfunction in glaucomatous retina will identify new therapeutic targets for a
disease that has no mechanism-based interventions.
 Guided by strong preliminary data, the aims of this proposal will address a critical element of the retinal energy
management in glaucoma by revealing 1) whether OHT is the impetus for metabolic reprogramming, followed by
adaptation as pseudohypoxia, in the glaucomatous retina; 2) how metabolic coupling is managed among neurons and
glia in the normal and ocular hypertensive retina; 3) how RGCs, Müller glia, and ONH astrocytes respond to and manage
metabolic challenge on a cell-by-cell basis. Overall, this work will enable us to determine how RGCs, Müller glia, and
ONH astrocytes respond metabolically to IOP increase, whether those changes persist long-term, and how we might
promote metabolic resilience. The approach is innovative by taking the position that insight will only come from
investigating the metabolic dependencies of the primary cell types impacted during the development of glaucoma
pathology. In addition, we will apply new cutting-edge approaches to the investigation of mitochondria such as cell-
specific mitochondrial isolation followed by metabolomics and co-detection of protein and gene expression through
spatial transcriptomics. This proposal is significant because we will reveal mitochondrial-specific metabolic dysregulation
amenable to therapeutic intervention."
11094265,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overarching goal of my proposal is to acquire technical and professional skills to become an
independent investigator at a leading academic institution and develop a research program deciphering the
molecular mechanism of inflammation induced prostatic tissue remodeling and fibrosis. This will be pursued
through a scientific project that will determine whether osteopontin, a pro-fibrotic secreted phosphoprotein,
stimulates prostatic inflammation, fibrosis, and lower urinary tract dysfunction.
 My training is focused on four key areas: 1) functional testing of mouse urinary function, 2) developing
biomedical engineering technologies to study prostatic fibrosis in vitro, 3) testing and further developing animal
models to study inflammation-induced prostatic fibrosis and its consequences on urinary function and, 4)
gaining essential training in immune-regulated tissue remodeling. UW-Madison and the UW O`Brien Center for
Benign Urology Research presents a unique environment for the proposed research and career development
activities. This includes seminars presented by local and national leaders of the field, career development
activities of several institutes across campus, clinical training of the Department of Urology, and specific
training in immunopathology and tissue engineering.
 Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic diseases deteriorate the quality of
life as men age. The treatment of male LUTS costs $4 billion annually and presents an economic burden on
our healthcare system. It has been recently identified that prostatic inflammation and fibrosis are associated
with LUTS, but the exact contribution of these mechanism to urinary dysfunction is unknown. Medical therapies
targeting inflammation and fibrosis could enhance drug development and provide novel molecular targets for
LUTS. Based on my preliminary studies, I hypothesize that inflammation-induced osteopontin levels stimulate
prostatic fibrosis and lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). The hypothesis will be tested by the following
aims:
 1) Test the hypothesis that OPN is required for inflammation-induced prostatic collagen accumulation
 and LUTD,
 2) Test the hypothesis that OPN induces prostatic fibrosis.
 The proposal will provide novel detection of collagen deposition, 3D in vitro and in vivo models of
prostatic fibrosis. It will also decipher the specific role of inflammation-induced prostatic fibrosis in lower urinary
tract dysfunction. This will be achieved by capitalizing on recently established prostatic inflammation models
and state-of-the-art urinary physiological tests uniquely available at the UW-Madison."

Failure of the right ventricle (RV) is a main component of the morbidity and mortality of pulmonary hypertension
(PH). There exists no specific treatment for RV dysfunction and failure and the only cure for many patients
(especially in the case of pulmonary arterial hypertension) remains transplantation. This is partially due to the
critical lack of understanding of RV biology; therapeutic strategies that are beneficial for LV failure have worse
outcomes when applied to those with RV failure. What has been observed in RV dysfunction in human subjects
and animal models is exaggerated fibrosis and divergent contractile and hypertrophic responses to several drugs
when compared to LV dysfunction. Thus, the RV may contain distinct pathobiology compared to the LV that has
high significance for treatment of PH. Cardiac myocytes may have distinct cell signaling properties in the RV,
though there is a lot unknown about these differences. Previous work has shown that RV cardiac myocytes,
compared to those from the LV, have increased K+ current, shorter action potential duration, reduced sarcomere
shortening, and reduced peak intracellular Ca2+ when compared to LV cardiac myocytes. These differences
demonstrate that RV cardiac myocytes may have molecular differences at a functional level. This diversity
supplement will determine how contractility, calcium handling, and size of the cardiac myocyte change during
RV remodeling in PH, and determine and test novel drug targets that alter RV contractility. These data may
uncover novel understanding of RV cardiac myocyte biology and lead to further therapeutic strategies for right
heart failure. This supplement will address this concern with two Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanism of
cardiac myocyte adaptation to RV pressure overload. and (2) Interrogate GPCR targets in the RV as potential

11096369,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is based on the core criterion of memory impairment, but
biomarker-detectable pathophysiological changes start decades before clinical symptoms. This preclinical
phase, in which someone has the neuropathology of AD but does not yet show clinical symptoms, is crucial for
potential intervention and timely diagnosis for patient and caregiver. The preclinical phase is currently only
detectable with expensive or invasive biomarkers. Because current cognitive measures are not sensitive to the
preclinical phase of AD and have low specificity and large variation with regard to individuals’ educational and
cultural exposure, there is a critical need to develop sensitive, low-cost, and high-access cognitive markers for
early detection in diverse older adults. The primary goal of this project is to investigate if novel psycholinguistic
metrics of existing cognitive test data can accurately identify people in the earliest stages of AD. The semantic
fluency task—naming as many animals in one minute—tests semantic memory, one of the first cognitive domains
to become impaired in AD. Traditionally, semantic fluency is scored by the total number of items. However, there
is a wealth of information at the item-level of this task, because words are organized in a semantic network that
becomes vulnerable during AD, specifically for words that are poorly connected and not often used. These traits
of words in the semantic network can be captured with novel psycholinguistic metrics, such as lexical frequency,
e.g., ‘dog’ is a high-frequent word in our language, as opposed to ‘iguana.’ The K99 phase of this study showed
that novel psycholinguistic item-level metrics related to memory decline over time over and above other
traditional neuropsychological scores, related to brain volume over and above established genetic, subjective,
and cognitive risk factors, and related to more cortical thinning across eights years in high-risk individuals without
a dementia diagnosis. In the R00 phase, psycholinguistic metrics will be used to estimate the temporality of
semantic impairment across the AD continuum (Aim 1) and determine the sensitivity and specificity of
psycholinguistic measures to predict progression to clinical AD (Aim 2). Since the relationship of demographics
to psycholinguistic metrics is not well understood, this project strives to deconstruct cultural and demographic
effects on these metrics in order to maximize their potential utility in early diagnosis among diverse older adults.
For the R00 aims, the project will employ advanced statistical analyses to investigate data from two large
longitudinal cohorts with participants from a range of socio-demographic backgrounds and semantic fluency data
in English and Spanish. The R00 proposal lays the foundation for an independent research program focused on
semantic processing in normal aging and across the AD continuum. The results of the proposed research have
the potential to translate into a clinical tool that we can use across educationally, linguistically, and culturally
diverse individuals to refine who to select for intervention trials."
10799543,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a human pathogen of global and domestic significance. Whereas progress has been made in development of new Mtb antibiotic regimens, adjunct therapies including those based on autophagy are currently being sought to improve control of Mtb, inflammation, and reduce chronic pulmonary impairment after completion of antibacterial TB chemotherapy. Understanding the role and mechanisms of autophagy in control of TB has been and remains the focus of our program. Before we can harness the power of autophagy for TB treatments, which is the long-term objective of our project, we must delineate the roles of canonical and noncanonical autophagy and identify specific human factors that control them. This renewal project’s scope remains to define the molecular entities that marshal autophagic control of intracellular Mtb and counter tissue damage in TB, with the focus on links between innate immunity signaling and the general membrane homeostatic processes associated with autophagy. We hypothesize that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the uniquely human autophagy factor IRGM, and other entities, sense and integrate signals coming from membrane damage caused by virulent Mtb to deploy components of the autophagic apparatus and protect the host. Completion of the specific objectives of this project will deliver a comprehensive understanding of how Mtb damages host cells and tissues to cause pathology and how autophagy and the autophagy-related processes of membrane homeostasis protect against TB. The scope and specific aims remain the same with updates based on progress made. The specific aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Determine how the mammalian autophagic apparatus recognizes phagosomal and other host cell membrane damage caused by virulent Mtb and how this contributes to autophagic control of Mtb.  
Specific Aim 2. Define the mechanism of action of human IRGM in autophagic processes in response to intracellular Mtb. 
The scope of the project remains unchanged with logical extensions reflecting the progress made to date. The key objectives are to understand how host cells detect presence of intracellular Mtb via membrane damage, how PRRs and IRGM function in this context, how signals are transmitted to the key regulators of autophagy, and how the membrane homeostasis via the autophagic component of Atg8ylation counters Mtb pathogenesis. This will deliver a new conceptual framework and specific targets for therapeutic interventions in TB."
11096707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Billions of base pairs of DNA must be replicated trillions of times during a human lifetime. Adding to the difficulty,
replication is challenged by stresses including DNA template lesions, difficult to replicate sequences, and
conflicts with transcription. Multiple repair and tolerance responses to replication stress act to complete DNA
synthesis while minimizing errors. In this project we seek to understand these mechanisms with a focus on
replication fork reversal. Replication fork reversal is thought to stabilize stalled forks, to place DNA lesions back
into the context of duplex DNA where it can be removed through excision repair, and to provide an opportunity
for template switching. Reversal is catalyzed by ATP-dependent DNA translocases and the RAD51 recombinase.
It is also highly regulated, which is needed to prevent inappropriate slowing of replication and nuclease-
dependent processing of replication forks. For example, we recently discovered RADX as a single-stranded DNA
binding protein that regulates reversal by directly binding RAD51. In this funding period we seek to understand
how RADX functions, how replication resumes following a challenge, and to rigorously test the hypothesis that
fork reversal is an error-free mechanism of DNA damage tolerance. We will test and refine new conceptual
models utilizing a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches. Our many years of
accumulated knowledge and reagents and strong team of collaborators uniquely position us to complete these
studies. Given the importance of replication stress responses to preventing diseases including cancer, these
studies will generate discoveries that could be translated in the future to benefit human health."

11095938,"Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Targeted agents have dramatically improved the
prognosis of over 30 cancer types, but are fundamentally limited by the evolution of resistance. Currently,
next generation targeted therapies are retrospectively designed to cover the liabilities of clinically
available targeted therapies. Unfortunately, every investigational compound will have resistance
mutations that prevent complete and durable response. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) has emerged
as a powerful tool for evaluating the mutational landscape of target proteins. DMS screens have recently
been used by academic labs to characterize the resistance landscape of targeted anticancer compounds,
but employ standard next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to measure a highly complex mutant
pool. NGS has a high error rate that prohibits accurate measurements of complex mutational pools.
Duplex Sequencing (DS) is an error correction method that enables the precise measurement of
mutations down to a frequency of 1 in 300,000 in a pooled cell-based library. The Pritchard lab has
developed Deep Mutational Scanning with Duplex Sequencing (DMS-DS) and propose to refine this
technology into a commercially viable service for anticancer pharmaceutical development. In Phase I of
this Small Business Transition Grant, we will harden and scale our DMS-DS technology into an industry-
viable screening platform. In Phase II we will screen all approved BCR-ABL inhibitors, design and build
DMS-DS screens for two lung cancer drug targets, and harden our BCR-ABL DMS-DS platform into a
commercialized end-to-end service. The final product of this SBTG project will be a robust, powerful, and
marketable new research tool ready for use by anticancer pharmaceutical developers. Our company will
leverage this tool (DMS-DS) to expedite lead candidate prioritization and optimize next generation drug
design.
Targeted therapies have revolutionized clinical outcomes for numerous cancers, but acquired resistance
critically limits their long-term utility. Having a commercially available screening platform that can
accurately predict the mutational landscape of next generation therapies will lead to more successful
clinical trials, better targeted therapies, and more effective treatment plans for cancer patients. We firmly
believe our technology will accelerate effective anticancer drug development and that our team is an
unparalleled position to succeed at the commercialization of this product."

The Down Syndrome – Ambulatory Research in Cognition (DS-ARC) study will develop and validate a
smartphone-based digital cognitive assessment designed specifically for participants at risk for Down
syndrome-associated Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD). We will partner with sites in London, Barcelona, Munich,
and Gothenburg to develop and validate this approach in different cultures and languages. Nearly all
individuals with Down syndrome have elevated levels of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers by the time they
are in their 30s or 40s, though not all show symptoms of AD. It is during the pre-symptomatic and early
symptomatic stages of DS-AD that an in-depth understanding of cognitive changes is crucial, as therapeutic
interventions to stop, slow, or prevent disease are focused on these critical periods. Typically, prevention trials
and observational studies in AD populations assess cognition with standard “table top” paper and pencil tests.
But these conventional methods have several drawbacks. First, performance is influenced by day to day
fluctuations in stress, fatigue, sleep patterns, and mood. Second, the testing takes place in environments that
are fundamentally different from where cognition is relied upon to function in daily life. Finally, by design,
cognition is typically assessed in “one-shot” in extended testing sessions on an annual or semiannual basis.
 The DS-ARC study will address these difficulties by developing a smartphone-based assessment solution
adapted specifically for individuals with Down syndrome. This approach uses a measurement “burst” design in
which participants complete very brief cognitive tests on their smartphones several times per day for one week
while living in their natural environments. Instead of focusing on one of these measurements, tests are
averaged across the week to provide a score that captures and normalizes natural variability and dramatically
increases reliability. Studies of our original ARC assessments in autosomal dominant and sporadic AD
demonstrate extraordinary reliability and strong relationships with AD biomarkers, while reducing costly and
burdensome in-clinic evaluations. The study has two phases: a 2-year development phase and a 3-year
validation phase. In the development phase, we will adapt an existing smartphone application called the
Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) app for use in DS-AD studies. This will include an iterative pilot
testing process for psychometrics and task development, focus groups and user experience testing to address
accessibility and compatibility concerns for DS-AD populations, and readiness audits to ensure that the DS-
ARC app meets strict compliance guidelines for clinical trial applications. In Phase 2, participants complete DS-
ARC assessments every 6 months and complete standard clinical, cognitive, and blood tests for AD
biomarkers annually. We hypothesize that DS-ARC assessments are accessible, sensitive, and reliable
indicators of cognitive change in DS-AD and will exhibit associations with AD biomarkers and disease stage
over and above those of conventional in-clinic assessments."

vulnerability to relapse, with few therapeutic options available. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a central hub
within reward circuitry and plays a critical role in the motivational value of drugs and drug-associated cues. Within
the heterogeneous neuronal subtypes of the NAc exist the sparsely distributed fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs).
The NAc FSIs receive strong excitatory inputs from cortical, thalamic and limbic regions and exert powerful
inhibition over the local projection neurons, making them a prime candidate for translational therapeutic
strategies to reduce the burden of the opioid abuse epidemic. The overall objectives of this application are to
elucidate how NAc FSI circuitry responds to, and mediates, opioid self-administration.
 Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Patrick Rothwell at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Lefevre has
utilized graduate training in molecular and behavioral pharmacology techniques, and post-doctoral training in ex-
vivo electrophysiology to study adaptations in NAc circuitry in non-contingent opioid addiction models. This
Pathway to Independence Award will provide the opportunity to broaden the candidate’s expertise to include in
vivo fiber photometry calcium imaging, and chemogenetics, under the continued mentorship of Dr. Rothwell. To
expand career development in addiction research, Dr. Lefevre will receive additional support from co-mentor Dr.
Mark Thomas in the implementation of contingent opioid self-administration models in female and male mice.
 During the mentored (K99) phase of the award, fiber photometry calcium imaging will be used to monitor
in vivo activity patterns of NAc FSIs in an Intermittent Access (IntA) fentanyl self-administration protocol to identify
how this neural population responds to contingent fentanyl and fentanyl-associated cues. Subsequently, a
chemogenetic approach, which will involve targeted expression of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by
Designer Drugs (DREADDs) by NAc FSIs, will be used to test the hypothesis that these neurons play a functional
role in addiction-related behavior. Following fentanyl self-administration, DREADDs will be used to excite or
inhibit NAc FSIs prior to progressive ratio and cue-induced reinstatement tests. This innovative combination of
tools will be used to test the relationship between NAc FSIs and the manifestation of fentanyl self-administration.
 The R00 phase of the award will distinguish Dr. Lefevre’s independent research from her mentors and
broaden to identifying the role of excitatory synaptic inputs to NAc FSIs. Ex-vivo electrophysiology will be utilized
to define input-specific excitatory synaptic plasticity adaptations in NAc FSIs induced by fentanyl self-
administration. Additionally, the R00 aims will incorporate electrophysiology, optogenetic and calcium imaging
expertise to develop stimulation protocols that restore opioid induced shifts in FSI circuitry and addiction-like
behavior. Overall, the aims proposed in this award will identify key FSI circuits in opioid self-administration and
provide the foundation for Dr. Lefevre’s independent research program studying the neural circuitry of addiction."
11092355,"Despite major advances in treatment and prevention of HIV infection, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues
 to cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. Of the 37.7 million people living with HIV worldwide, only
 73% are receiving antiretroviral therapy. In 2020 alone, an estimated 680,000 people died from
 AIDS-related illness, and nearly two million people are newly infected with HIV each year. The HIV burden
 is highest in parts of the world that face the additional challenge of highly constrained resources. HIV
 testing and treatment guidelines have continually evolved; however, assessing the benefits associated
 with improved testing, more effective antiretroviral therapy, and increasingly effective prevention
 interventions is difficult. It is unclear which specific strategies and overall approach would be most
 effective for specific populations, given the critical reality of budget constraints.
 This competing continuation proposes to expand upon the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS
 Complications International (CEPAC-I) Model, a computer microsimulation of the natural history,
 management, outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of HIV clinical care. This proposal includes
 cutting-edge, guideline-informing studies of novel treatments and development of innovative modeling
 optimization methods to advance the field. There are two specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To expand the CEPAC-I microsimulation to address new clinical policy questions focused
 on key populations, using data from recent clinical trials and implementation research studies.
 Specific Aim 2: To expand upon the optimization model and better determine the combination of HIV care
 interventions that most decreases HIV incidence in countries with different epidemic characteristics and
 resource constraints.
 In close alignment with the 2022 research priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, the goals of this
 proposal include reducing HIV incidence, identifying optimal prevention and treatment responses, and
 reducing health disparities by improving key population outcomes. The assembled research team has the
 ideal combination of skills and experience to address critical questions around the cost-effectiveness of
 new interventions for HIV in high-risk populations. The results will lead to new insights to inform clinicians
 and policymakers, leading to improved HIV treatment guidelines in multiple resource-limited settings."

SIGNIFICANCE:
HIV has been shown to seed in the central nervous system (CNS) during primary viremia and serve as a
reservoir of HIV (PMCID: PMC10266791, PMC32332225). In addition to latent reservoirs, replication-
competent reservoirs are believed to persist in the CNS during cART (PMID: PMC31790378, PMC5831193,
PMC5044815, PMC5559639, PMC7896558). This is particularly concerning for infants as their brains grow
and develop, leading to numerous neurodevelopment consequences (PMID: 24125015) and neurologic
diseases (PMID: 24806816). Compared to peripheral infection and reservoirs, current understandings of CNS
infection and associated neuroinflammation during early infection and under early treatment are limited.
Advances in molecular biology, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches have allowed our team
to develop a strategy to track infected cell clones with viral integration sites to show the impact of therapy on
virus infected clonally expanded cells (PMID: 32766447, PMID: 25289675, PMID: 24702996, PMID: 20844053,
PMID: 28654067). Moreover, we explore the utility of a library of barcoded viruses to achieve a population level
analysis of infection in latent reservoirs and after HIV rebound (PMID: 33377133, PMID: 35013215). Here,
these technologies will be adapted to assess the impact of bNAbs on SHIV CNS infection.
AIMS:
In this project, we propose to examine in detail the early dynamics and neuroinflammation of CNS infection in
the SHIV infant macaque model established at the ONPRC. We have established unique molecular
approaches to delineate CNS infection and reservoirs and their changes responding to treatment. Our team
uses a library of barcoded viruses to quantify the frequency of tagged viruses which are integrated, and the
relative level of each tagged virus produced in the periphery and the CNS. We have also developed high
throughput sequence analysis of viral integration sites, which enables quantitation of clonal expansion of
infected cells. Both assays together provide sensitive and quantitative means to assess the impact of therapy
upon the contribution of infected cells to the SHIV reservoir in the CNS. In Aim 2, we will further test a novel
therapeutic strategy aimed towards CNS infection suppression and clearance through effective delivery of
nanocapsuled bNAb in the CNS. Importantly, our CNS-delivered nanocapsules can be extended to various
bNAbs and other therapeutics (e.g., other immunotherapeutics, gene-editing agents, anti-viral drugs), opening
a new avenue for the development of novel HIV therapeutics.
IMPACT:
The success of this study will begin to dissect the mechanisms underlying CNS infection in infants and
demonstrate the effectiveness of bNAbs with improved CNS delivery to suppress CNS and deep tissue
infection and reservoirs. The successful completion of this project and acquired knowledge may lead to
interventions that could be initiated within the first few weeks of infection, the window of opportunity associated
with reduced mortality and HIV progression in infants (PMCID: PMC7073445, PMC2950021, PMID:
11029005)."
10633272,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While tremendous progress has been made to understand mechanisms of epithelial cell injury and fibroblast
activation in fibrosis, significant challenges remain in fully understanding the mechanisms of epithelial–
mesenchymal crosstalk in normal lung homeostasis and during injury, repair and fibrosis. As in normal lung
development, lung repair requires epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells to coordinate with each other to tune
cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. Similarly, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is
mediated by a myriad of pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic factors that are precisely orchestrated by epithelium and
mesenchyme during injury, repair and resolution. Therefore, aberrant epithelial mesenchymal interactions can
lead to non-healing processes in lung repair with pathological scar formation due to myofibroblast
accumulation and ECM deposition, ultimately contributing to pulmonary fibrosis. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to restore epithelial-mesenchymal homeostasis in pulmonary fibrosis with transcriptional regulation
of critical anti-fibrotic factors. Targeting mechanisms that augment the endogenous anti-fibrotic or fibrosis
resolution signals during disease progression may serve as an attractive therapeutic strategy to alleviate lung
fibrosis and restore lung function. Recently, single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identified loss of normal
epithelial cell identities and gain of abnormal indeterminate states of differentiation in IPF, with CEBPA
identified as a key transcriptional regulator diminished in IPF that was common to multiple independent
studies. Our central hypothesis is that CEBPA deficiency in lung epithelial cells promotes lung fibroblast
activation and fibrosis, that it normally increases during repair to resolve fibrosis, and that it can be
therapeutically restored using non-genome editing CRISPR gene activation to promote fibrosis resolution. This
hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: First, we will evaluate the role of Cebpa signaling from
epithelial cells in maintaining lung epithelial-mesenchymal homeostasis and its protective role in pulmonary
fibrosis. Second, we will determine whether increasing Cebpa expression with CRISPR gene activation is able
to restore epithelial-mesenchymal homeostasis and attenuate fibroblast activation and fibrosis. We will develop
and optimize an AAV-mediated approach to enhance Cebpa expression using non-genome editing CRISPR
activation in the lung of aged mice that display non-resolving lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury. Lastly, We will
test whether the anti-fibrotic effect of epithelial Cebpa expression is mediated by BMP4 and perform RNA-seq-
based gene expression analysis of sorted epithelial cells from Cebpa gain and loss of function studies to
identify additional novel candidate mediators of epithelial-mesenchymal homeostasis. Taken together, the
proposed research studies will reveal critical anti-fibrotic targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring
epithelial-mesenchymal homeostasis and alleviating pulmonary fibrosis."
11096165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is clinical and scientific interest in developing on-demand local anesthesia, in which local anesthetics can
only be released by an external trigger when and where needed after the first administration. In the past few
years, injectable local anesthetic formulations have been developed that can generate on-demand local
anesthesia triggered by light and ultrasound. However, their clinical application is hindered by shortcomings,
such as basal drug release when the trigger is not applied, a small number of repetitive trigger events for one
injection (usually 4 to 6 times), the trigger event only occurs within a few hours after the injection, potential local
tissue toxicity caused by the external triggers, and expensive preparation procedures. In this research, in order
to overcome these shortcomings, we aim to explore cold triggered local anesthesia. The formulation design
consists of three components: tetrodotoxin (TTX), cold therapy, and thermo-responsive polymersomes/hydrogels.
We hypothesize that TTX is an extremely potent local anesthetic, a small amount can successfully produce local
anesthesia, thereby improving the efficacy of each trigger and increasing the number of trigger events; cold
treatment is a common use of hypothermia in medical therapy, which has the characteristics of low cost, easy
operation, and non-invasiveness; thermo-responsive polymersomes/hydrogels can efficiently encapsulate TTX
at body temperature, but release TTX due to the deconstruction of the polymersomes/hydrogels under cold
treatment. In addition, the polymersomes/hydrogels can stay at the injection site for a long time, acting as a drug
reservoir to achieve long-term effects. Specifically, a large library of polymersomes/hydrogels with various
structures (size and porosity) and properties (structurally stability and shell stiffness) will be fabricated. Such
a library will be a collection of candidates. Iterative screening will be conducted to identify the
polymersomes/hydrogels with the desired in vitro cold triggerable TTX release, enhanced local retention in
tissues, and excellent biocompatibility (cytotoxicity, inflammation, myotoxicity, organ toxicity). Then, the rat
footpad anesthesia model and rat paw incision wound infiltration model will be used to evaluate the in vivo
efficacy and safety of the selected polymersomes/hydrogels in cold triggered local anesthesia."

The oxidation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds is a central biochemical process required by all aerobic
organisms. The microbial conversion of these bonds endows potent bioactivity on natural products and enable
pathogens to thrive on otherwise inert host-derived biomolecules. These reactions are currently known to be
accomplished by a short list of cofactors that include heme, nonheme iron, and copper. While manganese
cofactors perform difficult oxidation reactions, including water oxidation within Photosystem II, they are generally
not known to be used for C-H bond activation. We recently discovered that the 2-aminoisobutyric acid
hydroxylase from Rhodococcus wratislaviensis, AibH1H2, requires manganese to functionalize a strong,
aliphatic C-H bond (BDE = 100 kcal/mol). Structural and spectroscopic studies of this enzyme revealed a redox-
active, heterobimetallic manganese-iron active site at the locus of O2 activation and substrate coordination. This
result expands the known reactivity of biological manganese-iron cofactors, which was previously restricted to
single electron transfer or stoichiometric protein oxidation. Since the AibH1H2 cofactor is supported by a protein
fold distinct from typical, well-studied bimetallic oxygenases, our proposed research centers on the
characterization of ill-defined members of this protein family. Our preliminary results indicate that many of these
proteins harbor two active-site metal ions, behave as monooxygenases and, in some cases, display enhanced
enzymatic activity when manganese ions are preferentially incorporated within the active site. The core scientific
hypothesis for this study is that the unique sequence and structural features of this emergent class of
monooxygenases endows embedded manganese ions with otherwise unknown biological reactivity. To
investigate this hypothesis, the specific aims of this study are to (1) understand the signature amino acid motifs
that differentiate these monooxygenases from their ancestral, structurally-related amidohydrolases, (2)
characterize the geometric and electronic structures of mixed iron/manganese-containing enzymatic
intermediates, and (3) evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic competence of cambialistic Mn/Fe
monooxygenases. The resulting enzymatic information, methods, and structures will be of specific interest to
those in the fields of metallo-enzymology, structural biology, and synthetic bioinorganic chemistry, and of broad
interest to microbiologists in general."
11097622,"PROJECT SUMMARY: We are interested in understanding how lipid-metabolizing enzymes and lipid transport
proteins function and are regulated at the molecular and structural level. Previously, we focused on two enzymes
in phosphatidic acid (PA) metabolism: lipin and phospholipase D (PLD). Lipins are PA phosphatases that
dephosphorylate PA to generate diacylglycerol, which is the penultimate step in triglyceride biosynthesis. Lipins
regulate phospholipid and lipoprotein synthesis, fat storage as triglycerides, fatty acid synthesis, and insulin
sensitivity with implications to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. PLDs hydrolyze
phosphatidylcholine to produce the lipid second messenger PA in response to extracellular stimuli. Receptor-
mediated activation of PLD regulates vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation, and cell migration, which has
established them as therapeutic targets for cancer. Despite extensive studies on these highly regulated, multi-
domain enzymes, significant gaps remain in our knowledge of their molecular mechanisms of action. During the
past funding period, we determined the first structures of lipin and PLD, identified a new type of membrane-
binding domain in lipins, and provided insight into PLD activation by lipids and protein effectors. These
discoveries provide an excellent foundation for this application, where our main goals include 1) continuing to
understand how PLD is activated by protein effectors and lipids, and 2) examining the molecular mechanisms
regulating lipin PA phosphatase activity and PA substrate specificity. We will also 3) biochemically and
structurally characterize the nuclear envelope protein phosphatase complex CTDNEP1-NEP1R1, which
dephosphorylates lipin to control lipin PA phosphatase activity; and 4) study the structure and function of Nir lipid
transfer proteins, which transfer PA and phosphatidylinositol between membrane contact sites to replenish pools
of plasma membrane phosphoinositides after hydrolysis by PLC. Structural studies will be complemented by an
array of lipid biochemistry and lipid-protein interaction assays that we are well versed in, hydrogen-deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry, and cellular studies in mammalian cells. A network of collaborators who are
leaders in their respective fields supports these studies. We aim to answer several major questions: (1) How
does the structure of lipid-modifying enzymes allow them to recognize their lipid substrates and interact with the
membrane? (2) What role do structurally and/or functionally uncharacterized domains play in the action of these
proteins? (3) How are these enzymes/proteins regulated? Specifically, are they autoinhibited? how do protein
effectors, lipids, ions, and post-translational modifications regulate activity? and what conformational changes
occur during activation? Overall, this work will improve our understanding of biological mechanisms and provide
information on lipid-protein interactions of physiological and pharmacological significance."

11093248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ribosomes are large ribonucleoprotein complexes that are integral to translational control. The assembly and
maturation of ribosomal subunits involves a multitude of trans-acting factors that render the subunits
translationally competent. Maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit is accomplished by the release of eukaryotic
initiation factor-6 (eIF6) with the help of the maturation factors-SBDS and EFL1-GTPase. eIF6 sterically hinders
association of the 60S and 40S subunits and therefore, its release from 60S is critical to permit interactions
between 60S and the mRNA-bound 40S subunits. In addition, eIF6 is essential for rRNA processing in the
nucleolus and is associated with the translationally stalled 60S-ribosome quality control complex. Given its
essential roles, the spatial and temporal aspects of eIF6 activities and its release from 60S must be tightly
regulated to ensure successful initiation of translation. Impaired release of eIF6 is the defining hallmark of certain
ribosomopathies: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and RPL10 mutations-driven pediatric leukemias. eIF6 levels
are also deregulated in several cancers and its enhanced expression is associated with a poor prognosis.
Remarkably, restricting eIF6 levels inhibits growth of certain cancers without affecting normal growth. Therefore,
targeting eIF6 and its release from 60S has been proposed to be a desirable therapeutic strategy for cancers
and ribosomopathies. However, we are yet to understand the role of eIF6 in modulating the distinct steps of 60S
assembly and maturation. Also, the molecular mechanisms that regulate eIF6 interactions with the 60S are not
completely understood. Towards understanding these mechanisms, our recent work has identified key residues
in critical interfaces of eIF6 that modulate its interaction with 60S, and our preliminary data provide direct
evidence that the disruption of this interaction is detrimental to cancer cell viability. We have also identified novel
sites of regulation in the C-terminus of eIF6 and have uncovered its importance for controlling translational rates.
Building on these discoveries, in the current proposal we aim to define the mechanistic steps that promote the
release of eIF6 by SBDS, and EFL1 from distinct functional states of 60S and to uncover the role of GTPase
activity of EFL1 using a rigorous set of biochemical, biophysical, and single molecule approaches. In addition,
we aim to uncover the mechanism of allosteric regulation by the C-terminus of eIF6 and elucidate the functional
and phenotypic effects of disease-specific mutations of eIF6 using cellular and in vivo approaches. These studies
will provide crucial mechanistic insight into 60S dynamics and will enable the development of therapeutics
focused on eIF6 and its regulators."

There is a vast repertoire of species within cells for which we have a poor understanding of their function and
biomolecular interactions. These species can be referred to as the “dark matter” of biology, as their mechanism
of action is hidden from conventional observation. Our laboratory seeks to illuminate the function of cellular “dark
matter” through the development of new chemical technology. The proposed research program will pursue two
major research thrusts. First, we plan to develop tools for site-specific RNA modification, and apply these tools
for the manipulation, imaging, and isolation of disease relevant RNA protein complexes. We will create tools for
use in live cells and develop the ability to covalently recruit proteins to RNA, forming RNA-protein
macromolecular conjugates. The technology will be applied to study RNAs implicated in disease. Specifically,
we are interested in characterizing the pathways of pathogenicity for the C9orf72 nucleotide repeat expansion
RNA, which is thought to play a major role in genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the second thrust,
we will carry out the in situ synthesis of lipid species within living cells, with the goal of uncovering the molecular
mechanism by which enigmatic lipid species affect cell behavior. We plan to develop approaches enabling the
selective and bioorthogonal delivery of sphingolipids to living cells. Building upon technology previously
developed in our lab, we will deliver cell permeable lipid precursors which will spontaneously assemble into
functional lipids within the cell. Leveraging this approach, we will create photoaffinity probes for the pulldown of
sphingolipid-interacting proteins, with the goal of elucidating the protein partners of the non-canonical
deoxysphingolipid 1-deoxydihydroceramide, which is cytotoxic and implicated in several diseases. Realization
of our research program goals would improve our knowledge of cell biology and lead to the development of new
tools for interrogating RNA and lipid species. Our long-term vision is to create and apply technology that enables
improved mechanistic understanding of biomolecular interactions, leading to an increased understanding of
human disease, and accelerating the development of possible therapeutic interventions."
11091987,"Background: Although more than 1 million Veterans regularly use cannabis (i.e., have used cannabis within
the past month), only limited research has investigated cannabis use among Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) patients. Furthermore, existing health records do not ascertain use that is below the threshold of a
cannabis use disorder, suggesting that a substantial portion of patients who regularly use cannabis are not
documented or monitored by their VHA providers. This absence of data is concerning given the links between
cannabis use and adverse physical, mental health, and social outcomes. Such consequences may be even
more pronounced among certain population subgroups, including those with psychiatric illnesses, which are
overrepresented in the VHA patient population. Despite potential harms, some patients who use cannabis
report that it is beneficial for the management of chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other
illnesses, and 23 States and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of cannabis for individuals with
qualifying medical conditions. Research is needed to characterize and understand patterns of cannabis use
and how they relate to health, functioning, and service utilization among VHA primary care patients.
Objectives: 1) To characterize cannabis use among a representative sample of VHA primary care patients; 2)
To examine the extent to which cannabis use is associated with psychoactive medication use (e.g., opiates
and other psychotropics), substance use, substance use disorder symptoms, mental health symptoms (e.g.,
PTSD), pain, functioning, and treatment utilization among a cross-sectional sample of patients with regular
cannabis and those with no past-year use; 3) To identify cannabis use and cannabis use disorder symptom
trajectories at 6- and 12-months following an initial primary care visit; 4) To longitudinally estimate associations
between cannabis trajectory groups and psychoactive medication use (e.g., opiates and other psychotropics),
substance use, substance use disorder symptoms, mental health symptoms (e.g., PTSD), pain, functioning,
and treatment utilization. A secondary aim is to compare use, trajectories, and outcomes between those with
and without State-issued medical cannabis certification to examine how patients with medical cannabis
certification differ from those without it in the nature and extent of cannabis use and problems.
Methods: To achieve these objectives, the proposed project will screen Veterans receiving primary care at 3
VAMCs in Michigan. Through screening the project will identify a group of 500 patients with regular cannabis
use, defined as at least monthly use during the past year, and an age- and sex-matched comparison group of
500 Veterans without past-year cannabis use. Both groups will complete an in-depth cross-sectional baseline
interview. Following screening and baseline, the 500 patients with regular cannabis use will comprise a cohort
that will be re-assessed at 6- and 12-months follow-up to identify cannabis use and cannabis use disorder
symptom trajectories and related health, functioning, and service utilization outcomes."

Efficient genome maintenance is a double-edged sword. Accurate repair of DNA lesions and damaged
replication forks promotes genome stability, which is a key to avoiding cancer, aging and neurodegenerative
diseases associated with DNA repeat expansion. My research program under the parent NIH R35GM131704
MIRA grant (PI: Spies) investigates the molecular and structural mechanisms by which the intermediates of DNA
metabolism bound by Replication Protein A (RPA) are channeled into DNA repair, protection of DNA replication
forks, homologous recombination, DNA damage tolerance and signaling. Our goal is to reconstitute (in vitro and
in singulo) and manipulate (in vivo) the elaborate network of DNA repair mechanisms, and to understand how
cells “choose” between accurate DNA repair and “rogue” mechanisms that destabilize the genome.
Ability to visualize and investigate biologically important molecules individually, in real time, and under
physiological conditions is critical for developing mechanistic understanding of how cells work and communicate,
how molecular machines assemble and function, and, in general, how physiological functions emerge from the
chaos of stochastic molecular events and interactions. All projects under the parent MIRA award utilize single-
molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (smTIRFM), correlated optical tweezers and
fluorescence microscopy (CTFM), mass photometry, structural biology (CryoEM) and biochemical
reconstitutions to visualize and quantify the dynamic assembly and remodeling of the nucleoprotein complexes
coordinating DNA repair events, homologous recombination and processing of non-canonical DNA structures.
While my lab has been successful in broadening the scope of state-of-the-art single-molecule approaches to
study macro-molecular interactions, their dynamics and inhibition using smTIRFM, surface-tethering required for
this approach makes it impossible to rapidly screen experimental conditions, build fluorescence and Forster
resonance energy transfer (smFRET) distributions.
This application requests funds for acquisition of the EI-FLEX, a single-molecule fluorescence spectrometer
which has a capacity to simultaneously and rapidly record (i) fluorescence and FRET from single molecules in
solution, and (ii) fluorescence decay correlations which inform on complex sizes. Such information on the
complexes containing RPA, alt-RPA, FANCJ, REV1 and PARP1 will help us to build a completely new picture of
the nexus between RPA configuraiotnal dynamics and shuttling of the RPA-containing complexes into specific
genome maintenance pathways."

Metalloproteins perform chemical transformations with rates and selectivites that have yet to be achieved in
synthetic or designed systems. These differences in reactivity are directly linked to the environment produced
by the protein matrix. To test our understanding of how metalloproteins function, I aim to design de novo
metalloenzymes from scratch. Proteins that bind porphyrin-like cofactors are of particular interest, as heme
proteins are known to perform a variety of reactions. Recently, I designed a protein to bind the abiological
porphyrin, Mn-diphenylporphyrin (MnDPP), that provided the first crystallographic structure of a de novo
designed porphyrin-binding protein (MPP1). MPP1 was also capable of stabilizing a Mn(V)-oxo species, a
powerful oxidant that can perform sulfoxidation of thioether substrates. The proposed research seeks to
elucidate design features necessary to control the reactivity/stability of this high-valent species through
rational mutagenesis of my designed protein. This will allow direct correlation of changes in reactivity to
changes in structure. To gain greater control of substrate orientation and, therefore, product distribution, I will
design a 5-helix bundle that has a large pocket for substrate binding. Using the design strategy for MPP1 and
in-house developed computational methods, the 5-helix bundle will be parameterized from scratch and
designed to bind MnDPP. A library of sequences will be expressed and screened using high-throughput
methods for binding and sulfoxidation activity. Promising scaffolds will then be redesigned to include
substrate-specific interactions to bind the anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Using COMBS, a recently
developed bioinformatics method for designing backbone specific polar interactions, I will design two proteins
to control the orientation of diclofenac to direct the hydroxylation to yield 5-hydroxydiclofenac or 4’-
hydroxydiclofenac. This work would be a breakthrough in protein design and will directly impact the
fundamental understanding of the effects of protein environments on the function of metal centers in
metalloproteins."

 Ribosomes are complex ribonucleoprotein particles that catalyze protein synthesis in almost all cells in

eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled in vivo. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to facilitate molecular
genetic approaches, and cultured Hela cells to enable us to visualize the nucleolus, the cellular compartment
where ribosomes are made.
 Production of ribosomes is tightly linked to cell growth and proliferation. Consequently, dysregulation of
ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar integrity is linked to many diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative
diseases, or developmental disorders. Because pathways of ribosome biogenesis are very conserved, our
studies in yeast will help understand mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation of ribosome production in
humans.
 Ribosome biogenesis requires a dynamic series of remodeling steps in which protein and RNA interactions
are established and reconfigured. These steps are made more efficient and more accurate by the activities of
more than 200 assembly factors present in nascent yeast ribosomes, which are required for their assembly, and
conserved across eukaryotes.
 To enable in-depth studies of mechanisms driving ribosome assembly, we focus on one interval: just prior to,
during, and immediately after exit of large ribosomal subunit precursors from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm.
During this stage, several domains of ribosomal RNA are rearranged, numerous assembly factors complete their
functions and exit from pre-ribosomes, and new assembly factors enter the particles. We want to learn how these
dynamic remodeling steps are powered forward by energy-consuming assembly factors present at this stage.
 We are also investigating interconnections between ribosome assembly and the nucleolus, the prominent
biomolecular condensate thought to be formed through multivalent interactions between pre-ribosomes and
other nucleolar components. However, it is not clear exactly how ribosome assembly creates a nucleolus, nor
how material properties of the nucleolus enable efficient ribosome assembly.
 We propose experiments to address the following questions: (1) How do the RNA helicases/ATPases Drs1,
Has1, Dbp10, and Spb4 power maturation of pre-60S subunits during mid to late nucleolar stages of assembly?
(2) How does the structure and composition of pre-ribosomes enable them to be retained in the nucleolus? (3)
How does ribosome assembly contribute to the morphology and fluidity of the nucleolus?"

Chronic pain is a prevalent, disabling problem affecting as many as 50% of men and 75% of women Veterans.
There is widespread recognition of the importance of developing effective complementary and integrative
health (CIH) treatments and the need to optimize their effectiveness. The CIH pain treatment with the most
empirical support is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, not everyone benefits from CBT. Prior
research has shown that two CIH interventions, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Hypnotic
Cognitive Therapy (HYP-CT), are beneficial and offer alternatives to CBT and have similar efficacy. However,
as with CBT, individual response to these treatments also varies considerably. Our preliminary data suggests
the variability in treatment outcome may be due to important baseline patient differences. This suggests the
possibility that patients can be effectively “matched” to the treatments they are most likely to benefit from,
based on information that can be obtained before treatment starts. Research is needed to develop patient-
treatment matching algorithms that could match a given individual to the evidence-based treatment most likely
to be beneficial given their unique individual profile. The overall aim of the proposed study is to address this
need by identifying patient factors that determine who benefits most from two CIH treatments and the current
gold standard non-pharmacological treatment (CBT), relative to usual care. This aim will be addressed using a
clinical trial in which participants will be randomized to one of the four treatment conditions. We will test
hypotheses – developed from both theory and prior pilot research – that pre-treatment brain activity patterns,
hypnotizability, catastrophizing, and mindfulness moderate pre- to post-treatment improvements in pain
intensity associated with group-delivered CBT, MBCT, and HYP-CT, relative to usual care, in Veterans with
chronic pain. The findings will provide the foundation for building an algorithm to support personalized care,
whereby Veterans can be offered the treatment that will be most beneficial for them. This study will also help
develop knowledge about potentially powerful alternatives to pharmacological/opioid analgesic approaches.
Finally, the study findings will be useful to health care providers and their patients to facilitate shared decision-
making."

 This proposal aims to elucidate how the bacterial enzyme nitrogenase catalyzes the
chemically difficult transformation of atmospheric dinitrogen into a bioavailable form, ammonia,
and why/how it utilizes ATP hydrolysis to drive this reaction. Being the only enzyme responsible
for reductive nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase sustains the agricultural/nutritional needs of ~40% of
the human population. Aside from its global importance, nitrogenase is a unique model system
with broad relevance to biological redox catalysis as well as ATP/GTP-dependent energy
transduction processes, which are both central to proper cellular functioning and thus directly
relevant to human health.
 Despite nearly five decades of extensive biochemical, biophysical and structural
characterization, the two most important questions about nitrogenase mechanism have not
answered in detail: a) Why and how ATP hydrolysis is ultimately utilized for the reduction of N2
or alternative substrates? b) What is the intimate mechanism of dinitrogen reduction on the
nitrogenase active site cluster, FeMoco? The major experimental challenge in the investigations
of nitrogenase arises from the fact that the catalytic activity of nitrogenase depends on
continuous ATP turnover, which leads to a heterogeneous mixture of redox and nucleotide-
bound states of nitrogenase that are difficult to distinguish from one another. To circumvent this
challenge, we have initiated a research program in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to
structurally characterize dynamic states of nitrogenase at atomic resolution under enzymatic
turnover conditions. Preliminary experiments have not only established the feasibility of this
approach but also revealed unexpected structural features of nitrogenase which have fueled
new mechanistic hypotheses. In the proposed project, we aim to build upon on our preliminary
findings by a) mapping the ATP-driven conformational landscape of nitrogenase in
unprecedented detail and b) elucidating FeMoco structural dynamics and FeMoco-small
molecule interactions in atomic resolution, while also c) contributing to the development of
cutting-edge cryoEM methodologies for the structural interrogation of highly complex/dynamic
protein assemblies and metallocofactors."

Preeclampsia (preE) is a potentially fatal complication of pregnancy that affects 2-8% of pregnancies
worldwide. Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. Interestingly, the incidence of preE
demonstrates a seasonal pattern, whereby summer months conception (in the Northern Hemisphere) is
associated with the highest rates of preE. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer months are associated with
hotter temperatures compared to the winter months. High ambient temperatures are associated with several
negative health outcomes. For example, high ambient temperatures have been linked to increased incidence of
acute cardiovascular disease and worsening chronic cardiovascular disease. Similarly, kidney function is
significantly negatively impacted by high ambient temperatures. Given the central role of cardiovascular and
renal systems in the pathophysiology of preE, the association between elevated ambient temperatures and
adverse maternal-fetal outcomes assumes particular significance in the context of preE. Advanced maternal age
is also a risk factor for preE. Like chronological age, there is evidence supporting an association between
epigenetic age acceleration and preE. Exhibition of epigenetic age acceleration has been strongly correlated
with age-related diseases but has been scarcely studied in preE. The goals of this project are to: 1) Test the
association between the number of high ambient heat days during the first trimester with preE status during
the current pregnancy and identify the critical threshold at which ambient heat during the first trimester
impacts preE and 2) Test the association between epigenetic age acceleration and preE status during the
current pregnancy; and among participants diagnosed with preE during the current pregnancy, explore
whether high ambient heat days modify the association between epigenetic age acceleration and preE. The
findings from this study will provide epidemiologic and environmental evidence about the additional risk heat
may play for preE among individuals already experiencing chronic hypertension. Additionally, this project will
add to our understanding of the relationship between preE and epigenetic age acceleration."

Embryonic development requires the dynamic remodeling of epithelial sheets as the embryo
transforms itself during morphogenesis. Embryonic epithelia are hybrid tissues: they must
maintain their integrity as mechanically integrated cell sheets, connected by cell-cell junctions,
yet their cells must also retain the ability to dynamically change shape and position. The actin
cytoskeleton is central to these activities; cells must link actomyosin networks dynamically to the
cell surface via junctional complexes, and they must dynamically polymerize actin networks
during cell shape changes and cell migratory events. Our goal is to understand the dynamics of
actin networks during rapid cell shape change and during directed cell rearrangement in
embryos. Our goal is a multidisciplinary, integrated analysis of morphogenetic movements in
embryos that unites detailed structural analysis, single-molecule biophysics, genetics, and
dynamic in vivo analysis, in an ""Angstroms to embryos"" approach to morphogenesis. Upgrading
our ability to image nucleic and protein gels using modern USB3-based and more sensitive
cameras controlled by computers that adhere to modern security standards will allow us to
generate more sensitive and reproducible molecular analyses relevant to all aims of the parent
award, including quantitative assessment of protein-protein interactions between proteins that
are part of a network of mechanosensitive proteins that acts to stabilize junctional actin
networks during rapid morphogenetic changes in embryos."

 The Program brings together leading academic research institutions with longstanding relationships in
LMICs in a variety of disciplines and with multidisciplinary research capacities. The inclusion of institutions that
have shown a historical commitment to educating students from groups underrepresented in biomedical
research is prioritized. The four U.S. academic research institutions that will anchor our consortium are:
Harvard University (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health); Boston University (School of Public Health);
Northwestern University (Institute for Global Health, Feinberg School of Medicine); and the University of New
Mexico (School of Medicine, Center for Global Health).
 Our consortium’s partner LMIC research sites are 18 well-qualified institutions in 14 LMICs. These sites
have strong pre-existing relationships with the Program’s principal investigators and institutions and have
demonstrated capacity to provide outstanding mentored experiences. Specific Aims include:
AIM 1: Recruit a diverse pool of qualified U.S. predoctoral and U.S. and LMICS postdoctoral applicants;
including at least 17 trainees per year for Years 1-2 and 16 trainees per year for Years 3-5, for a minimum of
82 trainees over the award period; AIM 2: Deliver a comprehensive education and research support program,
including Field Preparedness Training, Monthly Seminars, and U.S. based training for LMIC trainees, that will
combine in-person and online learning and access to collaboration tools to support trainee individual
professional development and research project implementation; AIM 3: Provide trainees with rigorous
mentored research experiences at LMIC research sites with a very strong track record of peer-reviewed
publications and NIH research outputs; AIM 4: Build LMIC and global health research capacity at consortium
member institutions and internationally through activities such as alumni mentors and the Mentor Symposium.
 Ultimately, the Program will prepare a future generation of leaders to tackle and solve the most
challenging global health problems through early investment in committed predoctoral and postdoctoral
trainees to foster scientific creativity at a transformative stage in their career.

11093275,"Summary/Abstract for requested administrative supplement to GM-15792-57.
With this administrative supplement to our current NIGMS grant (GM-15792-57) we seek funds to purchase a
much-needed replacement surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument that is important for our current DNA
replication studies and for other related work of our group. Substantial parts of our ongoing research efforts are
focused on achieving a detailed mechanistic understanding of the function and control of the sub-assemblies of
the DNA replication complex of bacteriophage T4 by applying spectroscopic methods that site-specifically
position fluorescent and optically active probes in the DNA framework of the replication complex at important
protein binding sites. We use these labeled constructs to monitor – both with bulk (ensemble) solution
measurements and at the single-molecule level – biologically significant local conformational changes at defined
DNA positions that have been labeled with our spectroscopic probes.
SPR is an important analytical tool for monitoring equilibrium and dynamic properties of protein-DNA complexes,
including those in which the DNA components have been labeled with optical probes. We are pursuing two
different fluorescent probe-labeling strategies for our studies on DNA and protein-DNA interactions. We use pairs
of spectrally visible iCy3 dyes placed (internally) within the DNA backbones at defined positions to study the
structure and dynamics of local DNA backbone conformations and conformational fluctuations, while pairs of
fluorescent 6-MI base analogues, which have been substituted for natural guanine DNA bases, are used to
obtain complementary information about the structure and dynamics of the bases and base-pairs at defined sites
within our model DNA replication-fork constructs. SPR measurements provide important information to support
our ensemble and single-molecule measurements of probe-labeled systems, in addition to providing important
‘control’ information about these systems in the absence of probes.
The single-channel manual SPR instrument currently available in our laboratory (and – to or knowledge – the
only SPR instrument at our university) is over 15 years old, very time consuming to run, and its major components
are now beginning to fail. Furthermore, our present instrument is so outdated that the manufacturer no longer
supports its maintenance and components, and replacement microfluidic SPR sample cell ‘cartridges’ are no
longer available commercially. We will soon exhaust our dwindling supply of these cells, which will then put our
current instrument completely ‘out of business.’ For the above reasons, we herewith request funds to purchase
a replacement multi-channel automatized SPR instrument, which will take much less time to run and will greatly
facilitate our ongoing spectroscopic experiments, as well as our other ongoing studies of protein-nucleic acid
interactions. [We note that our laboratory has considerable experience with using SPR techniques for studying
protein-nucleic acid interactions – see Greive et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 105, 3315, (2008); Greive et al.,

11093281,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of our research program is to delineate molecular mechanisms that regulate cell
proliferation and differentiation in the context of animal development. This knowledge will help to advance
the understanding of normal processes in the developing multicellular organisms, explain why dysregulation
of these mechanisms leads to disease, and provide strategies to ameliorate these unwanted effects. We
focus on the highly conserved Retinoblastoma (RB) pathway, which is involved in plethora of biological
processes but is best known for its role in cell cycle control. One of the key targets of the RB pathway is the
E2F family of transcription factors that is negatively regulated by the Retinoblastoma protein (pRB).
Mammalian RB research has traditionally centered around its prominent role in cancer and therefore, its
function in development remains poorly understood. A major hurdle to studying the RB pathway in
mammalian development is redundancy and compensation, as the large multigene Rb and E2F families
make genetic analysis daunting. The Drosophila model system provides an attractive alternative because
the Drosophila RB pathway is highly conserved yet it is simpler. In previous years, we have focused on
identifying tissues and functions of E2F and Rbf, the fly pRB ortholog, that are essential for animal viability.
During these studies, we have found that the RB pathway is particularly important in adult skeletal muscle.
Surprisingly, in the muscle, both E2F and Rbf are needed in late muscle development to directly activate
the expression of metabolic genes. We will use genomics approaches coupled with genetic analysis to
investigate the molecular details of E2F/Rbf dependent activation. We will focus on the role of E2F/Rbf at
enhancers and how the loss of E2F/Rbf binding at these regulatory regions changes chromatin state and
gene expression. Previosuly, we have found that the phenotype of E2F deficient animals is a combination
of both tissue intrinsic and systemic effects. Our future research will build on this discovery to determine
why E2F inactivation in skeletal muscle leads to lethality. Another area of interest is focused on interaction
between the RB pathway and Hippo signaling pathway. Combined inactivation of both pathways leads to
photoreceptor dedifferentiation because the cells inappropriately turn on the eye progenitor transcriptional
program, which is dependent on Homothorax (Hth) and Yorkie, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo
pathway. Our future experiments will leverage the power of single cell genomics and single cell epigenomics
to determine the upstream regulatory events and identify the role of Hth-Yorkie in transcriptional regulation
in dedifferentiating photoreceptors and in normal eye progenitor cells. Collectively, the proposed research
will advance our understanding of normal development and animal physiology, and how perturbations in
growth pathways may lead to disease."
10936167,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is a leading cause of mortality world-wide. Despite
advancements in anti-arrhythmia therapies, VA rates remain high in part due to an incomplete understanding of
the underlying disease-induced arrhythmigenic substrate. In patients with prior myocardial infarction, traditional
dogma has maintained that heterogeneous scarring in the ventricles forms the arrhythmia substrate. While clinical
studies have utilized the visualization of ventricular scar in localizing VA ablation targets, these efforts have failed
to significantly improve VA recurrence rates, suggesting that scar characterization alone may be insufficient for
identifying and eliminating VA. Infiltrating adipose tissue (inFAT) is a newly recognized aspect of post-infarct
remodeling. However, because inFAT is intermingled with scar, the specific role of lnFAT In VA propensity In
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has never been explored.
The overall obJectlve of this appllcatlon Is to use a novel combination of mechanistic personallzed
computatlonal modellng (""dlgltal twin"" of the heart), Imaging, electroanatomlcal mapping, ex-vivo human
heart experiments, and artificial intelligence (Al) to comprehensively characterize the role of inFAT
vs. scar in post-infarct VAs, and to develop a new digital-twin approach for guidance of VA ablation in
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Leveraging our advancements in the acquisition of high-quality ventricular
images of scar and inFAT distribution, our expertise in personalized computational modeling and Al, and
our clinical and experimental expertise, we propose to develop personalized heart digital twins of ICM patinets
that incorporate scar and inFAT distributions and are parameterized with experimental data. Using the digital
twins and intra-procedure data, we will explore the mechanistic role of inFAT in arrhythmogenic propensity and
in the components of the VA circuit. We will also utilize the digital twinning technology to develop a comprehensive
VA ablation guidance strategy that accounts for the roles of inFAT and scar in VA circuits. The project
will culminate in a clinical translation feasibility study to demonstrate that the novel digital twins offer accurate
prediction of VA ablation sites, and can be used for pre-procedure guidance and optimal targeting, eliminating
extensive electroanatomical mapping. Successful execution of the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic
understanding of the role of inFAT in promoting and sustaining VAs, and will lead to significant improvements in
the clinical procedure of VA ablation. Completion of this project will also be a major leap forward in the integration
of imaging, computational modeling, intracardiac mapping, and Al in the treatment of heart rhythm disorders."
11093618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anomalies of the face invariably require some type of therapy, corrective surgery, and close follow-up while
imposing a financial and emotional burden on patients and their families. Although the analysis of human data
is critical, human studies pose particular problems, not the least of which is that critical times of prenatal
development are not available for study. This proposal aims to identify the developmental and molecular
processes underlying mandibulofacial anomalies using mouse mutants that we identified by systematically
searching the current contents of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) in response
to NIH PAR-20-137 for phenotyping IMPC embryonic and perinatal lethal KO mouse lines. Micro- or
retrognathia are the most common terms used to describe mandibular phenotypes in mandibulofacial dysostosis,
yet the current lack of precision in diagnoses of mandibular dysmorphology does not critically consider the
potentially distinct etiology of these conditions and their influence on potential sequelae of anomalies.
Micrognathia describes a mandible that is absolutely reduced in size, indicating that the mandible is primarily
affected, while retrognathia refers to a normally sized mandible that is placed posteriorly relative to the upper
jaw. Thus, micrognathia and retrognathia, while providing similar facial profiles, are produced by different primary
developmental processes and each may integrate differently with tongue and palatal development. When
mandibular dysmorphology occurs with glossoptosis, respiratory obstruction, and in some cases, a cleft palate,
the condition is referred to as Pierre Robin (PR). A causative pathogenesis of a sequence of developmental
events has been hypothesized for PR, but few clear causal relationships between discovered mutations,
dysregulated gene expression, precise cellular processes, and PR-associated anomalies are documented. To
test this hypothesis, we plan a carefully coordinated and fully collaborative set of analyses of IMPC mutant mouse
lines identified based on genes known to be causative for PR in humans or on the presence of PR features
recorded in these mouse lines. Our in-depth phenotyping will involve: Aim 1: quantitative 3D morphologic
analyses of embryos using phosphotungstic acid-enhanced micro computed tomography; Aim2: differential
gene expression analysis of relevant tissues and developmental time points between mutant and unaffected
littermate controls using bulk RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics; Aim 3: histologic studies using in situ
hybridization or immunohistochemistry of relevant genes, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and
differentiation states to determine the cellular and molecular events giving rise to dysmorphogenesis of the
mandibulofacial complex. This multi-level, systems biology approach will provide precise definitions of the
localized effects of genetic variants on mandibular and associated tongue, palatal, and upper airway phenotypes
to identify the developmental and molecular functions involved in their production, using mouse lines that model
the phenotypes associated with these conditions."
11096412,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays the role of maintaining brain homeostasis and preventing foreign 
invaders from infiltrating the brain tissue from the blood; however, an alternative pathway exists for 
opportunistic pathogens to enter the brain and cause severe damage. Infiltrating either through the olfactory 
or trigeminal nerves (in the nose), these pathogens, whether bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic, bypass the 
BBB and cause devastating symptoms. Like brain tumors, these neural infiltrating pathogens are free to grow 
with the protection afforded them by the BBB, which prevents the passage of greater than 98% of small 
molecule drugs. Because of the difficulty associated with treatment, pathogenic infections can lead to 
meningitis, with insufficient treatments available, demonstrated by mortality rates that range from ~10% to 
98%, depending on the etiology. Although these pathogens vary in their etiology and pathology, many of 
them are linked by enolase, an enzyme that plays a role in plasminogen binding and glucose metabolism, 
which seems to enable their infiltration. The Larsen Lab is a leading expert in the development of 
treatments for diseases of the central nervous system using polymer-based nanoparticles to 
encapsulate and deliver drugs across the BBB. We will leverage this expertise towards the treatment of 
brain-invading pathogens. Learning from these opportunistic pathogens, we will encapsulate enolase 
inhibitors in polymer-based nanoparticles called polymersomes and deliver them via intranasal 
administration. In this proposal, we specifically focus on brain-eating amoeba, or Naegleria fowleri, as our 
first model to provide proof of concept for our approach due to its extremely high mortality rate. We plan to 
leverage discoveries for treatments of other pathogens involving enolase."
11093601,"Project Summary
Many steps in drug discovery, as well as in basic biological research, could be accelerated with methods that
measure multiple phenotypes simultaneously, known as profiling technologies. When a cell or organism’s
function is affected by disease, a chemical compound, or a genetic perturbation, simultaneously measuring
many phenotypes provides greater power and less bias in identifying their impact. But many existing assays
require many painstaking months to develop and measure only one specific phenotype, missing potentially
crucial information - for example, a chemical might have positive effects on a disease-related assay but its
effects on other pathways are unmeasured, leading to undetected toxicity that is only discovered later.
Research in this MIRA period will focus on advancing algorithms and applications for image-based profiling, a
surprisingly quantitative type of profiling that is the least expensive and among the highest in information
content. Image-based profiling captures the location and amount of each stained cellular component, as well as
changes in morphology, but its applications are underexplored and its algorithms underdeveloped. Having
invented the main assay and software in the field, we aim to bring the technique to maturity now that four
things have become available or possible: (a) Image Data - huge quantities of suitable systematic, structured,
high-throughput, single-cell image data, usually from the Cell Painting assay, via several public-private
partnerships and totaling more than 3 billion single cells across more than 100,000 genetic and chemical
perturbations; (b) Algorithms - novel deep learning algorithms for several steps in profiling: segmentation,
feature extraction, and learning predictive models; (c) Integration - other data sources now available at a
scale that can be fruitfully combined with images; (d) Applications - out of more than a dozen theoretical
applications, many have not been attempted or scaled up for basic biological research and drug discovery, such
as determining compounds’ mechanism of action, identifying their targets, discovering relationships with
genes, predicting toxicity or other assay activity, and identifying gene function.
To fulfill the promise and real-world efficacy of image-based profiling, we therefore aim to leverage recently
available data and algorithms to carry out diverse biological applications, including identifying gene- and
compound-associated phenotypes and functions, virtual screening to identify potential compounds that target
genes of interest, hypothesizing the mechanism of action/targets for small molecules, computationally
predicting assay activity and toxicity, and identifying screenable disease-associated phenotypes. In doing so, we
aim to make rapid progress in algorithms, including trained neural networks/deep learning models, multi-
modal integration, visualization/interpretation, batch correction, and single-cell methods."
11093608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This supplement requests a mosquito Xtal3 crystallization robot for the parent grant (GM144578), which will
reduce the required sample amounts for structure determination projects to 10% of what is currently needed.
This will allow the PI to complete a larger scope of work, as protein purification is the most time-consuming step
in X-ray crystallography. The robot will also increase reproducibility of crystallization trials and allow to expand
the scope of the parent grant to include structure determination of larger complexes with low expression yields.
The parent grant investigates how the cell nucleus is bi-directionally transported and positioned in a cell cycle
specific manner, a process that is important for brain and muscle development. This is underscored by the fact
that human disease mutations of proteins engaged in the transport of the nucleus cause severe brain and muscle
development diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy, which is the most common genetic cause of death in
infants. Yet, it is unknown how teams of opposite polarity motors collaborate to achieve correct timing,
directionality and velocity of transport. We plan: 1) To establish how motility of the motor complex dynein is
modulated by dynein adapter/cargo complexes and by the opposite polarity motor complex kinesin-1. 2) to
establish a structural basis for recognition of the cell nucleus as cargo by dynein adapters. 3) To establish
whether the opposite polarity motors dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited in a cooperative manner to the nucleus.
Currently, the PI’s structural studies are focused on minimal protein complexes with truncated fragments that are
expressed in E. coli with high yields. The PI has successfully reconstituted larger complexes with full-length
dynein adapters and intact motors. While the structure determination of larger complexes was already suggested
as an alternative approach in the parent grant, it is currently not feasible due to the lower yields of the insect cell
expression system. The robot will allow to carry out crystallization trials with smaller drops compared to manual
pipetting, which will reduce the sample requirements to 10%. This will increase the impact of all three aims of
the parent grant since the PI will be able to expand her structural studies to intact complexes, which will reveal
a greater level of mechanistic insights compared to truncated complexes. This is particularly important for the
proposed aims which plan to establish the activation and cargo-recognition mechanism of BicD2, as well as how
bi-directional transport of the opposite polarity motors kinesin-1 and dynein is regulated by adapter proteins. Our
study serves as a model system to understand how cargo adapters regulate the motility and directionality of
cargo transported bi-directionally by both dynein and kinesin-1, which is important as these motors facilitate a
vast number of cellular transport events that are essential for chromosome segregation, signal transmission at
synapses, brain and muscle development. More specifically, results will establish how bi-directional transport of
the nucleus is regulated, which is crucial for muscle and brain development. Mutations of proteins of these
pathways cause devastating neuromuscular diseases, and results will help devise therapies for these diseases."

Advanced NMR, computational, and hybrid methods for metabolomics
The emergence of metabolomics promises to revolutionize the understanding of biological systems
from a metabolite perspective with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
Despite recent progress in the profiling and quantitation of complex metabolomics mixtures, such as
urine, serum, and cancer tissue, by NMR and mass spectrometry, important methodological challenges
remain. The proposed research program aims at addressing some of these urgent challenges by
developing new approaches to integrate NMR with cheminformatics and mass spectrometry for the de
novo characterization of unknown metabolites and their chemical and structural motifs, by developing
and maintaining advanced webservers and metabolomics databases (COLMAR) for the reliable,
efficient, and user-friendly analysis of highly complex metabolomics spectroscopic data, by developing
automated tools for the spectral deconvolution and quantitation of complex metabolomics mixtures with
synergies for protein NMR applications, and by developing new hybrid approaches to bridge
metabolomics with other Omics fields. The proposed research will promote the dissemination of
metabolomics as a powerful, versatile, and manageable tool to the biomedical scientific community with
synergistic benefits also for protein science. These activities are expected to lead to a better
understanding of a broad range of biological questions from a metabolite perspective for the benefit of
human health."
11095920,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nearly two thirds of the 18 million new cancer patients each year fail treatment due to resistance that is not
fully understood. Even in state-of-the-art clinical trials, oncologists struggle to select patients likely to respond
to next-generation therapies. The outdated, imprecise pathology tools currently in clinical use (e.g. IHC) fail to
reliably deliver critical information such as the extent of drug target expression and accurate assessment of cell
states. Newer research tools including immunofluorescence analysis and mass cytometry also fail to bridge
this gap due to complex workflows that limit adoption to expert users, incur high sample size requirements,
and/or represent a prohibitive expense. There is a significant unmet clinical need for the development of an
improved diagnostic tool capable of generating precise, accurate, single-cell information to enable improved
diagnostic and treatment outcomes across tumor types. The goal of this project is to commercialize a platform
for rapid molecular analysis for minute and fragile cell populations, in order to generate data on protein
expression, cell state, and co-localization (including of immune cells) in single cells with the precision of flow
cytometry, while preserving the sample. The successful completion of this project will result in a validated panel
for profiling of immune cells with accompanying computational services, which can be used on standard
immunofluorescent microscopes. A successful project of this service is expected to translate into the ability to
profile many more biomarkers from a range of biopsy samples than is possible at present. Ultimately, the
technology is well suited to translate to clinical settings, where it can be used to optimally select responders for
precision cancer therapies."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-

examined how policymakers in Africa, make policy decisions using research evidence. Furthermore, effective
dissemination of scientific research evidence can increase the likelihood that policymaker’s decisions are
aligned with evidence to control cancer, however a research-to-policy gap persists, with limited knowledge on
dissemination strategies that influence policymakers’ engagement with research evidence for cancer control.
This study aims to improve the use of research evidence among Nigerian policymakers and then develop data-
driven dissemination strategies that promote research on vaccine preventable cancers using audience
segmentation and designathons. Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment
framework, our specific aims are: 1) Use qualitative in-depth interviews and priority mapping exercises to
explore policy actor characteristics and organizational climate factors related to research evidence use and
preferences for vaccine preventable cancers (i.e. cervical and liver cancer) in Nigeria; 2) Empirically identify
and determine sub-groups of policy actors at various organizations focused on cancer control in Nigeria and
their distinct preferences and evidence use behaviors using latent class analysis; and 3) Use designathons
with sub-groups of policy actors to design and assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of

size fits all” research evidence or dissemination strategies for cancer control policies in Nigeria, but to
demonstrate that our use of audience segmentation and designathons can be used to address policy and
dissemination science knowledge deficits for cancer control policies on vaccines for preventable cancers, in
Africa’s most populous country."
11093720,"Over the past ten years, our consortium Universities in Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, and Washington have
provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."
11093736,"PROJECT SUMMARY (from P51): This application seeks five years of continued support for the
P51 Base Grant (OD 011132) for the Emory National Primate Research Center (EPC) of Emory
University. The overarching goals of EPC are to conduct a research program focused on scientific
problems relevant to human health and the NIH mission by providing resource infrastructure and
expertise in appropriate scientific and veterinary specialties and ensure the Center’s ability to serve
as a resource to Core Scientists, as well as to scientists regionally, nationally and internationally.
During the current reporting period (5/1/2011 to present), EPC has recorded remarkable progress,
as evidenced by numerous (>790) publications, construction of new animal facilities, including a
state-of-the-art transplantation and ABSL3 facility, and progressive expansion of its research funding
base, even in the era of an extremely competitive NIH funding environment. In addition, the Emory
Primate Center has maintained outstanding core research programs and provided resources and
services to a broad multidisciplinary network of affiliate and collaborative investigators throughout
the region and nation. These research programs, which involve the use of a variety of nonhuman
primate species, are directed primarily toward four major research disciplines, representing the
research divisions within EPC: 1) Microbiology and Immunology; 2) Developmental and Cognitive
Neuroscience, 3) Neuropharmacology and Neurologic Diseases and 4) Behavioral Neuroscience
and Psychiatric Disorders. Also, through the Divisions of Animal Resources and Pathology, EPC
provides support for outside investigators conducting research at EPC, consistent with our ORIP-
mandated role as a regional and national resource. Specific aims for the upcoming period of
support include: 1) To carry out basic and translational research using nonhuman primates to
expand knowledge, develop improved treatments, and advance cures that will benefit humanity; 2)
To provide regional and national resources for data, consultative expertise, biologic materials, and
specialized facilities useful in supporting nonhuman primate research; 3) To study basic nonhuman
primate biology and improve nonhuman primate breeding, husbandry and genetic characterization to
better serve the biomedical research community; and 4) To provide research and training
opportunities involving nonhuman primates to graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, visiting scientists and faculty members. The pursuit of these aims will enhance the Center’s
ability to serve as an enabling resource to Core and Affiliate Scientists for the conduct of nonhuman
primate research, all for the ultimate goal of advancing human health."
11094570,"Despite tremendous technical advances in drug discovery, de novo development of small molecule drugs is still
challenging. High-throughput screening (HTS) with libraries of natural products and other complex molecules
remains the bedrock approach. However, HTS is unsatisfactory in many ways: extraordinary cost, poor
efficiency, rampant false positives and a complexity of discovered “hits” that hinders hit-to-lead development.
Fragment based drug discovery (FBDD) was brilliantly conceived to overcome these limitations, but has arguably
not performed as hoped. The limited impact of FBDD is because most fragment “hit” molecules are very weak
binders and are undetectable by current assay methods. The enormous potential of FBDD is therefore lost. Here,
an approach is to be developed that can reliably detect weak but specific binding with the goal of helping to
reinvigorate and enhance early phase small molecule drug discovery. With a foundational premise of FBDD
method thereby actually ensured, the full potential of the FBDD approach can be realized.
Faithful detection of binding requires that the ligand and protein concentrations be at least on the order of the
dissociation constant, which is practically and financially unrealistic for weak binders. The strategy to remove
this basic barrier is simple. The water core of the reverse micelle (RM) is used to confine a single protein molecule
and fragments at high enough concentrations to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy. NMR spectroscopy
then permits site-resolved detection and quantification of binding affinity at reasonable cost. The first
application of RM NMR FBDD highlights its potential to greatly expand small drug discovery. A rule-of-three
(Ro3) fragment screen of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) shows that 1) weak yet specific binding can be efficiently detected
in a structural context; 2) achieving the required high protein and ligand concentrations is economically feasible;
3) a high hit rate is observed; 4) surface coverage is extraordinary and gives unprecedented connectivity
potential; 5) highly desired more polar binders are illuminated.
Critical questions to be answered include: Is the IL-1β surface coverage typical? What is the distribution of
fragment hit affinities of Ro3 and rule-of-five (Ro5) libraries more generally? What are the chemical
characteristics of useful fragments to choose for an optimal RM NMR screening library? How difficult is to move
weakly binding hits to the traditional hit-to-lead pipeline? Is the Ro5 library a better compromise of affinity and
surface coverage? What is the most efficient way to carry out RM NMR screening? Is RM NMR screening
quantitatively reliable? This project will address these and other technical challenges that stand in the way of
creating a strategy that more fully enables the brilliant insights of the FBDD paradigm and unleashes its
originally anticipated potential."

Despite the availability of effective HIV prevention tools such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), significant
disparities persist among communities of color, particularly among women in the Deep South where the rate of
HIV diagnosis is fourteen-times higher for Black women compared to White women. Current literature supports
that alcohol use is associated with condomless sex and increased number of sexual partners, which may
predict greater likelihood of STI/HIV acquisition among Southern Black women. The proposal takes advantage
of a dynamic and innovative collaboration of experienced HIV-prevention investigators from the University of
Alabama-Birmingham, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Centers for AIDS Research, and the Alabama
Department of Public Health (ADPH). In the parent Camellia Cohort, a population-based approach is used to
establish a geographically representative cohort of cis- and trans-gender women (‘Camellia Cohort,’ N = 800)
at significant risk for future HIV acquisition, based on recent gonorrhea or syphilis infection, across the state of
Alabama (AL), highlighted as a geographic hotspot by the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic strategy, to better
understand factors associated with risk of STI and HIV diagnosis and predictors for PrEP use. Leveraging
current enrollment into this cohort, we will recruit a subset of women to assess the following aims: 1) describe
subjective and objective measures of alcohol use in a cohort of women vulnerable to HIV and living in AL by
consenting 200 women form our parent study to self-collect alcohol biomarkers; 2) evaluated the association of
objectively measured alcohol use with a) incidence of STI and b) PrEP uptake and 3) explore the acceptability
and feasibility of biomarker evaluation among a cohort of women vulnerable to HIV by interviewing women who
consented to enroll in the supplemental study and those who did not (n = 12, each arm). Study findings will
provide updated estimates of how alcohol use impacts health outcomes and HIV prevention behaviors while
also providing critical information regarding how best to collect these data from women. Our data measures will
harmonize measures across the AWARE-funded projects providing the opportunity to provide data for
community partners launching initiatives to promote a reduction in HIV/STI incidence."

The discovery and manufacture of new life-saving medicines necessitates the development of new and
improved synthetic tools that can access complex, bioactive chemical structures in a selective and sustainable
manner. The proposed research program seeks to address this need by devising novel chemical reactions and
elucidating new principles of catalysis in the fields of transition metal and visible light photoredox catalysis.
The addition of saturated carbon atoms into chemical structures has been shown to confer improved bioactive
properties to drug candidates, prompting a need for the invention of improved C(sp3)–C bond-forming
reactions. Early work from our laboratory and others demonstrated that Ni and Ni/photoredox catalysis
present a versatile platform to generate and functionalize carbon-centered radicals in C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-
coupling. These reactions are being increasingly adopted by chemists in academia and the pharmaceutical
industry. Nevertheless, important challenges and opportunities remain, which the current proposal seeks to
address. These include: 1) the development of cross-selective C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reactions, with the
ultimate goal of affording a route to joining two saturated ring systems that is as versatile as traditional cross-
coupling for the assembly of biaryl architectures; 2) the identification of modular chiral ligand frameworks for
enantioselective and catalyst-controlled diastereoselective coupling reactions; and 3) the design of strategies
that overturn common site-selectivity for C(sp3)–H/O/N functionalization of small bioactive molecules.
Whereas most effort in the field of Ni and Ni/photoredox catalysis has focused on reaction discovery, our
program will also advance the field through ligand design and mechanistic studies. We will study the impact of
novel and established ligand classes on the structure and reactivity of catalytically relevant oxidation states of
Ni (0/I/II/III) with the goal of improving the efficiency of existing methods and enabling the design of new
reactions. Finally, despite numerous advances in the field of chemical catalysis, direct homolytic activation of
strong and redox-inaccessible C–O, O–H, and N–H bonds present in abundant feedstock chemicals and late-
stage bioactive compounds remains an outstanding challenge. Our program is addressing this gap by
developing a strategy that makes use of visible light photoredox catalysis and the single-electron redox
processes of phosphines for the activation of N–H heterocycles and aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic alcohols in
new bond-forming reactions. Taken together, these efforts will provide valuable new reactions and
understanding for the chemistry communities engaged in the discovery and synthesis of biologically active
small molecules. This program will also provide a platform for the scientific training and professional
development of a team of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate research assistants."

 The impressive amount of data generated by experimental HIV/SIV vaccines has led to the realization
that protection will most likely requires 2 levels of barriers, the initial one at the mucosal port of entry and if
breached, a second set of systemic defenses. The capacity of humoral and cellular immune responses in
mucosal tissues to block or contain replication at the initial stage of virus transmission may have a profound
impact on the ability of a vaccinated host to resist infection, even in the case when virus progresses beyond
the port of entry, allowing the systemic response more time to control or eradicate the incoming pathogen.
 We hypothesized that there are two necessary features for a successful vaccine: 1) A prolonged if not
life-long stimulation of the immune system with viral antigens to maintain “alert” immune responses; and 2) a
targeted immune response at the site of primary replication of HIV. A vaccine approach that simultaneously
addresses these two issues would have the potential to achieve solid, long-term active protection. To fulfill
these requirements, we have developed an original strategy to successfully deliver a vaccine to mucosal sites
that provide antigen stimuli at recurrent intervals and elicit protective mucosal immune responses. Our
strategy leverages epithelial stem cells as permanent but non-expressing source of viral antigen while their
differentiated offspring express and present antigen to the local immune system, along the reproductive cycle.
Using a single cycle SIV (SIVsc) approach, which has been shown to be safe compared to traditional
attenuated vaccines, we have cloned the SIVsc genome under the control of the involucrin promoter (pINV-
SIVsc), a terminally differentiated keratinocyte specific promoter. When administered, the vaccine targets and
transduces basal epithelial stem cells from vaginal tissues. These then proliferate and differentiate into mature
epithelial cells, triggering SIV antigen expression via the promoter and leading to both direct and cross priming.
 For this project, we propose: 1) To confirm and further improve the efficacy and safety profile of the
pINV-SIVsc vaccine in female macaques; 2) To visualize and optimize vaccine delivery, and investigate the
mechanisms of action underlying protection; and, 3) Using our best optimized vaccine strategy, demonstrate
protection from virus acquisition and/or viral replication in vivo and determine the correlates of protection or
control against repeated low-dose vaginal challenges with heterologous SIV."
11134474,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stimuli (cues) in the environment associated with reward can motivate normal behavior, bringing one in close
proximity to valuable resources (e.g. food); but they can also gain inordinate control over behavior, as is the
case with addiction. The ability of reward cues to motivate behavior occurs through Pavlovian learning
processes. When a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, it can acquire the ability to
act as a predictor, but can also acquire incentive motivational properties. In individuals with addiction, cues that
have been previously associated with the drug-taking experience acquire the ability to maintain drug-seeking
behavior and instigate relapse, even when there is a strong desire to stop use. The neurobiological processes
by which reward cues gain inordinate control over behavior have proven difficult to discern because cues can
simultaneously acquire “predictive” and “incentive” properties, and in most studies these two psychological
processes are confounded. In the proposed studies we will exploit natural variation in cue-reward learning to
identify the neural circuitry specifically responsible for the attribution of incentive motivational value (incentive
salience) to reward cues. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, some,
termed “goal-trackers”, attribute predictive value to a discrete food-associated cue; whereas others, termed
“sign-trackers” attribute incentive salience to the cue. Relative to goal-trackers, sign-trackers are more
susceptible to behavioral control by discrete food- and drug-paired cues and have a greater propensity for cue-
induced reinstatement or relapse. Using this animal model, we have found that the paraventricular nucleus of
the thalamus (PVT) plays a critical role in incentive learning processes and in regulating individual differences
in relapse propensity. The PVT appears to act as a node that integrates “top-down” and “bottom-up” input to
regulate cue-driven behaviors, but the subcortical circuitry subserving incentive salience attribution remains to
be determined. The central hypothesis to be tested here is that both input to and output from the PVT are
necessary and sufficient to promote dopamine-dependent incentive learning. We will use a molecular-genetic
approach with viral vectors to selectively express engineered artificial receptors (e.g. DREADD) to determine
how transiently altering activity of neurons in select PVT circuits affects the propensity to attribute incentive
salience to reward cues. Specifically, we will target inputs to the PVT from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and
outputs from the PVT to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). We will determine whether the PVT-NAcSh
pathway can regulate cue-driven behavior independent of the ventral tegmental area, and how manipulating
these subcortical circuits affects neurochemical activity in the NAcSh. In addition, we will determine if the LH-
PVT and PVT-NAcSh pathways mediate individual differences in the propensity for cue-induced reinstatement
of drug-seeking behavior. This work will identify critical components of the neural circuitry that contribute to
addiction liability."

Given the rising incidence and poor outcomes associated with cancer in Nigeria and surrounding
countries, the Nigerian Ministry of Health has designated cancer as a priority area for research and
training. To support this, we propose a new training program – the Nigerian Cancer Research Training
(NCAT) program – with the goal of increasing capacity for cancer research in Nigeria. We seek to not
only strengthen the existing research enterprise but to build in-country expertise and provide a solid
foundation for the development, implementation, and dissemination of evidence-based interventions
that will impact public health policy and cancer outcomes. The NCAT program builds on existing
relationships and infrastructure between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), Obafemi
Awolowo University (OAU), and the College of Medicine/Lagos University Teaching Hospital
(CMUL/LUTH). We will employ a multi-level approach to strengthen research capacity for individuals
(Aim 1) and institutions (Aim 2), while also enhancing broader relationships at national, regional, and
global levels (Aim 3). The NCAT program will address two distinct needs for cancer research training
in Nigeria: 1. a training program that can be used for clinical faculty (primarily physicians and nurses)
that will not interfere with clinical/research duties, and 2. a training program to bolster the capacity of
full-time PhD-level researchers in the disciplines of cancer epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and
biostatistics. Trainees will be competitively selected, and we will emphasize diversity and
underrepresented specialties (e.g., nursing, psycho-oncology). A multi-pronged training approach,
utilizing coursework, “hands-on” research in ongoing breast and colorectal cancer studies, virtual
learning, mentorship, and collaboration will be used to train a cadre of multidisciplinary Nigerian cancer
researchers. After a one-year cancer research training period, NCAT trainees will be grouped into
research teams and take part in team science-based training, which will include designing and
conducting a collaborative mentored pilot research project in Nigeria. In addition, to enhance support
for local researchers beyond the project period, we will develop cancer research training courses to be
used in Nigeria, and provide mentorship and training to research administration offices at OAU and
CMUL/LUTH. We will use multiple layers of trainee and project assessment to ensure that our program
is meeting its ultimate goal of creating well-trained colorectal and breast cancer researchers and a
sustainable pipeline for continued cancer research in Nigeria. A supplemental award will address the
need for clinical trials expertise and design/analytic support through development of a clinical trials
workshop and a 6-month cancer biostatistics course, both to be conducted on an ongoing basis."

Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) are a class of retrotransposable elements that continually mutate
genomes, including mammalian genomes. The currently active family of LINEs in mammals is called LINE-1
(L1). There are hundreds of thousands of copies of L1 in mammalian genomes, and unchecked expression of
this element in humans and/or model organisms is associated with various abnormal states, such as cancer,
infertility, aging and neurologic disease. We do not know whether L1 plays a causative role in these disorders,
partly because our knowledge of L1 biology in vivo is rudimentary, which has limited our ability to experimentally
manipulate endogenous L1 activity in a specific manner. Although a number of cellular host factors that can alter
L1 retrotransposition have been identified from biochemical pulldowns and genetic screens in immortalized cell
lines, the in vivo biological relevance of these factors in the evolutionarily relevant germ cells is unclear.
Previously our lab discovered that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) plays a critical
role for productive LINE retrotransposition in both yeast and human tissue culture. This proposal will use mouse
genetics to examine whether ESCRT is used for L1 intracellular trafficking and retrotransposition in the male
germ line, and whether disruption of the ESCRT/L1 interaction can alleviate germ line defects found in a mouse
models of infertility. To this end, we will utilize both wild type mice and mice with known increases in L1
expression in the germline. Mice deleted in the gene for Maelstrom (Mael-/-) have massive overexpression of L1,
arrest in meiotic prophase I, and are male sterile. Maelstrom is involved in the biogenesis of small RNAs in the
germ line, called piRNAs, and similar transposon/infertility defects are seen when related piRNA biogenesis
genes (e.g. Mov10l1) are knocked out in mice. It is currently unknown whether L1 is a driving factor of infertility
in these mice. To reduce L1 activity, we will introduce an ALIX knockout allele (ALIX is a component of the
ESCRT complex). In Aim 1 we will evaluate germ line L1 RNP localization, regulation, and retrotransposition
when the L1/ESCRT interaction is disrupted. In Aim 2 we will determine the contribution of L1 overexpression to
germ cell phenotypes in mice. This project will provide valuable insight into whether ESCRT enables L1 RNP
trafficking in the germ line. The proposed work will also shed light on whether excess L1 retrotransposition is a
driving factor responsible for infertility in piRNA pathway mutants. Because L1 and the piRNA pathway are
conserved in humans, and mutations in piRNA pathway genes have been associated with human infertility, we
expect that this work will form the basis for future study on the relation between transposon regulation and some
cases of human male infertility."

Physical integrity of epithelial tissue is established and maintained by the cytoskeletal network which integrates
cells into their environment with other neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. In particular, keratin
intermediate filament proteins ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells are responsible for the structural
integrity of epithelial tissues and recently emerged as a driver of collective cell migration. Yet, unlike actin,
understanding of keratin force-sensing is still very limited. We discovered that the keratin network responds to
externally applied physical forces by recruiting cten, a protein known to act as both a tumor suppressor and
promoter in a tissue-specific manner. Emerging evidence indicates that more proteins are recruited to the
force-bearing keratin fibers, suggesting that the keratin network may serve as a critical hub for
mechano-transduction. The overall premise of this application is that discovering the basic mechanisms and
functions of keratin-based mechano-sensing will contribute to the understanding of how the cell senses forces.
Our goal is to determine the force-dependent protein interactome surrounding the keratin network in epithelial
cells and how keratin-mediated mechano-transduction impacts cell behavior. To resolve force-sensitive
protein-protein interactions, we will inscribe proximal proteins by in situ promiscuous biotin labeling while cells
are being physically stimulated. Newly identified candidates will be tested to verify their force-dependent co-
localization with keratin filaments in live cells and in vitro, and analyzed for their roles in transcriptional
regulation, cell integrity maintenance, and collective cell migration. Our approach will reveal the comprehensive
list of keratin-associated proteins in the presence or absence of external forces and, for the first time, resolve
the force-dependent regulation of the keratin network and its physiological implications."
11097697,"Phenotypic plasticity is used by an incredible diversity of organisms, from plants to humans. Its ubiquity attests
to its fundamental importance in life. This project addresses the fascinating and understudied question of the
mechanistic basis of phenotypic plasticity – i.e., how developmental processes are influenced by
environmental cues to cause phenotypic differences -- and, importantly, how those processes evolve. The
focus here is on an innovative model, the pea aphid, which exhibits a textbook example of phenotypic
plasticity. This species offers an unparalleled opportunity to examine the role of nature and nurture in
phenotype determination: it exhibits dramatically different winged and wingless morphs that are induced by
environmental conditions in genetically identical, asexual females and controlled by a single genetic locus in
males. Thus, strikingly, two dimorphisms, each under different control mechanisms, exist within this single
species. The proposed experiments build on the exciting recent discoveries made by the PI about the role of
hormones and horizontally transferred genes in the female wing plasticity and about the identification of the
wing polymorphism locus in males, which has an insertion containing a duplication of a gene that influences
signaling (follistatin) and which is specific to wingless males. The proposed, vigorous research program aims to
decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and evolution of plasticity. Experiments on the
wing plasticity will examine the regulatory changes that control it, the epigenetic changes that accompany it,
and test if horizontally transferred genes are preferentially recruited into the process. Experiments on the
genetic male wing dimorphism will use functional and evolutionary studies of the follistatin paralogs to establish
how changes in these paralogs underlie male morphological evolution. Studies in females and males will be
united with experiments that will test whether or not the more recently derived male dimorphism evolved by
genetic accommodation of the female plasticity, hypothesizing that males bypass the environmental signals
used by the female plasticity. These studies will provide some of the first insights into the mechanistic basis of
genetic accommodation, where trait variation shifts from being caused by “nurture” to “nature”. These
experiments will have broad implications for understanding the mechanistic basis and evolution of plasticity,
which is significant from a human health perspective because of the numerous plastic traits that influence
human health and disease."

previously overlooked genetic risk factors contributing more substantially to IBD in Hispanic and
African-American populations.
SA#2: Analysis of the newly identified CD gene PDLIM5 and its splice region variant and
their impact on epithelial functions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the function of a newly

We are committed to including both sexes in our genetic and functional studies, including sex as
a variable in our data collection, analysis of results, and reporting of findings. This includes patient-
derived cellular models (e.g. hiPSC-derived lines). We will also ensure that the experiments are
done on diverse genetic backgrounds and determine if this impacts the effect of perturbation or
baseline behavior of the assay and/or model."

A critical process for early development of the vertebrate embryo is induction of the three primary germ layers.
Knowledge of the molecules that are produced in each embryonic cell is essential to understanding their
function to pattern the embryonic body. Decades of innovative cell biological and embryological studies,
assessment of function one gene at a time, and recently deep transcriptomics profiling via next-generation
sequencing have exposed the developmental roles of important genes, transcripts, and some proteins. As a
result, scientists have defined the spatial and temporal changes of mRNAs and abundant proteins, and some
serendipitously identified metabolites of importance, such as folate assisting in closure of the neural tube.
However, it has been technologically impossible to utilize high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), the gold
standard technology for proteomics and metabolomics (`omics), to study hundreds of metabolites and
thousands proteins in single embryonic cells in the vertebrate embryo. Further, in developing systems, a
complex correlation between gene transcription and translation as well as posttranslational modifications
complicate the use of mRNA information to approximate protein and metabolite levels. Without the availability
of single-cell HRMS as a routine laboratory tool or other technologies capable of deep metabolomics and
proteomics, scientists at present lack insights into metabolic processes that contribute to early embryonic
patterning. The research program proposed here fills this enormous knowledge and technological gap by
utilizing ultrahigh-sensitivity HRMS platforms that were custom-designed, custom-built, and validated in the
vertebrate frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo, a popular model in cell/developmental biology, to understand
noncanonical metabolomic processes that control formation of the germ layers. Most recently, single-cell
HRMS in X. laevis has discovered metabolites that are capable of (i) altering the normal cell fates of embryonic
cells, (ii) communicating between blastomeres, and (iii) affecting the whole-organismal performance of the
resulting tadpole. These findings have shed light on a gap in our basic knowledge of molecules participating in
the successful induction of the germ layers. This research program will determine roles that metabolites play in
patterning the embryonic body plan. This work will integrate classical embryological manipulations, cell-fate
tracking, and fluorescent microscopy with new-generation quantitative mass spectrometry capable of
subcellular sensitivity to characterize how targeted metabolic reactions impact reproducible tissue fates in the
X. laevis embryo. Because these molecular processes are highly conserved across vertebrates, the data
collected from Xenopus are likely to have high relevance to human development. This interdisciplinary
research program will help discover metabolic mechanisms governing cell differentiation and embryogenesis."

multiplexed analysis on protein and RNA markers; and iv) a separate EV isolation process required prior to the
assay. The overall goal of this application is to overcome these technical challenges and develop a new
platform that enables multiplexed analyses of EV protein and RNA markers in individual EVs. We previously
developed a nanoplasmonic EV sensing platform based on transmission surface plasmon resonance through
periodic nanohole gratings. We showed that the nanoplasmonic sensors could rapidly and sensitively detect
disease-specific EVs directly from clinical samples. In this project, we will further advance the technology for
robust multiplexed EV analysis and implement on-chip EV isolation to achieve simple assay procedures and
good reproducibility. We will validate the system using well-established preclinical and clinical samples to
demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the new technology for clinical applications. Successful completion
of the project will produce a highly sensitive sensing platform for multiplexed EV analysis. The development of
such a technology could offer additional insight into understanding subtypes, heterogeneity, and production
dynamics of EVs during disease development and progression. The gained insights will pave the way for
expanding EV studies to various diseases, further broadening the scope of EV applications in clinical settings."
11094353,"Project Summary: The human RNA-binding proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, are essential for mammalian
development and their dysfunction is linked to multiple human diseases including developmental defects,
neurological disorders, infertility, cancers, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These important functions compel our
overall objective to discover how PUM1&2 control the flow of genetic information from gene to mRNA to protein
and to identify the full repertoire of genes that they regulate. PUM1&2 bind to thousands of mRNAs in human
cells by recognizing an RNA sequence called the Pumilio Response Element (PRE). Previous research
showed that PUM1&2 promote degradation of hundreds of these PRE-containing mRNAs by recruiting RNA
decay enzymes. It is now clear, however, that this mechanism represents only one type of PUM-mediated
regulatory outcome. Thousands of mRNAs are bound by PUM1&2 but are not degraded. Therefore, it is now
necessary to determine how PUM1&2 control the fate of all target mRNAs. The resulting data will provide a
comprehensive view of their regulatory roles in biology and pathogenesis. We propose that human PUM1&2
repress many target mRNAs by inhibiting the process of translation. This hypothesis is supported by multiple
examples of genes that are repressed by PUM1&2 at the level of protein abundance in the absence of mRNA
degradation. The mechanism and prevalence of this translational inhibition is unknown. In addition, our data
indicate that for some genes PUM-mediated translational inhibition can synergize with RNA degradation to
regulate gene expression to a larger extent than either process alone. RNA molecules form structures that
influence their function and fate. While biochemical evidence indicates that RNA structure can modulate PUM-
PRE interactions, its effect in vivo remains unknown. In fact, there is an overall lack of RNA structural
information of mRNAs in human cells that limits our understanding of how that structure influences gene
regulation by RNA-binding proteins like PUM1&2. The proposed research seeks to determine how PUM1&2
inhibit translation and to identify the translational regulatory factors that are necessary for PUM1&2 activity.
The structure of human mRNAs will be determined and its effect on PUM-mRNA interactions and regulatory
network will be analyzed. By integrating this new data with existing knowledge of which mRNAs are bound and
degraded by PUM1&2, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of this key genetic regulatory network.
Discovery of the full regulatory network of PUM1&2 will provide new insights into how they control gene
expression to regulate normal biological processes. Moreover, this knowledge will help elucidate how their
dysfunction leads to diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as
“NOT-CA-24-039.”
Cancer mortality rates are projected to more than double in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the next two decades.
This public health crisis requires that a knowledge base be developed to better understand and act on the
growing cancer burden in SSA. We propose a training program that will maximize the rigor of cancer research
in SSA by training researchers to develop strategic and operational capacity that will generate new knowledge
about the determinants of cancer risk and outcomes and improve effectiveness of strategies for reducing risk
and improve outcomes. The overarching goals of this training program are to 1) Develop and disseminate best
practices to enable the highest quality cancer research in Africa; 2) Teach fundamental skills to those who
conduct research in Africa; and 3) Create a cadre of individuals who can lead and support cancer research in
SSA. Our training program proposes the following specific aims: 1) Develop and implement an educational and
career development program that will maximize the rigor of research being conducted in SSA; 2) Recruit and
train individuals who can build sustainable careers in cancer research; 3) Assess the impact of this training
program on the career outcomes of trainees and participants. Trainees will fall into two groups. First, we propose
a Principal Investigator (PI) Track for doctoral level investigators who will be trained to demonstrate leadership
in independent and collaborative research. Participants in the PI Track will become proficient in research
oversight and governance and build the skills and a scientific project focus toward independent extramural grant
funding. Second, a Project Management (PM) Track will be implemented to support the conduct of research.
Participants in the PM Track will be qualified to support a variety of research projects within SSA health and
regulatory settings. Training will involve bilateral interactions between mentors and trainees in both SSA and the
US who will partner to develop and implement best research practices. The training program will build on highly
successful existing research networks in SSA: The African Breast Cancer Study (ABCS), The African
Esophageal Cancer Consortum (AFRECC), The African Research Group in Oncology (ARGO), and the Men of
African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) network. Building on mentors and research capacity
of these networks, the proposed program will provide a core research curriculum known as the PROject
Management Oversight Training and Education in AFRICA (PROMOTE-AFRICA) framework as well as project-
based (for the PI Track) or practicum-based (for the PM track) activities as well as other educational experiences
to individuals seeking careers as independent cancer researchers or project managers."
11092515,"Project Summary The purpose of this project is to provide research and career development training for Valeria
Gomez, a current PhD student at the University of Florida. This project is a logical extension of the parent project,
‘Role of SR-mitochondria interplay in calcium-dependent arrhythmias’, thus furthering its overarching mission.
Additionally, it will facilitate career growth for the candidate, aligning with NIH’s interest in advancing diversity.
The release of calcium (Ca) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptors (RyR2) regulates
the heartbeat. This Ca release process is tightly controlled in healthy hearts but goes awry in diseased hearts
due to genetic or acquired defects of the RyR2 channel complex. These defects typically make the channel
complex hyperactive or leaky, thus giving rise to aberrant Ca release (ACR). RyR2 dysfunction and resultant
ACR is implicated in a range of cardiac dysfunctions including heart failure, metabolic heart, and cardiac
arrhythmias. For instance, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a genetic arrhythmia
syndrome directly caused by mutations in RyR2 or its accessory proteins. Interestingly, recent studies have
shown that mitochondria in CPVT appear to play a protective role by absorbing RyR2-derived ACR. Indeed,
strategies aimed at directing more Ca to mitochondria by targeting mitochondrial Ca uptake mechanisms appear
to be effective in alleviating arrhythmias in CPVT. SR and mitochondria form structural tethering known as
mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are the primary sites facilitating SR-mitochondria Ca
transfer. The parent project focuses on targeting one of the endogenous tether proteins, mitofusin 2, to
manipulate MAMs and assess its impact on arrhythmogenesis. In this project, Ms. Gomez aims to introduce an
engineered cardiac muscle-specific MAMs linker to CPVT hearts. She will test the hypothesis that the expression
of the engineered MAMs linker inhibits arrhythmias in CPVT by promoting MAMs. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that the expression of the engineered MAMs linker promotes MAMs in CPVT hearts. Adeno-associated virus 9
(AAV9)-mediated gene transfer will be employed to introduce the MAMs linker. The formation of MAMs will be
assessed through transmission electron microscopy and cellular assays, including immunofluorescence and
proximity ligation assay. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the expression of the engineered MAMs linker inhibits
cellular arrhythmias. Confocal imaging experiments will be conducted to evaluate the frequency of
arrhythmogenic Ca waves in myocytes. Aim 3 aims to test the hypothesis that the expression of the engineered
MAMs linker inhibits arrhythmias in vivo, assessed through surface electrocardiogram measurements. The
proposed project will explore innovative strategies for targeting mitochondria to inhibit Ca-dependent arrhythmias.
Moreover, it will offer exceptional training opportunities for the candidate, Ms. Gomez, equipping her with
valuable skills for a future scientific career."
11092570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain contributes significantly to the current opioid epidemic. Up to 20% of postoperative patients develop
chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). CPSP is highly associated with chronic opioid use and dependence, and yet
routine multimodal analgesia as a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and anti-neuropathic agents is only
moderately effective in preventing CPSP. The incidence for CPSP is particularly high in patients undergoing
mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissections (25- 60%). This specific postsurgical pain
condition is known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), and a recent study showed that 1 in 10 patients
continue to use opioids 3 months after surgery. We aim to study the effectiveness of postoperative ketamine for
the prevention of PMPS, within the NIH HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network (Pain ERN).
Our rationale is that ketamine can reduce key risks for CPSP including acute pain severity, anxiety and
depression, and pain catastrophizing, and in doing so can prevent the development of PMPS. Mechanistically,
ketamine is known to enhance endogenous cortical control of pain and mood. There is strong clinical evidence
for postoperative ketamine infusion in reducing postsurgical pain, and for a single ketamine bolus (0.3-0.5mg/kg)
to treat depression and anxiety associated with postsurgical pain. However, studies are urgently needed to test
the efficacy of ketamine in the perioperative period for preventing CPSP, particularly PMPS, in a large cohort of
patients and to assess clinical variables predictive for chronic pain severity and for treatment effects. We aim to
conduct a multi-site, three-arm RCT to study the effectiveness of ketamine in reducing the incidence and severity
of PMPS. 750 patients after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissection will be
randomized to receive either a standard continuous ketamine infusion starting after surgical incision (bolus of
0.35mg/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 0.25mg/kg/hr) and continued for 2 hours after surgery, a unique
regimen of single-bolus ketamine (0.6mg/kg) administered right after surgery, or placebo (saline) control. To
maintain the pragmatic nature of an effectiveness trial, all patients will receive routine postoperative multimodal
analgesia. Compatible with recent NIH recommendations, we will assess pain, function and mood over 6 months
after surgery. We will use Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity score at 3 months after surgery as primary
endpoints. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include pain incidence, BPI, opioid use, and NIH PROMIS
Anxiety and Depression scales as well as for neuropathic pain and physical function. We will also build precision
medicine models to analyze clinical variables associated with CPSP and with success of ketamine treatment.
Agreements have been reached with 15 sites, including 7 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)
hubs, NYU, Columbia, Einstein, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, UT Southwestern, UT MD Anderson, University
of Pittsburgh, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Univ. of Alabama, Univ. of Arkansas, Mayo Clinic, Rush
University, MetroHealth, and Univ. of Washington, to carry out this study successfully."

 The goal of the NIGMS T32 Predoctoral Training Program in Signaling and Cell Regulation is to prepare
predoctoral trainees for productive research careers in the field of signaling and cellular regulation. The training
faculty mentors consist of an outstanding, internationally recognized group of researchers in the Department of
Biochemistry (BCHM) and the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) at the
University of Colorado, Boulder, who study basic cell regulatory mechanisms through discovery and
characterization of key components in biological pathways. The program mentors students to gain critical
thinking skills and depth in understanding how to assimilate different scientific areas to solve problems in modern
molecular biosciences, and teaches them how to use apply these skills when they enter the biomedical research
workforce. Program elements include program-specific elective courses, an annual Symposium, Supergroup
research conferences, seminars, and journal clubs, together with trainee monitoring through thesis committees
and organizational meetings. These approaches expose students to broad, interdisciplinary scientific areas
through cross-disciplinary mentorship and collaboration; provide them with rigorous training in experimental
design, classical and modern technologies, and data analysis, with high standards for reproducibility; foster a
proactive community effort to promote the recruitment and retention of underrepresented trainees; and support
students’ progress and ability to work in teams in an inclusive environment through all aspects of their training.
Coursework on responsible conduct of research instills students with an awareness of norms and expectations
for conducting research with high ethical standards. Professional development and career training workshops
expose students to diverse career trajectories and opportunities, with experiential coaching for planning and
landing employment. By integrating SCR Program- specific coursework and activities with departmental graduate
program requirements, and through mindful and responsive mentoring, the Program creates a thriving
collaborative and interdisciplinary graduate training environment.
 The current proposal requests a NIH INCLUDE Down syndrome Administrative Supplement to the
existing parent T32 program. As articulated in the proposal, 15 of the 36 SCR Training Program faculty are
already actively engaged in Down syndrome-related research and training of graduate students and postdocs in
this field. Thus, the SCR Training Program is well positioned, both scientifically and administratively, to oversee
the mentorship of graduate students interested in Down syndrome-related research. This was demonstrated
during our first INCLUDE Administrative Supplement of 2023-2024, when 4 trainees with interests in Down
syndrome-associated cell mechanisms benefited from training in collaboration with Crnic Institute for Down
syndrome research. Therefore, this proposal is perfectly aligned with the NIH INCLUDE Project Research Plan
Component 1: Targeted high risk - high reward basic science studies in areas highly relevant to Down syndrome."
11094482,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) carries a high risk of cardiovascular disease mediated
by chronic inflammation and premature atherosclerosis, but responsive surrogate outcome measures of
cardiovascular (CV) risk are currently lacking. Loss of nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) decline by ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is common in children with pSLE, and has potential as an early, modifiable,
non-invasive measure of vascular health. Loss of NBP decline predicts CV events in adults and may be a
marker of endothelial dysfunction, which precedes structural changes in atherosclerosis. More importantly,
cardiovascular risk associated with NBP decline is potentially reversible with renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)
blockade. In order to determine the role of NBP decline as an outcome measure in pSLE, this proposal seeks
to first understand which mechanisms of increased cardiovascular risk contribute to loss of NBP decline, and
how NBP decline relates to endothelial function or other measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. Responsive
outcome measures would enable studies of interventions to improve vascular health. Potential pharmacologic
interventions include RAS blockade, which targets endothelial function without increasing infections from
immune suppression. There is, however, a paucity of data to guide the use of RAS blockade in pSLE.
 The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) identify the major factors that contribute to loss of NBP decline
in pSLE; 2) determine whether loss of NBP decline is associated with endothelial dysfunction and could serve
as a CV risk marker or potential treatment target; and 3) determine whether RAS blockade is associated with a
decreased risk of CV events in adolescents or young adults with SLE. We will perform a prospective
longitudinal study of children with SLE recruited to undergo serial ABPM, peripheral endothelial function testing
and comprehensive vascular profiles. We will also perform a retrospective analysis using advanced
pharmacoepidemiologic methods to estimate the effect of RAS blockade on the risk of cardiovascular events
among adolescents and adults in a large electronic health record database.
 K23 Candidate Dr. Chang completed a Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn) and has been appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP). The proposed research and training plan will provide her with the necessary experience
conducting prospective patient-oriented research, expand her expertise in non-invasive vascular assessment
and cardiovascular outcomes research, and provide advanced training in pharmacoepidemiologic methods, to
become an expert in early identification and prevention of cardiovascular complications of child-onset
rheumatic disease. She has established a strong multidisciplinary mentoring team that, together with the vast
resources at CHOP and UPenn, will facilitate the proposed work and foster her development as an
independent investigator and leader at the cross-section of cardiology and pediatric rheumatology."

 Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FA) are endogenous adaptive signaling mediators present in animal and human
tissues and fluids under basal conditions. They are formed at sites of inflammation and, most importantly, as an
interaction of dietary components containing nitrite and nitrate (e.g., leafy vegetables) and conjugated fatty acids
(e.g., dairy products and plant seeds). NO2-FA are electrophilic and pleiotropic signaling modulators that have
demonstrated protective effects in various pathological conditions. They exert their signaling actions by reacting
with target proteins to activate Nrf2 and heat shock protein expression, inhibit NF-κB and STING inflammatory
signaling, and associated fibrotic events. During the R0, we discovered the presence of a new group of nitrated
species, NO2-conjugated linolenic acid (NO2-CLNA), in healthy human urines. These lipids contribute to 40% of
the total NO2-FA pool, despite the limited levels of the CLNA substrate present in the western diet. The
remarkable nitration yields and ease of nitration of CLNA under biological conditions, the levels detected in
humans, and the potential biological activities underscore the value of this proposal. We hypothesize that the
nitration of CLNA is a critical reaction in the gastric compartment that confers new metabolic, protective, and
anti-inflammatory functions to these conjugated fatty acids. We will test the hypothesis through the following
Aims:
Aim #1 Define the NO2-CLnA formation and absorption.
Aim #2 Define the reactivity, signaling properties, and metabolism of new bioactive NO2-CLNA
Through quantitative and mechanistic studies, this proposal has the potential to change the CLA and CLNA
paradigm and demonstrate an active role for nitration in conferring new signaling activities to these conjugated
fatty acids, impacting how we understand pharmacology of these dietary fatty acids."

 Ribosome hibernation is a conserved mechanism used by both bacteria and eukaryotes to
prevent translation and to extend organismal lifespan. Recent studies from various bacterial
species, including pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, have provided compelling evidence for a
critical role of hibernating 100S ribosomes in protecting the ribosomal pool from damage, in
addition to blocking translational initiation. We found that S. aureus ribosomes lacking
hibernation-promoting factor (Hpf) are rapidly degraded by the 3’-5’ exonuclease RNase R and
other hitherto unknown ribonucleases. In our unpublished work, we isolated an additional
ribonuclease mutant that rescues the loss of ribosomes in S. aureus. Surprisingly, we found that
ribosomes are not the only target of S. aureus Hpf; instead, Hpf could interact with a cytoplasmic
protein of unknown biological activity, thereby reducing the abundance of hibernating 100S
ribosomes. We further demonstrated that Hpf is restricted to a specific subcellular localization
during rapid growth, providing a rare glimpse of possible Hpf segregation from actively translating
ribosomes. In this proposal, we will undertake a highly multidisciplinary approach consisting of
structural biology, omics, bacterial genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy to
achieve the following goals: (1) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which Hpf protects
ribosomes from ribonucleolytic cleavage. (2) Determine the previously undiscovered extra-
ribosomal role of Hpf. (3) Determine how the spatiotemporal localization of Hpf avoids translation
conflicts. Hpf and RNase R are evolutionarily conserved virulence factors among nosocomial
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, completion of these aims will provide significant
mechanistic insight into innovative counterstrategies to combat recalcitrant infections by
perturbing the biogenesis and turnover of hibernating ribosomes."

Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that decode the genome. Quality control
mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of this process are thus of paramount importance cellular
and organismal viability. Ribosomes move at variable rates, slowing down or even pausing to
facilitate organelle targeting, domain folding and co-translational assembly, but prolonged stalls
are deleterious to cells because they can deplete functional ribosomes and produce highly toxic
truncated nascent chains. Stalls that occur on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ribosomes are even
more damaging because they additionally obstruct the translocons through which all secreted
and membrane proteins must transit en route to the secretory pathway. Ribosome quality
control (RQC) is a conserved and essential process that rescues stalled 60S subunits by
extracting the obstructing nascent chain and degrading it by the UPS. Despite immense
progress in the past decade in defining RQC for cytosolic ribosome, the how RQC operates for
ER-stalled ribosomes is almost completely uninvestigated. Recently my lab discovered that
UFMylation – the process by which UFM1, a small ubiquitin-like protein is conjugated to
ribosomes — plays a central and essential role specifically in adapting RQC to proteins
synthesized at the ER. The three specific aims described in this proposal seek to build on the
foundation provided by our extensive preliminary data to define the mechanism by which
nascent chains that obstruct ribosomes that stall on ER translocons are extracted and
degraded. In aim 1 we will conduct a systematic dissection of the RQC machinery to define the
role of known RQC required to resolve stalled ribosomes at the ER. In aim 2 we will define the
interplay between ribosome UFMylation and RQC and dentify the readers of UFMylated
ribosomes at the ER. In aim 3 we will determine the structure of UFMyulated ribosomes and the
E3 ligase that conjugates UFM1 to the ribosome."

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling plays an essential role in many physiological processes and is also
involved in many human diseases, yet the mechanisms governing GPCR signaling remain poorly understood.
The goal of the proposed research is to further our mechanistic understanding of GPCR signaling. The model
GPCR receptor we study is the therapeutically relevant C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). CXCR4 signaling
is important for embryogenesis, immune function and stem cell regulation, among other functions. In addition,
CXCR4 signaling is involved in several human diseases, including cancer. CXCR4 is aberrantly expressed in
many cancers and its expression correlates with poor prognosis. This is mainly because CXCR4 signaling
contributes to metastatic disease, the reason for most cancer related deaths. Yet the mechanisms governing
CXCR4 signaling remain poorly understood. To achieve our goal, we will address two main questions: 1. What
are the biophysical and structural determinants driving GPCR signaling by b-arrestins via non-GPCR binding
partners? 2. What are the roles of PKCd and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in compartmentalized
heterologous regulation of GPCR signaling? To address these questions, we will mainly use cell culture models
and reconstitution assays using several complimentary integrative approaches including biophysical,
biochemical, proximity ligation, multi-labeling fluorescence confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, and signaling
assays. We believe our research is significant because we expect to define new concepts that apply broadly
across the GPCR family, which will provide an advanced explanation of the mechanisms driving GPCR signaling.
Our research hold the promise to translate new knowledge into innovative drug discovery efforts to modulate
GPCR signaling therapeutically."

The overwhelming immune response to systemic infection and traumatic injury may result in
hyperinflammation, multiple organ failure, and death in sepsis. Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous critical
illness with multiple dynamic dysregulated inflammatory pathways triggered by systemically released Damage
or Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs). Dysregulated inflammation also contributes to
the pathogenesis of many other diseases, e.g. autoimmune diseases, chronic wounds, etc. Clinical
challenges: Versatile immune modulation therapy to resolve inflammation in critical illness is still a significant
unmet need. Therapeutics targeting a specific inflammatory mediator, e.g. cytokines or DAMPs/PAMPs, have
failed to improve sepsis survival in the clinic. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory steroid drugs are associated
with immune suppression, resulting in an increased risk of secondary infections. Solutions: I have developed
a novel, well-defined linear-dendritic telodendrimer (TD) nanoplatform for structure-based nanocarrier design in
therapeutic delivery and immune modulation. In my on-going R01 project, I have developed TD nanotrap (NT)
platforms for both systemic injection and hemoperfusion therapy to passively capture a broad spectrum of the
overflowing inflammatory signals simultaneously, e.g. LPS, cytokines, and DAMPs/PAMPs, to restore immune
regulation. The optimized TD NT resins provide a cure in a severe sepsis mouse model when combined with a
moderate dose of antibiotics, as reported in our recent publications in Nature Communications 2020 and
Advanced Therapeutics 2022. Recently, we created a series of novel TD constructs with a well-defined and
optimal combination of negative charges and hydrophobic moieties that can actively block immune cell
inflammation triggered by various immune stimulating molecules, e.g. endotoxins from gram negative bacteria
(LPS) and gram positive bacteria (LTA), as well as bacterial cell lysate and even TNF-α. At the same time,
these TDs can assemble into nanocarriers for the encapsulation of vital antibiotics for infection control; they
can also effectively deliver endogenous potent pyroptosis inhibitors to control hyperinflammation and prevent
immune suppression in the later stage of sepsis. In the next five years, I will focus on the development of
transformative, next generation multimodal TD nanodrugs for sepsis treatment in three directions: PROJECT-
1: Develop a novel next-generation bioactive TD nanodrug for inflammation control; PROJECT-2: Develop
multi-functional TD nanotherapeutics to inhibit pyroptosis in sepsis; PROJECT-3: Develop multimodal TD
nanomedicine to control infection and inflammation in sepsis. In addition to sepsis, these TD nanodrugs can
also be applied in other inflammatory diseases, e.g., ARDS, chronic wounds, cancer perioperative
inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, etc. In summary, our innovative TD
nanodrugs are poised to provide resolution to inflammation and improve sepsis survival in the clinic by both
immune modulation and infection control."

Circadian clocks are intracellular enzymatic systems that provide a reliable biochemical
representation of local time with profound consequences to health across diverse
organisms. Unlike most enzymes, biological clocks are insensitive to a range of
physiological temperatures and cellular energy levels so that organisms can anticipate
dawn and dusk reliably. Another criterion of circadian clocks is that they can be
entrained through environmental cues and thereby stay synchronized to local time.
However, the mechanisms of these deﬁning hallmarks remain incompletely resolved in
any organism, and thus represent outstanding gaps in knowledge across the ﬁeld of
biological timekeeping. Therefore, the overall vision for the next ﬁve years is to build
upon our prior work to elucidate the mechanisms of temperature and metabolic
compensation and entrainment in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, a system
widely valued by the circadian clocks community. Because proteins and their
interactions underpin clock mechanisms regardless of organism, lessons learned here
are expected to serve as important points of reference for the scientiﬁc community
working on diverse circadian clocks. Over the past 20 years, we have made many
impactful discoveries on mechanism of the cyanobacterial clock and developed
innovative methodologies and tools along the way. Our lab recently reconstituted the
intact cyanobacterial clock in vitro such that each component can be monitored in real
time over several days, and our reﬁned and predictive model is the framework for our
hypotheses regarding mechanisms of temperature compensation, metabolic
compensation, and entrainment. Thus, we are very well positioned to succeed at ﬁlling
these critical gaps in knowledge. A major expected outcome of the work proposed
here is a detailed cause-and-eﬀect model linking clock protein behavior and
interactions to clock phenotypes in vivo."
11096442,"ABSTRACT. Tricuspid valve regurgitation severely impacts more than 1.6 million Americans. In most patients,
tricuspid regurgitation is considered “functional” or due to valve-extrinsic factors. The valve itself is considered
intact and thus viewed as an innocent bystander. Therefore, most treatment strategies focus on these valve-
extrinsic factors and ignore the valve itself. Recently, we have shown that tricuspid regurgitation may not be so
functional after all. In two separate sheep models of functional tricuspid regurgitation, we showed that the
tricuspid valve leaflets fibrotically remodel, i.e., maladapt. Those leaflets grow in area and become both thicker
and stiffer. Through computational studies, we further showed that maladaptation reduces leaflet compliance
and their ability to coapt successfully, thus impeding valve function. These findings are of critical importance as
tricuspid maladaptation may be a predictor for disease progression and patient outcomes. They may also explain
the limited success of current treatment strategies. That is, they may explain why tricuspid valve repairs fail long-
term in as many as 30% of patients. The ultimate goal of the parent grant is to understand tricuspid valve
maladaptation as a potential therapeutic target. In fact, Aim 3 of the parent grant explores prophylactic surgery
as one potential path toward preventing maladaptation and thus improving clinical outcomes. Instead, the
objective of this supplement is to take a first step toward testing tricuspid maladaptation as a pharmacological
target for future therapies. Therein, we are guided by our and others’ findings that remodeling of cardiac valve
leaflets occurs through disease-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (endoMT) of valvular endothelial
cells (VEC) and valvular interstitial cell (VIC) activation. Both phenotype changes have been suggested to be
mediated through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Toward identifying a pharmacological target for tricuspid
valve maladaptation, we thus test the hypothesis that targeted RAS inhibition suppresses the direct and indirect
activation of tricuspid valve cell phenotypes that drive tricuspid valve maladaptation. Specifically, in Aim 1, we
will test RAS-mediated VEC endoMT and VIC activation as a potential pharmacological target in-vitro. Thereby,
our work is a critical step toward a translatable treatment and directly informs future in-vivo studies. For example,
in the mitral valve, Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, has shown some promise to treat mitral
maladaptation. Based on our work, we may be able to similarly identify safe drugs that can be used to suppress
tricuspid valve maladaptation. Our effort will shed new light on a deadly cardiovascular disease and its treatment
and is thus well-suited for support through the CAROL Act."

Polymer nanoparticles present an exciting opportunity to deliver pharmaceutical drugs orally. While promising,
this approach is currently limited by two major problems, 1) lack of versatile polymer structures for customized

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered drug-laden polymer nanoparticles. In pursuit
of clinical translation of polymer nanoparticles, this proposal aims to synthesize polyesters with controlled
topologies for probing transcytosis at the gut-blood barrier and develop quantitative tools in the form of
mathematical systems physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Towards this goal, a series of in
vitro, in vivo, and in silico investigations in translationally relevant preclinical species are proposed to obtain
unprecedented quantitative insight into the processes responsible for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination (ADME) of drug-laden polymer nanoparticles. In addition, all the preclinical data will be
mathematically integrated simultaneously using a novel bottom-up systems PBPK model, which can serve as a

 The central objective of this application is to harness unconventional synthetic
building blocks for the development of new, reliable, and efficient, methodologies.
These methodologies are intended to enable the construction of stereochemically rich
scaffolds, including those seen in naturally occurring small molecules and medicines.
The development of new methods and the syntheses of complex small molecules
continues to be vital areas of research. Most medicinal agents on the market are
prepared by organic synthesis, including the large majority of all new drugs that have
become available over the past three decades. The chemical structures of new drug
entities are becoming increasingly complex, now often bearing sp3 centers rather than
“flat” structures. This has led to an increased need for chemists to develop new
methods that can reliably build intricate structures.
 The two unconventional building blocks we seek to harness in the proposed
studies are amides and strained cyclic alkynes and allenes. Regarding amides, the C–N
bond of amides has long been viewed as stable, such that synthetic methodologies that
rely on C–N bond cleavage have remained limited. We seek to develop methods that
utilize nickel catalysis to harness amide functional groups as synthons. We propose to
assemble important linkages with defined stereocenters, including quaternary
stereocenters, using catalysis and chemoenzymatic methods. These efforts provide
new opportunities in the area of strong bond activation by nickel catalysis, along with
new tools for the manipulation of amides via C–N bond cleavage. With regard to
strained cyclic alkynes and allenes, we seek to intercept these transient, highly reactive
species to efficiently build complex molecular scaffolds. Such methods should allow for
the establishment of scaffolds bearing two new bonds and three sp3 centers.
Enantiospecific and catalytic enantioselective variants will be targeted. Our
methodologies will be evaluated in the context of several synthetic endeavors. The
results of our studies should lead to powerful new strategies and tools for accessing
various molecules of importance, including natural products and medicines."

ABSTRACT
 Two million Americans are hospitalized for sepsis each year, and 1 in 3 die. Those that survive, however,
are not cured. Neurocognitive disorders occur in up to 50%, and cognitive decline continues for up to 8 years.
Sepsis hospitalizations account for a higher proportion of unplanned readmissions than those for myocardial
infarction, heart failure, and COPD. Five-year mortality for sepsis survivors exceeds that for heart failure and
stroke. The mechanisms underlying this persistent loss of health remain to be defined. We hypothesize that
early during sepsis the mitochondrion is restructured as an adaptive mechanism to protect the cell against any
future environmental stress, such as recurrent sepsis. These structural changes impart lasting alterations to
the mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and metabolism necessary to support a cellular phenotype,
which for a multicellular organism are poorly tolerated and underlie a persistent loss of health.
Our lab has spent nearly two decades studying sepsis to elucidate the Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that
regulate mitochondrial biology to balance Ca2+ homeostasis and ATP generation and preserve cellular health.
We have shown that early after sepsis, mitochondrial depolarization generates a Ca2+ signal. Members of the
family of Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) transduce these Ca2+ signals and work in
tandem to mediate adaptive changes in mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, and oxidative metabolism to lessen
cellular damage. More recently, we observed that sepsis restructures the mitochondrial calcium uniporter
(MCU) complex, imposing long-lasting changes to mitochondrial and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and
metabolism that perturb cellular and tissue function across the entire organism. We propose that as a
‘learned’ response to sepsis, the cell restructures the MCU complex to counter the potential for Ca2+
overload with future insult; this imparts long-lasting alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, oxidative
metabolism, and tissue phenotype. Using models of lower-respiratory tract and intraperitoneal infection and
correlative human samples, we propose the following aims:
Aim 1. To study in mice and humans how a restructured MCU complex alters Ca2+ homeostasis and
oxidative metabolism and thereby, the phenotype of each tissue comprising the organism.
Aim 2. To define the mechanisms of mitophagy and protein degradation through the lysosome and
proteasome as underlying causes of the persistent loss of MICU1 expression in murine models of
sepsis and in human sepsis survivors.
This new experimental work will provide foundational knowledge as to how the mechanisms governing
mitochondrial Ca2+ and metabolism are restructured during sepsis to underlie a persistent loss of cellular

This administrative supplement will fund the central pharmacy and urine drug screening activities
reassigned to Lead Investigators at Yale University and not previously supported in the original funded
application described as follows. Drug overdoses in the U.S. increased to over 107,000 in the year ending
January 2022 including > 80,000 involving opioids, representing a 24% increase from the prior year. Despite
improved outcomes and decreased all-cause mortality among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) who
receive opioid agonist treatment, only 11% of individuals with OUD receive medications for opioid use disorder.
Narrowing the treatment gap by expanding access to treatment beyond specialized drug treatment settings is a
public health priority, and the Emergency Department (ED), offering access 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days
a year, is a logical point of intervention. ED patients have a disproportionately high prevalence of OUD, and for
many, the ED is the primary or only access point in the healthcare system. There are currently no controlled,
prospective studies comparing dosing strategies for buprenorphine induction in the ED. We
propose
a
multisite
randomized double-blind, double-dummy, clinical trial of ED patients with moderate to severe OUD (N=360)
from 4 geographically diverse EDs to compare Standard ED Dose Induction (SDI; 8 mg) with High Dose
Induction (HDI; 24 mg) to evaluate AIM 1: Engagement in continuing OUD treatment at 10 days and AIM 2:
Differences in outcomes of craving, tolerability, withdrawal symptoms, and use of illicit drugs. We hypothesize
that patients assigned to the HDI group will be more likely to be engaged in OUD treatment at 10 days post ED
enrollment (primary outcome), and will describe less craving, less withdrawal symptoms and less use of illicit
drugs during the 10 days post ED buprenorphine induction. Additional outcomes will be the development of
ED protocols, and evaluation of safety, feasibility, and acceptability. The primary outcome of engagement in
treatment at 10 days as well as treatment at day 30 will be verified by the treating clinician. Assessment of
craving, withdrawal symptoms and use of illicit drugs will be obtained by daily Qualtrics phone surveys. The
planned study sample and the proposed analytical methods will allow for additional meaningful exploratory
evaluations of potential differential effects of gender, race, ethnicity, housing instability, insurance status, and
use of fentanyl, and other polysubstance use such as stimulants, sedatives, and alcohol. An accelerated
induction
typical
engagement
process that achieves t herapeutic buprenorphine levels in less than 3-4 hours compared to the
2-3 days could potentially increase safety during the crucial gap between ED discharge and
in continuation treatment by limiting illicit opioid use and encouraging follow up visits for OUD
treatment."

 While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold great promise for treating many challenging diseases, a
major barrier to clinically meaningful MSC therapies is the inability to consistently produce potent MSCs. In vitro
cultured MSCs often rapidly enter senescence and lose their potency, driven largely by misregulated metabolic
signaling in culture. To address this, many signaling pathways (e.g., FGF, ATM, SRT, mTOR, EGF, DDR2) have
been identified as regulators of senescence-related processes. Building upon these discoveries, this R35 MIRA
project aims to develop an innovative approach to delay MSC senescence by collectively adjusting these
pathways.
 In this administrative supplement proposal, we aim to address an unexpected technical hurdle
encountered in the parent award and introduce an innovative research aim by acquiring the Nikon NSPARC
confocal imaging module. Over the past two years, our efforts to resolve recurring issues with our current
confocal system have been unsuccessful, leading us to rely on a suboptimal epifluorescent microscope for AI
training data. Following extensive research, we have identified the Nikon NSPARC module as the optimal
replacement, offering high-resolution and high-throughput imaging essential for detailed observation of
subcellular structures like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and histone marks. Its low phototoxicity also
makes it suitable for live cell imaging, allowing us to explore dynamic cellular information and enhance our AI
model’s prediction of cell senescence states. Overall, this supplementary application, seeking to acquire a Nikon
Spatial Array Confocal Module, aims to overcome an unexpected technical obstacle critical to fulfilling the
objectives of the parent award while also augmenting our imaging capacity to explore novel hypotheses in
deciphering metabolism-based senescence pathways and rejuvenation mechanisms."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a global public health crisis, with an estimated 10 million deaths per
year expected by 2050 without significant public health intervention and the development of new classes of
antibiotics. Towards combating this crisis, the parent grant funding of this supplement proposal aims to better
understand bacterial virulence factors in order to develop new strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat
antibiotic-resistant infections. In project 2 of the parent U19 grant, we have further elucidated the mechanism by
which FimD, the outer membrane (OM) usher of the type I chaperone usher pathway (CUP) pilus system,
critical for both mouse and human cystitis, accommodates the tip adhesin during pilus biogenesis, and developed
monoclonal antibodies that inhibit this process by binding to and inhibiting usher function. While we have made
tremendous progress towards understanding usher function during pilus biogenesis, the process by which
ushers are folded and inserted into the OM has remained obscure. Each usher is -800 amino acids and consists
of five domains; i) a periplasmic N-terminal domain (NTD); ii) two periplasmic C-terminal domains (CTD1 and
CTD2); iii) a 24-stranded β-barrel translocation domain (TD); and iv) a plug domain (PD) that sits in the TD when
the usher is inactive and is moved into the periplasm to interact with the NTD when the usher is active. We
hypothesize that like other Gram-negative OM β-barrel proteins tested to date, all CUP ushers are folded and
inserted into the OM by the β-barrel Assembly Machinery (BAM). However, the presence of soluble periplasmic
terminal domains (NTD, CTD1, CTD2) and a luminal plug domain between strands 136 and 137 of the translocation
domain raises yet untested questions on how the β-barrel Assembly Machinery (BAM) accommodates these
domains and whether they play a role during usher folding by BAM. In this proposal, we will establish that ushers
are folded through the canonical BAM-mediated pathway by conducting photocrosslinking experiments between
BamA and FimD and investigate the role of the PD on FimD folding by comparing the crosslinking efficiency
between wild type and a plugless FimD (which is genetically deleted for the PD). We will also determine which
components of the BAM complex are required to accommodate the different soluble domains of the FimD usher.
These studies will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanism by which ushers are folded and inserted
into the OM by BAM, but also how BAM handles large multidomain OM proteins; revealing folding intermediates
that can be targeted for future therapeutic development."
11095071,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND RELEVANCE
The sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursors sphingosine and ceramides,
have emerged as pleiotropic signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular responses. Previously, we have
shown that in response to numerous stimuli, S1P produced intracellularly by two sphingosine kinases, SPHK1
and SPHK2, is exported out of cells via a specific transporter Spinster homolog 2 (SPNS2) to activate its
receptors S1PRs. While this process that we coined “inside-out signaling by S1P” is responsible for many of its
known functions, it has long been suspected that SPHK and the sphingolipids it regulates, S1P, sphingosine,
and ceramide, also have intracellular functions. This is an important gap that our research and the MIRA
proposal are aimed at filling as lower organisms express the evolutionary conserved sphingolipid metabolic
enzymes and although sphingolipid metabolites regulate important biological functions in these organisms,
they do not have S1PRs. Moreover, these enzymes are present in distinct subcellular compartments,
suggesting that the location(s) where sphingolipid metabolites are produced dictates their functions. The MIRA
proposal is focused on the roles of these sphingolipid metabolites in governing membrane contact sites (MCS)
between the ER network and late endocytic organelles versus the plasma membrane to control the movement
of cholesterol and sphingolipids between distinct cell membranes and their metabolism. Our research will also
address the involvement of these sphingolipid metabolites in establishment of lysosome-mitochondria MCS
and consequence to mitochondrial function and bioenergetics and define how they regulate localization of
GRAMD1s family, evolutionarily conserved ER-anchored cholesterol transfer proteins. Another goal of the
proposed research is to understand the functional transport mechanism of SPNS2, which remains
controversial, and could have important ramifications as SPNS2 has been linked to metabolism, cancer
metastasis, and auditory, inflammatory, and immune disorders.
 The new conceptual groundwork in this proposal will alter our understanding of sphingolipid metabolites
signaling and will reveal their ancient but understudied intracellular roles in regulation of membrane dynamics
and contact sites as sensors that integrate and coordinate sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism, and
potentially glucose homeostasis. Although this area of research is just in its infancy, we believe that our
proposed studies will shed new light on enigmatic functions of bioactive sphingolipids appropriate to their name
associated with the riddle of the Sphinx. It should also provide deeper understanding of how perturbations of
these fundamental biological processes contribute to human diseases."
11092522,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neuronal activity must be precisely coordinated to provide an accurate representation of our environment, a
feature exemplified by the electrical patterns measured in the brain during spatial navigation and memory
retrieval. While the activity of individual neurons is tuned to specific features such as physical location or speed,
simultaneous observations at the network level reveals electrical oscillations reflecting the coordinated activity
of thousands of neurons. Therefore, a central goal of neuroscience is to understand how network activity
emerges from the interactions between individual neurons. The neuronal architecture is relatively well-conserved
across multiple brain regions: a population of highly heterogenous inhibitory interneurons (INs) with dense
connectivity control a large population of excitatory neurons. Thus, the mechanisms controlling INs themselves
are poised to have a dramatic impact on network activity. Previous studies support the existence of small
populations of INs that selectively synapse onto other INs. These relatively sparse INs operate disinhibitory
networks that could have a profound impact on network activity. Here, I investigate how coordinated activity
emerges from neuronal interactions by investigating how disinhibition controls hippocampal circuits. In Aim 1, I
will dissect a disinhibitory circuits controlling parvalbumin-expressing (PV) INs, a class of neurons controlling the
firing of pyramidal cells. My preliminary results show that an overlooked class of INs known as backprojecting
(BP) INs hierarchically control PV-INs. I devised an intersectional genetic strategy to specifically access BP-INs
and establish their role in the network. Under Aim 2, I will explore how disinhibition maintains temporal neuronal
sequences, a hallmark feature of coordinated neuronal activity during network oscillations. I will focus on when
and how BP-INs are recruited during network oscillations and on the downstream effects of their activity by
working in vitro. Under Aim 3, I will reconstruct the impact of disinhibitory neurons on hippocampal network
dynamics. I will determine the necessity and the sufficiency of BP-INs in controlling hippocampal network
oscillations at different phases. Overall, this research will shed light on the physiological functions of disinhibition,
a well-conserved, but generally understudied circuit feature. During the K99 phase of the award, I will benefit
from the mentorship of Drs. Tsien and Buzsáki at New York University Grossman School of Medicine to obtain
additional training in system neuroscience. The training plan proposed will equip me with the necessary research
and professional skills to start an independent career at the intersection between cellular and system
neuroscience in the R00 phase. This work is further motivated by observations that dysregulation in neuronal
coordination can lead to neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsies. In the long
term, studying how inhibitory neurons and disinhibition control neuronal network activity will provide a better
understanding of these pathological conditions."

Disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly affects U.S. Hispanic children. Compared to non-
Hispanic children, they have lower health related quality of life, self-care, and communication skills 3 years
after injury; even though differences are not present at hospital discharge. Long-term rehabilitation improves
outcomes, but timely initiation is key since most functional gains happen 3 to 6 months after TBI. Parents play
a significant role in their child’s recovery. However, Hispanic parents face substantial barriers that can result in
delayed treatment initiation and suboptimal outcomes. We developed and pilot tested the 1st theory-based
intervention for Hispanic children and their parents consisting of Brain Injury Education and outpatient
Navigation (1st BIEN). Based on Social Cognitive theory, 1st BIEN integrates in-person education enriched by
video content delivered through mobile phone devices, with outpatient navigation during transitions from
inpatient to outpatient care and during school return. The 1st BIEN pilot, established feasibility and acceptability
for our program and 86% attendance to initial follow-up care. We propose a multicenter randomized controlled
trial to test the efficacy of 1st BIEN to maintain long-term adherence to rehabilitation and determine its effect on
children’s functional outcomes. We will enroll 150 parent-child dyads; children (6-17 years), with moderate to
severe TBI and their parents, from 5 centers in 4 states with Hispanic population predominantly from Mexico
and Central America. A higher risk group, whose educational attainment, income and English proficiency are
lower compared to other Hispanic groups in the U.S. Parents randomized to the intervention will receive (1)
One in-person education session, using the culturally, linguistically and literacy relevant 1st BIEN booklet, plus
bi-weekly video reviews individually tailored to the child’s TBI and therapies; and, (2) three months of bilingual
outpatient navigation, modeling and coaching problem solving skills. Attention control parents will receive one
in person-education session using the 1st BIEN booklet, monthly non-TBI (Well-child) texts and usual
institutional follow up care. The primary outcome is treatment adherence at 6 months post-discharge measured
by percentage of follow-up appointments attended during the prescribed time at centralized acute facilities,
community care providers and individual therapies. Secondary outcomes are functional status of the child
using PROMIS parental report measures; and, parental health literacy, self-efficacy and mental health
measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Children’s academic performance will also be assessed
using school records. Exploratory analyses will test possible moderators such as pre-injury parental
acculturation; and mediators, such as post intervention parental TBI-knowledge, self-efficacy, anxiety and
depression. Our study evaluates a novel, flexible and scalable approach using mobile phone devices to aid
transitions of care, increase treatment adherence and improve TBI outcomes. It addresses the needs of an
understudied population and can serve as a model for TBI family centered interventions for at risk groups."
11092572,"PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL
 The two aims of NeuroTech Harbor are: (AIM 1) to accelerate early development of the most promising
neuromedical solutions, and (AIM 2) to increase the number of women & URM innovators through outreach and
education, and to improve equity and accessibility of neuromedical solutions. NeuroTech Harbor (NTH), led by
Johns Hopkins and Howard Universities, will accelerate the development of highly promising solutions to improve
neurological health for all. Solutions for all means also for the underserved, often synonymous with minority
groups. Diverse innovators should sit at the table on day one, but very few minority entrepreneurs exist. To
address these inequities, we will build NTH with an Equitech philosophy, which is the belief that diversity of
teams, leadership, and perspectives is a force multiplier to fuel innovation, producing solutions accessible to all
communities. Hopkins & Howard are uniquely positioned to realize this vision. Hopkins brings a foundation of
researchers, prestigious research centers, and programs and has a translation track record ($3B invested in
start-ups in the last 7 years). Howard complements this with a large pipeline of aspiring under-represented
minority (URM) innovators both within and outside the Howard community. Howard has nurtured this community
with early-stage mentorship, a successful incubator program, and recently received a $17M grant to create a
Center for Entrepreneurship aimed at building resources and support for Black business owners across the
country.
 NTH will solicit proposals from innovators nationwide addressing pressing problems. Although the areas
supported will be broad, covering all participating NIH Institutes and Centers, the expertise of NTH will be
inclusive but focusing on Neuroprosthesis (cortical, spinal, peripheral, vision, and auditory), Brain Machine
Interface, Neuro Sensors and Devices, Neuro Informatics, Neuromodulation, and Mental Health. For funded
projects, resources will be provided, and a dream team of specialists will offer mentorship and tools to guide
successful translation to first-in-human prototype. Specialists will be drawn from a diverse Steering Committee,
Advisory Board, and Consultant Network, composed of highly regarded clinicians, scientists, technologists,
commercialization experts, and patient advocates. To expand diversity amongst innovators, NTH has formed
strategic Outreach Partnerships with access to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving
Institutions across the nation. We have created an NTH Institute, a center for innovator leadership development
to educate innovators in business development, translation and project management. Importantly, our needs
assessments will be guided by the principles of equity and accessibility for all communities and will include the
input of underserved stakeholders. Our 5-year goals are to (i) solicit over 500 applications and launch 45 projects,
where at least 15 have 1 woman or URM innovator on the team, and (ii) blaze a trail to alleviate suffering from
neurological conditions for all, including the underserved...the Equitech way."
11093854,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in Mexico, yet screening
participation is alarmingly low, with less than 30% of women aged 20 or older having ever been screened in
2022. Human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling is an effective method that increases accessibility for
women facing barriers such as embarrassment, fear of pain, or logistical challenges. The Mexican Social
Security Institute (IMSS), the largest healthcare provider in Mexico, serves 31 million women and has begun to
implement programs to examine the potential of using HPV-based screening. In October 2022, IMSS launched
the IMSS Maquiladora HPV Screening Program (IMHSP) in Chihuahua, targeting 35,000 under-screened
women working in maquiladoras. As of April 2024, 11,878 workers were screened, but adoption,
implementation, and effectiveness varied widely across maquiladoras and there was sub-optimal follow-up to
abnormal results.
 Our long-term goal is to reduce CC morbidity and mortality in Mexico. The goal of the proposed study is
to identify factors influencing the adoption, implementation, and sustainment of the IMHSP, assess program
effectiveness and implementation outcomes, and design implementation strategies to improve program use
and sustainment. Using Implementation Mapping, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR), and RE-AIM, we will: 1) Identify barriers and facilitators to the adoption and implementation of the
IMHSP and describe implementation and effectiveness outcomes by conducting interviews, observations, and
discussion sessions with stakeholders and personnel in maquiladoras and IMSS clinics. 2) Explore factors
influencing program integration and screening completion from the perspectives of patients and IMSS
healthcare providers in clinical settings. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with female workers who
participated in the program and were HPV positive, and with clinical personnel at IMSS clinics; and, 3) Design
implementation strategies based on findings.
 This proposal if for an administrative supplement to a parent U54 LISTOS (Leveraging
Implementation Science to Optimize Strategies) for cancer control. LISTOS is a National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-funded center through the Global Implementation Science for Equitable Cancer Control (GlobalISE
Cancer Control) program to establish implementation science centers in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). The LISTOS center focuses on strengthening implementation research and research capacity in
Mexico and Latin America. This proposed study advances the goals of LISTOS and provides training
opportunities for our junior colleagues. This study addresses a pressing need for improved cervical cancer
control in Mexico and will inform scalable strategies to enhance screening participation across worksites
significantly advancing public health efforts and reducing cervical cancer mortality in underserved populations."

There remains an acute, critical need to study HIV/AIDS as approximately 32,000 individuals are infected
annually in the U.S. and mortality globally remains at over 630,000 annually. The NIH Office of AIDS has four
main priority areas for HIV/AIDS research: reduce the incidence, develop HIV cures, develop next generation
therapies and address HIV comorbidities. The National Primate Research Centers are charged with supporting
the national needs for nonhuman primate research, with a significant priority on supporting HIV/AIDS related
research. The Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNRPC) actively supports research projects in
each of the priority areas designated by the Office of AIDS research.
There remains a current shortage of Indian origin rhesus macaques in the U.S. due to a ban on exportation and
recent global pressures significantly exacerbating the supply. This has led to the increased demand for P51
supported animals to be used to supply HIV/AIDS projects. The SNPRC has been disproportionately affected by
the national macaque shortage due to the small size of our SPF rhesus colony and the assumption of a greater
responsibility for research using rhesus. The SNPRC resources serve not only a number of internal core
scientists that are focused on infectious disease, but also a heavily external-facing research portfolio. The
SNPRC supports > 230 active research requests from > 120 affiliated scientists, with >30 % of rhesus macaque
projects completed onsite associated with HIV/AIDS related research. These requests have increased the
demand for appropriate ABSL2 research holding space in order to support the upcoming HIV/AIDS related
projects.
This proposed P51 supplement will meet an urgent need to upgrade ABSL2 macaque holding space to support
HIV/AIDS related research. Over the last decade several ABSL2 buildings and rooms have been removed from
service and taken offline at SNPRC due to failing HVAC systems. This supplement will provide HVAC upgrades
to eight ABSL2 rooms to bring them back into service to support rhesus macaque holding at SNPRC."
11093869,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Evidence from human imaging, postmortem analysis, and animal models suggests that atrophy of neurons in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of both neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative diseases. Structural changes—including retraction of dendritic arbors, loss of dendritic
spines, and reductions in synapse density—lead to functional deficits that manifest as impaired cognition,
decreased motivation, anhedonia, high anxiety, and increased impulsivity. Thus, therapeutic strategies aiming
to restore PFC structure/function have broad therapeutic potential. Psychoplastogens—small molecules that
promote structural and functional neuroplasticity in the PFC—produce both rapid and long-lasting therapeutic
effects after a single administration. However, many psychoplastogens, including ketamine and serotonergic
psychedelics, induce hallucinations, which greatly limit their therapeutic potential and clinical scalability.
Fortunately, increasing evidence suggests that the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine and psychedelics may not
be necessary for their therapeutic properties, and our group recently introduced the first non-hallucinogenic
psychoplastogens. The advent of non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens represents an exciting new direction for
the treatment of many brain disorders, but there is an urgent need to further optimize their efficacy and safety
profiles. Our primary goals are to, 1) establish robust synthetic strategies to psychoplastogenic natural products
and chemical scaffolds that are amenable to medicinal chemistry, 2) develop high-throughput cellular assays for
assessing psychoplastogen efficacy and safety, and 3) advance new in vivo assays uniquely suited to evaluate
the long-lasting effects of psychoplastogens. Taken together, these efforts will enable structure-activity
relationship (SAR) studies of key psychoplastogenic scaffolds, filling the gap in our knowledge about which
structural motifs are critical for both psychoplastogenic and hallucinogenic effects. Ultimately, the work described
here will enable the rational design of safer, non-hallucinogenic alternatives to psychedelics for treating a wide
variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases."
11095924,"Abstract
Chronic inflammation, referred to as ""inflammaging"", is a risk factor for many age-related chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes, cancer, frailty). Aberrant immune responses may be linked to inflammatory-mediated metabolic and functional disorders but many mechanistic gaps exist. Among recently appreciated regulators of inflammaging are microRNAs (miRNAs). One example of which is the anti-inflammatory miR-146a, where we and others have shown that mice deficient in this miRNA succumb to a life-shortening chronic inflammation that involves clinically relevant comorbidities (1-6). Moreover, deletion of miR-155 in T cells significantly extends the lifespan of miR- 146a·1· mice which points to a vital role for T cell expressed miR-155 in this context including CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (3, 5). We have recently expanded our analyses of this critical process by investigating novel pathways in aging T cells that are regulated by miR-155 during inflammaging. By conducting single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) we have identified three gene programs that are counter-regulated by miR-146a and miR-155 in aged T cells that have not been previously examined in this context. These include aerobic glycolysis, chemokine production, and senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. Additional preliminary data stemming from initial exploration of these pathways have pointed us to a novel, age-associated inflammatory cos+ T cell subset (Taa cells) that is GZMK""CD8"" and that expands in both mice and humans (7), and that is regulated by miR-155. Based on these preliminary data, we will carry out the following research aims in an effort to gain substantial new insights into T cell-dependent mechanisms that drive inflammaging and that are regulated by miRNAs. We will also uniquely extend these analyses to young and older adults in efforts to translate our findings to humans. 1) Determine the functional roles of miR-155-induced GZMK+CD8+ T cells during inflammaging. 2) Determine the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying miR-155 functions in T cells during inflammaging. 3) Determine if Taa and Tfh cells and their miR-155 levels in older adults correlate with markers of chronic, low-grade inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. We anticipate that this work will unveil key cellular and molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating lifespan through their influence on T cell-mediated, age-dependent chronic inflammation. As a result, therapeutically actionable targets will emerge with the potential to limit age-associated human inflammatory diseases that continue to rapidly gain in prevalence in our society."

 Fungal infections are a significant public health problem because they can be
lethal in immunocompromised individuals. A major difficulty in treating these infections is
the small number of effective antifungal drugs. Existing treatments cause significant side
effects and frequently result in the appearance of resistant strains. The cell wall is an
essential organelle of a fungal cell and contains many fungal-specific components that
are potential targets for anti-fungal drugs. For example, one major class of antifungal
drugs targets a key enzyme in cell wall assembly. Therefore, understanding how the cell
wall is constructed is essential for identifying new targets for antifungal drugs. In the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the haploid genomes produced by meiosis
are encapsulated by a multi-layered spore wall, which allows spores to resist a variety of
environmental stresses. The inner layers of the spore wall are composed of mannan and
β-glucan, similar to the vegetative cell wall. The outer layers of the spore wall are
comprised of the polysaccharide chitosan, the polyphenol dityrosine and triglycerides.
These outer spore wall components are absent from vegetative cell walls and are
primarily responsible for the stress resistance of spores. The combination of (1)
chitosan, (2) a polyphenol, and (3) neutral lipids is a conserved structural module in
fungal cell walls, including those of pathogenic fungi. The budding yeast spore wall
therefore provides an excellent model system to study the construction and regulation of
this structural module. This grant is focused on how a conserved set of lipid-droplet
localized proteins regulates the assembly of this fungal cell wall structural module both in
S. cerevisiae and the pathogen Candida dubliniensis."

The goal of our research program is to innovate the strategy and methodology of organic synthesis and use
these innovations to solve problems of biological and medicinal importance and ultimately impact human
health. Our program focuses on the synthesis and study of both natural and unnatural molecules with potential
for the treatment of cancer, neurological disorders, and drug resistant infectious diseases. We view the
completion of a chemical synthesis as the beginning of a larger and deeper scholarly inquiry. It would enable
us to profile the biology of the selected natural products and rationally designed small molecules, decipher their
mechanism of actions, and optimize the lead compounds into biological probes and novel therapeutics. The
selected terpenoid and alkaloid natural products represent both the state-of-the-art challenges for complex
molecule synthesis as well as promising lead compounds for novel therapeutic development. Their structural
complexity, natural scarcity, and unknown mechanism of actions have significantly hampered their biomedical
development. We aim to fill this gap and move these molecules forward in the drug discovery pipeline with a
multi-faceted approach centered on innovative chemical synthesis. The expected outcomes of this research
will provide (i) new reactions and strategies in the toolbox of both medicinal chemists and synthetic chemists to
prepare functional molecules, (ii) a reliable access to the selected target molecules with therapeutic
importance, (iii) a collection of medicinally relevant molecules featuring structural novelty, complexity, and
diversity for further and larger biological evaluations in academic institutions and pharmaceutical industries,
and (iv) novel anticancer, anti-neurodegenerative and antimicrobial lead compounds with potentially novel
mode of actions for in vivo and clinical evaluations.

Estradiol (17βE), the primary female sex hormone used as supplementation therapy in post-menopausal aged 
women fails to improve cognitive function and is well known to increase the risk of stroke (ischemic reperfusion 
(IR) injury). Therefore, it is essential to understand cerebral vascular mechanisms in post-menopausal 
conditions to identify 17βE pathways that do not have adverse effects. Cerebral vessels exhibit myogenic 
reactivity, a property in which vessels contract with an increase in lumen pressure to maintain a constant CBF. 
This essential physiological function is mediated by the dynamic regulation of Ca2+-sensitive large-conductance 
K+ ion channel (BK). While BKα-subunit forms a pore, β1-subunit regulates BK channel function. Loss of BKβ1-
subunit function exaggerates myogenic response and vice versa. Recently, studies from our lab suggest that 
middle cerebral arteries (MCA) isolated from ovariectomized (OVX) rats exhibit exaggerated myogenic reactivity 
and decreased vasodilation due to the downregulation of BKβ1-subunit. However, the mechanism contributing 
to BKβ1 downregulation is not known, nor is the exact role of 17βE-mediated regulation of BKβ1. While the 
mechanism is suspected to occur via the Nrf2 (transcription factor) antioxidant pathway, more mechanistic study 
is needed. Based on this gap in knowledge, the central hypothesis is that “a decrease in 17βE-Nrf2- mediated 
transcriptome downregulates BKβ1-mediated vasodilation which increases susceptibility to ischemic reperfusion 
injury and results in vascular cognitive impairment.” Preliminary studies have shown that pharmacological 
inhibition and genetic deletion of Nrf2 in knock out (KO) rats disrupted 17βE-mediated up-regulation of BKβ1
and pharmacological activation of Nrf2 improved cognitive function in OVX rats. Nrf2KO rats also showed greater 
ischemic reperfusion (IR) induced infarct compared to control rats. Therefore, in aim 1, we will test the hypothesis 
that ""the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway plays a role in BKβ1 vasodilation"". In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that 
“loss of 17βE downregulates Nrf2, decreases BKβ1-mediated vasodilation resulting in cognitive impairment”.
Finally, aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that “loss of 17βE-Nrf2-BKβ1-mediated vasodilation exaggerates IR 
injury”. Together these studies will identify therapeutic targets to improve cognitive function in post-menopausal 
aged women and identify vascular mechanisms involved in cognitive impairment. The expertise and resources 
offered through the MCHD-COBRE will allow for a systematic evaluation of the Nrf2-BKβ1 pathway through 
acquiring genomic datasets, development and study of gene-edited cell-lines for mechanistic study of Nrf2, and 
validation through targeted proteomic analysis, to ultimately provide a molecular to whole animal understanding 
of the 17βE-Nrf2-BKβ1-pathway in vascular function."
11091805,"PROJECT SUMMARY: From 2019-2022, telehealth uptake in rural health clinics surged by 73%. This rapid acceleration
in telehealth uptake was driven by COVID-19 precautions, the permanent closure of rural hospitals, a massive shortage
of mental health professionals, and $1.5 billion in federal investment in broadband access. However, despite the
availability and investment in telehealth, many rural patients, especially rural older adults, lack the digital literacy
necessary to fully utilize it, exacerbating barriers to quality healthcare and hindering the potential benefits of telehealth
in expanding access to quality healthcare. Increasing rurality and older age are associated with lower digital literacy and
telehealth adoption, and rural older cancer survivors (ROCS) face compounded vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated
by the reduced access to mental health professionals in rural areas for ROCS experiencing cancer-related distress.
Cancer-related distress is stress and anxiety related to a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Telehealth providing support
for cancer-related distress is a promising strategy to expand care in rural areas with a shortage of mental health
professionals. Still, without interventions to address digital literacy, many ROCS will go without this critical care, thus
compromising their overall cancer outcomes. To this end, we developed CONNECT, a web-based toolkit targeting
digital literacy and mental health support for ROCS, employing a user-centered design approach and the Designing for
Dissemination and Sustainability logic model. CONNECT addresses digital literacy and supports for cancer-related
distress management through interactive activities for setting up telehealth visits, accessing educational materials about
cancer-related distress, and providing individualized mental health resource recommendations. Feedback from our pilot
usability study was positive, reporting high levels of acceptability and usability from users. Yet, additional comments
underscored the need to enhance the platform with opportunities to engage caregivers remotely but synchronously to
provide additional real-time digital literacy assistance. Building on this pilot, we propose to adapt CONNECT using a co-
design process to include recommendations from our pilot, namely, functions that permit synchronous communication
with a caregiver (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the
adapted CONNECT for improving cancer-related distress among ROCS. We will randomly assign ROCS-caregiver
dyads (N=274) to a CONNECT intervention group (N=134) or enhanced standard of care (n=134). Dyads in the
intervention group will receive usual care and engage with CONNECT. Participants in the enhanced standard of care
group will receive usual care and survivorship care and cancer-related distress literature. Our primary outcome is levels
of cancer-related distress. We will secondarily assess digital literacy and healthcare engagement, clinical care, and
existing social support networks every 4 months after enrollment for 12 months. In Aim 3, we will use exit interviews in
Aims 1 and 2 with a subsample of participants to examine outcomes related to implementation and potential
sustainability in the rural multi-level context. Completing these aims will inform future integration of CONNECT across
multiple healthcare systems for a multi-site scaled-up effectiveness RCT."
11091908,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Heterozygous mutations in Uromodulin (UMOD) cause autosomal-dominant tubulo-interstitial kidney disease
(ADTKD-UMOD) which results in chronic and end-stage renal disease, and so far no specific treatment is
available for these patients. In different murine and cell culture models, it has been found that UMOD mutations
impair UMOD protein trafficking. Misfolded UMOD accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in
apoptosis of the thick ascending limb (TAL) cells and renal fibrosis. We have established a cell culture-based
assay which monitors secretion dynamics of wild-type (WT) and human mutation C150S UMOD in culture
medium of stable cell lines expressing luciferase-tagged UMOD plasmids, thereby measuring a disease-relevant
endpoint. Our objective for this proposal is to identify and chemically optimize compounds that enhance the
secretion of retained mutant UMOD protein as a new therapeutic modality for treating ADTKD-UMOD. Our
hypothesis is that increasing secretion of retained, mutant UMOD protein will reduce cellular apoptosis, and will
mitigate chronic kidney disease in ADTKD-UMOD. In preliminary data, we screened 8,000 compounds of a
subset chemical library for enhancing the secretion of C150S UMOD. We identified five hits that increased C150S
UMOD secretion to at least 75% compared to WT UMOD, providing proof-of-concept for our approach. The
rationale of this project is to identify potent compounds accelerating secretion of different UMOD mutations using
a human kidney cell line to ameliorate ADTKD-UMOD. After screening our established canine C150S UMOD
expressing stable cell line against the optimized over 150,000 compounds containing UTSW chemical library,
we will counter-screen identified candidates against stably transfected human kidney cell lines expressing the
C150S and five other human UMOD mutations. All of these mutations affect one of 24 disulfide bridges, which
are involved in up to 60% of UMOD mutations. With this approach, we attempt to treat a maximum number of
patients. In aim 1, we will first optimize all plate-based secondary assays including a UMOD ELISA, an assay
testing for non-specific upregulation of the secretory pathway, a caspase 3/7 assay, and an assay for testing
different UMOD mutations. In aim 2, we will conduct a large phenotypic HTS of the over 150,000 compounds
containing UTSW chemical library and will confirm hits in triplicates. A subsequent cell toxicity assay will exclude
compounds resulting in false positive hits due to UMOD release caused by significant toxicity. Secondary assays
optimized in aim 1 will be performed to decrease the number of promising hits. In aim 3, the best candidates will
be tested in a primary cell culture model of the TAL from WT and a mutant Umod mouse model. We will test the
stimulatory effect of compounds on mutant UMOD secretion by studying current density of the calcium channel
TRPV5. SAR and chemical optimization of the best hits will be studied and tested in the assays outlined in aims
1 and 3. Finally, baseline pharmacology characteristics will be evaluated. Results from these experiments will
be significant as they may provide novel and innovative therapeutic options for ADTKD-UMOD patients."

The proposed Johns Hopkins University Baltimore-India Clinical Trials Unit (JHUBI CTU) will combine three
highly productive Clinical Research Sites (CRSs): the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CRS at the JHU School
of Medicine in Baltimore, the Byramji Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College-Johns Hopkins University
(BJGMC-JHU) CRS in Pune, India, and the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG
CARE) CRS in Chennai, India, committed to ending the HIV, TB and comorbidities epidemics. These sites
include the largest HIV care provider in Baltimore, the largest HIV and TB care and clinical research provider in
Pune, India, and the largest HIV prevention and treatment care and clinical research center in Chennai, India.
Two of these sites are currently affiliated with existing NIAID Networks (JHU site 201 and BJGMC-JHU site
31441), while YRG CARE is applying as a new site but has most of its staff and infrastructure that was
previously part of Network site 11701. All three of these sites have extensive, ongoing NIH-funded research
portfolios, and are affiliated with the Division of Infectious Diseases at the JHU School of Medicine in
Baltimore, which will serve as the CTU home. Over the past 25 years, these three sites have contributed
significantly to the science, populations, and management of studies sponsored by all of the existing DAIDS
Networks: 1) the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG); 2) the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS
Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT); 3) the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN); 4) the Microbicides Trials
Network (MTN); and 5) the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). Since December 2013, JHUBI CTU
investigators have led 10 ACTG, 7 IMPAACT, and 2 HPTN scientific and administrative committees; led 27
ACTG, 11 IMPAACT, 7 HPTN and 1 HVTN protocols; and authored 2,167 HIV, TB, hepatitis, and related
scientific publications, including 150 Network-related publications. In addition, the JHUBI CTU has enrolled and
followed 2,702 participants with >90% retention into ACTG, IMPAACT, and HPTN trials, and >30,000
participants into non-Network studies relevant to the next 7 years of DAIDS Network science. The JHUBI CTU
proposes to affiliate with all four DAIDS Networks: HIV Adult Therapeutics, Maternal Adolescent and Pediatric
Therapeutics, HIV Prevention, and HIV Vaccine. The JHUBI CTU will engage in the highest quality human

11093856,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disease that can severely curtail life
quality and expectancy. Depression and sleep disorders manifest decades before disease onset and may serve
as an important early biomarker. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exhibit
neurofibrillary changes in the early stages of AD, which may contribute to some of these early non-cognitive
symptoms. The goal of this application is to determine whether tau accumulation in 5-HT DRN neurons induces
depressive-like behaviors and disordered sleep, leading to chronic sleep disruption. These sleep deficits, in turn,
may promote hyperexcitability of 5-HT neurons and lead to neurodegeneration. The increased activity in 5-HT
neurons due to sleep deprivation also facilitates the spread of tau pathology to the entorhinal cortex (EC), another
region that is impacted early in the course of AD. Loss of 5-HT inputs from the DRN to the EC will disinhibit
neurons that project to the hippocampus, precipitating tau spread and the onset of cognitive and memory
problems. In Aim 1, we will use in vivo fiber photometry to measure neural activity in 5-HT neurons during tests
of depressive-like behavior in mouse models of tauopathy to see if the normal function of these neurons is
negatively impacted. We will also monitor 5-HT activity during sleep to see if that is altered by tau pathology. In
Aim 2, we will examine the effect of sleep deprivation on 5-HT neuronal excitability and the progression of tau
pathology in the brain using electrophysiology and 3D imaging. The role of increased neural activity in 5-HT
neurons on the spread of tau pathology will also be examined using chemogenetic manipulations of neural
activity. In Aim 3, we will determine whether tau-induced loss of 5-HT inputs to the EC alters 5-HT signaling in
principal neurons that project to the hippocampus. We will also establish a role for 5-HT/5-HT2A receptor signaling
in the spread of tau pathology to the hippocampus and the onset of cognitive deficits. In total, the proposed
research will provide essential information concerning the impact of tau pathology on early behavioral symptoms
of AD and the later development of cognitive and memory deficits."
11095080,"Project Summary
The United Nations estimates that more than 8 million Venezuelans have fled their home country since 2015.
At present, Venezuelans are among the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the United States (U.S), filing two
times the number of US. asylum applications annually as citizens from any other country. Remarkably, almost
no systematic research—excluding our formative work—has examined the wellbeing of Venezuelans in
diaspora. Although prior research has advanced our understanding of this population and its challenges, the
role of intrinsic and extrinsic strengths among Venezuelan crisis migrants during resettlement and over time, as
well as how such factors relate to mental health, thriving, and flourishing across countries remains unknown.
To address this critical research gap, the present diversity supplement is aimed to: Aim 1, use qualitative
research to examine underlying mechanisms of thriving and flourishing among adult Venezuelan crisis migrant
in the U.S. and Colombia. Aim 2, employ prospective surveys to understand how intrinsic and extrinsic
strengths promote thriving and flourishing, flourishing, and how they relate to stressors and behavioral health
during and after resettlement. Aim 3, engage with key stakeholders to disseminate our mixed-methods findings
in an effort to promote thriving and flourishing among Venezuelan crisis migrants.
The comparison with Venezuelans in Colombia is essential for identifying aspects of life in the US that may
uniquely contribute to both risk and well-being among crisis migrants, and for informing context-specific and
cross-national solutions to a hemispheric crisis. Grounded in cultural stress theory, a strengths perspective,
and positive epidemiology, we will examine the interplay between strengths and both pre-migration risk factors
and post-migration cultural stressors and how they influence behavioral health outcomes. In addition to
quantitative and qualitative analysis, this study will use a convergent mixed-methods design to compare
qualitative and quantitative data. We will collect quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously (in parallel),
and conduct the data analyses separately. We will compare the quantitative and qualitative results to produce
an integrated analysis and identify whether there was convergence or divergence between the results. Given
the ongoing large number of Venezuelans migrating, this work is particularly relevant and timely."
11091403,"Tinnitus, a chronic condition for which there is no “cure,” is the most common service-connected
disability at the Department of Veterans Affairs1. The functional effects of chronic tinnitus can vary widely,
ranging from being a mild nuisance to being completely disabling.2 Veterans who are negatively impacted by
tinnitus commonly report sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, and disruptive emotional reactions2. In
addition, Veterans with tinnitus also suffer from multiple comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, sleep
disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and suicidal ideation3-5. Although
some Veterans with tinnitus spontaneously develop their own unique coping strategies to reduce the impact of
tinnitus on their lives, others need a lot of support to improve quality of life and functional status, especially in
the context of other physical or mental health comorbidities.
 In our program of research on tinnitus among Veterans6,7, we have found that there are inconsistent
standards of tinnitus care in VA settings8. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to improve
quality of life and functional status with tinnitus9, however, many VA health care providers report being
unaware that the method can be used to assist people negatively impacted by tinnitus7. In contrast to the
relative difficulty finding providers who are knowledgeable about effective, evidence-based care for tinnitus,
patients find easy access to products (supplements, ear drops, untested devices, etc.) that falsely promise a
cure and are directly marketed, often via the internet, to people struggling with tinnitus. Trying multiple over-
the-counter products in hopes of finding a cure that does not exist often exacerbates anxiety and frustration in
Veterans with tinnitus, a vulnerable population already burdened with managing multiple co-morbid behavioral
health conditions. Past interviews with individuals with hearing loss and tinnitus has shown that peer
testimonials are important factors in Veterans' sense of hope about their future and in their willingness seeking
help for these conditions10. Thus, Veterans' stories about their challenges, decision-making processes,
experiences with seeking a cure, and experiences with trying various coping strategies in spite of the lack of a
cure could be leveraged as an invaluable source of wisdom, information, and support for their peers with
bothersome tinnitus who are struggling and seeking answers that are hard to find.
 The gold standard of rendering patient narratives on health conditions is called the “The Database of
Individual Patients' Experience” (DIPEx). DIPEx is rigorous, evidence-based methodology for eliciting rich
information on the health experiences of a broad range of patients with diverse chronic health conditions. The
specific aims of this mixed-method are to: (1) Use DIPEx methodology to document Veterans' experiences (n=
10-15) with bothersome tinnitus and rehabilitative services in relation to disability, function, and overall quality
of life; (2) Develop a prototype video module of Veterans' narratives on tinnitus; and (3) Evaluate of the
prototype to assess resonance and perceived value of Veteran narratives (e.g., impact on decision-making,
self-management, functioning, and quality of life) in Veterans with bothersome tinnitus (n=25).
 In Year 1, we will develop the DIPEx interview guide and identify and recruit a diverse sample 40
Veterans for interviews or to evaluate the prototype. The qualitative data obtained in Aim 1 will be used to
develop a prototype of a DIPEx module of Veterans' narratives. It will contribute to Aim 3, which is a survey
instrument, using think aloud methodology, to evaluate the DIPEx prototype. Protype development and
evaluation will be the focus of Year 2.
 This research will provide preliminary evidence on the impact of a narrative approach on functioning
and quality of life in Veterans with bothersome tinnitus, and the information gathered will be used inform the
development of a full DIPEx module (30-50 narratives) as part of a future Merit Review Award."

Residential segregation is the geographic separation of low income and historically marginalized individuals into
distinct environments. For many U.S. residents, residential segregation serves as both a reflection and
reinforcement of structural racism. Although residential segregation has been identified as a root cause of
disparities in the U.S., long-term consequences of residential segregation remain largely understudied, including
environmental and reproductive consequences such as the racist siting of hazardous industries (e.g., oil and gas
development [OGD] sites) and fertility (fecundability, the per-cycle probability of pregnancy). OGD activities are
rapidly expanding across North America and projected to continue through 2032, many of which are
disproportionately sited in marginalized or racially devalued communities. OGD activity also poses a significant
threat to reproductive health, which may be amplified in segregated neighborhoods (an environmental framework
known as “fossil fuel racism”). Epidemiologic research also indicates residential segregation influences health
outcomes across the reproductive continuum, which may be modified by environmental hazards given racialized
economic patterns of (dis)investment, however its impact on fecundability is not known. In this application, we
evaluate environmental and reproductive consequences of residential segregation during the preconception
period. We will use prospective cohort data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a North American
preconception cohort study, which is the largest and most diverse preconception cohort in existence (n>15,000
U.S. participants). PRESTO has remarkable geographic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, with participants
enrolled across all 50 U.S. states, and >20% of participants identify as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color
(BIPOC). Reproductive-aged couples are recruited and followed for up to 12 months or until pregnancy using
internet-based methods, and a wealth of data are collected that makes PRESTO uniquely suited to evaluate
complex influences of residential segregation. We will use these data to address the following aims: 1)
characterize exposure to residential segregation, 2) estimate the effect of residential segregation on the
prevalence of OGD sites in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 3) estimate the effect of residential segregation
on fecundability, including effect modification by OGD activity. This diversity supplement will also support Ms.
Sharonda Lovett’s training to build and strengthen skills to achieve her long-term career goal. Under the
mentorship of Dr. Mary Willis (an expert in geospatial exposure assessment, applied data science, and
environmental exposures), this diversity supplement will support Ms. Lovett (the candidate), develop expertise
in geospatial exposure assessment and environmental epidemiology, both of which are areas she has not had
formal training to date. The tailored career development plan involves coursework, intensive workshops, and
didactic experiences overseen by an interdisciplinary team with an excellent track record of collaboration and
mentoring to ensure that Ms. Lovett gains well-rounded training."
11093117,"Fear-related disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are often characterized by an
inability to inhibit and extinguish fear memories leading to pathological expression of fear-related behaviors.
For progress to occur with targeted rationally-designed therapeutic approaches, a greater understanding of
the neural circuitry mediating fear inhibition and extinction is needed. This proposal utilizes cutting-edge, cell-
type specific approaches targeting circuits that control amygdala fear inhibition and extinction, via medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) cell-type specific neural pathways, to align with
NIMH research priorities by cutting across RDoC domains in the NIH strategic plan for identifying the
pathophysiology of fear-related disorders.
 It is critical that we understand the role of specific cell types projecting to the amygdala supporting fear
inhibition and fear extinction learning. This Competitive Renewal expands our prior work dissecting function of
cell-type-specific mechanisms in the amygdala that differentially mediate fear and extinction. In addition to
other neuronal subtypes, our prior work dissected roles of the CRF and Thy1-specific neuronal populations
within the mouse Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) nuclei, demonstrating distinct molecular and physiological
functions underlying fear and extinction pathways. Here we aim to extend this work using a variety of
currently available intersectional circuit dissection tools, to understand the role of medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) projections in regulating amygdala CRF and Thy1 populations.
 We predict that this approach will identify novel pharmacological targets for fear inhibition and
extinction, pursuing new pathways for fear-related anxiety disorders. Our central hypothesis is that the
specific pathways within the mPFC and vHPC to BLA circuits, involving projections to fear-controlling
amygdala CRF- and Thy1-positive cells, contribute to the mechanisms of fear retention. Targeting
these specific pathways will provide greater understanding of fear inhibitory control. This hypothesis will be
tested through the following Specific Aims: 1) Explore the role of mPFC and vHPC projections to CRF and
Thy1 cells in amygdala in control of fear and extinction. 2) Identify activity patterns in mPFC and vHPC
neurons projecting to fear-controlling cells in amygdala using GCaMP miniscope and fiber photometry. 3)
Explore synaptic and network-level mechanisms of repeated stress-triggered fear renewal, focusing on mPFC
and vHPC projections to amygdala CRF and Thy1 positive neurons, respectively. 4) Perform cell type
specific RNA profiling of amygdala-projecting mPFC and vHPC neurons (both CRH/Thy1 targeted cells and
engram activity dependent cells) with and without chronic stress. The identification of novel targets will
advance our understanding of circuitry underlying fear behaviors and will provide unique avenues for
therapeutics."

Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) degrades both aberrant transcripts containing Premature Termination
Codons (PTCs) and “normal” transcripts with other specific features. Regulation by NMD is pervasive and
estimated to impact around 10% of the transcriptome. UPF3 is a central NMD factor that bridges the mRNA
bound Exon Junction Complex (EJC) with the rest of the NMD machinery and aids in PTC recognition. In
mammals, there are two paralogs of UPF3, UPF3A and UPF3B, that have been documented to have both distinct
biological roles and functions. We and others previously found that UPF3A can compensate for UPF3B in NMD,
but is a weaker activator; moreover, this difference in activity is conferred by the “mid” domain. Moreover,
overexpression of UPF3A, but not UPF3B stabilizes an NMD reporter mRNA. To understand the different
propensities of UPF3 paralogs to stimulate NMD, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass
spectrometry to identify their associated factors. In addition to EJC and NMD components, we identified
transcriptional regulators and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling factors to be among some of the most enriched factors
in UPF3A and UPF3B immunoprecipitation. We also identified members of the nuclear transcription regulating
Little/Super Elongation Complex (LEC/SEC); the LEC was previously identified as an NMD factor that promotes
UPF3B association with the EJC. UPF3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, but its nuclear functions are
unknown. For the K99 phase (Aim 1), I am investigating the impact of these nuclear functions on UPF3
deposition and NMD activity. I hypothesize that nuclear import is required for UPF3 function in NMD, and the
LEC/SEC mediate nuclear UPF3 deposition onto nascent mRNPs. I am also investigating the functional
differences between the UPF3 paralogs in human cells and in zebrafish development; I hypothesize that
differential nuclear deposition underlies some of the functional differences between UPF3A and UPF3B, and
their distinct roles in vivo arise from these functional, rather than expression differences. This supplement is to
help maintain research productivity of Aim 1 (K99 phase) of the parent grant after I return from maternity
leave to allow me to focus on key aspects of research training. In zebrafish, Upf3a was implicated in the
poorly characterized Genetic Compensation Response (GCR) via interaction with nuclear histone modifiers, and
we found that this interaction is conserved in human cells. For the R00 phase (Aim 2), I will characterize the
mechanism of GCR initiation from NMD-targeted mRNAs. This supplement will help facilitate a timely transition
to an independent position and the research proposed in Aim 2. Taken together, this work will deepen our
understanding of how events in the nucleus and cytoplasm are coordinated to regulate cytoplasmic mRNA decay
and its feedback to transcriptional regulation."
11096187,"Project Summary of the Funded Parent Award (1R01GM138800-01A1). Isoprenoids represent a
diverse class of compounds with a broad range of applications in medicine and industry. Their extraction
from natural sources is both challenging and potentially harmful to the environment, while the enormous
structural complexity of many isoprenoids makes traditional chemical synthesis nontrivial. Modern
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches have overcome some of these difficulties, but
issues related to metabolic flux and the limited availability of the universal isoprenoid precursors complicate
their widespread implementation. The artificial pathways developed thus far have been solely focused on
synthesizing dimethylallyl and isopentenyl diphosphates and require additional enzymes for the generation
of polyprenyl-diphosphates (polyprenyl-PPs). Thus, the primary objective of this proposal is to develop an
efficient strategy for the synthesis of both natural and unnatural (poly)prenyl-PPs for downstream
applications. This will be achieved using two complementary methods: i) employing undecaprenol kinases
and isopentenyl phosphate kinases; and ii) employing hydroxyethylthiazole kinase, isopentenyl phosphate
kinases, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Additionally, the two methods will work in conjunction with
isoprenoid methylatransferases to incorporate additional diversity into the polyprenyl-PPs. The proposed
studies include: i) structural and functional assessment of selected enzymes, ii) catalyst engineering, and
iii) optimization of coupled in vitro and in vivo platforms for the generation of diversified libraries of select
natural products. We expect these studies to generate: i) rules and concepts to advance knowledge on
structure-activity relationships in selected classes of enzymes; ii) an optimized, enzyme-coupled platform
to generate diversified substrates and isoprenoids; and iii) novel isoprenoid analogs with potential
therapeutic applications. Thus, the proposed work will offer unprecedented access to uniquely bioactive
isoprenoid libraries not readily accessible via traditional methods, and it stands to deepen our fundamental
understanding of four enzyme classes while also developing them into useful biocatalysts."

11097395,"Abstract
SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that adds small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) to
protein lysine residues. SUMOylation regulates many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, DNA repair,
and stress response. Deregulation of SUMOylation contributes to genome instability and cancer development.
Attachment of single SUMO to proteins often creates scaffolds to nucleate macromolecular interactions. On the
other hand, attachment of chains of SUMO (polySUMOylation) often triggers protein ubiquitination and extraction
from a macromolecular complex. Recent works demonstrate polySUMO-dependent relocation of damaged DNA,
which facilitates damage repair. However, the function of protein polySUMOylation and its regulation during cell
cycle remain poorly defined. Our long-term goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that control genome
stability to provide fundamental knowledge that will help develop treatment strategies for diseases resulting from
genome instability, such as cancer. The objective of this project is to investigate how polySUMOylation controls
the relocation of two key mitotic regulators during the cell cycle: the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and
telophase) critical for mitotic exit, and the CPC (chromosomal passenger complex), essential for chromosome
bipolar attachment. We recently found that polySUMOylation induction in yeast cells triggers relocation of these
two critical mitotic regulators. Our preliminary data support the central hypothesis that polySUMOylation
promotes relocation of some key mitotic regulators for successful anaphase initiation, and activation of polo-like
kinase triggers polySUMOylation by phosphorylating a deSUMOylase. Our objective will be attained via the
following specific aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of polySUMOylation-triggered nucleolar protein
delocalization that promotes mitotic exit. 2) Determine how polySUMOylation of CPC subunits promotes CPC
translocation. 3) Investigate the temporal control mechanism for polySUMOylation during the cell cycle. To test
our hypothesis and achieve our aims, we will combine budding yeast genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry.
Successful completion of this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of how polySUMOylation
controls subcellular localization of protein complexes in the context of cell cycle. Given the exceptional
conservation of both the SUMO system and the cell cycle machinery, principles proved in budding yeast are
highly likely to translate to human and other eukaryotes. The results will have an important positive impact on
the cell biology field because they will uncover new mechanisms critical for genome stability and unveil new
targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
11097780,"Project Summary
While the regulation of gene expression is well recognized as being important to human
disease, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the role of post-transcriptional
processes. Because post-transcriptional processes are critical for the regulation of
protein production, addressing this knowledge gap will facilitate better models of the
relationship between genotype and phenotype. Like transcription, mRNA translation is
regulated by cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors. upstream Open Reading
Frames (uORFs) are cis-acting regulatory element found in most human genes, and
some disease-linked mutations appear to alter the presence of uORFs. The primary
focus of my laboratory is to determine how cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors
control translation. Our goal for the next funding period is to determine the functions of
human uORFs and evaluate their regulation by trans-acting RNA binding proteins
(RBPs). To accomplish this, we have adapted our yeast Massively Parallel Reporter
Assays (MPRAs) for use in human tissue culture. In addition, our computational analysis
has identified thousands of primate-conserved human uORFs, many of which have
conserved RBP binding sites downstream of their start codons. The vast majority of
these uORFs have not been functionally studied. Our innovative approach combines
exquisite systems biology tools with cutting-edge computational modeling to investigate
the functions of these ubiquitous cis-regulatory elements. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to fundamentally advance our understanding of human
gene regulation."
11098931,"Abstract: DNA damage arises spontaneously from endogenous and exogenous sources and multiple DNA
repair pathways are required to identify and repair sites of damage. Failure to repair damage can result in cell
death or mutations. Somatic mutations accumulate as we age and result in a wide spectrum of diseases
including cancer. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DNA repair enzymes
function and identify the key biophysical and biochemical principles that are important for successful DNA
repair. A fundamental understanding of DNA repair enzymes is immensely valuable as it provides a framework
for understanding the relationships between genotype and phenotype, exposure-induced mutagenesis risks,
and in rationally improving treatments that directly or indirectly cause genotoxic stress, such as cancer therapy.
This proposal will focus on repair of the most abundant forms of DNA damage both because of the clear
biological importance, and because these are excellent model DNA repair systems to elucidate basic principles
that may be applied broadly to understanding many DNA repair pathways. We will primarily focus on human
enzymes because of the opportunities to immediately translate experimental findings in the context of specific
diseases and treatments. We take an interdisciplinary approach to combine different types of structural and
biophysical information and to integrate information across multiple time and size scales. This work builds upon
our core strength in transient kinetics with rigorous structure/activity analysis. Although the focus of this project
is in uncovering the fundamental biological mechanisms for DNA repair, we will combine forces with a diverse
set of collaborators who bring unique perspective and training that will allow us to pursue translational and
clinical aspects of DNA repair that pertain to specific disease contexts."

 Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles that change shape, size and abundance in response to
specific stimuli. Protein interactions that control mitochondrial division are tightly regulated and directly impact
ATP production, Ca2+ homeostasis, and regulation of programmed cell death. Therefore, mitochondrial
dynamics has recently come to the forefront as a therapeutic target in several degenerative diseases, including
neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. But the lack of insight into the regulation of this
process is a major limitation. The major driver of mitochondrial division is a cytosolic GTPase, dynamin-related
protein 1 (Drp1). To mediate membrane scission, Drp1 recruitment and self-assembly is coordinated through
combinatorial interactions with lipids, proteins and nucleotides at the surface of mitochondria. This proposal
seeks to identify key attributes of the mitochondrial division machinery and how dysregulation of Drp1 leads to
organelle damage and cellular degeneration. This will be accomplished using a multifaceted approach that
combines molecular studies with functional cell experiments to provide a comprehensive evaluation of Drp1
interactions that govern membrane remodeling. Under Specific Aim 1 of the renewal, cryo-EM studies will
examine auto-inhibitory interactions that limit Drp1 oligomerization in a cytosolic state. Distinct conformations
will be studied to identify and characterize intermediate structures during recruitment and assembly of Drp1
into a functional fission complex. We propose that regulated rearrangements “open” the molecule for functional
assembly at defined sites of mitochondrial division. For Specific Aim 2, reconstitution experiments provide a
means to evaluate macromolecular interactions that drive mitochondrial membrane remodeling. Specific
mitochondrial cues, including lipids and partner proteins, will be studied to evaluate the contribution of each
component to membrane remodeling. Constriction of protein-lipid tubules will be encouraged to evaluate the
magnitude of constriction using advanced structural methods. Liquid-EM will visualize dynamic narrowing of
Drp1-lipid tubules in real time, and cryo-ET will be used to resolve 3D structures of assorted Drp1 constriction
events in parallel. In Specific Aim 3, defects in mitochondrial fission will be examined at the cellular level to
establish how deleterious changes in Drp1 can directly influence mitochondrial bioenergetics. The integrity of
ETC complexes will be studied to reveal how altered organelle morphology informs metabolic stress.
Concurrently, the impact of this stress on ROS signaling and mitophagy will be monitored. In summary, the
structural and functional insight gained from this proposal will catalyze directed therapeutic strategies that
counteract mitochondrial damage in various disease states."

 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical reactions for the synthesis of compounds that could be used
as medicines. We will build upon our expertise in the synthesis of cyclic peroxides, a family of natural products
that exhibit a broad range of biological activities, suggesting their application to the treatment of malaria, cancer,
and viral and bacterial infections. During the proposed funding period, we will investigate our hypothesis that
initiation of ferroptosis is a general property of cyclic peroxides, and we will optimize the potency and metabolic
stability of FINO2, a cyclic peroxide we developed that initiates cell death by a new mechanism. The target of
FINO2 is unknown so we will study the mechanism by which cyclic peroxides like FINO2 initiate programmed cell
death, in collaboration with Professor Brent Stockwell (Columbia University). We will also develop new methods
for the synthesis of the cyclic peroxide structural motif found in many naturally occurring peroxides. We will also
investigate the synthesis of aromatic peroxides, a structural class whose synthesis and reactivity have not been
addressed. In the proposed funding period, we will also extend our investigations of mechanisms of acetal
substitution reactions, which are important methods in natural product synthesis and carbohydrate chemistry.
Using systematic studies of model systems, we can identify the factors that contribute to the stability and
reactivity of oxocarbenium ions, which are intermediates involved in many of the reactions of carbohydrates,
including enzymatic reactions. We will determine how the carboxyl group in sugars such as sialic acids influence
the stereoselectivity of reactions involving these sugars. We will demonstrate remote neighboring-group
participation as a means of controlling stereoselectivity in cyclic and acyclic compounds. The proposed research
is innovative because it addresses structural types and reactive intermediates that have received little attention
in the literature. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to new pathways for making biologically
active compounds and will provide deeper mechanistic understanding of chemical and biological processes.
These studies are relevant to human health because they could result in drugs that kill cells by unique pathways,
leading to new treatments for various diseases. Furthermore, the mechanistic understanding of intermediates
involved in reactions of carbohydrates could lead to new ways of designing enzyme inhibitors."

The knowledge of the function, types, distributions, and plasticity of afferent neurites innervating
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tissues is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the
development of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) pain. The objective of this proposal is to address this
critical gap in knowledge by comprehensively elucidating the functions, types, neuroanatomical distributions,
and plasticity of trigeminal (TG) neurons innervating the muscles, tendons, and fascia of the masseter (MM)
and lateral pterygoid (LPM) muscles, as well as the cartilage, joint capsule, and ligament around TMJ condyle
in male, female and aged mice, primates, and humans with and without TMJD pain conditions. In support of
this proposal, we have demonstrated that TMJ tissues are innervated by trigeminal (TG) neurons with unique
and distinct properties, distributions and molecular signatures compared to previously described TG and dorsal
root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Based on supporting data and the expertise of our multi-disciplinary team, we
anticipate that this project will map the location and elucidate the phenotype and plasticity for TG neurons
innervating TMJ tissues in male, female, and aged mice, primates and humans with and without TMJD pain
conditions. We also expect candidate therapeutic target identification in TMJD patients’ TMJ tissues, which
could ultimately lead to possible new treatments for TMJD. This study will be conducted in four interconnected
yet independent aims. Aim 1 identifies the molecular signature, function and plasticity of TG neurons
innervating TMJ tissues in male, female and aged mice with and without TMJD. Aim 2 maps afferent neurites
innervating TMJ tissues in mice with and without TMJD. Aim 3 maps the location of neurites and define the
phenotype and plasticity of TG neurons innervating TMJ tissues in non-human primates (NHP) with and
without TMJD. Aim 4 examines TMJ tissue nerves and cell plasticity in TMJD patients. Substantial amount of
data generated by this work will have a substantial positive impact by achieving most objectives of the RE-
JOIN program, including (1) mapping the location of the afferent neurites in TMJ tissues; (2) phenotyping and
functionally characterizing TG neurons innervating a variety of TMJ tissues; (3) identifying TMJD-induced
plasticity of these TG neurons in male, female and aged mice, primates and humans; (4) identifying novel
candidate therapeutic targets in biopsies from TMJD patients; and (5) increasing study translatability by
validating data from TMJD mouse models in primate and human tissues. The proposed experiments will create
large, integrated, annotated datasets and metadata and develop advanced approaches, which will be shared
with the research community conducting similar studies."
11091920,"Contributions of Genetics and DNAm to Phenotypes, Severity & Treatment Response in Urban Children
Aim 1. To utilize the novel Asthma&Allergy Array to identify DNAm patterns in blood that link genetics and
environmental exposures to the expression of asthma phenotypes in urban children in the APIC study.
Rationale: Epigenetic analyses provide a critical link between genetics and environmental exposures in the
expression of disease. DNAm is the most common epigenetic mark and methylation levels at CpG sites are
influenced by exposures (environment), genetic variation, or both. Importantly, DNAm can mediate the effects of
both genetic and environmental risk factors on health outcomes. Carole Ober and colleagues developed the novel
Asthma&Allergy array through a study of nasal epithelium from URECA and Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST)
birth cohort participants. Assessment of DNAm in blood, nasal brush, and sputum samples from the Asthma
Phenotypes in the Inner City (APIC) study holds great potential to identify potential mechanisms by which various
environmental exposures (microbial, allergens, pollutants, etc) contribute to the expression of various respiratory
phenotypes such as difficult vs. easy to control asthma and the APIC phenotypes described by Zoratti et al. This
provides a unique opportunity to explore how epigenetic patterns are differentially related to asthma phenotypes
(such as the T2-low cluster B). By including the nasal and sputum samples, which are available for a subset of the
population, we can compare and contrast these relationships across compartments (blood, upper and lower airway).
Preliminary Data: Using an empirical Bayes approach to factor analysis and the Asthma&Allergy DNAm array, we
recently defined in children three factors comprised of between 6,188 and 659 CpGs from nasal brush samples that
are associated with allergic phenotypes in URECA. The genes that are correlated with these DNAm-defined factors
are significantly enriched in networks downstream of IFNG and IRF9 (factor 5), SEPTIN1 and BBS1 (factor 9), and
TSLP, IL4, IL13, and STAT3 (factor 16). Based on the direction of gene effects in these networks, the factor 5 genes
suggest “impaired microbial response”, the factor 8 genes suggest “impaired barrier function”, and the factor 16
genes suggest “activated T2 immune response”.
Study Design: In this study, we propose to use the Asthma&Allergy array to analyze DNAm in blood samples from
more than 500 APIC children. Additionally, we will analyze DNAm in sputum and nasal brush samples from a subset
of these children. We will then assess patterns of DNAm and their association to asthma phenotypes and severity,
as well as environmental exposures assessed in APIC. Further, we can integrate this data with the whole genome
sequencing previously performed to assess meQTLs and understand the role of genetic variation in DNAm patterns.
Anticipated Results & Interpretation: We anticipate that we will identify DNAm patterns that mediate the contributions
of genetics and environmental exposures to the expression of respiratory phenotypes and asthma severity in urban
children in APIC.
Aim 2. To genotype urban children in the ACE, ICATA and PROSE clinical trials, inadequately represented in
genetic studies of asthma to date, in order to assess contributions of genetics to disease severity and treatment
response.
Rationale. While large GWAS studies have been performed in asthma, black and Hispanic participants have been
woefully underrepresented in these studies. We have previously genotyped APIC, URECA, MUPPITS-1, and
MUPPITS-2. We have stored DNA available from the ACE, ICATA and PROSE clinical trials. Generating genotype
data from these prior studies is a unique opportunity to further address the underrepresentation of these children in
GWAS studies of asthma. Further, it will provide the opportunity to examine many important questions, such as the
impact of genotype on biologic treatment response (omalizumab) the relationships between genotype and disease
severity across ICAC studies. and gene by environment interactions.
Preliminary data and Experimental Design. Genotyping of the APIC and URECA studies has led to multiple
publications. Analyses are ongoing of the recently generated MUPPITS-1 and -2 genotype data.
We will use the same Illumina genotyping array that was employed for the genotyping of MUPPITS-1 and -2.
Anticipated results and interpretation. We anticipate that we will identify SNPs and polygenic risk scores associated
with the expression of asthma phenotypes, therapeutic responses, and interacting with environmental exposures
important in urban environments."

The purpose for Mandatory Core Component A is to support an Enhanced Surveillance Network of US
pediatric institutions to develop and implement standard research protocols to conduct prospective active
population-based surveillance in defined inpatient and emergency department (ED) settings for a) acute
gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus, rotavirus and other enteric pathogens, b) acute respiratory infection
(ARI) due to respiratory viruses including influenza, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus,
rhinoviruses, enteroviruses (including EV-D68), adenoviruses, coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and
other respiratory viruses, c) and healthy controls (HC) and d) Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) syndrome among
pediatric patients seeking healthcare at these pediatric medical institutions. The results from this program will
be used to inform vaccine recommendations and assess the public health impact of the US rotavirus, influenza
and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs and provide epidemiologic data for other infectious diseases with
therapeutics and vaccines in development. There are two objectives for Mandatory Core Component A::
For Objective 1 we will conduct population-based active surveillance for respiratory and enteric viral pathogens
in pediatric inpatient and ED settings and enroll asymptomatic healthy controls in Hamilton Co. children <18
years of age. Through our already established ARI, AGE and HC Surveillance Platforms we will 1) perform
active surveillance to determine the etiology and burden of inpatient and ED acute viral enteric and respiratory
diseases in our defined population, 2) characterize the clinical and epidemiologic factors of infections including
asymptomatic children and 3) evaluate VE and impact of vaccines and other interventions available or projected
to become available during the study agreement period for rotavirus and influenza vaccines using a test-
negative design and for RSV and SARS-CoV-2, when available and recommended for children and
adolescents. For Objective 2 we will conduct surveillance activities for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM in
hospitalized children <18 years of age). Through our already established AFM Surveillance Platform, we will 1)
define baseline rates of AFM in our pediatric institution through active case finding in collaboration with our
Neurology and Neuroradiology Co-Investigators using the CDC's case definition for patients meeting the clinical
criterion for AFM and a spinal MRI showing at least some gray matter involvement by conducting active
surveillance and establishing incident rates for AFM among hospitalized children within our catchment area, 2)
compare rates of AFM to rates of circulating respiratory and enteric pathogens at our site from our population-
based active surveillance program and 3) characterize the clinical spectrum of pediatric AFM and compare with
the clinical spectrum seen with other similar neurologic conditions."
10917009,"Component A: Project Summary
Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) aims to continue inpatient and emergency department surveillance as part
of the larger national New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) to assess the burden of pediatric
respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses and acute flaccid myelitis in hospitalized children and children
seeking care in the emergency department. Specifically, we will operate year-round surveillance to assess
the burden of multiple viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, including but not limited to SARS-CoV-2,
influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and
emerging respiratory pathogens, such as enterovirus D68. A concurrent group of healthy, asymptomatic children
presenting to Texas Children’s Pediatric practices for well child care will be enrolled as a control group. Nose
and/or throat swabs will be collected from symptomatic and healthy control children and tested for a wide array
of respiratory pathogens using molecular methods in the laboratory of Dr. Pedro Piedra, a national expert in
pediatric respiratory disease. In addition, we will assess the burden of gastrointestinal pathogens such as
rotavirus and norovirus. Stool specimens from symptomatic patients and healthy control children will undergo
molecular testing in the labs of Dr. Robert Atmar and Dr. Sasirekha Ramani at Baylor College of Medicine.
Complete vaccination histories will be obtained for all children based on our well-established process for
gathering vaccination histories. We will calculate baseline and population-based rates of respiratory and enteric
pathogens among hospitalized and ED patients. Using a test negative study design, we will calculate vaccine
effectiveness for vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, rotavirus and SARS-CoV-2, comparing
symptomatic patients who test positive for a pathogen of interest to symptomatic patients and asymptomatic,
healthy controls who test negative for the specific pathogen. Importantly, TCH is an exemplary surveillance
site due the large number of admissions each year (>36,000), racial and ethnic diversity of the Houston
area, and the similarity of the TCH population to that of the community. Given the large number of
admissions per year and depth of local neurologic expertise, TCH represents the ideal site for conducting year-
round surveillance for children with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) and comparing rates of AFM with rates of
circulating respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens."
11094302,"Project Summary
Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor and the major acyl group carrier in mammalian cells. CoA plays a
central and regulatory role in energy metabolism, as its acyl-CoA derivatives are substrates for hundreds of
metabolic reactions and the posttranslational modification of histones and key metabolic enzymes. CoA-
dependent processes occur in multiple subcellular compartments, and major pools of CoA are found in the
mitochondria, peroxisomes and cytosol. At the whole tissue level, the concentration of CoA is tightly regulated
and dynamically adjusted to changes in the metabolic state. The importance of such a tight control over CoA
levels is underscored by the fact that genetic manipulations that force the concentration of CoA outside of its
homeostatic range result in loss of metabolic regulation and organ function. For example, the inability to increase
CoA levels during a fast blunts fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis in the liver, causing fasting
hypoglycemia. On the other hand, an abnormally high concentration of CoA in skeletal muscle is associated with
decreased muscle mass, ATP levels and exercise performance, highlighting the importance of mechanisms that
prevent the accumulation of this cofactor to toxic levels. The concentration of CoA is regulated by balancing its
synthesis and degradation. The process of CoA degradation is poorly characterized. Furthermore, the
mechanisms that regulate the different subcellular CoA pools are incompletely understood. During the previous
funding cycle, we have characterized the biochemical and regulatory properties of two CoA-degrading enzymes,
NUDT7 and NUDT19, which reside in liver and kidney peroxisomes, respectively. Our published and unpublished
observations support the conclusion that these enzymes regulate peroxisomal lipid metabolism. Furthermore,
deletion of Nudt19 leads to the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA in the kidneys, suggesting a
connection to cholesterol synthesis. We also identified the first mammalian CoA-degrading enzyme, NUDT8,
which resides in the mitochondria, and we have recently generated Nudt8-/- mice. The existence of CoA-
degrading enzymes in both peroxisomes and mitochondria suggests that these enzymes contribute to the
regulation of the CoA pools within these organelles. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand
the mechanisms that regulate tissue CoA levels and to harness them to manipulate the metabolic network for
the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders. To move toward this goal, we propose to 1) determine the
mechanisms through which NUDT19 regulates kidney lipid metabolism and kidney function and 2) determine
the role played by NUDT8 in the regulation of the mitochondrial CoA pool and mitochondrial metabolism. This
research program will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the peroxisomal and
mitochondrial CoA pools. Furthermore, identifying the processes regulated by each CoA-degrading enzyme will
aid in the development of strategies to target and correct specific CoA-dependent pathways in metabolic
disorders."

The escalating prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) presents a critical cardiovascular challenge. Individuals with cardiometabolic disease harbor greater
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including accelerated vascular aging and premature atherosclerotic
disease. Importantly, alterations in endothelial function predate the development of clinical CVD, making the
vascular endothelium an important potential target for cardioprotection. Experimental studies and our prior
work link altered metabolism to organelle stress including mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that organelle stress induced by cardiometabolic traits drives vascular dysfunction
and promotes CVD. We will leverage the unique resources of the planned Framingham Heart Study fourth
examination cycle to prospectively collect fresh human endothelial cells (EC) from 2000 individuals. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the association of T2DM and cardiometabolic traits with EC phenotype including organelle
stress and nitric oxide signaling in a nested case-control sample of 450 individuals. In Aim 2, we will measure
EC gene expression levels using RNA sequencing in 900 participants to identify and prioritize EC
transcriptional programs linked to EC health phenotypes, cardiometabolic traits, and systemic metabolism. This
proposal leverages a unique and highly experienced multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in
obesity-related cardiovascular disease, endothelial biology, population science, translational patient-oriented
research, multi-omics and bioinformatics. The proposed work will dwarf past efforts at defining endothelial
health across disease states and will combine new deep phenotyping of EC conducted at scale in a
community-based cohort with existing rigorous measures of cardiovascular health including metabolite profiles
and genomic markers. These studies have the potential to provide important insights into mechanisms driving
endothelial dysfunction and develop an unprecedented resource that will benefit vascular biology research."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a global public health crisis, with an estimated 1 0 million deaths per
year expected by 2050 without significant public health intervention and the development of new classes of
antibiotics. Towards combating this crisis, the parent grant funding of this supplement proposal has facilitated
the development of GmPcides, a novel class of synthetic antibiotics that target a wide range of Gram-positive
pathogens including vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), erythromycin and clindamycin-resistant
streptococci, methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-insensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, VISA;
respectively). Second generation GmPcides, including the lead compound PS757, have bactericidal activity
against stationary phase VRE as well as both exponential and stationary phase MRSA and have shown synergy
when combined with several classes of existing antibiotics. Further optimization of GmPcides have led to fourth
generation compounds with an sp3-rich 2-pyridone core with dramatically improved compound solubility with
equal or greater potency against VRE and MRSA than PS757. Treatment with lead 4th generation compounds
has also been shown to reduce ulcer size and time to healing in a murine skin and soft tissue infection model.
While resistance mutants can be selected against second generation compounds, repeated attempts to generate
resistance against fourth generation sp3-rich 2-pyridone GmPcides have proven unsuccessful. While good for
prospects of clinical efficacy, the lack of detectable resistance mutants has complicated identification of the
cellular targets of 4th generation compounds, which may be essential and difficult to assess with standard
approaches. This proposal will elucidate essential targets in MRSA of GmPcides in vitro and virulence
determinants that are important for survival to GmPcide challenge in the murine SSTI model. Understanding the
molecular interactions between GmPcides and their essential targets in vitro and during in vivo infection will allow
for further refinement of 4th generation GmPcides that improve their clinical effectiveness."

At last count, sepsis was reported to be the leading cause of death in U.S hospital intensive care units (ICU);
accounting for ~1 in 5 deaths world-wide; its incidence is anticipated to rise as the populations in developed
countries age; and it was the consensus cause of death assigned to those dying from COVID-19 infection.
Most frustrating, is that while we continue to optimize the supportive care for these critically ill patients, we
have yet to see a novel molecular etiology-based therapy make a sustained impact on overall septic
morbidity/ mortality. Excitingly, while working for years on defining numerous defects of components of both
adaptive and innate immune responsiveness induced by shock and/or sepsis, we have uncovered novel
role(s) for a number of the B7-family of cell-associated co-inhibitory receptors, Programmed Cell Death
Receptor-1 [PD-1], B-/T Lymphocyte Attenuator [BTLA], recently, V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T
cell Activation [VISTA, a.k.a., B7-H5, PD-1H] and their respective cell surface ligands; popularly referred to
as checkpoint proteins. In this competitive renewal of our MIRA program, we propose to continue to push
forward the 3 project areas we brought together previously under the over-arching concept that by
understanding the mechanism(s) of injury/shock and/or sepsis that serve to predispose animals
(experimentally) or critically ill/injured patients to develop morbid outcomes, we can elucidate not
only novel prognostic markers of patient's course but uncover unique therapeutic targets for their
treatment. In the 1st Project area, we will determine how the select expression of PD-1, BTLA or VISTA, on
myeloid as opposed to lymphoid cells alters the development of morbid events associated with sepsis; then,
how the expression of ligands for these co-inhibitory molecules, on leukocytes and/or endothelial/epithelial
cells, contribute to the onset of septic liver, intestine and/or kidney dysfunction. In our 2nd Project area, we
will utilize a novel murine model of indirect-acute lung injury (iALI)(dual insults of hemorrhage shock followed
by cecal ligation & puncture [CLP]) to ask how checkpoint protein expression not only effect the patho-
mechanisms driving the development of iALI, but how are these co-inhibitors alter cell `priming'/'innate
immune memory'/function by following pulmonary immune/non-immune cell transcriptomic/ epigenomic
fate/programing. Finally, (3rd Project) since the neonate possesses a unique/naïve immune system and is
more susceptible to morbid response in the face of infectious challenge; we ask how the expression of
members of the B-7 family of proteins and/or their ligands not only have a comparative impact on the
response to septic insult, but how this alters their microbiota and epigenetic makeup/immune function as
survivors mature? To do this we will interrogate these 3 cogent models of sepsis, shock/sepsis and/or
neonatal sepsis, by applying a combination genetic/Cre-Lox mouse models, adoptive transfer, single cell
RNA-seq/ATACseq, 16S microbiota RNA-seq and bisulfite/pyrosequencing to examine these hypotheses
along with select observational clinical studies in the critical ill patient population."

Telomeres, the physical ends of linear chromosomes, are composed of short repeating sequences (TTGGGG in
the G-strand for Tetrahymena thermophila and TTAGGG in human) of double-strand DNA with a single-strand
3′ overhang of the G-strand and, in humans, six proteins collectively called shelterin. Of these, TPP1–POT1
associate with the 3′ overhang, where POT1 binds the G-strand and TPP1 functions to recruit telomerase via
interaction with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The telomere DNA 3’-ends are replicated and
maintained by telomerase, for the G-strand and subsequently DNA polymerase α–primase (PolαPrim) in
complex with CTC1–STN1–TEN1 (CST), for the C-strand. In Tetrahymena, orthologous proteins p50 (TPP1),
Teb1 (POT1), and CST are constitutively associated with telomerase. Mutations that affect their activity or
regulation have profound effects on human health. Recent cryoEM structures and other studies on Tetrahymena
and human telomerase and these interacting partners set the stage for our goals to illuminate the detailed
mechanism and regulation of G-strand and C-strand synthesis at telomeres. Our focus will be on two broad
aspects of human and Tetrahymena telomerase and telomere structural biology: (A) telomerase mechanism,
assembly, and disease and (B) C-strand synthesis by CST–PolαPrim. Our research approach will primarily
involve complementary applications of cryoEM and NMR spectroscopy along with rigorous biochemistry and

and mechanisms while also providing an evolutionary perspective for divergent organisms. Additionally, (C) we
will extend from single particle cryoEM to cryoET to visualize telomerase at telomeres in situ."

The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90) is essential for the folding and
activity of an array of `client' proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. They are
also responsible for many maladies including cancer, neurodegenerative, autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases. Hsp90 inhibition strategies are currently being explored in
these diseases in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, however the optimal use of
Hsp90-targeted therapeutics remains unknown. This is partly due to our limited
knowledge of Hsp90 regulation in cells. Unraveling the detailed regulatory mechanisms
of Hsp90 function in cells can provide new strategies to increase the cellular potency of
Hsp90 inhibitors. Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ATPase activity, which is
regulated by co-chaperones and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, it is
unclear how these regulatory components work together to fine tune Hsp90 function and
also contribute towards drug sensitivity. During the past five years we have made major
contributions towards the understanding of Hsp90 regulation by co-chaperones and
PTMs. i) New co-chaperones: We have identified three new co-chaperones, FNIP1, 2
(collectively FNIPs) and Tsc1, that decelerate the chaperone cycle and facilitate chaper-
oning of both kinase and non-kinase clients. They are regulated by PTMs (phosphoryla-
tion, O-GlcNAcylation, SUMOlyation and ubiquitination). Their expression also enhances
Hsp90 binding to drugs and consequently sensitizes cells to Hsp90 inhibitors. ii) Post-
translational modification of Hsp90: Our work during the past decade on Hsp90 PTMs
has redefined the regulation of its chaperone activity and revealed the reciprocal regula-
tory mechanisms between client proteins, co-chaperones, and Hsp90. We have recently
shown that loss of TSC1 co-chaperone leads to hypoacetylation of Hsp90 and elevated
its ATPase activity. It also subsequently decreased Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Our
long-term goal is to unravel the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 chaperone regulation in
cells and regulatory factors enhancing cellular potency of Hsp90 inhibitors. Our strategy
is to use biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays to decipher the interconnectivi-
ty and compensatory mechanisms between the co-chaperones and PTMs. Our vision is
to utilize this information to dissect the intricate network of regulatory signals involved in
fine tuning Hsp90 function and their impact towards cellular sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibi-
tors."

Nuclear DNA is packaged into nucleosomes by histone proteins to create chromatin.
The assembly of chromatin is not a passive process but requires the activity of a
network of histone-chaperone proteins that facilitate histone stability, prevent
aggregation, organize histone transport and facilitate their deposition. Histone
chaperones must deal with new histones, and also with pre-existing histones that
are evicted from chromatin. DNA replication, DNA transcription and access to other
control elements in the genome require nucleosomes be either moved out of the way
(slid) or removed, resulting in the eviction of pre-existing histones. Specific chaperones
contribute to the selective timing and placement of histone H3 variant deposition.
However, many histone chaperones are agnostic about the variant or modification
status of the histones they bind. Very little information exists as to how the chaperone
pathways for new and pre-existing histone differ. NASP has long been appreciated as a
key histone chaperone for histone H3 and histone H4, that functions irrespective of
histone variant or posttranslational modification. NASP also binds the histone
acetyltransferase enzyme HAT1 which contribute to the acetylation of new H4
histones at K12. Aim1 of this application will define novel interactions of NASP during
DNA synthesis that contribute to new histone supply. Our work will also take an
unbiased approach to ordering the process of histone-chaperone interaction during
new histone deposition and histone eviction. A novel chaperone pathway for pre-
existing nucleosomes that have been evicted from chromatin will be defined in aim 2 of
the proposal. Finally, Aim 3 will define a novel mechanism for crosstalk between
histone supply and nucleotide metabolism. Our work proposed in this application will
define, for the first time, differential processes that regulate fate of new and pre-existing
histones and provide a new paradigm for coordinated metabolic control."

In the past 40 years, the prevalence of obesity has increased at an alarming rate. Even modest weight loss of
at least 5% improves clinical parameters and quality of life. Efficacious behavioral weight loss programs teach
participants behavioral strategies to create and maintain a caloric deficit. The two strongest predictors of long-
term weight loss in such programs are initial weight loss and dietary self-monitoring. Over time, these
phenomena decline, limiting program effectiveness. Financial incentives to increase initial weight loss and self-
monitoring are appealing because they can be delivered to large populations with relative ease and at low cost.
Employers and payers have begun to provide financial incentives for health behaviors and outcomes despite
an inadequate evidence base to inform the optimal design of such interventions. The proposed study will
evaluate which incentive approach has the greatest impact and durability—incentivizing interim weight loss,
dietary self-monitoring, or both. Studies testing the effects of incentivizing these phenomena have showed
some promise for increasing short-term weight loss. Few studies have evaluated incentive effects on long-term
weight loss; examined the mediating role of intrinsic or extrinsic motivation; or calculated program costs or
cost-effectiveness of financial incentive interventions. In the proposed two-site, randomized, single-blinded,
longitudinal 2x2 factorial study, known as “Log2Lose,” we address these limitations by evaluating the individual
and joint effects of incentivizing, in near real-time, weekly weight loss and dietary self-monitoring on 6-month
weight loss and subsequent weight loss maintenance. People with obesity from the communities of Madison,
WI and Durham, NC will receive an 18-month intervention comprising: 1. An incentivized weight loss program
for 6 months (Phase I), 2. An incentivized weight maintenance program for 6 months (Phase II), and 3. A non-
incentivized weight maintenance program for 6 months (Phase III). Participants will be randomized to receive
adjunctive incentives for weekly weight loss, dietary self-monitoring, both, or neither. We will measure the
proportion of participants achieving clinically significant weight loss of ≥5% at 6 (primary endpoint), 12, and 18
months. We will assess whether extrinsic and intrinsic motivation mediate intervention effect; calculate
intervention costs; and calculate cost-effectiveness ratios across the four study arms. Our financial incentives
intervention was designed to be scalable by using available technology and automating the process of
analyzing data to provide incentives in near real-time. The intervention could be paired with various weight loss
interventions offered by clinicians or payers, or integrated into a variety of patient and consumer-facing
technologies. Completion of this study will contribute to our long-term goal of identifying and implementing
efficacious, cost-effective, scalable approaches to reduce the prevalence of obesity and associated health
outcomes."

Monocytes and macrophages function in diverse processes, from homeostatic
maintenance to immune responses and tissue regeneration. These functions are
coordinated with and strongly influenced by cellular metabolism via mechanisms that are
increasingly studied and characterized in populations of macrophages. However, such
studies mask the cell-to-cell variation which is an inherent property of macrophage
diversity. Indeed, single-cell transcriptomics data have demonstrated that macrophage
polarization is better described by continuous gradients rather than by discrete states
amenable to isolation and population analysis. Yet, transcriptional measurements are
insufficient to characterize the metabolic and protein networks that shape monocyte and
macrophage diversity. To understand how these networks control macrophage
polarization and functions, we propose to directly quantify proteins and regulatory signals
(such as localization of key regulators, e.g., NF-κB) in primary human monocytes and
macrophages responding to physiologically relevant metabolic environments.
Furthermore, we will extend this single-cell analysis to the responses of these cells to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns.
These data will enable us to identify likely regulatory networks driving monocyte and
macrophage responses to metabolic states and molecular patterns. Subsequently, we
will test these networks via pharmacological and genetic perturbations. We are uniquely
positioned to perform this research since we recently pioneered methods for quantifying
thousands of proteins across many single cells. Furthermore, we have the required
expertise in analyzing metabolic systems (including aerobic glycolysis, which is frequently
associated with macrophage activation) and developing new algorithms for data
analysis. This project will advance our understanding of macrophage immunometabolism
and polarization, will introduce methods for more sensitive and accurate single-cell
analysis, and will provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the possibility to identify
protein-mediated molecular mechanisms at single-cell resolution. We strongly believe
that attaining these goals will have a transformative impact on biomedical research
and will inform new and better therapeutic strategies."

Project Summary
Approximately 280,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United
States in 2021 and more than 40,000 will die from the disease. It is well documented that early
detection results in improved morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound imaging is an important
screening and diagnostic breast cancer detection tool, particularly for women with dense breasts
when mammography tends to be suboptimal. While suspicious findings may be clarified with
ultrasound imaging, a subset of ultrasound images yield inconclusive results, necessitating
biopsies or follow-up imaging, which increase patient anxiety and places additional burdens on
the time available for clinical care and the resource allocations of our healthcare system. One
reason for this outstanding challenge is that dense breasts tend to create images with significant
acoustic clutter, which confounds the differentiation of an otherwise anechoic mass (which is
indicative of a benign cyst) from a truly hypoechoic mass (which could be indicative of
malignancy). In addition, it can be difficult to distinguish a complicated cyst (which has internal
echoes due to proteinaceous material and is benign) from either a solid mass or a complex cystic
and solid mass (which could be malignant) using standard ultrasound imaging methods alone.
The objective of this proposal is to develop new, real-time ultrasound imaging technology that will
simplify clinical workflows by distinguishing fluid-filled masses from solid masses and from
complex cystic and solid masses, which each appear hypoechoic in traditional ultrasound B-mode
images. Our novel approach, Robust Short-Lag Spatial Coherence (R-SLSC) imaging, has
demonstrated feasibility to make this distinction by incorporating coherence-based beamforming
to augment existing beamforming methods available in clinical ultrasound scanners. Aim 1 will
focus on development of a real-time system for implementing matched B-mode and R-SLSC
imaging. Aim 2 will evaluate and compare real-time system performance. Aim 3 will assess the
ability of our novel methods to distinguish fluid from solid or complex cystic and solid masses
utilizing a combination of quantitative analyses and task-oriented reader studies.Aim 4 will
investigate advanced methods to retrieve coherence information and diagnostic information
regarding mass contents from ultrasound channel data, including recently discovered options that
rely on coherence lengths and lag-one coherence values without requiring reader input.
Successful completion of these aims will lead to a real-time, ultrasound-based tool to confidently
distinguish solid from fluid hypoechoic breast masses and provide a more simplified clinical
workflow for the most challenging of these cases. In addition, results from the proposed studies
will be applicable to clarifying the content of masses that may appear in multiple organs throughout
the human body (e.g., testicular, liver, or pancreatic masses).

Work in the last decade from many labs has underlined the critical importance of RNA-mediated
cellular pathways, and clear connections of specific RNAs to human health. RNAs are
increasingly viewed both as appealing therapeutic targets, and as therapeutic agents
themselves. We hypothesize that obtaining a deeper and broader understanding about how
ligands interact with the many RNA species of the cell will provide important new insights into
RNA networks and functions, provide new understanding of how current drugs cause cellular
toxicity, and lend novel insights into improving RNA therapies. We are convinced that the
analysis of RNA interactions transcriptome-wide is essential to future biomedicine.
Unfortunately, methods for assessing RNA interactions directly in the cell lag well behind those
for protein and proteome analysis.
This project will consolidate our RNA work into a broad program that will develop a new set of
RNA-reactive reagents and methods, and will apply them to provide specific, quantitative
information about ligand interactions with the transcriptome. We will develop first-in-class
methods for functionalizing native RNAs at specific sites, and novel strategies for controlling
RNAs with red light. Combining our reactive acyl tools and methods with next-gen sequencing,
we will pinpoint and quantify ligand binding sites in the whole transcriptome. These
methodologies, together termed Reactivity-Based RNA Profiling (RBRP), will be applied to
analyzing off-target RNA binding by known small-molecule drugs with clinically limiting toxicity,
to profiling RNA interactions of endogenous secondary metabolites, and to the analysis of how
modified bases in next-generation mRNA vaccines and therapeutics affect their structures and
interactions in the cell. This work is significant because it seeks answers to system-wide
clinically-relevant questions regarding RNA interactions. Further, it develops the 2’-OH group as
a nearly universal handle for manipulation, conjugation, and study of RNAs, introducing
enabling molecular technologies that will broadly benefit researchers in the fields of RNA
biology and contribute to improving future RNA therapies."

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a robust risk factor for the development of significant social difficulties in
adulthood. However, the predominant use of retrospective measures of broad ill-defined CAN experiences in
broader cross-sectional designs that rely on single methods or informants has limited our understanding of the
associations among specific dimensions of CAN and characteristics of close relationship experiences in
adulthood. Moreover, from a public health perspective, the CAN experiences of historically underrepresented
individuals are also substantially underrepresented in the scientific literature in spite of the disproportionate
suffering they experience as victims of CAN in the broader context of discrimination, systematic structural
inequities, and substantial barriers to health care access. Finally, at a substantive level, studies have yet to
systematically delineate the mediating processes and moderating conditions that account for the multiple
developmental cascades linking CAN with close relationship sequelae in adulthood.
To address these substantial gaps in scientific knowledge, the present application is designed to provide
the first test of an integrative process model of the relational vestiges of CAN in adulthood. Specific aims are
centered on examining: (1) the selectivity and breadth of prospective associations among CAN dimensions and
multiple domains of intimate partner and parent-child relationship qualities; (2) the psychological mechanisms
that mediate the adult relational sequelae of CAN; and (3) the multi-level moderating conditions that potentiate
or disrupt the mediating cascades linking CAN with close relationship experiences in adulthood. Given the
relative lack of research on participants from diverse demographic backgrounds, the proposed application is
specifically designed to advance an understanding of the sequelae of CAN in an economically marginalized
sample of individuals who predominantly identify as Black or Latinx.
Building on the solid base of an integrative conceptual framework and promising preliminary findings, this
application will test these aims by following up a sample of 427 28- to 32-year-old adult participants who
experienced substantially elevated CAN and participated in data collection during early adolescence (Wave 1:
10-12 years old) and emerging adulthood (Wave 2: 18-20 years old). To overcome the existing methodological
limitations in the literature, we capitalize on a multi-method (e.g., observations, surveys, semi-structured
interviews, structured interviews, q-sorts), multi-informant (e.g., trained coders, counselors, primary caregivers,
friends, peers), and multi-level (i.e., ecological, family, interpersonal, intrapersonal, neurocognitive,
neurobiological) measurement battery across three prospective measurement occasions encompassing more
than two decades. By identifying the mechanisms and conditions underlying links between CAN and adult
relational sequelae, this application will provide critical information for clinical and policy initiatives designed to
maximize the welfare of children and families."

Mechanisms of enhancer dynamics and assembly in gene regulation
Effective gene regulation is essential for the proper functioning of cells. Dynamic control of enhancer
repertoires drives stage-specific transcription during tissue development and disease progression. The overall
objective of our research program is to gain a fundamental understanding of the regulations of enhancer
dynamics in response to signaling and their effects on gene regulation, leading to innovative approaches to the
prevention and treatment of enhancer-related diseases. We propose the following two themes in our parental
NIGMS R35 grant to pursue this objective from multiple levels: from the enhancer chromatin organization, to
the coordination of enhanceosome components, and the molecular interactions that drive enhancer assembly.
Theme 1: To profile the context-specific enhancer dynamics and understand its functional
significance. Our previous studies have revealed that enhancer dynamics can be induced by 1) acute
hormone stimulations, which can build up the active enhancer machinery in just minutes at many chromatin
sites to turn on gene expression, and 2) chronic disease progression towards tamoxifen resistance, which
reprograms the ERα cistrome to evade endocrine therapies in breast cancer. With these two established
model systems (acute and chronic signaling), we will 1) capture the dynamic enhancer chromatin organization
with multi-omics analyses and identify candidate key transcription factors associated with enhancer
reprogramming using bioinformatic approaches; 2) define stage-specific enhanceosome components using in
vivo proximity-dependent biotin labeling BioID/TurboID technologies; and 3) introduce a series of perturbations
to understand how disruption of enhancer dynamics affects transcriptional activation and cell state.
Theme 2: To decipher inter- and intra-molecular interactions of enhancer components and their
contributions to enhancer assembly. We have revealed important principles of enhancer assembly,
including combinatorial interactions of multiple transcription factors on hormone-regulated enhancers, and
phase-separated condensation mediated by hormone receptor multivalent interactions. Further studies will
employ a diverse set of genetic and genomic approaches, as well as our recently established imaging-based
approaches, including the LacO arrays/LacI-fluorescence proteins system and a single-molecular tracking
(SMT) imaging system. Specifically, we plan to 1) investigate the behaviors of homotypic and heterotypic
multivalent interactions of enhanceosome components and their contributions to enhancer assembly; and 2)
dissect the intra-molecular interactions of hormone receptors in response to ligand binding and their roles in
regulating enhancer assembly and activity.
To understand the functional attributes of different enhancer components, we require support from this
supplemental grant to purchase a user-friendly cell analyzer with a high-throughput sampler for our planned
CRISPR screen experiments. This equipment is critical for my lab to complete this parental R35 project."
11095168,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional signaling lipid and central biosynthetic intermediate that is subject
to strong homeostatic regulation, with its levels tightly controlled in space and time. Though many PA-
metabolizing enzymes and PA transporters are characterized, it is not well understood how cells sense changes
in PA levels and how homeostasis is achieved. To both elucidate mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal
regulation of PA metabolism and reveal a broader spectrum of effector proteins that propagate PA signaling, we
posit that new strategies to rapidly perturb PA levels with organelle-level precision are required. We have begun
to develop precision “membrane editing” tools for the rapid installation of physiologically active pools of PA on
target organelles. An optogenetic phospholipase D (optoPLD) uses blue light to recruit a bacterial PLD to desired
organelle membranes, where it generates transient pools of PA via phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and recent
directed evolution efforts have yielded second-generation, super-active optoPLDs (superPLDs). The
combination of superPLD-mediated membrane editing and organelle membrane proteomics via proximity
biotinylation using a membrane tethered TurboID, which we term a “feeding and fishing” (F+F) strategy, has
afforded us a global view of rapid changes to the integral and peripheral membrane proteomes of the plasma
membrane during conditions when its lipidome is edited using superPLD to transiently elevate PA levels. Beyond
detecting known regulators of PA metabolism, we identified and validated new candidate proteins for sensing,
transporting, and signaling the presence of PA in these membranes. Yet, several critical issues remain
unaddressed, related to both methods development and mechanistic understanding of preliminary hits from our
screens. The overall objective of this proposal is to deploy new optogenetic and proteomics tools to understand
how cells establish and maintain functionally distinct PA pools in different locations to balance biosynthetic and
signaling needs. First, we will develop ultralow-background, next-generation optogenetic PLDs and apply them
to control PA-dependent signaling and discover new regulators of PA homeostasis. Second, we will elucidate
roles for a new player implicated in the inter-organelle transport of PA using a combination of cellular and in vitro
studies. Third, we will elucidate the molecular details and functional importance of the interaction of PA with a
newly discovered PA-binding protein whose mutation causes a heritable musculoskeletal disease. Collectively,
our studies will yield widely useful tools for membrane editing and deciphering PA signaling and establish a
mechanistic framework for understanding how cells exert spatiotemporal control over the levels and bioactivity
of a pleiotropic lipid to maintain homeostasis and direct specific physiological and signaling events."

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the U.S. About 250,00 cases and
34,000 deaths from prostate cancer occur each year, making it the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
U.S. men. Incidence is so high that approximately one in every eight men will be diagnosed with the disease
over their lifetimes, and there are currently an estimated 3.2 million men living with prostate cancer in the U.S.
Due to this high incidence, prostate cancer creates a significant economic burden estimated to total over $13
billion in the U.S. annually. It is well established that androgen signaling drives prostate cancer growth and
metastasis. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy, which inhibits androgen receptor (AR) signaling, is widely used
as first-line therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. However, the majority of patients progress,
with lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Interestingly, despite androgen deprivation,
mCRPC continues to be driven by AR signaling due to the presence of AR splice variants that are constitutively
active in the nucleus. ARMA Bio is developing dual inhibitors of AR-full length (AR-fl) and AR-V7, the most
prevalent splice variant of the androgen receptor in men with mCRPC. AR-V7 expression in patients with mCRPC
is associated with drug resistance and poor survival outcomes. Currently there is no dual AR-fl/AR-V7 inhibitor
on the market, leaving patients with mCRPC with no therapeutic options. A first-in-class dual inhibitor has the
potential to overcome drug resistance, synergize with conventional androgen receptor therapy, and offer a much-
needed therapeutic option for men with mCRPC, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. In this Fast Track
project, ARMA proposes to 1) Perform medicinal chemistry for compound optimization and assess selectivity,
potency, and mechanism of action. 2) Investigate in vivo toxicity and pharmacokinetics. 3) Evaluate efficacy of
lead candidate in mCRPC xenografts. 4) Assess efficacy and synergism with enzalutamide in additional models
including patient-derived xenografts. 5) Perform mechanistic studies as a foundation for clinical biomarker
development. 6) Perform GLP manufacturing and IND-enabling toxicology studies. Ultimately, this work will
identify a lead compound and provide proof-of-principle data to advance the goal of developing a first-in-class
pharmacologic inhibitor of AR-fl/AR-V7. This inhibitor could be readily combined with existing anti-androgen
receptor treatments to not only reverse, but also prevent, the onset of AR-V7-mediated drug resistance, thereby
benefiting patients with earlier stages of disease."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death of U.S. women with CVD mortality increasing in
reproductive-age women. Rural, migrant Latina farmworker women have significant disparities in CVD risks
and CVD morbidity and mortality during reproductive years and later in life. Social determinants of health
(SDOH) are major drivers of disparities in health risks, behaviors, and outcomes across the lifespan. Migrant
Latina farmworker women have multiple adverse SDOH and unmet social needs, compounding their CVD risk
and cardiovascular health (CVH). The long-term goal of this project is to mitigate adverse SDOH of rural,
migrant Latina farmworkers and to improve their CVH, thus decreasing their disparate CVD morbidity and
mortality. The objective of this proposal is to bring an evidence-based approach to promoting
cardiometabolic health, i.e., peer support, combined with interventions to reduce unmet social needs and
mitigate adverse SDOH to this high-risk population. The scientific premise of this proposal is that addressing
SDOH-related needs is an essential component of a CVD reduction intervention to improve equity in rural,
marginalized populations. The proposed work will leverage a 31-yearlong community partnership, the Farm
Worker Family Health Program in southwest Georgia to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of a
community health worker/promotora (CHW/P)-led peer support and community resource navigation
intervention (Hermanas de Corazón), build capacity of Latina CHWs, and strengthen partnerships among
community stakeholders. The specific aims of this hybrid type-I effectiveness-implementation trial are: 1)
assess the effectiveness of the Hermanas de Corazón intervention in a) decreasing stress, social isolation, and
psychological distress and increasing perceived social support and access to SDOH-related resources, b)
decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors in this population determined by the American Heart Association Life’s
Essential 8; 2) examine potential mediation effects among these variables, and 3) evaluate barriers and
facilitators to implementation and implementation outcomes. This innovative study includes SDOH
assessment and intervention in a CVD prevention intervention, recognizes the high trauma exposure in this
population and incorporates trauma-informed care in the intervention. The proposed work is significant
because it targets a population of women that is Understudied, Underrepresented, and Underreported in
biomedical research and that has significant health disparities and adverse SDOH. The expected outcome is
an understanding of the potential mediating effect of addressing unmet social needs and adverse SDOH to
improve health. This work will have positive impact in that it will advance the science of effective interventions
and test implementation approaches to address social inequities and health disparities in this rural, migrant
Latina farmworker population."
11091960,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemophilia is an x-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiencies in clotting factor VIII or IX. Patients
suffer from frequent joint bleeding, which may lead to debilitating hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Both
symptomatic and silent bleeds, as well as unnoticed microhemorrhages, generate hemosiderin deposits, the
primary etiology of joint degeneration in HA. Non-invasive imaging of both hemosiderin and the subsequent
damage it causes to cartilage and subchondral bone is important for optimizing costly prophylactic treatment
plans and monitoring disease progression. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for
evaluation of HA, it has significant limitations including imprecise, only semi-quantitative evaluation of
hemosiderin deposition, and an inability to detect both early iron deposition and degeneration in cartilage and
subchondral bone. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI sequences, with TEs ~100 times shorter than those of
clinical sequences, can overcome these limitations. Using targeted UTE sequences, fast transverse relaxation
signals from hemosiderin and the osteochondral junction (OCJ) can be directly detected with high contrast.
This study aims to develop a complete package of UTE MRI techniques for evaluation of HA, including 1)
accurate quantification of hemosiderin through volumetric mapping of T1, T2*, and susceptibility; 2) assessment
of early cartilage damage by monitoring proteoglycan and collagen; and 3) evaluation of the OCJ, and aims to
apply this package in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of three groups of HA patients (mild, moderate,
and severe), as well as an age-matched control group. In Aim 1 we will further optimize the speed, contrast,
resolution, and accuracy of a series of 3D UTE MRI techniques for morphological and quantitative evaluation
of hemosiderin in synovium, and for assessment of articular cartilage health and OCJ changes using a clinical
3T MR scanner. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the optimized 3D UTE and clinical MRI sequences for assessment
of hemosiderin, cartilage, and the OCJ in ex vivo tissues from hemophilia patients following total knee
arthroplasty (n=10) and from normal cadaveric human knee joints (n=10). We will compare UTE-based
morphological and quantitative measures (tissue magnetic susceptibility, T1, T2*, fat fraction, adiabatic-T1ρ,
magnetization transfer ratio, macromolecular fraction) with clinical MRI evaluation of hemosiderin, cartilage,
and the OCJ, and we will correlate UTE and clinical MRI measures with histopathology, biochemistry, and
biomechanics. In Aim 3 we will apply the optimized 3D UTE and clinical MRI techniques to evaluate outcome
of prophylaxis in three groups of hemophilia patients with mild (n=20), moderate (n=20), and severe (n=20) HA
at two time points (baseline and 12 months), and a group of age-matched healthy volunteers (n=20) once.
Cross-sectional and longitudinal UTE and clinical MRI measures will be correlated with Hemophilia Joint
Health Scores (HJHSs), Pettersson radiograph scores, and self-reported outcomes. We expect that UTE
sequences will be more sensitive to early changes in hemophiliac joints than clinical MRI."
11096297,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 General anesthetics are essential in medicine, providing unconsciousness, amnesia and analgesia for
otherwise intolerable surgical procedures. Although general anesthetics are widely used, little is known about
how the brain recovers consciousness after general anesthesia. Consequently, there are no available
treatments for common clinical problems associated with recovery from general anesthesia, such as
emergence delirium and delayed emergence. Recent studies demonstrate that subcortical arousal nuclei are
important for recovery of arousal, but mechanisms underlying recovery of cognition have not been explored.
 There are important knowledge gaps that this research program intends to fill over the next five years.
First, the trajectory of cognitive recovery during anesthetic emergence is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear
how discrete cognitive domains recover, and how the recovery trajectory differs among commonly used
anesthetic drugs with different mechanisms of action. Second, it is unknown whether there are sex differences
in cognitive recovery from general anesthesia, and whether different stages of the estrous cycle alter the
cognitive recovery profile in female rodents. Finally, it its unknown if activating neural circuits involved in
arousal, attention, and memory facilitate cognitive recovery from general anesthesia.
 The broad, long-term objectives of this R35 (MIRA) grant are to elucidate how cognition
recovers after general anesthesia, and to develop novel approaches to accelerate recovery. First, we
will use touchscreen-based cognitive testing of rats to establish how specific cognitive domains recover after
general anesthesia. Second, we will determine whether the female estrous cycle influences cognitive recovery.
Finally, we will use chemogenetic manipulations to activate neural circuits involved in arousal, attention, and
memory to test for acceleration of cognitive recovery. These studies will inform and guide novel approaches to
accelerate recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia and treat common clinical problems associated
with anesthetic emergence. They will also provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms of
consciousness and cognition."

Faithful replication of DNA and response to encounters with aberrant DNA are essential to cell propagation and
survival. Our long-term goal is to understand the action of multi-protein DNA replication and damage response
machinery at eukaryotic replication forks. Our strategy is to elucidate the structural mechanisms using an
integrative structural biology approach, coupled to biochemical/biophysical characterization and collaborations
to define functional implications. This proposal focuses on critical unsolved questions about the initiation of
daughter strand synthesis in replication, and the stalling and remodeling of replication forks upon encountering
aberrant DNA. In DNA replication, the processive polymerases δ and ε require a short primer strand on the
template to function, which is generated by DNA polymerase a-primase (pol-prim). Although 3D structures have
been determined for all components of pol-prim and even the intact heterotetramer, these have provided only
limited mechanistic insights because structures of the full-length protein with relevant substrates and essential
co-factors are lacking. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we propose to determine the relevant structures
using Cryo-EM. We also propose to continue working on characterizing the structure, biochemical properties
and functional roles of 4Fe-4S clusters in pol-prim. We will test and refine our hypotheses about the role of: (i)
the primase 4Fe-4S cluster redox in modulating DNA binding activity; (ii) the role of the cluster in pol α in driving
the transition from RNA synthesis by primase to DNA synthesis by pol α. Together, these studies will solve the
fundamental questions about how pol-prim counts the length of the primer at each step and how the substrate
hand-offs occur from primase to pol α and then from pol α to pols δ or ε. Our second project addresses two
critical gaps in knowledge about replication fork encounters with aberrant DNA. RPA and Rad51 are two highly
abundant ssDNA binding proteins that have critical roles in the stalling, reversal and stabilization of stalled forks.
RPA-coated ssDNA is the key initiating signal for multiple damage response pathways and plays several
additional roles, including recruiting and directing the fork reversal activity of the ATP motor protein SMARCAL1.
We propose to elucidate the mechanisms that drive this important aspect of fork remodeling by determining the
structure of the RPA and SMARCAL1 on a model fork substrate complex using Cyro-EM. Rad51 plays an
essential role in the stabilization of stalled replication forks. Collaborative studies with David Cortez led to the
discovery and characterization of RADX, a new DNA damage response protein involved in regulating the activity
of Rad51 at stalled forks. We recently discovered RADX also interacts physically with RPA, suggesting there is
a RPA-RADX-Rad51 network operating at stalled forks. We propose combined structural, biophysical and
functional analyses of RADX and its interactions with DNA, Rad51 and RPA to clarify the roles of RADX at stalled
replication forks. Together, our two projects will greatly enhance understanding of how DNA is processed at
eukaryotic replication forks and genomes are maintained and propagated."

Alcoholic cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. One of the key drivers in its
pathogenesis is the reduction in hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) expression resulting in
the reduction in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) levels. The reduction in SAMe level leads to several
adverse intracellular consequences, which include promoting the inflammatory cascades in immune cells such
as macrophages by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This
project involves two academic centers in the United States (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and
Indiana University Hospital), a research institute in Spain (CIC bioGUNE), and NIAAA intramural liver research
scientist (Dr. Bin Gao) to examine SAMe in humans with alcoholic cirrhosis. We proposed a randomized
double-blind placebo controlled trial to determine the efficacy of SAMe (1,200 mg/day given in two divided
dose) and its mechanistic effects in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (Child class A and B) in the real world
setting. The primary endpoint will be the mortality of any causes between groups. The target enrollment of our
clinical trial is 196 participants (176 patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis and 20 controls). The approval
for funding of our study started on September 20, 2019. However, our study was significantly impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The administrative hold on research activities due to the pandemic
prohibited us to enroll patients as we anticipated. To date, 112 participants (~57%) were enrolled. Our
enrollment continues to improve and meet the monthly target enrollment starting around the beginning of Yr 3
of the project (~September 2021, the time when the overall COVID-19 pandemic was improving). Given the
trajectory of the enrollment, we anticipated that we should be able to complete our enrollment around August
2026. Our current funding ends on 8/31/24. This supplemental application is to allow us to complete the
clinical trial, currently being funded by 1U01AA02681."

Dynamic oscillations in protein abundance represents the most salient molecular feature of cell cycle
progression. This is typified by the cyclins and cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs), that oscillate during cell cycle
progression and determine the activation kinetics of Cyclin Dependent Kinases, which propel the cell cycle
forward. Protein dynamics are not confined to kinase regulators, but rather are exhibited by hundreds of proteins,
including regulators of transcription, chromatin organization, cytoskeleton, and metabolism. Defining the
pathways, networks and mechanisms underlying these dynamics is essential to understanding proliferative
control. Cell cycle protein dynamics are controlled, in part, by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin is the
major regulator of protein degradation in eukaryotes and plays an essential and highly conserved role in cell
cycle. A cascade of enzymes coordinates the conjugation of ubiquitin onto substrates. However, E3 ligases are
the enzymes that ultimately determine when, where and who is ubiquitinated. Like other post-translational
modifications, ubiquitin is reversible, and can be removed from substrates by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Thus, the
countervailing activities of E3s and DUBs sculpts the proteome to regulate cell cycle progression and the
maintenance of genome integrity. The goal of my research is to define enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway that
control cell cycle, their cognate substrates, and how specific ubiquitination events contribute to cell cycle
progression. To address this goal, the proposed project seeks to address two fundamental questions, which
remain understudied. The first relates to key molecular events of G2-phase. Cells arrest in G2 in response to
stress and damage and utilize this time to make key decisions about whether to proliferate. However, G2 remains
the most poorly studied phase in the cell cycle. We uncovered a widespread program of protein degradation that
occurs in G2 and G2/M, and which is regulated by the activity of the multi-functional kinase PLK1. The identity
and timing of substrate degradation, the E3 ligases involved, and the consequences of this regulation are almost
entirely unstudied. The second question relates to the role of DUBs in cell cycle, which relative to the E3s they
antagonize, remain vastly understudied. Using computational and proteomic methods we identified DUBs with
understudied roles in cell cycle. We are determining their enzyme kinetics and preferences, substrates,
mechanisms of action, and structures when bound to E3 counterparts. We pursue these questions using a
combination of cell, molecular and biochemical assays, combined with proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy.
Collectively, addressing these questions will identify new regulatory pathways that control cell cycle, proliferative
decision making, and the maintenance of genome integrity."
11097401,"(Parent Award: R01 GM109993) Defining how cells regulate the uptake and efflux of transition metals
such as Zn is a key component in elucidating cellular mechanisms of metal homeostasis. Bacterial model
systems provide paradigms for understanding regulation mechanisms. In E. coli, the Zn2+-responsive
metalloregulator ZntR senses Zn excess and activates Zn efflux systems (e.g., ZntA), while Zur senses Zn
sufficiency and represses Zn uptake systems (e.g., ZnuABC), to keep this essential metal at appropriate
physiological levels in the cell. Past research has provided significant insights into the structure, function, and
mechanism of the protein players in regulating cellular metal concentrations, including metalloregulators, and
metal uptake/efflux transporters, etc. Yet, many mechanistic pathways are still poorly understood, especially
regarding spatially and temporally coordinated interactions among proteins and/or DNA that can reside at
different locations in the cell. The long-term goal here is to understand how metal regulation in the cell can be
manipulated for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Toward this goal, the PI has established an internationally
recognized and unique research program that applies and develops advanced single-molecule/single-cell
imaging approaches to interrogate and understand the mechanisms of bacterial metal regulation both in vitro
and in live cells, which are further enhanced by bulk biochemical/biophysical and protein/genetic engineering
approaches and by established collaborations with biologists and engineers. The research has led to the
discoveries of first-of-their-kind mechanisms of metal-responsive transcriptional regulation and metal efflux. The
objective of this renewal is to advance the study and understanding of bacterial metal regulation from single
molecules and single cells toward cell communities, comprising three aims that focus on Zn regulation in E.
coli: (1) define a “through-DNA” mechanism for Zn uptake-vs-efflux regulation; (2) define the mechanism of
ZnuABC for Zn uptake in the cell; and (3) dissect cell-cell interactions in Zn homeostasis within bacterial
communities. The research is significant because it will provide novel mechanistic insights into: how
metalloregulators can act on each other on DNA, beyond the present paradigm of “set-point” mechanism; the
spatiotemporal coordination of multicomponent Zn transporters for Zn uptake; and the cell-cell interactions in Zn
homeostasis within a bottom-up cell community; and because these insights will deepen our understanding of
cell biology of metals in general, including related processes in human cells, thus providing fundamental
knowledge for identifying causes or developing preventions of diseases that involve similar regulation processes
or for devising strategies to impair bacterial Zn homeostasis for antimicrobial treatments. The research is
innovative because it generates novel mechanistic concepts in metal regulation, uptake/efflux, and emergent
behaviors in microbial communities and because it applies novel single-molecule/cell imaging methods as well
as microfluidic and optogenetic manipulations."

Transposable elements have generated the majority of the sequence in the human genome, and all of human
biology has evolved in the ever-present DNA, RNA, and protein made by these self-replicating pieces of
selfish DNA. The replication of transposable elements constitutes a major source of new mutations in humans
which drive genome instability and a variety of genetic diseases. Our group previously discovered the rapid
evolution of several restriction factors of Long Interspersed Element-1 (L1), the endogenous retroelements most
active in humans. This pattern of evolution suggests that L1s have evolved to evade these restriction factors,
driving rapid host evolution to keep pace. However, it is unknown how sequence variation in L1s impacts
their ability to evade and replicate in the presence of host restriction factors.
We are specifically interested in understanding – have transposable elements evolved to evade the defense
mechanisms of the human genome? What are the mechanisms of transposable element evasion? What are the
consequences to human health of evasive transposable elements replicating at times and places they are
normally repressed? To answer these questions, our lab employs non-traditional combinations of approaches
including retrospective analyses of genomes to understand what has happened and prospective experiments to
ask what could happen. We propose to leverage the lab’s recently generated, diverse panel of more than 130
young human L1s to search for variation in the ability of L1s to replicate in the presence of otherwise effective
host restriction factors. This variation could indicate adaptation of an L1 to evade host restriction or adaptation
of the host to restrict evasive L1s. In addition to this retrospective analysis of evolutionary history, we propose to
‘speed up’ evolution by building an in vitro evolution system to select for L1s that evade a defined restriction
factor. Comparison of these historical and prospective evolutionary approaches will help us decode the
selective pressures that drove L1 and human evolution. This research will address a fascinating basic
science question about the mechanisms of L1 evolution in the face of the host innate immune system with impact
on our understanding of sporadic autoimmune diseases without a clear genetic contribution.
Our lab combines a dedication to mentorship and scientific outreach with effort to build a communicative
and accommodating space to enable creative, daring science. Our diverse and experienced team of scientists
integrates expertise in comparative genomics, genome evolution, L1 biology, in vitro evolution, and protein
evolution and function to bring an evolution-driven approach to the proposed projects. With our record of pushing
conceptual and technical boundaries to bring new understanding to the fields of protein evolution and
restriction factor biology, our team is uniquely poised to bring about a new understanding of L1 evolution and
biology with implications for genome evolution and numerous disease states with clear L1 involvement. (30 lines)"

Chronic alcohol exposure is associated with the development of tolerance to alcohol’s aversive properties, which
serve to limit drinking. In contrast, the response to alcohol’s rewarding properties, which promote drinking, remain
unchanged. The brain undergoes a host of neuroadaptive changes as a result of chronic alcohol exposure but
the neural mechanisms underlying this tolerance are unknown. Impaired signaling in circuits encoding aversion
is a likely candidate mechanism. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is characterized for its involvement
in aversion including signaling the aversive properties of ethanol. The prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) shares important functional similarities with the RMTg including facilitation of aversion learning and
regulating the behavioral response to aversive stimuli. The neighboring infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC
exerts opposing effects to PL mPFC by facilitating extinction of aversive responding. Our work has uncovered a
dense projection from the mPFC to the RMTg that spans both PL and IL subregions. Our findings from
experiments investigating the function mPFC inputs to the RMTg support a role for these circuits in regulating
aversive responding. These data lead us to hypothesize that subregion- and circuit-specific dependence-induced
plasticity in RMTg-projecting mPFC neurons facilitates chronic tolerance to ethanol’s aversive properties. The
aims described in the current proposal will use innovative, circuit-specific strategies to test this hypothesis. Aim
1 will use in vivo fiber photometry to measure changes in calcium signal in RMTg-projecting PL and IL mPFC
inputs during the development of tolerance. Aim 2 will use closed-loop in vivo optogenetics to dissect the effects
of bidirectional manipulation of PL and IL mPFC inputs to the RMTg on measures of chronic tolerance to
ethanol’s aversive properties. Aim 3 will use whole-cell patch-clamp slice electrophysiology and a virally-
mediated intersectional approach to identify dependence-induced changes in synaptic and structural plasticity
underlying tolerance to ethanol’s aversive properties. The results of these studies will provide crucial insight into
the circuit-specific neural mechanisms that contribute to uncontrolled alcohol drinking. In doing so, our findings
have the potential to uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder."
11094463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interactions between long noncoding RNAs and epigenetic complexes are now increasingly recognized as
important regulators of developmental decisions. A classic example is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), an
epigenetic process by which one X-chromosome becomes inactivated in the early embryo. XCI can take
place randomly or in an imprinted manner on the paternal X. In the mouse, random XCI is observed in the
embryo proper (soma), and imprinted XCI in the placenta. Both require the ‘X-inactivation center’ (Xic), an
X-linked region that harbors several essential noncoding genes. A key gene is Xist, which produces a
noncoding RNA that ‘paints’ the X-chromosome and recruits silencing factors in cis. Our work has shown
that, during random XCI, Xist is regulated both positively and negatively by Xic factors, with Jpx in the
positive pathway and Tsix/Xite in the negative pathway. We have also shown that homologous X-
chromosome pairing coordinates which X chromosome will be inactivated. In this funding cycle, we have
further advanced understanding of the Xic’s role in X-chromosome counting, allelic choice, and imprinting.
For the counting mechanism, Jpx RNA — an Xist activator — serves as an X-linked “numerator” by titrating
the autosomal “denominator”, CTCF. This titration accounts for the X-to-autosome (X:A) ratio and creates a
permissive state for Xist induction. We also learned that X-X pairing requires a new long noncoding RNA
called “PAR-TERRA” produced from the X-linked pseudoautosomal region (PAR). Interestingly, all pairing
interactions take place within a “tetrad” of two Xic’s and two PAR’s. X-X pairing is then resolved by mRNA
decapping enzyme, DCP1A. For imprinted XCI, we have generated an ex vivo cellular model to study XP
imprinting. We have demonstrated that a 200-kb Xic region is sufficient to direct Xist imprinting and that Xist
imprinting requires an unpaired state in the male germ line that is akin to meiotic sex chromosome
inactivation (MSCI). Our research has generated new opportunities and many additional mechanistic
questions. In the next funding cycle, we aim to (i) investigate mechanisms underlying X-X pairing and
breaking of X-chromosome symmetry, (ii) determine how Jpx-CTCF titration regulates the initiation of XCI,
and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms of imprinted XCI. The proposed work will require five years to complete
and is expected to train three postdoctoral fellows for academic careers in the fields of epigenetics and RNA
biology."
11095137,"Epithelial cells play critical roles in many organs and are responsible for elemental processes
such as nutrient uptake and waste product secretion. To fulfill these functions, they polarize their
plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains. To maintain tissue homeostasis, epithelial
cells must continuously sort newly synthesized and internalized surface receptors to the correct
target domain. And after tissue damage, epithelial cells must correctly migrate into the wound and
re-colonize the wound area. Loss of polarity is associated with numerous diseases including
metastatic cancer, polycystic kidney disease, and Crohn’s disease. How epithelial cell polarity is
regulated is thus an important cell biological question with profound implications for human health.
Our work identified the epithelial cell-specific clathrin adaptor complex AP-1B as crucial for
polarized recycling of cargos to the basolateral domain. Cargos that depend on AP-1B for
basolateral localization include important signaling receptors such as epidermal growth hormone
receptor who’s missorting to the apical domain has been implicated in cancer and polycystic
kidney disease, and toll-like receptor 3 whose missorting results in chronic inflammation. A major
unresolved question in the field is how AP-1B uniquely functions in epithelial cells, and why its
close cousin AP-1A mostly fails to substitute. Our previous work suggested that AP-1B changes
the organization of recycling endosomes (REs) to accommodate AP-1B’s function in basolateral
sorting. Only AP-1B but not AP-1A localizes in REs where it triggers the formation of a lipid domain
enriched in PI(3,4,5)P3, and facilitates the recruitment of accessory factors including a vesicle-
tethering complex (the exocyst) and a lipid kinase (PIPKI-90). We recently showed that AP-1B
expression reduced the speed of collective cell migration after monolayer wounding, a novel
function independent of basolateral sorting. We will test the central hypothesis that AP-1B plays
dual roles in establishment and maintenance of epithelial monolayers by 1) directing cargos to
the basolateral membrane by generating a sorting platform in REs at steady-state and 2) during
cell migration by modulating the availability of focal adhesion molecules at the plasma membrane.
We will test this hypothesis in our proposed experiments by using state-of-the-art imaging
techniques including live TIRF microscopy in combination with photoactivation and unbiased
screens including BioID and mass spectrometry to complement innovative cell biological and
biochemistry approaches to: 1. Determine how AP-1B generates a basolateral sorting platform,
and 2. Determine how AP-1B controls cell migration. Our studies will define new mechanisms
governing the organization of polarized epithelial cells at steady-state and during cell migration."

Free ionized intracellular Mg2+ (iMg2+) is estimated to be in the range of 0.5–1.2 mM. In general, it is accepted
that under resting conditions, the concentration of ionized cytosolic Mg2+ is `muffled' by phosphometabolites,
nucleic acids and proteins. For example, ATP binds with a Kd value of 50 μM-70 ȝM and therefore Mg2+ in the
cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix is primarily complexed with ATP (Mg-ATP2-). Because of its abundance (~5
mM), ATP is considered to be the largest iMg2+ `store'. Fluctuations in free cytosolic (cMg2+) following hormonal
stimuli have been touted as passive adjustments of Mg2+ dissociating from the exuberant Mg-ATP contingent
and other `buffered' pools of Mg2+. Apart from iMg2+ `buffering' mechanism, Mg2+ ion channels and transporters
controlling Mg2+ entry as well as efflux across the plasma membrane are thought to maintain the equilibrium of
free cMg2+. Currently, several candidates are correlated to Mg2+ entry machinery (TRPM6, TRPM7, MagT1), but
are still awaiting convincing evidence for such roles. The Mg2+/Na+ exchanger SLC41A1 was proposed to
contribute Mg2+ efflux from the cell, whereas Mrs2 was proposed as a mitochondrial Mg2+ transporter. Very little
is known about the molecular details of Mg2+ transport into/from cellular organelles like the ER, mitochondria,
endosomes and lysosomes. A few studies have speculated that free [Mg2+] in the ER and mitochondria are likely
to be similar to [cMg2+]. However, the temporal and spatial dynamics, let alone the biological relevance of iMg2+
mobilization, remain a mystery in cell biology. Nevertheless, Mg2+ is an essential cation controlling many
biochemical reactions. Our recent work has shown that L-lactate acts as an activator that triggers a dynamic
transfer of Mg2+ between the ER and mitochondria to shape bioenergetics and cellular metabolism (Cell 2020).
The mitochondrial localized Mrs2 transporter was found to be responsible for the accumulation of Mg2+ in
mitochondria. However, the L-lactate-induced ER release molecular machinery remains unidentified. I propose
to identify ER Mg2+ release component, plasma membrane entry machinery and the resultant molecular signaling
pathways. I will take advantage of unbiased RNAi screen and targeted CRISPR/Cas9 editing approaches to
answer these mysteries in the Mg2+ signaling field. Identification of these molecular machineries would aid in our
understanding of iMg2+ dynamics and the cause-effect relationships that exist between iMg2+ flux and cellular
processes. Additionally, I will test and define the Mg2+-dependent signaling events based on the cellular and
mouse model phenotypes. It is thrilling to define the molecular link between cellular Mg2+ homeostasis and
physiological function. Our identification and characterization of the Mg2+ flux components will further investigate
how, and if, these signaling routes impinge on the pathophysiology of a growing number of Mg2+ deficiency
diseases in humankind. Overall, the R35/MIRA funding will support the testing of this unconventional hypothesis
and my laboratory will address these major mysteries in the near future."

Protein secretion is an essential component of the arsenal used by many bacterial pathogens to
invade hosts, damage tissues, and suppress immune responses. Gram-negative bacteria have
evolved sophisticated machines to secrete proteins across two membranes: the inner membrane
and outer membrane. Since discovered in 1979, the type I secretion system (T1SS) has been
identified in more than 800 bacterial genomes, and many of its substrates contribute to the
virulence of pathogens, examples being hemolysin HlyA in uropathogenic Escherichia coli,
adhesin SiiE in Salmonella enterica, and adenylate cyclase CyaA in Bordetella pertussis. The
T1SS secretes unfolded substrates from the cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu. It includes three
components: an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), associated periplasmic
adapter proteins located in the inner membrane, and a porin in the outer membrane. The
canonical “alternating access” model cannot explain how the large protein substrates are
transported by the T1SS ABC transporter across the inner membrane. Therefore, the
mechanisms of substrate secretion at the molecular level is still obscure. The proposed research
leverages single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), bioinformatics, in vivo and in vitro
assays to answer key questions in the field, including the structural basis of substrate recognition,
the nature of the translocation pathway, the energetics for substrate translocation, and the
regulation of the T1SS ABC transporter's activity. The studies will substantially increase the
fundamental scientific knowledge about the mechanisms of the T1SS and provide a new basis
for developing future therapeutic interventions against a broad range of bacterial infections."

 Epigenetic gene repression by heterochromatin is necessary for multi-cellular organismal development
and genome stability. Mis-regulation of heterochromatin is a cause of multiple diseases through perturbed gene
expression patterns. The long-term goals of our research program are to determine at a molecular level how
noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in heterochromatin formation and function. Many ncRNAs act in the
nucleus to regulate gene expression through association with chromatin regulatory machinery. We and others
have shown that certain RNA-mediated heterochromatin pathways require intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions
between ncRNAs and nascent RNA that serve as the trigger to form heterochromatin. However, many systems
where RNA is implicated have unexplored molecular mechanisms of action. We will address three high-level
major outstanding questions in the field: 1) Which heterochromatin systems are controlled through RNA-RNA
interactions? 2) How is heterochromatin built around nascent RNA? 3) How are RNA binding proteins re-
purposed from mRNA processing functions to contribute to RNA-mediated heterochromatin formation? Our
research program focuses on multiple heterochromatin systems that incorporate different species of noncoding
RNAs. We study long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as HOTAIR and pericentromeric transcripts, which can
inhibit heterochromatic histone modifiers to control their activity. In addition, we have developed the first
biochemical system to study the human nuclear piRNA pathway, which uses base-pairing of the small piRNA to
target nascent transcripts of repeats that then are suppressed via heterochromatin. Finally, we address how
RBPs such as the N6-methyladenosine reader YTHDC1 can work with ncRNAs to promote gene repression.
We use biochemical, structural, cell biological, and genomic approaches to study these models of RNA-regulated
heterochromatin. Mechanistic insight into these pathways will provide a fuller understanding of how they work
normally and in disease, which will prove useful in targeting for pharmacological intervention.
Relevance to public health
Noncoding RNAs are produced from regions of the human genome originally thought to be ""junk"" DNA. Many
ncRNAs participate in epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation and mis-regulation can lead to diseases such
as cancer. ncRNAs are therefore clear candidates to provide a missing link to understanding the molecular
mechanisms of many human diseases for which there is a ""hidden heritability"" factor that has not yet been
identified."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects ~10% of the US adult population, and another 84.1 million have prediabetes. The β-cell dysfunction is an early and essential event in an impaired glucose tolerant state (IGT) that leads to diabetes, including obesity-linked T2D. The formation of SNARE complexes is rate-limiting for the fusion of insulin granules to the plasma membrane (PM) for insulin secretion. A PM protein syntaxin is a central component for forming SNARE complexes that modulate biphasic insulin secretion. Our understanding of factors that inhibit the formation of SNARE complexes to reduce insulin secretion in an IGT state is lacking. In this regard, we have identified Tomosyn-1, an endogenous inhibitor of insulin secretion that functions by binding to syntaxin. Our long- term goal is to understand how Tomosyn-1 function in β-cells can be manipulated to improve insulin secretion in IGT to treat and prevent prediabetes and T2D. Increasing protein abundance and/or functional activity of Tomosyn-1 reduces insulin secretion. We show that β-cell-specific loss of Tomosyn-1 increased insulin secretion, improving glucose clearance in mice. Increased Tomosyn-1 protein abundance in obese mouse and T2D human islets is associated with reduced insulin secretion in IGT. As such, islets of diet-induced obese mice hemizygous for Tomosyn-1 exhibited increases in insulin secretion. We have identified phosphorylation sites in Tomosyn-1 in response to β-cell signaling pathways, which increase insulin secretion, and an E3-ubiquitin ligase, Hrd1, which increases Tomosyn-1 turnover. Excitingly, we discovered that Syt9, which marks a subpopulation of insulin granules, binds Tomosyn-1 and inhibits the formation of the SNARE complexes. Improved glucose tolerance in Syt9-null mice directly results from enhanced insulin secretion from β-cells. Interactions of Tomosyn- 1 with syntaxin and Syt9 provide strong evidence for Tomosyn-1 as a key modulator of the fusion of insulin granules for the insulin secretion process. We aim to determine how Tomosyn-1 inhibits insulin secretion in pathophysiology and physiology at the molecular level and how its inhibitory function is regulated. We hypothesize that Tomosyn-1 is a critical protein in the exocytosis machinery that regulates SNARE complex- mediated insulin secretion in response to nutritional cues, and specific post-translational modifications of Tomosyn-1 increase insulin secretion. For one year of bridge funding, we plan to a) conduct metabolic phenotyping using Tomosyn-1βKO and control mice in young (6 weeks) and older (>30 weeks) mice, b) determine Tomosyn-1 protein abundance in human T2D islet β-cells, and c) assess the binding of Syt9 with Stx1A and Stx4 and Tomosyn-1 in T2D islets. These experiments are aimed to address select reviewers’ comments to provide a stronger rationale for investigating the role of Tomosyn-1 in regulating insulin secretion and that increases in Tomosyn-1 binding with Syt9 are implicated in reducing insulin secretion in T2D human islets. This will improve our understanding of how β-cells fine-tune insulin secretion and there is a loss in fusion competency of insulin granules during IGT."

This is a request for an Administrative Supplement for the Immune Drivers of Autoimmune Disease (IDAD)
project U01 AI176320 “T cells promoting transitions toward autoimmunity”. The proposed studies for the
Administrative Supplement are within the scope of the active parent grant, focused on understanding the immune
mechanisms underlying the transition from sub-clinical autoimmunity to autoimmune disease. Our objective in
this administrative supplement is to test the hypothesis that the transition from high-risk autoantibody positivity
to clinical disease will have shared features across these diseases. The proposed studies will leverage existing
longitudinal serum samples from three clinical trials evaluating the ability of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to prevent
progression from sub-clinical autoimmunity with the presence of autoantibodies to clinical diagnosis of
autoimmune disease. The three clinical trials are: the TN22 trial focused on prevention of type 1 diabetes (T1D);
the SMILE trial focused on prevention of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); and the StopRA trial focused on
prevention of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The proposed studies will profile the serum proteome in individuals from
these trials using the Olink Explore HT platform to measure 5400 serum proteins. We will select samples from
baseline, 6 months, and samples drawn near disease transitions when available. The samples will be run at
OMRF leveraging their expertise with Olink and ensuring that the same platform is used for all samples. For data
analysis, we will compare placebo versus HCQ within each trial but also compare across trials to identify both
disease-specific biomarkers and biomarkers present in all three diseases. We will use approaches that support
integration of these datasets with other datasets that have already been generated for each of these trials.
Specific Aim 1 will assess the change in serum protein expression from baseline to 6 months on HCQ using
samples from the treatment arm of each trial. Specific Aim 2 will assess the change in serum protein expression
at baseline, prior to disease transition and after transition selecting samples from individuals in the placebo group
who progress to clinical disease. Specific Aim 3 will compare serum protein expression between patient types at
baseline and upon disease transition. The proposed project brings together IDAD researchers at BRI, UT
Southwestern and OMRF and will include additional research groups in the field including UC Denver. It also
expands the IDAD disease focus to include individuals at risk for rheumatoid arthritis."

11092461,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe type of congenital heart defects, which is characterized
by the underdevelopment of left side of the heart. The clinical presentation of HLHS includes hypoplasia of the
left ventricle and structural defects in mitral valves, aortic valve, and ascending aorta. HLHS newborns usually
die within a week without surgical treatment. We and others have linked the pathogenic NOTCH1 mutations to
HLHS and calcific aortic valve disease. It appears that abnormal NOTCH signaling interrupts the communication
between myocardium and endocardium thus leads to incomplete growth of ventricular chamber. However, the
mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in hypoplasia of the left ventricle are largely unknown due to
limited models for studying HLHS. Genetically engineered animals are not capable of reproducing the clinical
phenotypes in HLHS patients. Previous studies have focused on the structural and electrophysiological defects
in cardiomyocytes from HLHS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which may not recapitulate
the underlying non-cell autonomous scenarios in the hypoplastic ventricles. In this proposal, we hypothesize that
NOTCH1-mediated myocardial-endocardial crosstalk is required for normal human ventricular cardiomyocyte
differentiation, and NOTCH1 mutations leads to abnormal myocardial-endocardial interactions which cause the
hypoplasia of ventricular cardiomyocytes in HLHS. We will employ an integrated stem cell model using HLHS
and CRISPR genome-edited iPSCs to investigate how NOTCH1 mutations lead to abnormal myocardial-
endocardial interactions in HLHS. We will design a novel co-culture platform using human iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) with distinct NOTCH1 genetic composition to
study the intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium in both healthy and diseased
conditions. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endothelial
NOTCH1 deficiency suppresses human ventricular cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine how the crosstalk between myocardium and endocardium affects ventricular
cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation by co-culture of human iPSC-CMs and iPSC-ECs. In Specific
Aim 3, we will decipher the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in the dysfunctional myocardial-
endocardial interactions and contribute to hypoplasia of the left ventricle using genome-edited HLHS-iPSCs. The
completion of this R01 project will have a major impact on the understanding of HLHS through interactions
between endocardium and myocardium using clinically relevant and patient-derived cardiomyocytes and
endothelial cells."

Chronic pain is common, costly, and debilitating. Opioid prescription in the treatment of chronic
pain is frequent and carries a consequent risk of poor treatment outcome, as well as higher
morbidity and mortality in a clinically significant number of patients, particularly those who meet
criteria for opioid dependence. Despite the alarming increases in prescription opiate misuse and
opioid use disorder (OUD) nationally in the United States, there are few treatment options available
that target both pain-related interference and OUD among patients with chronic pain. In military
veterans, this issue is of particular importance as numerous reports indicate frequent use of opioids
in the treatment of chronic pain, as well as increasing opioid-related problems. To date, there are
no evidenced-based treatment options which aim to both reduce pain interference simultaneously
addressing problematic opioid use. The overall aim of the parent study (UH3DA051241) is to
determine the efficacy of an integrated psychosocial treatment in veterans with chronic pain, who
are taking buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. To examine this aim, we are utilizing a multisite
randomized clinical trial design to assess the efficacy of two empirically supported interventions:
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for chronic pain and Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention
for substance use and misuse. Efficacy will be assessed by examining pain interference and opioid
misuse outcomes after three months of active treatment, as well as at 6 and 12 month follow-ups.
Secondary outcomes, including depression, pain-related fears, and other substance use, will also
be assessed at these same follow-ups. The study will also examine the relation between within-
treatment changes in treatment mechanisms, including pain acceptance, engagement in values
based action, and opioid craving, and changes at post- treatment and follow-up. The results of this
study will directly inform treatment of patients with chronic pain and represents a significant
advance in the growing and understudied problem of OUD among patients with chronic pain. In
addition to addressing the question of whether the treatment is feasible, it will further examine
issues of treatment mechanisms to better inform the provision of treatment. This supplement to the
parent award will support finalizing recruitment, treatment, and follow-up of the sample at three
Veterans Administration Healthcare System sites, and will aid in dissemination efforts."

Lung transplantation (LTx) remains the only available treatment for patients with end-stage pulmonary disease.
Yet, outcomes after LTx are worse compared to the transplant of other solid organs (SOT). Immunosuppressive
regimes used in LTx have been derived from experiences with other SOTs. Yet, such a strategy may be flawed,
as recent data has demonstrated clear differences in the immune responses in the lung. Unlike other SOTs
where initiation of rejection depends on cell trafficking to graft-draining lymphoid organs, in the lung lymphocyte
priming occurs in the lung graft itself. There is thus an urgent need to develop novel approaches to improve
LTx survival. As most lungs transplanted into recipients are harvested from brain dead (BD) donors, there are
important biological consequences that must be considered, particularly the massive inflammatory activity and
cytokine release, which results in the activation of a panoply of cell types. This includes the upregulation of
cellular adhesion molecules (CAM), in particular VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, priming the graft for rejection. Ischemia-
reperfusion injury caused by the transplant procedure has the potential to drive this CAM activation higher. We
thus propose to investigate a novel bi-functional approach to the prevention of LTX rejection, focused on the
development of nanoagents with the potential to block CAM-based priming of the graft concomitant with the
delivery of immunosuppressives. Specifically, we will: 1) Identify peptides capable of binding ICAM-1 or VCAM-
1 with the ability to suppress immune cell trafficking and T cell priming; and 2) Investigate advanced bi-functional
nanoagents designed to localize to the lung and inhibit rejection. The overall goal is the validation of a novel
targeted therapeutic regime with the potential to obviate the need for systemic immunosuppression."
11095507,"SUMMARY OF THE PARENT RESEARCH PROJECT
Membrane protein effectors of pathogen interactions with host. The goal of this project is to develop a
framework for understanding the way in which the human host defenses interact with microbial pathogens and
age-related stressors. Many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade innate immunity by recruiting
complement regulatory factors onto the microbial cell surface. Moreover, the ectopic deposits that form in age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are also rich in blood proteins involved in
innate immunity. Despite the biomedical importance of these processes, mechanistic knowledge is limited. This
research project is designed to address this knowledge gap. We focus on determining the structural basis for
two central interactions of human blood proteins involved in immunity, hemostasis and cell adhesion and cell
migration: (1) interactions with outer membrane proteins from the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis that are
important for pathogenesis, and (2) interactions with lipids and biominerals that are relevant to the formation of
pathological deposits associated with AMD and AD. Proteins in these highly heterogenous environments play
central roles in human health but are highly under-represented in the scientific knowledge base. We aim to
bridge this fundamental knowledge gap. Addressing these problems is important for advancing comprehensive
knowledge of the disease process and for developing diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. The
research strategy is multidisciplinary. It relies significantly on structural biology techniques, particularly solution
NMR and solid-state NMR."
11097498,"CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor (CKR) that plays a central role in inflammation through its regulation of T cell
migration and function. Despite the established clinical relevance of CKRs in disease, there are only three FDA
approved drugs that target the entire chemokine system, which consists of approximately twenty receptors and
fifty ligands that regulate nearly every aspect of inflammation. Reasons for this difficulty in CKR drug develop-
ment include the potential redundancy between multiple chemokine ligands for a given CKR and a lack of
knowledge of how the signaling pathways activated by CKRs regulate immune cell function and inflammation.
Thus, there is a critical unmet need for drugs targeting the chemokine system. This puts into context work from
my group on the chemokine receptor CXCR3. We have shown that the chemokine ligands of CXCR3, CXCL9,
10 and 11, act as biased agonists, generating quantitatively and qualitatively distinct signals from one another
through their interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins and β-arrestin adapter proteins. In the previous project
period, we have identified small-molecule G protein- and β-arrestin-biased CXCR3 agonists that (1) differentially
activate signaling pathways downstream of CXCR3, and (2) have distinct effects in a mouse model of T-cell-
mediated inflammatory skin disease. These findings suggest distinct roles for G proteins and β-arrestin in pro-
moting the CXCR3-mediated inflammatory response. The long-term goal of our research is to determine the
mechanisms underlying biased agonism to develop novel therapies targeting CKRs in inflammation. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine how CXCR3 biased agonists promote different effector conformations
that lead to distinct patterns of signaling resulting in changes in T cell function and inflammation. Our central
hypothesis is that β-arrestin-biased agonists promote unique receptor and β-arrestin conformations that favor
“location-biased” endosomal signaling that promotes a unique transcriptional response in T cells and inflamma-
tion. To address our objective, first, we will determine how the receptor:ligand complex promotes biased re-
sponses through allosteric regulation of effectors. We have found that CXCR3 biased agonists promote different
β-arrestin-mediated effects, which we will explore further by using receptor mutants. Then, we will determine
how endosomal signaling and location bias contribute to CXCR3 biased signaling. We have found that some
CXCR3 biased agonists promote transcription that can be prevented by inhibiting receptor endocytosis. Lastly,
we will determine how CXCR3 G protein- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways contribute to T cell function
and the inflammatory response. We will use CXCR3 mutants to test the contributions of specific signaling path-
ways to T cell chemotaxis in vitro and inflammation in vivo. This project explores an innovative approach to study
CXCR3 signaling that will provide an understanding of CXCR3 regulation of the inflammatory response by the
selective activation of G proteins and β-arrestins. The research is significant as it will lay the groundwork for
research on biased agonists as therapies targeting CXCR3 and serve as a model for drug design at GPCRs."

We request an administrative supplement to grant R35GM149355 for the purchase of an Isothermic Cryogenic
Dry-Vapor Freezer from Custom Biogenic Systems. This is to replace our current Isothermic Cryogenic Dry-
Vapor Freezer which has broken down and is not repairable. The parent grant, R35GM149355, is focused on
mechanisms of telomere cohesion in human cells. The goal of our research is to elucidate the proteins and
mechanisms required for establishment and resolution of sister chromatid cohesion at human telomeres. As
described in the parent grant, the research requires that we generate and store many cell lines. We utilize a
broad range of human cell lines, including primary normal human cell lines and cancer cell lines. We store
multiple aliquots of these cell lines in a cryogenic freezer. For each of these cell lines we use lentivirus to generate
cell lines overexpressing and depleted for the proteins that we proposed to investigate in the grant. We store
multiple aliquots of these cell lines in a cryogenic freezer. We then use these cell lines to measure telomere
function during long term cell growth and aging. Thus, the research in the grant requires that we freeze and store
many cell lines. For this, we require a large, reliable cryogenic storage system. This is essential for the conduct
of the research and for the reproducibility of the studies. Our current system has broken down and it is essential
that we replace it in order to continue the studies proposed in the grant. This request for equipment is completely
within the scope of the parent award."
11100515,"SUMMARY: In response to NOT-GM-24-021, we apply for a supplement to our ongoing NIGMS award 5R01GM148970-
02, “DMS/NIGMS 1: Topological Study on Histological Images and Spatial Transcriptomics”. We propose to extend the
parent award by integrating the developed methods with state-of-the-art deep learning methodology, in order to produce
more powerful topology- and gene-informed feature representation for spatial transcriptomics data. The method will use
topological features and gene features as guidance for contrastive learning and teacher-student consistency learning so that
histology image patches are mapped into a powerful topology- and gene-informed features. To achieve the goal, we will
develop contrastive learning or teacher-student consistency loss, in which we ensure that both gene-based and topology-
based similarity measure will be preserved. We will use public ST data (10 Visium) on breast cancer and brain cancer, as
well as proprietary ST data (4 triple negative breast cancer samples, from Indiana University). We will use gene correlation,
as well as topological feature similarity, to determine similarities between different spots, and learn the feature mapping.
To evaluate the quality of the obtained imaging feature, we will test on two downstream tasks: (1) direct image-to-gene
mapping; (2) downstream tasks on whole slide prediction. For the ﬁrst task, we will use the learnt feature to train a classiﬁer
to directly predict spot-level gene expression. We expect that the learnt new features have better prediction power of gene
expression. Furthermore, for downstream tasks, we will combine the learnt gene features with whole slide prediction models
such as Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). We expect that the new topology- and gene-informed features will achieve better
prediction power in these downstream tasks. To perform the proposed tasks, however, we require a powerful GPU server.
We expect such features will demonstrate strong prediction power in downstream tasks."
11100099,"Chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions that occur spontaneously during normal cell
metabolism or following treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents. If unrepaired or repaired inappropriately,
DSBs can lead to profoundly detrimental events, such as chromosome loss, deletions, or translocations. Defects
in the repair of DSBs cause genomic instability, manifested as immunological, development or neurological
defects, and predisposition to cancer. The toxicity of DSBs is exploited for radiation and chemotherapy, as well
as targeted therapies directed against specific DNA repair proteins. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of
DSB repair is of fundamental importance and has practical application for development of new therapeutics and
uncovering pathways to resistance. Homologous recombination (HR), one of the two main mechanisms to repair
DSBs, employs extensive homology and templated DNA synthesis to restore the broken chromosome. In
addition to its role in repairing DSBs, HR has emerged as a prominent mechanism to restart stalled or collapsed
replication forks. The overall goal of our research program is to decipher the mechanisms of homology dependent
DSB repair, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The first part of our program builds
on our previous studies showing that the conserved Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex initiates end resection,
the first step of HR, while more extensive processing of the 5 terminated strands is catalyzed by Exo1 or Dna2-
Sgs1. Specifically, we will use S1-seq and MNase-seq methodologies to determine whether chromatin
remodeling precedes or is coupled to end resection, and will determine which resection mechanisms are
impacted by loss of RSC, SNF, INO80 and Fun30 chromatin remodelers. The second part of our program
focuses on the repair single-end DSBs produced by collapse of replication forks. We recently developed an
efficient system to create a site-specific replication fork collapse using Cas9 nickase and have shown that cell
survival is completely dependent on the MRX complex and Rad51. This system will allow us to define the elusive
functions of MRX in sister-chromatid recombination and to identify novel factors that participate in collapsed fork
repair. In the long term we believe that mechanisms under investigation in this proposal will provide new insight
into genomic instability caused by replication stress and how chromatin structure modulates DSB repair."

DNA nanotechnology offers near-atomic control for building structures, with precise positioning of guest
molecules such as antibodies, fluorophores and ligands that make them potentially useful in a number of
biological applications such as biosensing, drug delivery, cell modulation and bioimaging. However, there are
still many challenges that need to be addressed for DNA nanotechnology to reach its full potential for practical
applications. In this proposal, we focus on two main areas of development in DNA nanotechnology to address
these challenges: (1) Creating a robust, multifunctional drug delivery platform for treating multisystemic diseases,
and (2) designing 3D DNA crystals as scaffolds for X-ray structure determination and characterization of such
3D lattices using the new technique of Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography (SFX).
For drug delivery, we will develop DNA polyhedra as drug carriers for delivering a new class of modified polycyclic
compounds (MPCs) to multiple organ systems and enhancing drug candidate screening using myotonic
dystrophy type 1 (DM1) as a testbed disease. Our work will provide quantifiable loading of these minor groove
binding drugs and thorough validation of drug delivery efficiency from cell culture to preclinical DM1 mouse
models, establishing cell internalization, lack of toxicity and immune response, cell- and disease-specific
targeting, bioavailability and biodistribution of the drug-loaded DNA nanostructures.
For developing DNA nanostructures as structural scaffolds, we will design and construct DNA motifs that
assemble into 3D DNA crystals with different cavity sizes that allow hosting guests of different sizes ranging from
nanoparticles to proteins. We will improve resolution of the crystals by programming crystal contacts and
incorporating chemical modifications and demonstrate macromolecular scaffolding of proteins using triplex
forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) as tethers and peptides using PNA linkers. We will develop methods to grow
microcrystals of these DNA motifs for structural analysis using SFX, where diffraction data is collected using high
intensity X-ray free-electron lasers, that eliminate the need for large single crystals, freezing, and radiation
damage associated with traditional crystallography.
This proposed research extends beyond a single disease or health issue, making this work well-suited for the
R35 Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA) at the NIGMS. In the long-term, I envision that our
modular, platform technology using DNA nanostructures can be adopted by other labs for different disease
treatments and drug screening (drug delivery) and to obtain crystallographic information of hard-to-crystallize
molecules (macromolecular scaffolds)."
11100210,"Inositol is essential for the viability of eukaryotic cells. Myo-inositol is the precursor of all inositol compounds,
which play pivotal roles in cell signaling and metabolism. Consistent with its importance, perturbation of inositol
homeostasis is associated with pathologies as diverse as neurological and psychiatric illnesses, myopathies,
cancer, and diabetes. Furthermore, inositol depletion is a hypothesized therapeutic mechanism of action of drugs
used to treat bipolar disorder, a devastating psychiatric illness that affects ~2% of the population. In this light, it
is striking that very little is known about the regulation of inositol homeostasis in human cells. Our research
seeks to determine how inositol synthesis is regulated and how inositol deprivation affects essential
cellular functions in human cells. Toward this end, we identified the first negative transcriptional regulator of
inositol synthesis in mammalian cells – inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1). IP6K1 represses expression
of ISYNA1, the gene coding for the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis, myo-inositol-3-P synthase (MIPS).
Further, we demonstrated that binding of IP6K1 to phosphatidic acid (PA) is required for nuclear localization of
IP6K1 and repression of MIPS expression. Our first project will rigorously dissect the mechanism of
regulation of ISYNA1 by IP6K1. To elucidate the consequences of inositol deprivation, we constructed an
ISYNA1 knock-out (ISYNA1-KO) human cell line, which cannot synthesize inositol. Inositol-deprived ISYNA1-
KO cells exhibit profound alteration of lipid homeostasis and expression of genes involved in stress signaling.
Specifically, we observed an increase in ceramides and increased expression of genes that mediate the unfolded
protein response (UPR), a stress response that is activated by ceramides. Our second project will test the
hypothesis that inositol deprivation results in activation of the UPR pathway by upregulating ceramides.
Intriguingly, inositol-deprived cells exhibited increased levels of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is the
biochemical hallmark of the mitochondrial disorder Barth syndrome. Consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction,
we observed increased activation of ERK, a promoter of mitochondrial fission, in inositol-starved cells. The third
focus of our studies will test the working hypothesis that inositol deprivation perturbs mitochondrial
function. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to the first molecular model of regulation of
inositol synthesis in mammalian cells and demonstrate how inositol deprivation affects the cellular stress
response and mitochondrial function. This knowledge will have important implications for understanding inositol
homeostasis as well as the therapeutic mechanisms of inositol-depleting mood stabilizing drugs."
11100211,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The goal of this Administrative Supplement application is to support the purchase
of a multi-lane metabolic & telemetric treadmill from Columbus Instruments. This equipment is essential for
determining how preoperative exercise therapy (PET) modulates anti-inflammatory trained immunity in Kupffer
cells (KCs) via hepatic vagal neurotransmitter, Acetylcholine. This study is highly relevant to the parent grant
(R01GM137203) entitled ""Preoperative exercise therapy for surgery triggered inflammation"". Liver ischemia
and reperfusion (I/R) is an unavoidable consequence of major liver resection and liver transplantation that
leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and costs after liver surgery. Previous strategies to protect the liver
from I/R injury have typically focused on specific known injury mechanisms, often leaving other detrimental
processes unaddressed. Pre/post-operative exercise facilitates recovery after major abdominal surgery. It has
beneficial effects on the surgical outcome by regulating multiple mechanisms, including the quantity and
function of innate immune cells to confer an anti-inflammatory environment. We have discovered that PET
significantly reduced liver damage and inflammatory responses after liver I/R via metabolic reprogramming
Kupffer cells with anti-inflammatory trained immunity. However, the precise mechanisms by which PET triggers
metabolic changes in KCs remains unclear. Our recent preliminary data that PET increased levels of
acetylcholine in the liver and blocking α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) abrogated
the long-lasting protective effect of PET on liver I/R injury. Therefore, we hypothesize that PET triggers an anti-
inflammatory trained immunity in KC against liver I/R injury via cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP).
The multi-lane metabolic & telemetric treadmill is a state-of-the-art system designed for enhanced accuracy
and efficiency in metabolic and physiological monitoring during small animal exercise. Our proposed vagal tone
studies with metabolic treadmill will significantly expand the scope of the parent R01 award by addressing two
new questions related to those already being investigated in the parent R01 award: 1) Does PET trigger
trained immunity in KC to protect liver from I/R injury via hepatic vagus nerve? 2) Does PET metabolically-
epigenetically reprogram KCs via a7nAChR to trigger trained immunity? In summary, the multi-lane metabolic
& telemetric treadmill will significantly enhance our understanding of the effects of PET on modulating
immunometabolism in hepatic immune cells against liver I/R injury and drives significant scientific
advancements in the field of immunometabolism."

The overall goal of this Maximizing Investigator's Research Award renewal application is to advance
understanding of how inductive and morphogenetic processes during vertebrate embryogenesis are coordinated
to ensure normal development. Early inductive processes controlled by maternal and zygotic gene products
establish embryonic polarity and germ layers, while convergence and extension (C&E) gastrulation movements
elongate embryonic tissues down the anteroposterior axis and narrow them mediolaterally. The noncanonical
Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling pathway polarizes morphologies and behaviors of mesenchymal
gastrula cells that shape embryonic body. We previously proposed that Wnt/PCP signaling acts as a cellular
compass that orients cells with respect to the anteroposterior embryonic axis, but how the compass is regulated
is not understood. During the previous funding period, we surprisingly found that several pathways work in
parallel to Wnt/PCP to polarize cells during C&E. We also implicated in C&E another conserved regulator of
planar polarity, Dachsous atypical cadherin, which is essential for many processes, including embryonic
cleavages and axis specification, by promoting microtubule dynamics. We invested significant effort in generating
new genetic tools to probe the mechanisms of the Wnt/PCP compass and initiated a genetic screen for new
gastrulation regulators.
 These findings and tools motivate our future studies in three research themes. In the first, we will investigate
how numerous membrane receptors, including Gpr125 adhesion GPCR, which we implicated in the Wnt/PCP
compass, interact during C&E. Using precise mutations and tags in the endogenous gpr125 locus, proteomic
and genetic experiments, we will test whether Gpr125 promotes formation of Wnt/PCP complexes composed of
select components. In the second theme, we will extend our studies of Dachsous and investigate whether it
regulates gastrulation movements by promoting microtubule dynamics. Using Dachsous endogenously tagged
with GFP, we will carry out proteomic studies to isolate endogenous interactors, and genome editing to define
its critical regions. In a parallel unbiased genetic approach, we will continue a promising genetic screen for
maternal and maternal-zygotic mutations that impair embryogenesis and gastrulation. Altogether, our
mechanistic studies of Wnt/PCP and Dachsous regulators of planar cell polarity and unbiased genetic screens,
will both advance the MIRA mission and understanding how inductive and morphogenetic processes are
coordinated during vertebrate gastrulation. As mutations in the components of these pathways cause
miscarriages, birth defects and diseases, our studies will provide insights into their understanding and diagnosis,
and facilitate development of therapies."
11100309,"Project Summary
Growth factor (GF)-based therapies hold great promise for tissue engineering, cancer treatment, and regenera-
tive medicine but controlling their activity and selectivity can be challenging. GFs act as ligands for membrane-
receptors controlling signaling cascades that drive gene expression and cellular functions, such as proliferation
and differentiation. Tools that can selectively activate or suppress GF-mediated signaling activity in cells are
needed to achieve control over the activity of these molecules and improve their therapeutic properties. Heparan
sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (PGs), while often overlooked, are uniquely suited for this purpose, as they often
serve as coreceptors for GFs at the cell surface. By promoting the formation of complexes between GFs and
their receptors, they balance competing signaling pathways and regulate cellular responses. While the structure
and activity of HS on cells can be controlled, to some extent, through genetic engineering of their biosynthesis,
chemical tools for remodeling cell-sulfate HS to attain GF-binding specificity would be much mor general and
better suited for therapeutic applications. This project establishes such tools, termed neoPG chimeras, that will
be able to selectively activate or inhibit GF signaling activity in cells. This will be achieved by taking advantage
of the GF-binding selectivities of recombinant HS polysaccharides produced through systematic mutation of HS
biosynthetic enzymes in laboratory cell lines. The recombinant HS polysaccharides will be harvested, character-
ized for GF binding specificity and merged with functional elements for targeting to the cells. Membrane targeting
neoPG chimeras will be developed to promote GF association with receptors at the cell surface and promote GF
signaling activity (Aim 1). Lysosome-targeting neoPG chimeras will be used to drive extracellular GFs into the
cells for degradation, thus inhibiting signaling activity (Aim 2). The focus of this study will be on establishing and
validating neoPG chimeras as actuators of signaling by members of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family of pro-
teins in the context of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, many other classes of GFs require cell
surface HS for function and the new tools are expected to find broad application in many different aspects of
biomedical research and GF-based therapies."

Achieving selectivity in complexity-building transformations is critical for being able to access target molecules
with potential to impact human health such has potential drugs and chemical probes for studying biological
systems. Although significant strides have been made in developing chemical methods for complexity-building
reactions, it often remains challenging to carry out these transformations with high levels of chem-, site- and
stereoselectivity on complex or functional group dense molecules. In contrast to small molecule catalysts and
reagents, enzymes often have evolved to carry out reactions with high levels of selectivity. The discovery of
specific enzymatic reactions and development of the utility of these catalysts has the potential to enable to
synthetic strategies and grant us access to new molecules with potent biological activity. This proposal
describes several strategies for developing robust enzyme-mediated reactions and leveraging these tools for
the streamlined synthesis of molecules with pharmaceutical potential.
The goal of this NIGMS proposal is to provide synthetic chemists with highly selective, efficient, well-
characterized and sustainable biocatalytic methods to be planned into synthetic approaches toward target
molecules. Using enzymes from natural product biosynthetic pathways and targeted protein families as a
starting point, we will elucidate the natural chemical function and mechanism of a given enzyme. From this
initial benchmark, we use bioinformatic tools, structural analysis, computational modeling, and evolutionary
approaches to assemble panels of complementary biocatalysts of utility to the synthetic community. We
subsequently seek to use the platform provided by each protein class to design new reactions and apply these
methods to the streamlined synthesis of molecules relevant to human health. My group seeks biocatalytic
solutions to reactions that continue to challenge modern synthetic chemists including selective C–H
hydroxylation, site- and stereoselective oxidative dearomatization, and the chemo- and stereoselective
derivatization of α-amino acids. Moving forward, we continue to work in these areas and are seeking to
develop biocatalytic C–C bond forming reactions, C–H functionalization reactions beyond hydroxylation, and
strategies for building and elaborating functional group dense molecules such as nucleotides.
In summary, this proposal describes the development of chemo-, site- and stereoselective transformations
mediated by enzymes. These methods will directly enable the synthesis of complex biologically active
molecules relevant to human health."

11100868,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The purpose of an internal circadian clock is to generate a series of phases - time markers across the
day and night by which di9erent aspects of physiology and behavior (e.g., sleep, hormone release, temperature
elevations) may be aligned to local time for optimal e9iciency. We know a great deal about the molecular mechanisms
of the clock (the timekeeping system) and how it is sensitive to local time. We know much less about circadian output,
and speciﬁcally how the clock generates multiple phases across the entire solar day. Such phases are used by other
clock cells, and by non-clock bearing downstream cells and circuits. Our laboratory studies circadian neurophysiology
and the overall goal of this project is to understand the generation and usage of di9erent circadian phasic outputs. The
work is performed in the model system Drosophila. It builds on observations and a model we created from our past
studies of the neural circuit in the Drosophila brain that controls daily locomotor behavior. In the ﬂy brain, ~150
dedicated circadian pacemaker neurons direct daily rhythmic physiology and behavior. These 150 pacemakers are
highly synchronized: they all tell the same time. Our model features the cell-intrinsic molecular clock in all pacemakers
directing a morning phase of heightened neuronal activity. Yet, di9erent subsets of pacemakers are not all active in the
morning, but at di9erent and stereotyped times of the day and night. The diversity of active periods (circadian phases)
is generated primarily by cell interactions (especially neuropeptide modulation) and together these activity periods
represent the multi-phasic outputs of the pacemaker system. Overall, this research program aims to extend and test
this model by providing a cell- and molecular-level understanding for how circadian phase information is transmitted
beyond the pacemaker system and received by downstream target circuits. Our work in Drosophila will likely inform our
understanding of circadian output in the mammalian brain, and will also be relevant more generally to the mechanisms
of neural circuit modulation by neuropeptides."

Refractive errors are a major cause of vision loss worldwide, and the rising prevalence of myopia and
associated blinding conditions is a significant public health concern. Regulation of ocular axial growth is critical
for normal refractive development to ensure that a focused image falls directly on the retina. Our goal is to
decode the molecular and genetic program that governs ocular axial growth. Ocular growth is driven by an
intrinsic, genetic process during prenatal and postnatal development (vision-unadjusted) and by a postnatal,
vision-guided process, emmetropization, thought to interact with intrinsic ocular growth such that the eye's
axial length matches its optical power. Enhanced intrinsic ocular growth and defective emmetropization are
thought to cause a mismatch between ocular axial length and optical power, leading to myopia. Ocular axial
growth relies on signals from the retina to the sclera to promote extracellular matrix remodeling and ocular
elongation. However, the mechanisms by which the signals translate to ocular axial growth remain elusive. Our
studies suggest that PRSS56, a secreted serine protease, is a component of the intrinsic machinery that
supports ocular axial growth. However, it is not known whether Prss56 has a direct role in emmetropization.
We propose to uncover the molecular and cellular processes underlying PRSS56-dependent refractive
development and associated errors and assess the role of PRSS56 in vision-guided ocular growth.
Despite evidence that altered expression of PRSS56 affects ocular axial length, the factors that regulate its
expression and mediate its effect are not known. The Wnt-mediated pathway is associated with myopia
pathogenesis, and we have found that Prss56 responds to Wnt signaling agonists. In Aim 1, we will elucidate
the link between Wnt and Prss56 by modulating WNT activity in genetic mouse models and studying the effect
on the retinal expression of PRSS56 and ocular growth (Aim 1.1). We will also determine, in conditional mouse
models, whether retinal pigment epithelium–localized Serpine3—which we identified as a candidate mediator
of PRSS56-dependent growth—helps relay PRSS56-dependent signals that support ocular growth (Aim 1.2).
In Aim 2, we will characterize the function of PRSS56 to guide the identification of its substrate(s) and targeted
therapies. In Aim 3, we will test the role of PRSS56 in emmetropization and PRSS56-dependent regulation of
ocular axial growth by temporarily inactivating PRSS56 in conditional mutant mice and using experimental
paradigms that induce axial elongation in response to visual blur or optical defocus.
The proposed studies will provide a molecular and genetic framework to understand the mechanisms of ocular
growth and guide us to potential therapeutic targets to manage myopia."
11088959,"Project Summary
 The central nervous system regulates gonadotropin secretion through neurosecretion of gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is synthesized in preoptic and periventricular neurons, transported via
intertwined processes that distribute as axonal-vascular terminals in the median eminence and released into the
hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vasculature. GnRH binds receptors on gonadotropes to stimulate secretion and
synthesis of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Neurosecretion of GnRH is
pulsatile and is obligatory for sustaining normal gonadotropin secretion and synthesis.
 Kisspeptin (KISS1) neurons are a major GnRH afferent network that activates GnRH neurons during
puberty, maintains GnRH release during adulthood, and transduces negative and positive feedback actions of
gonadal steroids. In our studies we will test the hypothesis that KISS1 neurons, specifically those in the arcuate
nucleus (ARC) that co-express the peptides neurokinin B (NKB) and prodynorphin (PDyn) (KNDy neurons),
function as a GnRH pulse generator (Aim 1), with NKB mediating synchronized activation of KNDy cells (Aim 2)
and dynorphin terminating each pulse discharge (Aim 3). These studies are significant because they will provide
information on the cellular circuitries that govern GnRH pulse generation, and thus will shed new light on the
pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying neuroendocrine-based fertility disorders, such as absent, delayed, or
precocious puberty, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, or polycystic ovary syndrome, and in the longer term,
point to new potential targets for intervention in these reproductive impairments.
 The proposed studies will use powerful genetic tools to dissect and characterize the functional
components of the kisspeptin-GnRH pulse generating system. To define the key elements of the pulse generator,
we will utilize innovative genetically modified mouse models, each enabling an analysis of the consequences of
kisspeptin neuron-specific gene deletion. We will first study the role of the KNDy neuronal population using a
Kiss1fl/fl mouse recently created in our laboratory. This mouse will be bred to a prodynorphin Cre (Pdyn-IRES-
Cre21,2) mouse, hereafter Pdyn-Cre, to eliminate Kiss1 in KNDy neurons. We have also developed a novel
mouse bearing a doxycycline-inducible kisspeptin-Cre allele (iKiss-Cre mouse) that will enable temporal control
over the selective deletion of genes from Kiss1 neurons. Two other lines, a NKBfl/fl mouse (developed in our
laboratory) and an Oprk1fl/fl mouse (Jackson labs) will be crossed to Kiss1-Cre or iKiss-Cre mice to generate
mice that will allow us to analyze the effects of kisspeptin neuron-specific deletion of NKB and Oprk1 on GnRH-
triggered LH pulses. We will also use the iKiss-Cre mouse to delete and study the roles of steroid receptors in
kisspeptin neurons in the adult. This temporally controlled gene deletion will eliminate a longstanding technical
limitation of conventional steroid receptor knockout models in which steroid regulation of the axis is confounded
by steroid developmental and organizational effects in the axis."

One-in-five children and adolescents in the United States (US) live in rural areas where they experience
approximately two times the risk of suicide compared with their urban-residing peers. Despite having increased
rates of mental and behavioral health conditions, less than half of rural-residing youth with these conditions
receive necessary treatment, due in part to shortages of pediatric services and clinicians. Firearms are the
most lethal means of suicide, and high rates of firearm ownership in rural regions contribute further to rural-
urban disparities in youth suicide risk. Given barriers to community-based mental healthcare, youth with
suicidal ideation and/or attempt increasingly present to emergency departments (EDs) for care. While several
national organizations endorse safety planning (a brief intervention that involves identification of coping
strategies, social supports, and lethal means restriction) in EDs as an evidence-based suicide prevention
intervention, implementation in rural settings requires consideration of the cultural context as well as hospital
and community resources. The overall goal of this project is to develop and implement a technology-aided
approach to safety planning that will specifically address two social determinants of health – home safety and
access to community mental healthcare – to decrease suicide risk in youth 12-17 years of age who present to
rural EDs. To achieve this goal, investigators will: (i) conduct focus groups and interviews with rural-residing
youth, their caregivers, clinicians, and community members to ascertain their priorities and perspectives about
how to optimize safety planning, including lethal means counseling and community resource connections, in
rural EDs; (ii) apply principles of human centered co-design to develop and test a youth- and caregiver-facing
tablet-based digital intervention to guide safety planning, using mixed methods to investigate its feasibility,
acceptability, and appropriateness, and to evaluate participant-reported self-efficacy to improve suicide-related
coping and home safety (target mechanisms); and (iii) conduct a type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness
study using a hospital-randomized stepped wedge design in four rural EDs to determine the effectiveness of
this intervention compared to usual care for youth with suicidality, evaluating the extent to which outcomes are
mediated by caregiver and youth self-efficacy, and assessing the reach, adoption, implementation and
maintenance of the intervention using a mixed methods approach. Primary outcomes, measured one and three
months following the ED visit, will include youth-reported suicide risk, evaluated using a validated instrument,
and caregiver-reported access to firearms and medications within the home. These aims are directly aligned
with the goals of this funding announcement to “develop, adapt, or implement intervention strategies
addressing social determinants of health to improve health and promote health equity in rural populations,”
addressing critical rural-urban disparities in youth suicide risk and firearm mortality."
11092659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulatory T cell (Treg) infusion, alongside solid organ transplantation, is an emerging strategy which focuses
on rebalancing the Treg ratio in the transplanted organ to prevent rejection or loss. However, developing effective
therapeutics using live cells necessitates means to determine their in vivo biodistribution, persistence, and
efficacy after administration. Clinicians do not know the fate of injected cells, thus, interpreting cases of non-
responding patients remains a barrier to wider use.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only technique that is radiation-free, clinically translatable, and
enables direct visualization of labeled cells in vivo. Due to the clinical translation potential, MRI applications and
contrast agent development continue to see remarkable growth, especially in the cell tracking sphere.
Through this diversity supplement, our goal is to design, synthesize and characterize a novel click functional
dextran coated superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles for in-vivo T cell tracking by 1H MRI.. We will
develop a novel Fe3O4 nanoparticle platform containing T cell directing functionalities for enhanced cell uptake
and improved contrast in MR imaging. Synthesis and derivatization of dextran coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles with
CD4, CD8 or CD25 click chemistry functionality will provide a platform to be used for T cell labeling and tracking.
Decorated nanoparticles will be optimized and tested in cell culture assays including uptake and viability
measurements. T cell tracking and homing will be evaluated in vivo in a murine models. If successful, this
platform will allow for more precise and personalized treatment approaches, potentially increasing the overall
response rates to cell therapy. This will give clinicians adequate tools through imaging to improve patient
management and overall outcomes.
 The logical extension of this Aim would be to test longitudinal tracking capability of the cells labeled with
this new in-house probe. The rationale for developing our own platform with the CD25 target is two-fold. First, it
would minimize dependance on a patented product from Miltenyi. Second, the goal is to develop a universal
platform that would enable clicking of any target moiety of interest, such as CD4, CD8 and beyond for a multitude
of disease models, which corresponds to Brock’s comprehensive PhD thesis plan. This protected training
and research time will also provide necessary experience and education critical for Brock’s PhD trajectory
and future career as an independent scientist in academia."
11092661,"We will establish a satellite service center within a larger network according to RFAs RM-19-009 and -
010, named the CU-Boulder Center for Cryo-Electron Tomography (CCET). Our satellite will focus on cryo-
specimen preparation and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) applied to cells, organelles and large
supramolecular assemblies. The applicants combine the expertise of three P.I.s, Michael Stowell (high-
resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)), Karolin Luger (biochemistry of large complex assemblies,
especially protein-nucleic acid interactions), and Andreas Hoenger (former P41 director, cryo-EM and cryo-ET
from macromolecules to cells and tissues). With our current staff, we combine extensive expertise with cryo-ET
and relevant software. We will offer a broad range of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-ET
preparation procedures for cellular structures and intracellular macromolecular assemblies, as well as training
opportunities for scientists who would like to establish these technologies, or at least part of them, for their home
labs. Here in Boulder, we have several high-end microscopes available, including a newly installed Titan-Krios.
Three of our microscopes are equipped with direct electron detectors. In addition, we have a comprehensive
periphery for cryo-specimen preparation, storage, and handling resources, including computational tools. We
will add cryo-Focused Ion Beam (cryo-FIB) milling to produce vitrified lamellae of cells and tissues. We propose
the following organization of the facility: Specific Aim 1: Cryo-ET specimen preparation methods offered
for service: Our technology and expertise will be made accessible for our users and for further collaborations
with the data collection hub proposed in a parallel RFA (RM-19-010). Specific Aim 2: Cross-training
opportunities for service users: We will offer comprehensive training for users, including one-on-one
instruction on microscopes and related equipment. As appropriate, we will pool users into small groups and run
a training week as a hands-on workshop on equipment as well as related software developed by our facility such
as Serial-EM, IMOD and PEET. While the emphasis with training will be on practical aspects of specimen
preparation and data collection, we often encounter novice users in strong need for a thorough introduction into
image analysis software as well. Specific Aim 3: Administration and organization of the facility: Users,
assigned to us via the network-wide application process will have the opportunity to participate in the specimen
refinement process, and receive training on the cryo-ET processes involved. Projects with high potential will be
referred for high-throughput data collection to the central hub facility of the network. Boulder, Colorado is centrally
located and well-connected nationwide through Denver International Airport."

The parent award aims to study transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of cellular survival and adaptation
under stress using lineage barcoding, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics. Budget cuts have
limited the number of cancer models and cell lines studied, potentially impacting the generalizability of the
findings. This Equipment Supplement requests funds to purchase an Element AVITI System, a transformative
next-generation sequencing platform that will overcome these limitations and enhance the impact of the parent
award. The AVITI System's unique Avidity Base Chemistry delivers high-quality sequencing data while
dramatically reducing costs. Its acquisition will enable lineage tracing and sequencing on more cancer models
and stressors, improve data quality for precise barcode assignment, and accelerate experimental workflows.
We are requesting $250,000 towards the total cost of $290,000, with the Shaffer lab covering the remaining
$40,000 (see letter). This purchase will have the greatest impact on the research if supported now at the start
of the award. The AVITI System will be housed in the Shaffer lab, which has extensive experience in operating
similar equipment. Cost savings from transitioning to the AVITI platform will allow the project to achieve more
of its initial goals without exceeding the sequencing consumables budget. Long-term sustainability for the
service contract expenses will be ensured through cost-sharing agreements with other labs, UPenn Institutes,
and departments."
11098331,"ABSTRACT
Elevated plasma LDL cholesterol is the main risk factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD), the
leading cause of death in the United States. Cholesterol levels are regulated by complex feedback
mechanisms that help maintain cellular and plasma cholesterol levels in check. While
transcriptional mechanisms that control cholesterol homeostasis, such as SREBPs and LXRs are
well described, here we describe a novel post-transcriptional mechanism that is involved in
controlling the mRNA stability of Ldlr mRNA. We have identified a family of RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) that target specifically mRNAs and are important in cholesterol homeostasis. We show
that hepatic loss of one or more of these RBPs in the liver results in increased levels of LDLR
mRNA and protein. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify the direct mRNA targets in vivo using CLIP-
Seq and we will perform functional genomics to determine the effect of human variants in the
LDLR 3’UTR. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend our preliminary data showing that loss of one of
our RBPs in the liver profoundly protects from atherosclerosis. Using a ‘humanized’ lipoprotein
mouse atherosclerosis model, we have developed the hypothesis that loss of our RBP in the liver
promotes uptake of LDL particles, thus protecting from atherosclerosis. Further, we hypothesize
that the internalized cholesterol is then preferentially catabolized to bile acids. Thus, our mouse
model will allow us to better understand how the liver channels cholesterol taken up from LDL
particles to ultimately protect from CVD."
11099275,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT. This Equipment Supplement project seeks to acquire a high-resolution
fluorescent microscope to advance the goals of my R35 MIRA project. The MIRA supported research program
focuses on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of tissue injury
mediated by meprin metalloproteases. Two goals in the project rely heavily on microscopic imaging technology
with complementary software for quantitation of the staining intensity as a measure of protein expression
levels. Meprins comprise of two subunits, α and β, which form two protein isoforms, meprin A (α-α or α-β) and
meprin B (β-β) with distinct and overlapping substrates. Meprins are most abundantly expressed in the brush-
border membranes of proximal kidney tubules and small intestines. Meprins are also expressed in leukocytes
(monocytes and macrophages), podocytes, skin, endothelial cells, and cancer cells. Meprins have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory- and fibrosis-associated diseases that include kidney
disease, inflammatory bowel disease, lung fibrosis, neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), and
cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the meprin β gene were shown to associate with severity
of certain diseases such as diabetic kidney disease and cancer. My research group uses a combination of
molecular biology and proteomic approaches to identify meprin substrates and characterize the interactions
between meprin isoforms and their substrates. These are coupled with in vivo studies with meprin knockout
mouse models to determine how meprin activity impacts the progression of disease. Known meprin substrates
include extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, modulators of inflammation (e.g. proinflammatory cytokines [IL-1β,
IL-6, IL-18, MCP-1; and anti-inflammatory proteins Ac-SDKP), cell signaling proteins (e.g. protein kinase A and
protein kinase C), mediators of the hypoxia response (e.g. osteosarcoma-9), tight junction proteins (e.g.
claudin 5, occludin, E-cadherin, and Z0-1) cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. villin and actin) and proteins that
contribute to plaques in AD (e.g. amyloid precursor protein and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells
2). The diversity of meprins substrates suggests that complex mechanisms are involved under different
conditions and in different organs. It’s important to gain understanding of these mechanisms to facilitate
development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. For the MIRA proposal, we are conducting studies in three
areas; (i) to determine how SNPS in the meprin β gene impact its interactions with substrates and
physiological sheddases, (ii) determine how meprin interactions with substrates modulate signaling pathways
and impact responses in hypoxia, inflammation, and ECM metabolism, and (iii) to evaluate the use of meprin
and meprin cleavage products as biomarkers for development of diagnostic tools for early detection of disease.
The proposed research transcends basic (in vitro and in vivo) to gain insights on the basis for genetic
predispositions associated with meprins. Translational studies are also proposed to apply this knowledge in
development of diagnostic tools applicable to kidney injury and neurodegeneration as occurs in dementias and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, the MIRA award facilitates mentoring of trainees from
underrepresented minority populations and thus promote diversity of the biomedical workforce."
11099360,"Project Summary
 The broad goal of our lab is to obtain a systems-level understanding of cellular organization and develop
proteomics technology that facilitates this research. Thanks to the human genome project, we have a nearly
complete parts list of all molecules making up cells, but we still very poorly understand how these molecules
come together and elegantly organize into a living system. So far, this organization has been studied mainly by
looking carefully at one protein at a time. While this approach has been tremendously successful, it cannot
address the higher levels of complexity in biological systems that arise from the interplay of a myriad of
components. Looking at one molecule at a time can severely hinder understanding biology. Instead, we
investigate the entire system all at once. Recent progress in multiplexed proteomics enables us to observe
thousands of proteins simultaneously among multiple conditions. Combined with classical biochemical
approaches, we can reveal collective behavior and emergent properties that we would not have discovered
otherwise. My lab is broadly interested in systems-level cellular organization. Towards this goal, this proposal
contains two parts.
 The first part of this proposal outlines how we intend to improve quantitative proteomics technology.
Proteomics has become very powerful. Nevertheless, severe shortcomings concerning sensitivity, data quality,
and accessibility remain. We strive to address these problems. Over the last year, we have developed a new
method for quantitative shotgun proteomics (TMTproC), producing data with unmatched sensitivity and
measurement quality while reducing cost. Next, we aim to make TMTproC compatible with entry-level mass
spectrometers, which has the potential to democratize quantitative proteomics. Furthermore, we propose to fuse
TMTproC with data-independent acquisition (DIA). We anticipate that this will fuse the benefits of both
approaches: a method delivering the exquisite measurement quality of multiplexed proteomics with the infinite
scalability of DIA.
 The second part describes how we aim to apply our technological advances toward understanding
systems-level mechanisms. First, we will integrate passive diffusion and active transport models through the
nuclear pore to predict how the entire proteome partitions between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Second, we aim
to integrate all levels of protein abundance control aspects for every gene – transcription, translation, and protein
degradation. We will focus on protein turnover, the technically most difficult to measure of these parameters.
Ultimately, we aim to determine how protein expression levels are controlled for each gene as a fertilized zygote
develops into an embryo with a fully defined body plan. These measurements will provide us with fundamental
insight into the regulation and organization of developing embryos in health and disease."

LIM Domain Kinases: Regulation and Substrate Recognition
ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic cells interpret extracellular and intrinsic cues to effect remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, a process
critical for controlling cell morphology, movement, and invasiveness. Tight control of signaling pathways
impinging on the cytoskeleton is therefore essential to normal development and homeostasis. The RHO family
GTPases RHO, RAC and CDC42 each directly activate kinases (RHO kinases, PAKs, and MRCKs) in a spatially
restricted manner that in turn directly phosphorylate and activate the LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2).
These kinase signaling cascades ultimately converge on phosphorylation of the cofilin/ADF (actin-
depolymerizing factor) group of proteins, key molecules that mediate remodeling of actin filaments. Over the
previous two periods we have leveraged the highly complementary expertise of our two laboratories to provide
significant advances in two main areas: understanding the specificity and regulation of p21-activated kinases
(PAKs) and revealing the basis for selective targeting of cofilin by LIMKs. We will now target our efforts toward
answering outstanding questions that remain regarding regulation and function of LIMKs. Our preliminary data
suggest that an intramolecular interaction between a LIM-PDZ module and the kinase domain, potentially
involving evolutionarily conserved binding surfaces, is responsible for suppressing LIMK catalytic activity.
Combining biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based approaches, we will address the hypothesis that disruption
of this interaction results in activation of the LIM kinases, and we will reveal the structural basis for LIMK
autoregulation. We will further investigate recent evidence that LIMKs can phosphorylate both Ser and Tyr
residues by X-ray crystallography of LIMK-substrate complexes and molecular dynamics simulations. In this way
LIMKs will serve as a general model for understanding substrate recognition by the various “dual specificity”
kinase families. Finally, we will investigate the myotonic dystrophy related CDC42-binding protein kinases
(MRCKs), a major group of LIMK activating kinases downstream of the GTPase CDC42, about which little is
currently known. We will use structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches to define the basic architecture
of MRCKβ studies and to probe how its activation is coupled to interactions with LIMKs through substrate adaptor
proteins. Overall, our studies will provide a substantial advance in our molecular level understanding of signaling
pathways downstream of the RHO family GTPases that impinge on regulation of the actin cytoskeleton."
11099368,"Summary
The parent R35 research program aims to develop innovative methods and tools for the
comparative analysis of molecular sequences. The focus is on creating machine-learning
methods to perform big data analytics, gaining biological insights, and comparing these with
traditional model-based methods in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. A key development in
this program is the Evolutionary Sparse Learning (ESL) framework, designed to enhance
molecular evolutionary analyses. Although ESL has been benchmarked against classical
methods using high-performance computing (HPC) resources, benchmarking against advanced
deep learning (DL) approaches remains infeasible due to the need for substantial computational
power. To address this, we request a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cluster to enable DL
analyses essential for advancing our research. Two major example projects highlight the need for
this system. The first project focuses on discovering fragile clades and causal sequences in
phylogenomics. We have developed metrics for gene-species sequence concordance and clade
probability using ESL models, validated across many phylogenomic datasets. Benchmarking
these ESL methods against DL approaches, such as MSA Transformer, is crucial. MSA
Transformer captures phylogenetic relationships using multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) but
requires refinement for orthologous protein sets, demanding a powerful GPU system. The second
project aims to uncover molecular convergences that parallel organismal convergent evolution.
Using ESL, we have built genetic models to understand the independent origins of traits such as
C4 photosynthesis in grasses and echolocation in mammals. Benchmarking revealed that current
methods, including ESL, are limited in detecting convergences involving different residues at
different sites. Therefore, we are developing ESL approaches leveraging DL-generated protein
embeddings to infer non-identical sequence convergence. Fine-tuning general DL models for
orthologous sequences requires a dedicated GPU cluster, as existing resources are inadequate
for the extensive analyses needed. The requested GPU cluster is essential for refining these DL
models and conducting comprehensive analyses, enhancing the impact and scope of our parent
grant. Our experienced team and institutional support ensure effective use and maintenance of
the equipment, promoting continued advancements in molecular evolutionary analysis."
11099282,"Summary
 Our research seeks to uncover the molecular mechanisms of activation and modulation of two dimeric
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), human GABAB receptor and human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).
The GABAB receptor is ubiquitous in the central nervous system, responsible for mediating slow and prolonged
synaptic inhibition. Defects in GABAB receptor have been implicated in brain and behavioral disorders,
including spasticity, epilepsy, addiction, and anxiety. CaSR maintains a stable Ca2+ level in the blood.
Abnormal activities of the CaSR are associated with a vareity of Ca2+ homeostatic disorders including
potentially life threatening hypercalcemic conditions. Both receptors function as obligatory dimers and contain
large extracellular domains that are responsible for orthosteric ligand binding. Fundamental questions remain
regarding how an extracellular stimulus propagates a signal across the membrane through such a dimeric
GPCR system. Building on our structural models for the extracellular domains of each receptor, we plan to
determine full-length structures of these GPCRs, including their transmembrane domains, in multiple functional
states. For each receptor, we aim to address three main questions: (1) how the dimeric interactions control
receptor activation, (2) what the mode of coupling between each receptor and its cognitive G protein is, and (3)
how allosteric modulators and auxiliary proteins regulate receptor function. We will combine structural and
functional approaches to understand the molecular basis of ligand-induced activation in each receptor system.
Our findings will ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutics for treating diseases associated with
the GABAB and CaSR."
11099120,"The conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia is required for the global nitrogen cycle and is accomplished biologically
by nitrogenase enzymes. Although highly inert, dinitrogen is “fixed” by nitrogenase enzymes, and made
biologically available, allowing uptake to form key nutrients necessary to sustain life. The nitrogenase enzyme
active site features a multi-metallic core contained within a complex network of amino acids, which are necessary
to orchestrate a series of multi-proton, multi-electron transfers to small molecule substrates during the reduction
process. Although crucial for dinitrogen reduction, the precise molecular role that these secondary interactions
serve to promote reduction is not well known. More explicitly, the scientific community does not precisely know
where and how substrates bind, how electrons are delivered, and products released. Thus, there is an inherent
gap in our knowledge underlying key contributors to nitrogenase reactivity. To address this gap, this proposal
targets the design and study of small molecular constructs that contain highly directed and variable secondary
coordination sphere interactions. We will use a rational design approach to prepare synthetic analogues that
feature modifiable appended functionality (hydrogen-bond donors, Lewis acids/bases) in the secondary
coordination sphere environment to evaluate cooperative reactivity. We will use these molecular structures to
test key mechanistic hypotheses regarding the molecular-level reduction of substrates using secondary-sphere
cooperativity. We propose that the same type of interactions evaluated in our synthetic systems that promote
nitrogenase-type activity can be, by extension, adapted to describe biological systems. The knowledge we
acquire will provide key needed contributions to mechanistic studies of nitrogenase function and also synthetic
nitrogenases. Substrate activation promoted by highly directed secondary sphere interactions is a broad theme
among many biocatalytic cycles, and thus, we envision that the results of our studies will have broad utility to
elucidate meaningful contributors to enzymatic reactivity."
11099135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation and persistent infection conditions have long been associated with increased risk of cancer.
Growing evidence suggests that cancer-associated inflammatory processes, such as lipid peroxidation, cause
genomic instability that can be linked to the development of carcinogenesis. Reactive species from lipid
peroxidation are known to damage DNA and form etheno-type adducts. Previously, four etheno DNA adducts
have been reported: 1,N6-ethenoadenine (εA), 3,N4-ethenocytosine (εC), 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-εG), and
N2,3-ethenoguanine (N2,3-εG). These etheno lesions are also generated by metabolites of the human carcinogen
vinyl chloride. Recently, a new etheno adduct, 3,N4-etheno-5-methylcytosine (ε5mC), was identified. It bears the
etheno damage on 5-methylcytosine, an important epigenetic marker in humans. Thus far, no information on the
repair and mutagenicity of ε5mC has been reported. Replication of the etheno lesions is known to cause
mutations and may constitute a critical step in the pathway leading to neoplastic transformation. Importantly for
cells, DNA repair pathways are the guardians of genomic integrity and function to return damaged DNA to its
canonical state. This research project focuses on two key repair pathways: base excision repair (BER) and direct
reversal repair (DRR). Most of the experiments that give rise to our current understanding of BER and DRR were
conducted using DNA oligomers. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge of how repair occurs in the context
of chromatin, where eukaryotic DNA is compacted in a complex hierarchy of DNA-protein interactions. At the
most fundamental level of chromatin organization, the nucleosome core particle (NCP) is the basic packaging
unit that is comprised of ds-DNA wrapped around a histone protein core. The overarching goal of the proposed
research is to understand how DNA sequence context and the packaging of DNA into chromatin influence repair
of the etheno adductome. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that BER and DRR enzymes repair etheno
lesions with different efficiencies, and these distinctive repair profiles are the result of 1) sequence context of the
lesion and interactions with the enzyme and 2) modulation of repair by the protein component of chromatin, the
histones. Guided by this novel hypothesis, strong preliminary data, and innovative techniques, the proposal
investigates three aims that: (1) define the sequence context effects (by considering the 5’ and 3’ neighboring
bases) of BER and DRR enzymes in unpackaged DNA oligomers; (2) characterize the repair profiles of the five
etheno adducts in NCPs; and (3) determine the extent to which tailless and variant histone proteins provide a
mechanism of modulating repair in chromatin. The results obtained in this work will explain in vivo observations
of alkylation damage profiles and contribute to our understanding of mutational hotspots and mutational
signatures. Therefore, the research has considerable translational potential to enhance our understanding of
DNA repair and the results can assist in the development of future therapeutic treatments that improve cellular
defenses against genomic instability."
11099442,"*The current equipment supplement request will not modify the original scope of funded research.
Cells are constantly exposed to exogenous and endogenous agents that chemically damage the genome. During
DNA replication, this chemical DNA damage can introduce mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and
chromosome mis-segregation events that contribute to progression of cancer and ageing. DNA interstrand cross-
links (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that covalently link the two strands of DNA and block unwinding by the
replicative CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS (CMG) helicase. These lesions are generated by cancer chemotherapeutics,
endogenous metabolites, and microbiome toxins. Deficits in ICL repair cause the bone marrow failure and cancer
predisposition syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). The products of genes implicated in FA participate in a common
ICL repair pathway that is activated when CMG collides with an ICL. Replication fork stalling at the ICL initiates
nucleolytic incisions that convert the ICL into a DNA double strand break (DSB). The DSB is itself a potential
source of genome instability that must be repaired by homologous recombination. In previous work, we used
Xenopus egg extracts to demonstrate that certain ICLs are repaired by an alternative pathway that is also
activated upon CMG collision with an ICL. In this pathway, the NEIL3 glycosylase cleaves an N-glycosyl bond in
the cross-link, resolving the ICL without DSB formation but generating a labile abasic (AP) site. Our work
indicated that the NEIL3 pathway is the preferred response for resolving a subset of ICLs, though the FA pathway
can process these lesions when NEIL3 is inactivated. We further showed that the AP site produced by NEIL3
forms a DNA-protein cross-link with the HMCES protein, which stabilizes the AP site and regulates mutagenic
DNA synthesis past the AP site. These results indicate that multiple functionally distinct pathways can cooperate
to promote efficient replication-coupled repair of DNA damage. In this proposal we will use approaches spanning
biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology to investigate how repair mechanisms are coordinated at the
replication fork during repair of physiologically- and clinically-relevant DNA lesions. In Aim 1, we will determine
the mechanisms of repair for an ICL formed by a bacteria toxin implicated in cancer progression, providing new
insight as to how the chemical structure of an ICL influences repair. In Aim 2, we will explore the repair of ICLs
by the NEIL3/HMCES pathway, including examining how this pathway is activated and how it regulates ICL
repair outcomes. In Aim 3, we will examine how HMCES regulates AP site metabolism and contributes to
genome stability in cells. These experiments will provide a deeper understanding of how different biochemical
repair activities are integrated at stalled replication forks. This work has the potential to inform therapeutic
interventions that modulate replication-coupled repair to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy or halt
progression of diseases caused by DNA repair deficiencies."

This BLI system is capable of quantitative measurements of binding kinetics and affinity with very
small amounts of proteins. The project supported by the parent R35 grant is focused on study
the structures and regulatory mechanisms of transmembrane receptors critical for the
development and functions of the nervous system, cardiovascular system and immune system,
including but not limited to plexin and VEGF receptor. The activation of these receptors by their
ligands and co-receptors as well as heparin sulfate proteoglycans are very complex, involving
multiple binding interfaces mediated by two or more proteins as well as glycans. The binding
affinities span a very broad range, from nanomolar to high micromolar. Quantitative
measurements of these binding events are critical for validating our cryo-electron microscopic
(cryo-EM) structures and gaining deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However,
Such measurements are difficult to do with techniques that are currently available in the lab or
accessible from the core facilities at UT Southwestern medical center, such as isothermal titration
calorimetry, which requires large amounts of proteins that are not practical for us to produce in
human cell lines. We therefore request to purchase an Octet R2 BLI system, which uses surface-
based binding measurements based on light interference that requires very small amounts of
proteins and no labelling. In addition, the system can be expanded in future to allow
simultaneous measurements of 8 samples in the 96-well format, with the capacity of high-
throughput screen of many mutants and libraries of antibodies or small molecules. This system
will greatly accelerate the progress of the parent project and may even make it possible for us to
pursue exciting new directions."
11099298,"Project Abstract
 A large portion of important drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates either originate from plants or are
synthesized from petrochemical-based products. Several natural products of significantly high value to human
life (e.g., antibiotics, pharmaceuticals like Artemisinin, anticancer agents like Taxol (paclitaxel) among others)
have been produced by organisms that are not optimal for industrial production. Although some of these natural
products can be chemically synthesized, the complex structures of several of these compounds makes chemical
synthesis difficult and commercially infeasible. As a result, there is increasing need to develop sustainable and
readily tractable technological platforms to synthesize these drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates. The
central objective of this proposal is to develop a sustainable technological platform that harnesses light energy
and biocatalysis to synthesize molecules of significant relevance to human life. We envision doing this by
establishing cyanobacterial endosymbionts within yeasts cells, such that the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
provide ATP and assimilated carbon (generated from photosynthesis) to the yeast cells, which utilize it to produce
biologically important natural products. This platform will allow us to couple the remarkable biosynthetic and
biocatalytic potential of yeast to the photosynthetic ability of cyanobacteria to develop a sustainable and simple
bioproduction platform to produce natural products of significant value to human life (vide infra). Premise: (i)
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been recently harnessed to produce high titers of biologically important
molecules such as amorphadiene and artemisinic acid, (precursors to Artemisinin) and taxadiene (a key
precursor to Taxol), (ii) we had previously developed model endosymbiosis between S. cerevisiae /E. coli to
study mitochondrial evolution are currently engineering yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis (preliminary data in
Specific Aim 1) and (iii) our preliminary data on engineering model yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis.
 In this proposal, we will focus on three key areas: (i) We have engineered experimental platform to
establish endosymbiosis between model cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus, and model budding yeast,
S. cerevisiae. We will expand this platform by engineering novel cyanobacterial mutants as putative
endosymbionts. We will extensively characterize the engineered yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis to develop
strategies to improve their stability, growth rate and homogeneity. (ii) We will create a metabolite-driven synthetic
communication system to control endosymbiosis and optimize our platform for metabolic engineering. (iii) We
will utilize our photosynthetic endosymbiotic platform to produce key precursors of FDA approved compounds,
Artemisinin and Taxol. These studies will be the first step towards our long-term goal of developing a
photosynthetic and genetically tractable endosymbiotic platform for the bioproduction of biologically important
novel natural products as well as molecules like biopolymers and biofuels."

The equipment supplement seeks to acquire a PromethION 24 long read sequencer to increase the impact of
the award grant. The parent proposal presented a pilot screen of more than 32K variants from myCode and
ClinVar that suggest 1-2% of exonic mutations affect splicing. The pilot study also revealed that splicing
mutations are not uniformly distributed across disease genes or even within genes. This proposal will continue
this effort on variants from UK biobank, AllofUs, ClinVar and GTEx that localize to actionable genes. Splicing
mutations do not occur uniformly across exons. The proposal seeks to map susceptibility to splicing mutations
and identify hotspot exons (exons unusually susceptible to splicing mutations) in the genome. The long read
sequencer will enable full isoform analysis which will discover complex splicing events that contain multiple
exons. In addition to identifying loss of splicing variants, the little studied problem of gain of splicing variants
(i.e. single base mutations that can activate pseudoexons) will also be explored. Preliminary studies locate
many intronic regions in pre-mRNA that contain all-but-one of the numerous cis-elements necessary for
splicing. In addition to mapping susceptibility to splicing mutations, these efforts will contribute to the basic
science of combinatorial signal recognition with a high-level approach that will define mechanisms of splice site
selection. Finally, we present a principled method of restoring splicing to mutated exons using antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO) that weaken flanking splice sites. Here again long read sequencing will be used to
study splicing in its native state and properly identify complex events."

biomedical research. In this context, oxidation and reduction reactions are among the most important and
frequently used processes in organic synthesis. However, manipulating the oxidation states of functional
groups in complex settings with high efficiency, precision, and minimal waste remains an important
challenge in modern organic chemistry. Given its many distinct characteristics, electrochemistry
represents an attractive approach to discovering new reactivities, enabling new synthetic strategies, and
meeting the prevailing trends in organic synthesis. Therefore, there exists a clear impetus for the
invention of new reaction strategies to improve the scope of synthetic electrochemistry and provide new
platforms for reaction discovery and synthetic innovations. In the past funding period, we demonstrated
a new catalytic approach that combines electrochemistry and redox-metal catalysis for the oxidative
difunctionalization of alkenes to access a diverse array of highly functionalized structures. These
promising results led us to envision that electrochemistry will ultimately emerge as a powerful tool for
solving a wide range of longstanding synthetic problems. In the new funding cycle, we aim to build upon
our previous success but move our research into new grounds. In each of the projects targeted herein,
we aim to apply electrochemistry to address a prominent challenge in organic synthesis. The
transformations targeted in this grant are either currently unknown or display salient limitations in reaction
scope or selectivity. Among the specific reactions that we aim to develop in the context of this grant are:
two- and three-component cross-electrophile couplings; asymmetric synthesis and late-stage
functionalization of N-containing compounds; and regioselective C–H functionalization of pyridines. In
addition, in-depth studies using canonical physical organic and electroanalytical techniques will provide
insights into the reaction mechanisms. The development and mechanistic understanding of these
proposed transformations will represent significant advances for the field of organic synthesis."

High optical transparency, low light-scattering and low autofluorescence of mammalian tissues in the near-
infrared spectral range open up the possibility for non-invasive imaging, sensing and light-regulation of cellular
biochemistry, tissue metabolism and physiology in mammals. Due to near-infrared absorption and the use of
heme-derived biliverdin produced in all mammalian tissues as a chromophore, bacterial phytochromes are
currently the preferred molecular templates for the development of genetically encoded optical reagents for in
vivo applications. Here we propose a variety of near-infrared imaging probes and optogenetic tools. We will
focus on the development of fluorescent proteins with higher brightness, greater bathochromic shift and
exhibiting photoconversion, as well as on the search for new natural near-infrared absorbing proteins as initial
templates. These probes should lead to deeper and spatiotemporally precise in vivo imaging. We will also
focus on the visualization and manipulation of endogenous molecules in cells and whole organisms using
antigen-stabilized fusions of near-infrared fluorescent proteins with genetically encoded nanobodies. This will
allow background-free detection of various intracellular antigens and antigen-dependent regulation of protein
and cellular functions. In addition, we will develop near-infrared optogenetic modules with improved
performance in mammalian cells and use them to engineer light-controlled enzymes, receptors and cells. This
should open up possibilities for user-defined regulation of cellular and organismal functions in vivo. All
proposed near-infrared probes will spectrally complement existing reagents in the visible range. Planned
studies will also expand our basic knowledge of photochemistry and light-induced signaling of phytochrome
photoreceptors. Novel genetically encoded near-infrared fluorescent probes and optogenetic tools will drive the
development of more sensitive in vivo imaging and light-control technologies, optimization of gene delivery
strategies, development of targeted non-invasive illumination, and refinement of optical readouts in tissues and
animals."

Our proposed research seeks to understand the evolutionary origin and capacity to adapt of complex
molecular machines. It is challenging to comprehend how protein function, which depends on finely tuned
cooperativity between many components, is adapted and altered as an organism evolves. That is, how does
evolution satisfy the demands of high performance while maintaining the capacity for diversification and
adaptive specialization? To gain insight into these processes we plan to carry out high-throughput mutagenesis
and functional studies of a set of proteins involved in DNA replication.
High-speed DNA replication relies on proteins known as sliding clamps, which are proteins that encircle DNA
and can diffuse rapidly along the double-helix without dissociating from it. Because the sliding clamps form
closed circles, they do not readily associate with DNA on their own. Sliding clamps are opened and loaded
onto the start sites of DNA replication by ATP-driven molecular machines called clamp loaders. Clamp loaders
are members of an evolutionarily ancient family of ATP-dependent molecular machines called AAA+ ATPases,
which are a diverse set of proteins that transduce ATP binding and hydrolysis into mechanical action on
proteins. Because the DNA polymerase clamp-loaders are very well understood in terms of their three-
dimensional structures, they are excellent models for understanding intramolecular force transmission as well
as, more generally, the evolution of complex protein machines. The central goal of this proposal is to develop
an understanding of the mechanisms and evolutionary divergence of such complex protein machines, leading
to advances in our ability to predict and control the behaviors of cellular systems in both normal and disease
states.
The T4 bacteriophage (T4) is a small virus that infects the E. coli bacterium. The T4 genome encodes its own
DNA replication proteins, including a sliding clamp and clamp loader, proteins that are closely related to their
counterparts in eukaryotic cells, including human cells. We have developed and validated a powerful high-
throughput functional assay for the T4 bacteriophage (T4) clamp loader system. This platform opens up many
avenues to investigate mechanism and design principles in a proper biological context. We will use high-
throughput mutagenesis to map mutational sensitivity and allosteric coupling in the clamp loader and examine
the conservation of these properties in a very divergent AAA+ ATPase, a protein that controls transcription in
bacteria. We will use statistical models trained on genome sequences to infer the essential constraints on and
between amino acids in clamp loaders and test these inferences in a biological context. The aims of this
project represent a unified body of work to use new assay systems to understanding clamp loader and AAA+
mechanism, and to test the potential of emerging sequence-based models for understanding and engineering
complex macromolecular machines."

Systemic and structural racism is a public health crisis. However, little is known about the impact of
structural racism and discrimination (SRD) on the health and emotional well-being of individuals across the life
course. While prior studies have shown associations between discrimination and negative health outcomes in
adults (e.g., cardiometabolic disease, depression), these studies have been cross-sectional and primarily
examined individual-level sources of racism and discrimination. Much more research is needed to fill gaps
in our understanding about the relationship between SRD and health disparities before interventions
can be developed. To significantly advance the field regarding SRD and health equity, studies need to
include: (1) multi-level measures of SRD including individual (both intrapersonal and interpersonal),
neighborhood, institutional, and societal/policy levels; (2) rigorous mixed-methods designs (e.g., ecological
momentary assessment (EMA), biological measures, geographic information system (GIS) data, surveys); (3)
multi-site samples with urban and rural participants; (4) a life course approach; (5) whole-person outcome
measures (i.e., mental, physical, behavioral health); and (6) longitudinal study designs. Including these study
elements will allow for comprehensively examining the relationships between SRD and health and emotional
well-being to identify mechanisms to target in interventions to mitigate SRD. The main objective of the
proposed study is to examine multiple levels (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,
societal/policy) of SRD and associations with mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes across
the life course to identify intervention targets to promote health equity. The proposed study is built on a
prospective longitudinal cohort study of 627 racially/ethnically diverse families (i.e., African American, Hispanic,
Native American, Immigrant/Refugee, White) across the life course (childhood, adolescence,
adulthood/parenthood) from urban settings (i.e., Minneapolis, St. Paul). The parent R01 already has three
time-points of mixed-methods data (i.e., EMA, GIS, survey) that includes discrimination and neighborhood
segregation measures and physical and behavioral health outcomes carried out using a community-based
participatory approach. For the proposed study, a sample of 300 racially/ethnically diverse families from rural
Georgia (i.e., Athens) will be added to compare SRD experiences in urban versus rural settings. In addition,
cardiometabolic and stress biomarker data (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, HbA1C,
cytokines) and multi-level measures of structural racism (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,
societal/policy) will be added at two time points, 18 months apart. The proposed study will be one of the first to
prospectively measure multiple levels of SRD using mixed-methods across two sites and associations with
mental, physical, and behavioral health disparities across the life course in diverse families. Results of the
study will inform the development of an intervention targeting multi-level SRDs to promote health equity."
11100555,"Significant gaps exist in our understanding of normal aging processes, the impact of these processes on health
trajectories, and the influence of exposures as individual’s age. These gaps must be addressed to devise
effective therapies that increase health-span. It is well-established that the earliest exposures affecting health-
span occur in utero during fetal development. One common challenge, maternal over nutrition (MON) during
gestation is an adverse exposure that disproportionally affects individuals from disadvantaged communities.
The long-term impacts of MON are important in public health, but difficult to determine in humans due to
extensive confounding by multiple environmental and social factors. The baboon is a nonhuman primate (NHP)
species highly similar to humans in genetics, physiology, and metabolism, and naturally develops age-
associated diseases. We have been studying baboons longitudinally to examine the impact of a Western diet
on age-associated diseases, and dissect the impact of MON on health-span. In Cycle 1 of this U19 we
hypothesized that MON leads to accelerated aging, but with similar trajectories to normal aging. Our studies
have shown that in utero MON developmentally programs (DP) molecular, cellular, and functional processes,
leading to fundamentally different aging processes and trajectories compared to healthy aging animals. An
understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms that differ due to exposures is essential for development of
therapies that target appropriate systems. In Cycle 2 of the U19 we propose to integrate discoveries from
molecules with whole animal measures to better understand established and novel hallmarks of aging. For
these planned studies in Cycle 2 to be feasible, it is essential that we maintain the unique cohort of MON
animals and their age-matched controls. The requested bridge funds will cover animal per diems of the cohort
to guarantee that these animals are not assigned to other studies at the Southwest National Primate Research
Center during the NCE of our U19 program."

Iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) enzymes, representing a superfamily of non-heme mononuclear
iron-containing (NHM-Fe) enzymes, have garnered strong research interests from fundamental enzyme
mechanism studies to bioengineering/biocatalysis explorations in recent years due to their exceedingly diverse
catalytic reactivities and simple enzyme architectures. Radical halogenation reactions via C-H bond activation
catalyzed by Fe/2OG halogenases are particularly attractive for chemical synthesis and biocatalysis applications,
since these enzymes can install carbon-halide bonds in a regio- and stereo-specific manner, a feat that has yet
to be achieved by organic synthetic methodology. As revealed by the mechanistic studies of carrier protein
dependent Fe/2OG halogenases, the key step in the radical halogenation mechanism is the selective halide
radical transfer from the hydroxo-Fe(III)-halide intermediate to the substrate radical generated by the key reactive
species, the ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) intermediate. However, a consensus mechanism to explain the selective halide
transfer in Fe/2OG halogenases has not been reached, particularly the controlling factors to avoid hydroxyl
radical transfer to lead to hydroxylation reaction are not fully revealed. Additionally, the reasons why Fe/2OG
enzymes cannot perform fluorination reaction are completely unknown. In this project, we will bridge these
knowledge gaps by studying two newly discovered carrier protein-independent Fe/2OG halogenases that
catalyze chlorination reactions to generate halogenated nucleotide natural products and halogenated
freestanding amino acids. By using an integrative approach consisting of mechanistic probe design and
synthesis, enzyme product structural determination via LC-MS and NMR analysis, transient enzyme kinetics,
advanced spectroscopic characterization and molecular dynamics simulations, we will elucidate the influence of
protein substrate interactions and dynamics in controlling efficient halogenation, explore the effect of different
iron-bound anions (e.g. Cl- vs. F-) to the electronic structure and the reactivity of the ferryl intermediate, test new
chemical strategies to enable fluorination in Fe/2OG enzymes, and expand the substrate scope of these
enzymes for potential synthetic applications. Given the importance of halogen-containing organic molecules in
the modern pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, mechanistic elucidation of these newly discovered
halogenases will lay scientific foundation for future biocatalytic applications of these unique enzymes."

This is the same as the parent award. The nervous system and immune system communicate
with each other to respond to infections and maintain immune homeostasis. Work over the last
two decades has shown that the vagus nerve is a critical pathway for neuro-immune
communication carrying motor signals descending to the body, in addition to sensory signals
ascending to the brain. Detection of immune mediators in the periphery, such as cytokines, is
thought to be vagally-mediated but it is unclear how sensory neurons respond and represent this
information in situ. The goal of the proposed studies is to discover how vagal sensory
neurons encode and represent information about specific inflammatory mediators. This
new understanding will provide crucial mechanistic insights into the nervous system
representation of immune signals, which can be used to understand what goes wrong in a host
of inflammatory disorders that involve immune dysregulation.
 With a team of experienced scientists who are experts in the neural regulation of immunity,
we will use genetically encoded calcium indicators to monitor large groups of vagal sensory
neurons while they respond to specific inflammatory mediators. We will use techniques and
tools adopted from neuroscience to determine whether these neurons encode information
using a population code or a temporal code for representing information immune-relevant
information."
11100361,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 40 million people in the United States annually are provided anesthesia for surgery. Reactive aldehydes,
produced during surgery, are toxic metabolites which drive cellular dysfunction and end organ damage. For
Asian Americans that are descents from East Asia a genetic variant (present in nearly 540 million people in the
world) severely limits reactive aldehyde metabolism. Besides inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism, several
other genetic differences occur for Asians within the lipid peroxidation pathway; a pathway which regulates
damage that occurs during organ injury. As mortality following surgery is the third leading cause of death in the
United States, with organ injury a major cause of this mortality, understanding how these genetic differences in
Asians may alter lipid peroxidation-induced organ damage could unlock novel treatment strategies for all
ethnicities to reduce organ injury occurring during surgery.
For this MIRA program, we will study the genetic differences existing within the lipid peroxidation pathway for
Asians, including the genetic variant which causes inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and the impact on
organ injury. To carry out these studies, we generated tools to study reactive aldehydes in the basic science
laboratory including a knock-in mouse model to reflect the human genetic variant that causes inefficient reactive
aldehyde metabolism and sensitive assays to detect reactive aldehydes. We will use these tools to examine
whether an analgesic given during surgery exacerbates cellular injury for rodents with inefficient aldehyde
metabolism. Further, we will also study how reactive aldehydes may impact a transient receptor potential channel
to trigger organ injury. We also expanded these aldehyde tools by developing non-invasive methods to assess
reactive aldehyde levels in humans and methods to identify phenotypes for inefficient reactive aldehyde
metabolism. We plan to use these tools in humans undergoing surgery to identify people with inefficient reactive
aldehyde metabolism and monitor their aldehyde levels during surgery in real-time. Asian Americans are one of
the fastest growing populations in the United States and are projected to reach nearly 34 million by the year
2050. Asian Americans will require specific anesthetic plans for surgeries due to genetic differences in the lipid
peroxidation pathway, including genetics which cause inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism. Providing
precision medical care for people who require surgery with this genetic variant will ultimately reduce health care
costs and improve quality of care for a large subset of Asian Americans. As we describe here, studying genetic
differences can also provide insight into biological mechanisms and unlock novel strategies that can impact
medical care for people of all ethnicities."

11100382,"Abstract (from parent grant)
The broad goal of this proposal it to computationally identify, validate, then target for therapeutic
intervention regulatory elements within the 5' untranslated regions (UTR) of protein coding genes,
known as upstream open reading frames (uORFs). In so doing, we aim to modulate the protein
output from selected genes, offering a novel, translational approach with broad potential.
uORFs are segments of 5′UTR mRNA sequences that can initiate and terminate translation
upstream of protein-coding (CDS) start codons. Rare uORFs have been shown to produce
potentially functional micro-peptides, while others affect protein expression by tuning translation
rates of downstream protein-coding sequences. Our recent work showed that uORFs exhibit
strong negative selection for preserving their start and stop codons, but not the encoded
sequence, favoring the notion that uORFs have been retained through evolution because of their
cis regulatory effect on protein gene products. Using genetic databases, we showed that variants
affecting uORF start/stop codons associate with disease phenotypes (PheWAS analysis) and
validated their expected effect on the protein (but not RNA) levels of the downstream genes.
Potential uORFs have been identified in ~50% of all human protein-coding genes, many of which
harbor more than one uORF. While blocking some uORFs decreases CDS protein output, our
unpublished data show that targeting uORFs can be used to increase CDS translation. As a
potential case for increasing protein levels, we focused on heritable pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH), a fatal condition with no current cure, most commonly driven by BMPR2
haploinsufficiency. By blocking a BMPR2 uORF, we were able to increase BMPR2 protein levels
by up to 220%. Based on our published and unpublished results we propose an integrative set of
computational and experimental approaches to systematically detect, prioritize, validate and
target uORFs for therapeutic intervention, focusing on genes associated with haploinsufficiency
and ASOs as an intervention."
11099660,"Nearly 90% of trauma-exposed Veterans report clinically significant insomnia and/or trauma-related
nightmares. Added to the impact on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma-related nightmares have a
negative effect on physical health, substance use, and suicidal behaviors. There is a critical need for continued
research to better understand these phenomena with the goal of developing personalized treatment plans.
Limitations of current assessment procedures present a significant barrier to improved care. In-laboratory sleep
studies rarely capture nightmares and cannot assess change over time, reducing our knowledge of phenotypic
markers of nightmares to guide treatment. Therefore, there is a need to assess sleep over multiple nights in
the home environment, where nightmares occur. The proposed Clinical Sciences Research and Development
CDA-2 aims to significantly enrich knowledge about trauma-related nightmares by using a zero-burden, multi-
night, objective sleep measurement method within Veterans’ usual sleeping environment prior to and during an
evidence-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for nightmares. This study has two primary aims: 1) to
identify, with greater precision than previously possible, objective features of sleep associated with trauma-
related nightmare occurrences; and 2) to use the treatment for nightmares as interventional probes to
determine whether and how changes in sleep physiological parameters identified in Aim 1 covary with changes
in subjective nightmare frequency and severity.
 The study will include 80 trauma-exposed Veterans reporting with trauma-related nightmares. Eligible
participants will monitor their sleep for a week using a multi-night mattress actigraphy implemented in their
home. Mattress actigraphy, which measures movements using accelerometers embedded in a mattress
topper, employs no body surface sensors. Therefore, this system represents a truly zero-burden method for
obtaining intensive longitudinal sleep measurement. During the week of sleep monitoring, participants also will
complete one-night of polysomnography (PSG) sleep assessment to calibrate the actigraphic sleep efficiency.
These methods will be used to investigate candidate physiological parameters associated with trauma-related
nightmares. After establishing the levels of these candidate markers, this project will assess the impact of a
cognitive-behavioral treatment, Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy (ERRT), on the subset of
markers which can be measured continuously over the course of the treatment. Participants will be randomized
to five weeks of active treatment (ERRT; n = 40) or to five weeks of the comparison treatment (sleep and
nightmare management; n = 40). Throughout the course of treatment, participants will continue to sleep while
monitored by the mattress actigraphy system. Upon completion of treatment, a post-treatment and follow-up
assessment will assess subjective symptom change.
 Results from this CDA-2 will provide important information to facilitate increased understanding of the
phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment of nightmares in trauma-exposed Veterans. This CDA-2 also
will provide the applicant with focused training in sleep physiology, advanced longitudinal statistical designs
and treatment research methods, and grantsmanship to prepare for a successful VA research career focused
on improving the quality of life for Veterans with trauma-related sleep disturbances."

Apical constriction is a change in cell shape that drives critical morphogenetic events, including gastrulation
and branching morphogenesis in diverse animals and neural tube formation in vertebrates. Fundamental
questions about mechanisms of apical constriction remain unanswered. Research in this laboratory focuses on
understanding how cells accomplish this change in shape. Apical constriction is being studied to uncover
insights into how animals are shaped, and to contribute to a foundation of basic science leading to improved
diagnosis and prevention of neural tube defects. This proposal will support projects to answer how the
molecules that contribute to apical constriction generate and transmit the forces that change cell shapes, how
a cell’s actin architecture is dynamically altered, how developmental patterning mechanisms deploy cell
biological players with the necessary spatial and temporal precision, and how novel mechanisms contribute to
apical constriction. The laboratory has developed technical innovations to address critical barriers to progress
in this field, and the proposed projects build on the lab's strength in dissecting cell biological mechanisms of
development more generally. Study of apical constriction intersects with some of the major themes in cell and
developmental biology including cell polarization, control of motor activity, and dynamic control of forces, in a
complex in vivo context. The proposed projects seek to combine in a single model system the tools that are
valuable to different model systems, plus the new tools that the lab has developed, to produce unique and
sustained contributions to unraveling mechanisms that are relevant to critical morphogenetic events."
11100624,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are minor components of the eukaryotic membrane but major regulators of cellular
functions. The seven PIPs are critically involved in nearly every aspect of cell physiology. One of the cellular
processes regulated by PIPs is autophagy, a process essential for a broad range of cellular functions and tissue
development, and dysregulated in many human diseases. Found on late endosomes and lysosomes, PI(3,5)P2
is necessary for autophagosome maturation, and dysregulation of PI(3,5)P2 biogenesis has been linked to
several neurological disorders through defective autophagy. However, the mechanism by which PI(3,5)P2
regulates autophagy is poorly understood. PIP signaling is often mediated by lipid-protein interactions. Our
efforts in the last grant cycle have led to the development of a single-molecule assay that detects lipid interaction
with proteins in mammalian whole-cell lysates, using which we have discovered widespread PIP interactions
within the large family of human pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins. XPLN, with dual activities
as a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and an endogenous inhibitor of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), has emerged as a novel PI(3,5)P2-interacting protein, and we have also
discovered that XPLN regulates autophagy in vivo. Guided by the working hypothesis that XPLN is an effector
of PI(3,5)P2 and plays a central role in mediating PIP signaling in the regulation of autophagy, our proposed
studies will decipher the biochemical basis of XPLN-PIP interactions and how they control XPLN activity and
function. The role of XPLN phosphorylation by protein kinase C will also be investigated. We will ask how those
biochemical mechanisms underlie the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. Finally, physiological
relevance of the new mechanisms will be probed in a mouse model of injury-induced skeletal muscle
regeneration, for which autophagy is required. Our expertise in lipid signaling, strong preliminary data, and a
unique combination of biochemical, biophysical, cell biology, and animal model approaches will ensure a
successful outcome that is likely to have significant impact on the biochemical and functional understanding of
PIP signaling and regulation of autophagy."

 Bioassay-guided fractionation of cells uncovers small molecules that bind receptors in new and
unexpected ways. These cellular metabolites emerge from evolution with complex molecular features
preoptimized for function. High stereochemical content, high globularity and diverse heteroatom content
impart greater specificity of protein binding and greater aqueous solubility than simple, flat and non-polar
substances. Parametrization of large molecular libraries have supported a correlation between evolutionary
optimization and therapeutic design: “drug” chemical space is optimized away from commercial building
blocks and towards natural products (NP space). These types of molecules represent a challenge to chemical
synthesis, however, and require the development of new chemical tools for optimization and human use.
 This grant advances our work towards the rapid access and navigation of NP space. Our robust
routes to complex molecules have proven practical: synthesis allowed us to annotate and modify biological
function. Over the coming grant period we extend this approach into three areas. First, we develop the
chemistry to access two chemotypes with known phenotypic effects but unknown biological targets. One
target has stimulated the discovery of a new, stereoselective cross-coupling reaction, whereas another has
inspired the conversion of inert scaffolds to new warheads for protein adduction. Second, we describe rapid
access to complex ligands of known biological targets that embody ‘combinatorial’ aggregates of multiple
proteins. Diverse structural modifications of the complex small molecule will enable a search for selectivity
among these combinatorial targets with consequences for therapeutic development. Third, selectivity
defines the future goals of dual-catalytic cross-couplings to reach NP space: we seek to address substrate
selectivity, relative stereoselectivity and absolute stereoselectivity."

A broadly effective HIV vaccine remains a high priority to reduce the spread of this highly pathogenic virus in the
human population. Neutralizing antibodies, broadly cross-neutralizing are highly likely needed to be generated
from evolving vaccine candidate immunogens, either protein-based or mRNA-based. Recently, we have elicited
cross-neutralizing serum and serum IgG responses in all macaques immunized with a series of 4 recombinant
highly stable and homogeneous NFL trimers arrayed at high density on fully synthetic trimer-liposomes. Besides
serum cross-neutralization we now have compelling EMPEM apex densities (Ozorowski/Ward – HIVRAD
Structural Core C) to heterologous near-native protein trimers derived from tier 2 viruses not in the immunogen
series. In addition, we know have isolated monoclonal antibodies that possess long and tip-charged HCDR3s
that compete with PGT145 and VRC26 for trimer-binding. These data indicate that these neutralizing antibodies
are likely apex-directed, cross-neutralizing antibodies – a very significant accomplishment for the field. To launch
this study, we initially tested a set of NFL trimers available from the Wyatt lab for recognition by the germline-
reverted NHP bNAb RHA1 from George Shaw (Roark et al, Science 2021). Remarkably, the Q23 NFL displayed
detectable binding that was enhanced by multi-valent array on covalent trimer-liposomes. Accordingly, we used
Q23 NFL trimers and Q23 trimer-liposome (high-valency array) in SMNP adjuvant (Darrell Irvine) to elicit
autologous neutralization. We followed the Q23 NFL prime with heterologous boosting of trimers that are the
most sensitive to apex-directed bNAbs (ie, ZM233, see below). Using this prime:boost strategy we elicited
neutralization of multiple clinical isolates, including the well-studied CH505 transmitter/founder virus. At this
juncture, our initial apex-targeting vaccine experiment in NHPs appears to be quite successful. We have elicited
both autologous Q23, ZM233 and 1428 neutralization, as well as cross-neutralization of tier 2 isolates not in
the vaccine regimen. Accordingly, here, we propose to perform heterologous protection studies of the NFL-
trimer vaccinated NHPs by repetitive low-dose mucosal challenge with the well-characterized, clinical isolate,
transmitter-founder-based CH505 SHIV."
11098350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nucleic acids and their building blocks play central roles in all cellular events and, as such, have immense
impact on the emergence of diseases and, in turn, on human health. Studying such events is complicated by
the non-emissive nature of the natural nucleobases, which frequently deprives researchers from the use of
modern fluorescence-based techniques. Faithful minimally perturbing emissive nucleoside surrogates can thus
facilitate the monitoring of nucleoside, nucleotides and nucleic acids-based transformations at nucleoside/tide-
“resolution”, and advance basic research, diagnostic tools and drug discovery efforts.
 The goal of the proposed program is to design and synthesize new isomorphic emissive nucleoside and
nucleotide analogs and implement them as probes for monitoring nucleoside- and nucleotide-based
transformations as well as nucleic acids function, structure, dynamics and recognition. Specifically, major
contemporary challenges will be tackled in an attempt to bridge major gaps, among them: (a) Powerful
biophysical techniques, such as Fluorescence-Detected Circular Dichroism (FDCD), introduced nearly five
decades ago, remains practically unexplored; (b) Multiphoton, imaging and single molecule spectroscopy-
based experiments, using native or minimally perturbed oligonucleotides or nucleotide cofactors, are severely
underutilized; (c) Similarly, single molecule enzymology of nucleoside/tide processing enzymes has not
advanced; (d) Probes for real time exploration of fundamental processes such as peptidyl transferase, phase
separated membrane-less organelle formation and mRNA decay are lacking; (e) Nucleoside/tide-based
metabolic processes and nucleotide-based signaling events cannot be directly monitored; and (f) High
throughput screening for nucleosides and nucleosides processing enzymes cannot be performed in real-time
and in a high throughput manner without the use of faithful emissive surrogate substrates.
 Capitalizing on several useful families of emissive nucleoside surrogates developed in our laboratory, we
will further refine our “designer” emissive and isomorphic nucleosides/tides and apply them to advance
solutions to the challenges articulated above. We will pursue the advancement of new physical and
biochemical methods, as well as effective real-time screening and diagnostic tools. These efforts will expand
the community’s arsenal of emissive functional probes, driving future strides into discovery and imaging
applications. These innovations, in turn, will further fundamental understanding of key biological processes
related to disease development and will have long-term impact on improving human health.
 This applications seeks funding to replace an old, automated chromatography unit, which is critically
important for all aspects of the project as they critically rely on the synthesis and purification of nucleosides."

Circular dichroism (CD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) are chiroptical spectroscopies that provide valuable
structural information about biomolecules and pharmaceuticals under native conditions in aqueous buffer without
the need for special sample preparation or crystallization. The two methods are complementary as they probe
the circular dichroism of molecular electronic and molecular vibrational transitions, respectively. A combination
of the two methods is particularly well suited for investigating the structure of membrane binding proteins, which
remain very difficult to characterize with other biophysical characterization tools. Although in theory a combined
CD / ROA characterization has the potential for providing important structural information of membrane binding
proteins, in practice the weak sensitivities of the two spectroscopies makes it difficult to realize this potential. A
need for high sample concentrations and long acquisition times has limited a more widespread use of CD and
in particular ROA spectroscopy as tool for characterizing membrane binding proteins. This project intends to
overcome the sensitivity limitations of CD and ROA spectroscopies by developing plasmon-enhanced CD
(PECD) and surface-enhanced ROA (SEROA) spectroscopies that utilize plasmonic nanoantennas, which are
engineered nanostructures with specific electric (E) and magnetic (H) field properties as well as defined phase
properties, to enhance signal intensities. To maximize the signal enhancement, antenna substrates will be
developed with plasmon resonances in the ultraviolet (UV) so that the electromagnetic resonances can overlap
with the molecular electronic resonances of biological target molecules, facilitating strong signal intensities for
both CD and ROA. As this proposal focuses on developing PECD and SEROA as characterization tool for
membrane binding proteins, another important design component of the proposed antennas is the assembly of
a lipid membrane on the surface of the plasmonic nanoantennas to provide binding sites for membrane binding
proteins. This approach enriches the proteins of interest in electromagnetic hot spots where CD and ROA signal
enhancements are highest and allows for a spectroscopic characterization of the protein structure in its
membrane-bound form. The developed plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies will enable important new insights
into the structure and chirality of membrane-binding proteins, for instance as function of lipid compositions, and
will contribute to a greatly improved understanding of protein-membrane interactions. The specific aims of this
application are to:
Aim 1: Develop a Plasmon-Enhanced Ultraviolet CD Spectroscopy for Membrane Binding Proteins
Aim 2: Develop Plasmon Enhanced Raman Optical Activity (ROA) Spectroscopy for Membrane Binding Proteins
Aim 3: Prototype Combined Electronic CD / ROA Instrument for the Characterization of Membrane Binding

11099107,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) has been estimated to infect 15-20 million individuals worldwide and is known to be the etiological agent of an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an inflammatory disease syndrome known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and pathologies of the lung, skin, eyes, and thyroid gland. HTLV-1 is notorious for being extremely difficult to propagate in cell culture, which has prohibited rigorous analyses of virus replication, including the steps involved in retrovirus assembly. HTLV-1 spread is known to be heavily reliant on virus infection involving cell-to-cell contacts that form what is termed the virological synapse (VS), which represents the primary means for virus spread, including events associated with oral transmission. While HTLV-1 has been previously studied in regard to virus spread via cell-cell contacts, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding the nature of virus particle assembly and transmission via the VS. In general, virus particle spread through cell-cell contacts increases the likelihood of an infection event of virus particles that may possess low particle infectivity in cells without formation of VS. Previous studies have indicated that a low proportion of mature HTLV-1 particles possess an intact capsid core, suggesting that aberrant particle morphology could help to explain the poorly infectious nature of cell-free HTLV- 1. In order to address the current knowledge gap in the field, we propose in this exploratory application to develop workflows for state-of-the-art bioengineering and quantitative imaging technologies that hold high promise in being applied to the efficient study of HTLV-1 particle assembly and spread at the VS. First, we will develop a workflow for the use of cell micropatterning technology in order to reproducibly and efficiently create cell-cell contacts and investigate the role virus budding in virus spread. Second, we propose to establish an efficient workflow in which we can view cell-cell contacts utilizing high-resolution cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy in order to investigate the role of host cell proteins in virus assembly at cell-cell contacts. Development of these workflows will allow for quantitative analysis of virus particle biogenesis at cell-cell contacts. These technologies have broad applicability in virology and the success of this research will be applicable to a variety of questions regarding virus replication and virus-host cell interactions."
11099311,"All living cells possess mechanisms that partition the chromosomal DNA into actively transcribed,
accessible domains, and transcriptionally silent domains densely packed by DNA-bound proteins. In
Escherichia coli, nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) assemble into nucleoprotein filaments that cover
several kilobase-long regions of DNA, silencing expression of horizontally acquired xenogenes, virulence
factors or enzymes needed for utilization of exotic nutrients. While silencing of promoters, frequently by
exclusion of RNA polymerase, is well studied, silencing during RNA chain elongation has only recently
come to light. E. coli H-NS and its homolog StpA are NAPs that directly bind to AT-rich DNA and inhibit
transcription initiation and elongation. The available data show that the transcription elongation complex
is involved in both maintenance and relief of NAP-mediated silencing. Recent data implicate the ω
subunit of RNA polymerase in regulation of global DNA topology and transcription of xenogeneic regions.
A universally conserved elongation factor, NusG, and termination factor Rho, which are associated with
RNA polymerase genome-wide and stop synthesis of RNAs that are not actively translated, cooperate
with H-NS to silence xenogenes and other inactive genes. Conversely, we showed that a specialized
NusG paralog, RfaH, which is required for expression of xenogeneic operons, excludes NusG and Rho
from the transcribing RNA polymerase and counteracts NAP-mediated silencing. We propose to
elucidate molecular mechanisms which control the accessibility of bacterial chromatin, focusing on poorly
understood regulation during transcription elongation. In Aim 1, we will investigate effects of the
ubiquitous ω subunit on RNA polymerase structure and activity. We will identify cellular factors that
interact with ω using genetics and proteomics, characterize ω-induced changes in transcription
complexes, and investigate ω effects on in vitro RNA synthesis. In Aim 2, we will study regulation of Rho-
dependent termination. We posit that hyperactive Rho may be harmful during slow growth or translational
stress and will investigate mechanisms by which Rho activity may be globally downregulated, e.g., by
changing Rho conformation, promoting the formation of inactive Rho filaments, or blocking Rho binding
to RNA. In Aim 3, we will identify new factors that contribute to maintenance of E. coli heterochromatin;
determine contributions of different NAPs, Rho, and ω to silencing; and elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which RfaH counter-silences NAPs in vitro."

Understanding how nature builds new traits is a fundamental goal of evolutionary genetics. Unbiased
experimental dissection of trait variation from the wild has to date used linkage or association mapping, which
are suitable only for crosses between compatible individuals of a given species. In the first funding period of
this methods-development R01, PI Brem developed RH-seq, an approach for the unbiased mapping of natural
trait variation that can be applied to reproductively isolated species. Our RH-seq projects in invertebrate test
cases have put the complex genetics of ancient traits within reach for the first time in the experimental
literature. We now want to advance strategies that investigate deeper themes in complex genetics between
species—namely whether evolution uses concerted molecular mechanisms across the loci underlying a
polygenic adaptation, and how these loci work together to drive phenotype. To test-drive these approaches, in
our first Aim we will use an ecologically relevant model system, a thermotolerance divergence between yeast
species that last shared an ancestor five million years ago. In our second Aim, we will port our ideas and tools
for interspecies genetics to mouse primary cells. The latter will use as a testbed a cell-autonomous, pro-
inflammatory aging program called cellular senescence, which we have found to diverge between between
sister species of mice. We will develop RH-seq for unbiased genetic mapping of senescence traits, and we will
pursue epistatic and molecular mechanisms of the underlying loci as a parallel to our yeast model. Together,
our yeast and mouse projects will advance methods for the analysis of polygenic traits as they differ between
species, and accelerate the dissection of such ancient characters in systems across Eukarya."

Aging can be slowed, lifespan extended, and diseases postponed in mammals by diet, mutations, and small
molecules. The most potent longevity mutations in mice modulate levels or actions of growth hormone and/or its
downstream mediator, IGF1. The PAPP-A protease activates IGF1 signaling in specific tissues by cleavage of
IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), principally IGFBP4 and IGFBP5. Pappa KO (PKO) mice are long-lived, and show
protection from diverse aging pathologies, e.g. cancer, kidney disease, and atherosclerosis. PAPP-A deficiency
induced in adult mice also provokes longevity, implying that pharmacologic inhibition of PAPP-A might represent
an effective and well-tolerated anti-aging strategy. Although inhibitory antibodies against PAPP-A have been
developed, and shown to be effective treatments in preclinical models of atherosclerosis and kidney disease, no
small molecule inhibitors against PAPP-A have been described. This represents a critical knowledge gap in this
field, since, for aging studies, it would be highly desirable to use small molecule PAPP-A inhibitors, rather than
antibody reagents. The objective of this application is to design, synthesize and develop potent, selective, and
bioavailable PAPP-A inhibitors, to elucidate their mechanism of action, and test them in vivo. Our preliminary
data have shown that our lead PAPP-A inhibitor, P100, effectively inhibits proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-4 and
IGF signaling, the latter assessed by measuring IGF receptor phosphorylation. The proposed work is based on
a large body of foundational data, and will be performed in the context of two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
design and synthesize new analogs based on our lead PAPP-A inhibitor, to improve their potency, selectivity,
and drug-like properties, with the ultimate goal of developing compounds with in vivo activity. A series of assays
will be used to characterize the new analogs at the biochemical, biophysical, structural and functionals level, and
thus to establish structure-activity relationships of this new class of PAPP-A inhibitors. In Aim 2, optimized PAPP-
A inhibitors will be evaluated using a battery of novel cellular and mouse assays of PAPP-A function. The activity
of PAPP-A inhibitors in suppressing cellular IGF1 signaling will be tested. The ability of inhibitors to induce a
reduction in nucleolar area, a novel phenotype of PKO cells we have uncovered, will be tested. These assays
will all be performed in wild-type and PKO cells, to test for PAPP-A dependency of phenotypes observed. In vivo,
the impact of PAPP-A inhibitors will be evaluated on PAPP-A-dependent gene expression changes we have
uncovered in adipose, skeletal muscle, and thymus, by qRT-PCR and RNA-seq. The most promising small
molecules will be evaluated for their ability to induce novel phenotypes of Pappa KO mice: “beiging” of white
adipose tissue (WAT), altered ratio of M1/M2 macrophages in WAT, and increased expression of FNDC5, a pro-
hormone with beneficial physiological effects. These studies will generate, for the first time, potent and selective
small molecule PAPP-A inhibitors. Such molecules will serve as chemical tools to explore the biology of IGF1
signaling and PAPP-A function, and as the basis for future candidate anti-aging compounds."
11100593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), (PWH), are at increased
risk of frailty, which increases the risk of adverse age-related outcomes, including falls, hospitalization and
mortality. The mechanisms of frailty are not completely understood, particularly among PWH. The objective of
this proposal is to study the extent to which sex hormone binging globulin (SHBG) post-modification is associated
with frailty and inflammation in men with HIV. We hypothesize that SHBG are key biomarkers for identifying
PWH at the highest risk of frailty and who may benefit from intervention with anabolic agents. Therefore,
pro-inflammatory glycans on SHBG will be higher among frail compared to non-frail men with HIV and with higher
SHBG concentrations. Our specific aim is to determine the association of novel SHBG glycans with frailty among
men with HIV.
In Aim 3, we will study novel SHBG glycoforms in men with HIV, the identification and quantification of SHBG
glycoforms will be performed by new proposed advanced biochemical techniques, including SHBG
immunoprecipitation optimization, glycoproteomics with digestion, and liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LCMS/MS). The proposed research aims to provide new insights to the contribution of free
testosterone and SHBG in frailty and its relationship with systemic inflammation. The goals during the award
period include gaining advanced expertise in biostatistical methods, design and conduct epidemiological studies,
as well as hands-on experience in the measurement of glycoforms from plasma proteins and interpretation of
glycomic data through mentored research, tailored didactic coursework, and supervised performance of relevant
laboratory techniques. Long-term goals include developing a career as an independent investigator in
translational epidemiology and developing new approaches to treating and preventing age-related outcomes
such as frailty in PWH."
10858010,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by M. tuberculosis (Mlb) infection, is one of the leading causes of infectious disease
related death globally despite the availability of treatments. Lack of reliable diagnostics for TB contributes to a
significant proportion of the preventable TB deaths as currently only 60% of those who develop TB are
diagnosed. Current diagnostic approaches depend on detection of Mlb in sputum and are either too resourceintensive
to be deployed widely in endemic areas or have low sensitivity, underperforrning especially in those
co-infected with TB and HIV and in children. Use of sputum as a sample itself is a bottleneck as a sizeable
fraction of people with suspected TB cannot produce sputum. Current serological assays, which measure only
the presence or titer of Mlb-specific antibodies, fail to provide the required sensitivity and specificity for TB as
they cannot distinguish active TB disease from latent TB infection (L TBI) which is widespread in endemic regions.
Recent work by the Sarkar lab and others has highlighted the remarkable specific and sensitive ability of
pathogen-specific antibody glycosylation to mark recent and active infections even for endemic pathogens,
including Mlb. Additionally, ii has been shown that integrating this with Fab & Fe region biophysical and functional
properties of antibodies (including antigen-specificity, isotype/sublype, Fe receptor binding) using machinelearning
based analytical approaches defines a multivariate, disease-state specific biomarker. Measuring this for
a large set of Mlb-specific antibodies, however, currently requires intractably large sample volumes, laborious
sample preparation and expensive and complex analytical methods such as mass spectrometry. To resolve this
bottleneck, the Sarkar lab has recently developed sample-sparing, binding-based assays for multiplexed
glycoprofiling of antigen-specific antibodies as well as novel electronic and optical detection microchip formats
for implementing them at the point-of-care (POC). Taken together these findings and technological developments
suggest the exciting prospect of a multiplexed POC 'antibody-omic' profiling chip for TB diagnostics from
a single drop of blood. The goal of this project is to realize this overall vision. First, a microfiuidic multiplexed
antibody profiling chip will be developed to enable coupled measurement of Fab and Fe properties of large
numbers of Mtb-specific antibodies from small sample volumes. Next this will be applied to banked serum from
a clinically well-characterized cohort of HIV- and HIV+ TB patients. Machine-learning based methods will be
applied to resulting high-dimensional data sets to define the antibody Fe signatures that act as a robust
biomarker for TB. Finally, a low-cost, POC detection microchip for TB diagnostics will be developed which
would be applicable in endemic regions including low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Development of
such a reliable, low-cost diagnostic for TB would have a significant impact on its clinical care and management.
Overall, this project will create broader biomarker discovery and POC diagnostic opportunities beyond TB as
well.

The overall objective of this research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms of intracellular calcium
signals that regulate multiple diverse cellular functions, both healthy and pathological. Many of these signals are
due to opening of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), the most widely expressed ligand-gated Ca2+
channels. IP3Rs reside primarily in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from which they release Ca2+
when they bind both IP3 and Ca2+.The proposed studies focus on uncovering the structural and mechanistic
basis for ligand binding, ion permeation and gating in the family of IP3R channels. IP3Rs work as Ca2+ signaling
hubs through which diverse extracellular stimuli and intracellular inputs are processed and then integrated to
result in delivery of Ca2+ from the ER lumen to generate cytosolic Ca2+ signals with precise temporal and spatial
properties. However, an in-depth understanding of the comprehensive allosteric mechanism governing control
of intracellular Ca2+ signals via IP3R channels is still lacking. Our structural and functional studies accomplished
over the last years, establish the molecular architecture of neuronal IP3R subtype 1 (IP3R1) channel providing
critical insights into channel gating and ligand-binding. Recent advances in our work coupled to our knowledge
and expertise over two decades of research on calcium channels, guide our current research strategy. In this
proposal, we seek to address the fundamental questions of how ligands and modulatory proteins affect the
conformational landscape of IP3R, and how conformational changes in channel structure control and shape its
function. We are pursuing a multidisciplinary approach that includes biochemical, biophysical, mutagenesis,
electrophysiological, cryo-EM and cryo-ET studies to dissect structure-function of IP3Rs. We will use a deep
learning neural network-based method to extract conformational motions of the IP3R domains directly from cryo-
EM images. Continuing with IP3R1, we will elucidate the molecular and structural mechanism for channel gating
and regulation at atomic level detail and define its subcellular organization and dynamics. Another effort will be
directed at defining the structural basis for isoform-specific properties of IP3Rs. To this end, we will determine
high-resolution structures of other IP3R subtypes in multiple functional states. Our structural findings will be
validated by extensive functional analysis. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms of how IP3Rs sense multiple
cellular signals and decode them into cytosolic Ca2+ signals to ensure appropriate regulation of downstream
signaling pathways. The proposed studies will provide a structural framework and the mechanistic knowledge
required for the development of new ways to control IP3R function."

RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which catalyzes mRNA synthesis, is co-regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) and phosphatases to control transcription cycle progression and ensure coupling of elongation and
processing. Derangements of the RNAPII cycle underlie cancer and other diseases; CDKs and phosphatases
are potential drug targets, but how they collaborate to regulate gene expression is largely unknown. We seek
to determine how specific phosphorylations are placed and removed in precise order to execute transitions
between phases of transcription. In the past five years we uncovered two CDK-phosphatase switches that
regulate RNAPII elongation. Our goals for the next five years are to understand how these circuits work to
coordinate the transcription cycle, and how they might be disrupted with small molecules.
Dissecting CDK-PPP switches: We identified two members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family
as targets of inhibitory phosphorylation by Cdk9 (P-TEFb). PP4 and PP1 dephosphorylate the Cdk9 substrate
Spt5 to regulate the onset and end of rapid elongation, respectively. To define roles of Cdk9-PPP crosstalk in
transcription, we will introduce mutations that lock PP4 or PP1 in constitutively active (unphosphorylated) or
inactive (phosphorylated) states and analyze genome-wide effects on RNAPII dynamics and gene expression.
Unraveling control of RNAPII elongation by PPP family phosphatases: PP4 and the related PP2A,
another phosphatase recruited to transcription complexes, dephosphorylate Spt5 with similar site specificity,
and may cooperate to regulate RNAPII release from the promoter-proximal pause. We plan integrated genomic
analyses to ask whether PP4 and PP2A work independently, in combination, or in response to different signals.
Understanding how phosphorylation events are ordered in the RNAPII cycle: By analogy with the cell
division cycle—also regulated by CDKs—the order of phosphorylations during transcription is likely determined
by substrate specificities of CDKs and phosphatases, and by structural features of the substrates themselves.
We will test this hypothesis for Cdk9, which has scores of substrates and is active throughout elongation.
Functional dissection of a conserved elongation regulator: Spt5, large subunit of the conserved elongation
factor DSIF, is the linchpin of elongation control by Cdk9-PPP switches; phosphorylations placed by Cdk9 at
different sites in Spt5 are removed at different times by PP4 or PP1 and are likely to perform different functions
in the transcription cycle. We will take a genome editing approach in human cells to dissect the functions of
distinct Spt5 phosphorylations, and to elucidate their differential regulation by CDKs and phosphatases.
Illuminating a link between transcription and cell cycle control: One CDK is a core component of both
cell-division and transcriptional machineries: the TFIIH-associated Cdk7. As human cells re-enter the division
cycle from quiescence, chromatin-bound Cdk7 is activated, potentially enhancing its function in G1-specific
gene transcription. We will test this model and identify pathways that lead to Cdk7 activation at cell cycle entry."

Biology is driven through the action of proteins. We know that structure often provides the foundation for proteins’
function, but in recent years it has become clear that protein function is also critically dependent on dynamics,
or movements of structure. How dynamics enables function is now a central question in protein biology that limits
our basic understanding of proteins, as well as applications in drug discovery and protein design. While there
are many types of functions that dynamics – or conformational flexibility – promotes, two functional archetypes
for dynamics are enzyme catalysis and allostery. The mechanistic bases for these two phenomena, pervasive
as they are, remain largely mysterious and have attracted much attention for the likely role of dynamics. The Lee
laboratory has focused on studying dynamics and allostery in proteins using NMR and other biophysical methods
for nearly 20 years. The approach outlined in this proposal is to combine investigation of natural allosteric
enzymes (Areas 1 and 2) with efforts to engineer allosteric regulation into signaling proteins using optogenetics
(Area 3). In the last five years, the lab has developed two complementary systems for NMR and biophysical
studies of dynamics and allostery that are highly amenable for addressing these mechanistic questions and,
importantly, developing approaches to study intersubunit allosteric communication. The two systems are the
enzymes chorismate mutase (CM) and thymidylate synthase (TS), both symmetric homodimers that are
functionally allosteric. CM (from yeast) is a classically allosteric protein, exhibiting all the hallmarks of traditional
allostery: sigmoidal activity curve; symmetric quaternary structure; tense (“T”) and relaxed (“R”) conformations;
and small molecule allosteric effector ligands that either up- or down-regulate activity. In contrast to CM’s positive
cooperativity, TS is negatively cooperative because it is half-the-sites reactive. Work will be on the E. coli (ecTS)
and human (hTS) forms, which, despite their similarities show very different behaviors. The human TS is the
target of anticancer drug 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU). CM, ecTS, and hTS all have outstanding features for study by
solution NMR since they are highly soluble, stable, and yield excellent spectra. The goals for the next five years
fall into three main areas: (1) Through the use of NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations,
calorimetry, x-ray crystallography, and biochemistry, the structural and dynamic properties of these enzymes will
be related to functional behaviors of key interest, such as: allosteric communication; how apo state conformations
compare to T and R conformations; protomer asymmetry in singly liganded states; and the nature of the transition
state. (2) We will advance the study of protein homodimers by NMR by introducing a technology for chemical
conjugation of protomers using click chemistry. Mixed labeled dimers produced this way will facilitate NMR study
of interprotomer interactions, such as allostery, and improve NMR structure determination of homodimers. (3)
For engineered GTPases that have been artificially placed under optogenetic control, the allosteric mechanisms
will be determined using an NMR approach."

Title: Investigating and improving performance of polygenic scores for cardiometabolic traits in Samoan adults
Project Period: 2024-09-01--2026-08-31
The clinical utility of polygenic scores (PGSs) in individuals of Pacific Islander ancestry is unknown due to a
paucity of Pacific Islanders participating in studies of PGSs. Specifically, the applicability of published polygenic
scores for cardiometabolic disease risk and related biomarkers to clinical practice has not yet been evaluated.
This gap in knowledge may further exacerbate health disparities in this population due to this unknown transfer-
ability of findings from majority populations to individuals of Pacific Island ancestry. Therefore, the primary focus
of this supplement is to provide the first ever examination of existing and development of PGSs of cardiometa-
bolic traits in Pacific Islanders. This will be achieved through two primary aims—first, assessing the portability of
existing PGSs for cardiometabolic health traits in Samoans, and second, to measure change in prediction power,
and thus clinical utility, of PGSs that have been augmented to include Samoan-specific variation. Understanding
the transferability of existing PGSs may shift how PGSs are translated into clinical practice by elucidating how
much trait variation is due to underlying genetic components of cardiometabolic traits that are shared across
populations and how much is context dependent. Clinical use of existing PGSs for individuals with Polynesian
ancestry has the potential to exacerbate the health disparities that these populations already face in cardiomet-
abolic disease prevention and treatment. Thus, this project will improve genomics-related health equity by ex-
amining the portability of PGSs for cardiometabolic traits in a population that is systematically underrepresented
in research and that faces alarmingly high rates of cardiometabolic disease. This project will provide the first ever
characterization of the portability of existing PGSs for Polynesian populations which will inform clinical interpre-
tation of these PGSs among individuals with Polynesian ancestry."

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal cancers in the U.S. with a 5-year survival rate of 7%, which
has essentially unchanged for the past 40 years. Despite extensive research, there are no effective targeted
therapies for this disease, suggesting an insufficient understanding of oncogenic signaling networks in PC. While
almost all of the signaling networks implicated in cancer rely on the cooperation of kinases and phosphatases to
transduce signals promoting cancer, most efforts have only been put on the study of protein kinases in cancer
while leaving protein phosphatases as a blind spot. PP2A is a family of heterotrimers that serve as the main
source of Ser/Thr phosphatase activities in human cells, with each consisting of a scaffold subunit (Aα/β), a
catalytic subunit (Cα/β), and one of many non-conserved regulatory (B) subunits (>27) that control the substrate
specificities of PP2A complexes. Our preliminary studies identified PR55α, a regulatory subunit of PP2A, as an
important new player in promoting malignant PC. In particular, our studies revealed that PR55 inhibits the
MOB1/LATS auto-activation loop of the Hippo tumor suppression pathway, whose function is to induce the
phosphorylation of YAP causing its cytoplasmic retention and proteasomal degradation. In line with the essential
role of YAP signaling in Kras-driven PC development and progression, knockdown of PR55α impeded the
anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of PC cells. Our preliminary data also revealed
that the stability of PR55α protein is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and its target gene
FBXL20, a substrate adaptor for the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ligase. Consistently, we observed that
PR55α is elevated in PC specimens, where its expression correlates with poor patient survival. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that loss of p53 function results in the stabilization of PR55α protein, which, in turn,
activates the YAP oncogenic signaling required for Kras-driving PC initiation and progression. We will test the
hypothesis by three specific aims: Aim 1 to define the mechanism by which PR55α/PP2A promotes YAP
activation and the significance of this cascade in oncogenesis and malignant potential of PC, Aim 2 to elucidate
how p53 suppresses the level of PR55α, and Aim 3 to delineate the role of the PR55/YAP axis in pancreatic
cancer development and progression in the KPC spontaneous mouse model. The work is innovative, as it will
illuminate a critical pathway that promotes PC initiation and progression through PR55/PP2A activated YAP
signaling, which is novel to both the PP2A field and the PC field. Successful completion of the proposed studies
will yield an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the critical contribution of PR55/PP2A complex to the
observed cooperation between Kras activation and the loss of the p53 tumor suppressor during PC development
and progression. The acquired knowledge not only will improve the understanding of the role of PP2A in cancer
but also will contribute to identifying novel therapeutic targets for improving the treatment of PC."

Summary of Parent Award: Enzymes with complex metallocofactors in their active sites catalyze myriad
transformations relevant to human health and disease. Understanding their reaction mechanisms requires
molecular-level characterization of their resting states and intermediate states, and metal-specific
spectroscopic techniques are especially useful in this endeavor. However, the high nuclearity of many
metallocofactors can limit the usefulness of such techniques; the signals arising from multiple metal sites
can be challenging to resolve, especially in mixtures of reaction intermediates. Moreover, it is often
impossible to map the rich spectroscopic information onto the geometric structure, and this severely limits
our understanding of the chemical bonding—and therefore the reactivity—of complex metallocofactors.
We propose to address these challenges by developing methods for modifying the isotopic and elemental
compositions of complex metallocofactors, in particular the nitrogenase catalytic cofactors. Nitrogenases
are responsible for supplying a significant portion of the fixed nitrogen on the planet, and they therefore
play an important role in maintaining a healthy and growing human population. Their catalytic cofactors
are among the most complex in Nature, and as a result their reaction mechanisms have been especially
difficult to characterize. To overcome these challenges and gain new insights into the mechanism of
biological nitrogen fixation, we will develop chemical methods for precisely altering the isotopic and
elemental composition of nitrogenase cofactors. Our approach is to discover mild protocols for removing
specific Fe sites in nitrogenase cofactors and subsequently replacing them with 57Fe. The site-selectivity
of the label will allow for the electronic structure (as elucidated spectroscopically) to be connected to the
geometric structure (as defined crystallographically), and will thereby provide unprecedented insights into
the chemical bonding and reactivity of nitrogenase cofactors. Studies of these cofactors in both their
resting states and intermediate states comprise the heart of the proposal. We will also extend the site-
selective 57Fe labeling protocol to incorporating different metals into specific sites of nitrogenase
cofactors. This will yield artificial metalloenzymes that will serve as mechanistic probes with potentially
unique properties and/or reactivity. Completion of this project will provide unprecedented mechanistic
insights into biological nitrogen fixation and will articulate concepts and protocols for rendering complex
metallocofactors as mechanistically tractable as mononuclear active sites.
Justification for proposed equipment: The proposed modern ultracentrifuge would replace our current
ultracentrifuge (a decades-old Beckman Coulter L70, heretofore referred to as the “Old Ultracentrifuge”),
which was listed in the Equipment section of our grant proposal submitted in 2021. We first describe the
scientific relevance of an ultracentrifuge with respect to this project, and then the reasons for replacing the
Old Ultracentrifuge with a modern ultracentrifuge.
Scientific necessity for a functioning ultracentrifuge. The project is absolutely dependent on large-scale
overproduction of nitrogenase proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av), and this can only be
accomplished by conducting large-scale cell growths and protein purifications. The extraction of
nitrogenase proteins from Av cells (50-150 g) requires cell lysis and clarification of the cell lysate in an
ultracentrifuge; without this step, particles in the lysate would clog the chromatography resins, rendering
protein purification nearly impossible. Thus, an ultracentrifuge is critical for cell lysis. Indeed, when the
Old Ultracentrifuge is broken, the project grinds to a halt because every experiment requires access to
nitrogenase proteins (e.g., the Mo nitrogenase) and/or nitrogenase-protein-derived cofactors (e.g., FeMo-
co, the catalytic cofactor of the Mo nitrogenase, which is extracted from the Mo nitrogenase). The specific
aims that would be affected without an ultracentrifuge are:
1. Aim 1. This Aim cannot be undertaken because it relies on the large-scale isolation of nitrogenase
cofactors.
2. Aim 2. This Aim cannot be undertaken because it relies on the large-scale isolation of nitrogenase
cofactors as well as the apo-proteins in which they are reinserted.
3. Aim 3. This Aim cannot be undertaken for the same reasons as articulated for Aim 2.
Simply put: an ultracentrifuge is one of a few critical pieces of equipment, without which the project
cannot be pursued.
Rational for purchasing a modern ultracentrifuge. My lab inherited the Old Ultracentrifuge from Prof.
Stephen Lippard, who purchased this equipment many years ago. Because of its age and because we use
it frequently, it breaks several times per year. This has not significantly slowed down our research progress
because it is typically repaired within a few days by a talented technician from Beckman Coulter.
However, Beckman Coulter recently informed us that they have stopped making replacement parts and
we will therefore no longer be able to source them. As such, Beckman Coulter is not guaranteeing the
repairability of the Old Centrifuge, which means that it is essentially obsolete; soon (probably within a
year), the Old Centrifuge will break and will remain permanently broken. This will be catastrophic for our
research project for the reasons described above.
Replacing the Old Centrifuge with a modern centrifuge would solve this problem since a modern
centrifuge would be serviceable now and for the remainder of the project. Additionally, it would likely
break far less frequently, and thus would result in less down-time in our research efforts.
Note that we are proposing to purchase a modern ultracentrifuge (Beckman Optima XE) that has
essentially the same features as the Old Ultracentrifuge. The Optima XE is not only their best-selling
model, it’s also their most economical ultracentrifuge, and as such, our proposal to purchase this piece of
equipment is financially conservative.
Future costs. There will be no additional costs associated with the new ultracentrifuge as any repairs will
be covered under a service contract."

and calcium channels (CaV) drive membrane depolarization and activate second messenger pathways via gated
cellular entry of their namesake ions. In skeletal and cardiac cells, CaV channels trigger muscle contraction.
Voltage-gated potassium channels (KV) allow the release of potassium ions from within the cell to drive
membrane repolarization. In concert, these channels provide the molecular foundation for thought, perception,
and contraction. High-resolution protein structures of human voltage-gated channels are now providing the first
glimpses of the types of poses they may adopt in cellular environments. However, understanding the ultimate
link between how these proteins look and how they support physiological mechanisms is a major challenge that
will require innovative approaches. For one, transmembrane voltage is absent in a structural experiment thus
depicting voltage-gated channels in an essentially non-physiological environment. We are therefore developing
photochemical `stapling' approaches to covalently trap high-value protein conformations in live cell membranes
prior to purification for structural determination. Further, we have begun to identify mechanisms of channel
function by introducing modified chemistries at the peptide backbone in the transmembrane segments that form
voltage-sensors and channel gates. In cellular settings, ion channels are also critical amplifiers of transduction
pathways. During the fight-or-fight response, for instance, the near instantaneous phosphorylation of CaV1.2
channels results in faster and sustained channel opening, leading to a more forceful and rapid heart rate. Yet
the absolute speed and complexity of the process is a challenge to experimentally parse individual molecular
events that result in channel gating modifications. We describe newly validated methods that enable light
controlled, site-specific phosphorylation, for the careful deconstruction and identification of key steps and players
is this process. Lastly, CaV channels can be therapeutically inhibited to manage pain, epilepsy, arrythmia, high
blood pressure, and alternatively, activated to treat heart failure. Surprisingly, both of these effects (channel
activation and inactivation) can be elicited by medicines binding a common extracellular binding site on the
channel. Conversely, unintended blockade of cardiac hERG potassium channels by otherwise useful
therapeutics cause 90% of drug induced long-QT syndrome, a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia. All of these
chemical binding events rely on aromatic rich binding sites formed by the side-chains of phenylalanine and
tyrosine residues in CaV and hERG channels. To better understand these chemical interactions, we have
developed a high-resolution method that allows for energetic and nuanced dissection of these aromatics within
the CaV and KV drug binding aromatic boxes in the environment of mammalian cells. The successful execution
of this research program will provide cutting edge training opportunities, advance the molecular understanding
of channel gating, and will reveal the binding modes of clinical drugs with high therapeutic value."

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a major intercellular signaling pathway important for
embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Errors in Hh signaling are linked to
several newborn birth defects such as skeletal malformations and craniofacial defects, and
associated with multiple tumors including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. An
important but poorly understood aspect of vertebrate Hh signaling is the strict requirement of a
microtubule-based organelle known as the primary cilium. While we now have a wealth of data
on the “parts-list” of proteins involved in the Hh signaling, the molecular mechanisms underlying
cilia-mediated signal transduction remains poorly understood. Our overall goal is to fill this major
knowledge gap and provide a biochemical framework for the Hh signaling pathway by
reconstituting key reaction of this pathway from its components. For this research, we will build
on our experience in integrating single-molecule imaging methods with biochemical assays and
cell biological readouts to connect the biochemical properties of the protein components to their
cellular function. In this proposal, we focus a key step of the Hh signal transduction pathway
which is the establishment of signaling complexes at the base and the tip of the cilia, as
is needed for the proper activation or repression of the transcription factor Gli, the major effector
of the Hh pathway. Here, we will: (1) define these protein-protein interactions through a series of
reconstitution studies and determine how they restrict the Gli binding to the nuclear import
machinery and (2) analyze the dynamics of key pathway proteins in the cilium using high-
resolution real-time imaging. Together, these studies will define how Gli is regulated through
dynamic transit between protein complexes at defined cytoplasmic locations. We expect that our
findings will not only advance our understanding of the basic biology of this important signal
transduction pathway but also shed light on how mutations in pathway components contribute
to developmental disorders and human cancers."

Understanding how endogenously-generated adult-born neurons functionally integrate into neural circuits may
inform strategies employing stem cell-derived neurons to repair damaged brain areas. Olfactory sensory neurons
(OSNs), which are generated throughout life in all mammals, provide an ideal model to study functional
integration in both the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. Our long-term goal is to determine how
circuit function and regeneration can be enhanced by functional integration of newborn neurons. The overall
objective of this application is to determine how evoked activity during an immature developmental window
influences OSN survival and integration in the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. Our central
hypothesis is that odor selective input to immature OSNs is required for their survival and functional integration
in both the healthy and the regenerating olfactory system. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific
aims. First, we will define the odor selectivity of immature OSN sensory input to the OB, using in vivo 2-photon
calcium imaging. Second, we will determine the role of evoked activity in immature adult-born OSNs in their
survival and functional integration. We will up- and down-regulate evoked activity in OSNs during the immature
developmental stage, and use immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, optogenetics and in vivo 2-photon
structural and functional imaging to assay their survival, synaptogenesis and functional integration. Finally, we
will determine the role of immature OSN activity in regeneration of OSN input to the OB. For this aim, we will
chemically ablate OSNs, which regenerate from olfactory epithelium stem cells, manipulate activity using naris
occlusion and chemogenetic silencing during regeneration, and use in vivo 2-photon time-lapse imaging to track
structural and functional regeneration of OSN input to glomeruli. We expect to find that evoked activity during
immaturity plays a key role in the survival and integration of that OSN. Hence, our proposed work will have an
important impact by defining how functional integration of an endogenous population of stem cell-derived
neurons is regulated to maintain and regenerate brain function. This study will be highly significant in elucidating
the role of activity in an endogenously-generated population of newborn neurons in regulating their functional
integration, thereby providing important insight relevant to the development of stem cell-based therapeutic
strategies to repair damaged neural circuits. Our proposed research is conceptually innovative in proposing that
sensory input during the immature phase of development is crucial to successful functional integration of OSNs
in the healthy and regenerating OB and will employ a technically innovative array of experimental approaches."

 The progression of cancer and infectious disease is an evolutionary process. Pathogens engage in an arms
race with their hosts, and while antibiotics/antivirals have enabled us to skew the outcome of these contests,
these bulwarks against contagion are being steadily eroded. Mutation and natural selection, coupled with rapid
generation times and immense pathogen population sizes, provide pathogens a decisive advantage. To regain
the upper hand, we must better understand the evolutionary process, to aid in the development of novel classes
of antimicrobials and devise therapeutic strategies that take into account how these weapons work and how
pathogens evade them. Until recently, efforts to gain a deep understanding of the adaptive process were stymied,
because adaptive mutations are rare and identifying them is challenging. To solve this, we developed a system
to track the evolutionary process, isolate thousands of adaptive lineages, remeasure the fitness of those lineages
across many environments, and cheaply whole genome sequence hundreds to thousands of such mutants.
 I propose a new phase in my ambitious, integrated research program that takes full advantage of this lineage
tracking system, and our discovery of Pareto fronts, which are indicative of trade-offs. We will pursue two major
goals. First, we will expand our understanding of evolution in the face of abiotic selection pressures, especially
those that produce adaptive trade-offs. Specifically, we will determine the role of historical contingency as it
pertains to trade-offs in adaptation, the potential for trade-offs to force canalization (e.g., trapping lineages into
extreme specialization), the influence that epistasis exerts on the geometry of trait space, and the extent to which
adaptive constraints underlie negative and diminishing returns epistasis. Second, we will expand to contrast
these findings with evolutionary outcomes under biotic selection pressures, using two new systems. To model
genetic conflict and arms race dynamics within species we will use the killer yeast system. Killer yeast secrete a
toxin that destroys sensitive yeast, while retaining an intracellular antitoxin. Toxin and antitoxin are both encoded
by a vertically inherited virus, which itself parasitizes a second virus. We will co-evolve killer and sensitive cells
and determine whether, as theory predicts, there are recurrent periods of selection and whether coevolved
solutions show greater trade-offs than typically observed from abiotic selection pressures. To experimentally
model arms race dynamics between species we will use crAssphage, one of the most prevalent bacteriophages
associated with the human gut microbiome. The aim of these evolution experiments will be to evaluate the
dynamics of phage and its bacterial host co-adaptation over trials of short- and medium-term duration. Overall,
this integrated, multi-level research strategy will yield fundamental new insights into how the adaptive process is
constrained under alternative forms of selection. Armed with this deeper understanding of adaptation, we will
better be able to predict the likelihood of different evolutionary futures given knowledge of a genomic present and
thereby gain the upper hand in our battle against human disease."

 My lab is interested in defining how the maternal load is established during oogenesis and decoded
after fertilization. We know the identity of most important maternal transcripts and maternally supplied RNA-
binding proteins. We know that these factors are required for germline development, oocyte maturation, and
pattern formation in early embryogenesis. But we do not yet know which regulatory events are most important
for reproduction, or what mechanisms coordinate regulation in space and time.
 We employed a “protein-centric” approach to map the wiring diagram of maternal RNA regulation in the
nematode Caenorhabidits elegans. We defined the sequence motifs recognized by a several maternal RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs) and identified of functional cis-regulatory elements in 3’UTR reporter genes
representing well studied maternal mRNAs. Our work made revealed that binding specificity is not sufficient to
explain mRNA targeting in vivo. All proteins studied to date bind to short linear partially degenerate motifs
present in at least 30-50% of all mRNAs. In some cases, the motifs have been shown to be necessary but not
sufficient to drive regulatory activity. In other cases, the motifs do not lead to regulation. Putting a motif, even in
multiple copies, into a transgene does not confer RBP-dependent regulation. Binding is not a great predictor of
regulation, revealing that binding site context is also crucial for targeting.
 Moving forward, we are pursuing three major strategies. In the first, we are using CRISPR-cas9
genome editing to make mutations in the 3’UTRs of two critical maternal transcripts in order to identify which
regulatory events are most important to define the pattern of expression and for reproductive health. Genome
editing technology has advanced to the point where we can make targeted UTR deletions and substitutions, so
now we can assess importance directly. Our second direction is aimed at defining regulatory mechanisms. We
are performing AID-degron tagged experiments to define how RBPs and core regulatory machinery control the
maternal mRNA expression with temporal resolution in the germline and in the embryo. Finally, we wish to
understand how the biochemical properties of an RBP contribute to its mutant phenotypes. Proteins can have
multiple activities, and it is not always clear that the most obvious activity is the one that underlies its mutant
phenotypes. We are in position to address this question directly. We have expressed and purified several C.
elegans RBPs over the course of the past ten years and have begun to dissect their biochemical properties
using quantitative in vitro tools. We now have the ability to introduce mutations that effect RNA-binding
properties into the endogenous locus in C. elegans to determine phenotype.
 Our innovative interdisciplinary approach, coupled to the strong atmosphere at UMass Medical School
in RNA biology and C. elegans genetics, will ensure rapid progress in defining the maternal effect in
embryogenesis at the functional level."

Research in my laboratory has centered on the development and application of multi-disciplinary approaches to
study signal transduction pathways important in normal physiology and, when de-regulated, in disease. This
began with our discovery and cloning of a novel signaling partner for the epidermal growth factor receptor, the
human Cdc42 protein, a small GTPase highly conserved from yeast to humans, and continued with the
identification of many Cdc42 regulatory proteins and signaling targets. The conservation of Cdc42 throughout
evolution accounts for the many fundamentally important roles it plays in cell biology and organism development,
including the regulation of cell growth and migration, and the establishment of cellular polarity. We then
discovered an unanticipated but highly significant function of Cdc42 in directing the upregulation of metabolic
activities that generate the necessary building blocks for the biosynthetic processes required for a wide range of
cellular functions. They also provide a mechanism to connect the various intracellular processes regulated by
Cdc42 to the surrounding environment by directing the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have
now been implicated in mediating intercellular communication across the evolutionary spectrum from bacteria to
higher organisms. Recently, we found that these metabolic activities are mediated through the assembly of large
protein complexes. Understanding how these metabolic/signaling complexes assemble should hold important
clues to their regulatory and catalytic mechanisms, as well as shed light on a long-standing question of how
Cdc42 activates a critically important protein kinase, mTOR (mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin), as a necessary
step for cap-dependent mRNA splicing, the neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and the
survival of cancer cells under stressful conditions. We have also recently discovered important roles for EVs in
a number of biological contexts. Determining the biochemical and structural features of multi-protein signaling
complexes that activate glutamine metabolism and mTOR, essential for the growth and survival of cells, and
moving the exciting field of EVs forward, represent major research efforts for our laboratory in the next 5 years.
We will address key gaps in our knowledge surrounding these broad areas of study by determining how Cdc42
directs the formation of signaling nodes with important functions in cell biology and significant implications for
disease, by defining their unique biochemical characteristics and 3D structures. We also will set out to address
questions representing important next steps for the development of the EV field by defining the biochemical
determinants and signaling cues that dictate the loading of essential EV cargo, and by gaining insights into their
structural features that enable their various biological functions. To achieve these goals, we will leverage our
expertise in signal transduction and benefit from a strong group of collaborators."

 Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the output neurons of the retina responsible for transmitting information
about the visual world from the eye to the brain. Thus, RGC damage and loss, a characteristic of many disorders
of the visual system, has the direct consequence of vision impairment, or blindness when RGC loss is more
severe. Our translation-enabling approach builds on a very well-established, thoroughly characterized and
validated experimental glaucoma (EG) model. This affords our study the distinct advantage of conducting each
of the proposed hypothesis-driven experiments within the framework of a reliable model of RGC degeneration
that closely recapitulates the anatomical changes and pathophysiological processes observed in human
glaucoma. Moreover, our preliminary results establish the feasibility of our approach, demonstrating that we have
already achieved successful transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RGCs into
the EG retina, while also characterizing major barriers that require targeted solutions. Hence, we propose to
employ a series of manipulations to both donor RGCs and the recipient EG retina in order to overcome the
existing barriers to RGC replacement and thus make a giant leap forward toward realization of the audacious
goal to restore vision in persons blinded by glaucoma or other optic neuropathies. Each of our Aims is soundly
based on existing knowledge of the relevant biology and will lead to meaningful enhancement of donor RGC
survival, integration, and function in the glaucomatous EG retina. We will utilize rigorous quantitative
electrophysiological and anatomical assessments for testing the hypothesis at the core of each Aim. Aim 1 will
target neuroinflammation to improve the long-term survival of transplanted RGCs. We will create
hypoimmunogenic iPSCs and manipulate the host retinal environment using systemic immunosuppressive
agents or inhibition of microglial activation. Aim 2 will augment donor cell survival and integration through
modulation of cellular age, with host retinal glia experimentally induced to an immature state through cellular
rejuvenation. Aim 3 will enhance the connectivity and axon outgrowth of donor RGCs in the retina. Donor RGCs
will be edited to express hM3Dq DREADD receptors for chemogenetic stimulation and mTOR activators.
Thrombospondin will be overexpressed in host retinal astrocytes and donor RGCs, leveraging astrocyte-derived
factors that promote axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Together, these Aims will generate a wealth of
knowledge and resources for the scientific community and bring us significantly closer to the reality of vision
restoration through RGC replacement."

Illuminating multiplexed RNA dynamics to interrogate splicing in health and disease
 Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play key roles in numerous cellular processes. A classic example is alternative
splicing, where the large megadalton spliceosome complex removes intron regions from the pre-messenger
RNA (pre-mRNA) and re-joins the exons to form the mature mRNA in the nucleus. The spliceosome consists
of protein and non-coding RNA components. Its assembly includes intricate maturation steps that are highly
regulated to ensure that the correct mature mRNA molecules are produced in healthy cells. Splicing patterns
are subject to intense regulation, requiring a sophisticated interplay of cellular cues and spatiotemporal
dynamics of splicing components. Perturbations of the splicing process may be caused by genetic mutations or
environmental stressors. These are linked to disease states like cancer and neurological diseases. Together,
the central role of complex spatiotemporal RNA dynamics for proper splicing calls for the need to interrogate
diverse RNAs live on a subcellular level over time. The complexity of RNA species involved in splicing requires
robust and versatile labeling strategies to visualize multiple RNA molecules simultaneously and relative to
other biological molecules of interest. A key goal of this research program is to develop such a robust toolbox
for multiplexed RNA visualization using advanced fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging
microscopy (FLIM) emerges as a particularly versatile approach, as it is compatible with adding sophisticated
imaging modalities for broad applicability. A central feature that will be included in the proposed work is the
ability to visualize multiple RNAs simultaneously, including small non-coding RNAs with roles in splicing.
Multiplexed tagging and tracking of RNAs with our Riboglow platform using FLIM requires a FLIM microscope.
This application requests purchase of an upgrade of an existing confocal microscopy system with fluorescence
lifetime imaging microscopy capabilities. More broadly, these fluorescence lifetime imaging capabilities will
allow researchers across different fields to investigate biomolecules in a variety of relevant cell model systems.
The requested FLIM technology will benefit colleagues in my home department and neighboring departments
and I am excited to build this advanced fluorescence microscopy capacity."
11100491,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Our laboratory has, for many years, studied the essential process of mRNA decay in
the model Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. We have identified several ribonuclease (RNase) enzymes
of B. subtilis and have elucidated the role they play in mRNA turnover. The viability of a B. subtilis strain lacking
all of the known 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases prompted us to pursue identification of additional RNase activities.
Using classic protein biochemistry, we recently identified a novel RNase, named YloC. YloC is an
endoribonuclease with a hexameric structure, an unusual characteristic that is shared with only one other RNase:
the Nsp15 protein of the SARS-CoV family. Initial experiments suggest that, although YloC has ribonuclease
activity in vitro, it may function as an adapter for RNA interactions in vivo. Although proteins with significant
homology to YloC are widespread in bacterial species, there is no published information on the structure of any
member of this protein family. The current proposal seeks to elucidate the structure and function of YloC, and
the related Escherichia coli YicC, as follows:
 • Mutagenize highly conserved residues of YloC/YicC to determine the effect on several properties –
 including ribonuclease activity, RNA binding, and structure – and to clarify functional domains of the
protein.
 • Identify high-affinity RNA ligands of YicC via SELEX procedures with random-sequence
 oligonucleotides and with genomic RNA sequences.
 • Characterize how the strong interaction of YloC with E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)
 acts in small RNA (sRNA) regulation in E. coli and possibly in B. subtilis.
 • Determine the three-dimensional structure of the highly homologous E. coli YicC protein bound to an
 RNA substrate, as well as the structure of YloC and/or its homologs from thermophilic bacterial species.
 This work will build on an initial determination of the structure of YicC.
RELEVANCE: Ribonucleases play essential roles in RNA turnover and processing. A thorough understanding
of the proteins that bind to and act enzymatically on RNA molecules will enable design of antimicrobial agents
that disrupt such proteins and thereby interfere with bacterial cell growth.

Precious metal catalysts are typically used for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) even
though first-row transition metals such as Ni are more sustainable and can facilitate unique reactivity. For exam-
ple, Ni-catalyzed reactions can readily form sp2-sp3 C–C bonds, which provides methods to synthesize the types
of non-planar APIs that are challenging to prepare using precious metal-catalyzed reactions. However, in general,
the relative lack of mechanistic understanding about Ni-catalyzed reactions has hindered their use in the syn-
thesis of APIs because it inhibits the development of improved systems and the rational design of new reactions.
One difficulty in elucidating the pathway of Ni-catalyzed transformations is that NiI complexes are often invoked
as intermediates but information about their reactivity is limited. In this project, novel NiI halide, alkyl, and aryl
species supported by bidentate nitrogen ligands, which are proposed as intermediates in reactions including
cross-coupling, cross-electrophile coupling (XEC), and metallaphotoredox based processes, will be synthesized.
The ability of these NiI complexes to undergo the proposed elementary steps in catalysis will be investigated as
a function of the ancillary ligand and reaction conditions using experimental and computational techniques.
These studies will be complemented by experiments to probe how NiI species are formed via comproportionation
between Ni0 and NiII complexes and in situ studies to elucidate the speciation of Ni catalysts during catalysis. It
is expected that our fundamental investigations will lead to the design of the next generation of Ni-catalyzed
reactions by providing guidelines about the reactivity of NiI complexes. Another problem with the development
of Ni-catalyzed reactions is that they often involve heterogeneous reductants, which complicate mechanistic
studies, create difficulties for scale up, and cannot readily be tuned to vary the reduction potential. The PI’s group
has developed a series of commercially available tunable homogeneous reductants, with reduction potentials
similar to Zn0. Apart from leading to improvements in practicality, the tunability of these reductants was crucial
for developing novel strategies for controlling the rate of alkyl radical generation from Katritzky salts and 1° alkyl
halides in Ni-catalyzed C(sp2)–C(sp3) XEC, which led to new reactivity. Here, tunable homogeneous reductants,
with reduction potentials similar to Mn0, a commonly used heterogeneous reductant, will be prepared. Kinetic
studies will be performed to understand the ability of the reductants to control the rates of alkyl radical formation
from N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters and 1°, 2°, and 3° alkyl halides. This will be accompanied by experi-
ments to identify ancillary ligands on NiII complexes that enable facile trapping of alkyl radicals, which is currently
unknown. The studies on alkyl radical generation and trapping will aid in solving significant problems in C(sp2)–
C(sp3) XEC, such as the use of aryl and alkyl chlorides and 3° alkyl halides as substrates. Finally, through a
collaboration with Merck, the new methods will be evaluated against medicinal chemistry targets and applied to
nanomole scale chemistry, which is an emerging strategy to prepare diverse libraries of bioactive compounds."

procedure of “therapeutic hypothermia.” Our laboratory is interested in fundamental genetic analysis and
mechanistic studies of hypoxia, hypothermia, innate ischemic tolerance in resilient organisms, and
cytoprotection against tissue injuries caused by metabolic stresses. We leverage genetically tractable C.
elegans mutants isolated from large-scale screens with abnormal cell physiological and organismal behavioral

organocatalysis and palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. We utilize 13C and 2H kinetic isotope
effects (KIEs) in combination with theoretical calculations as design tools to evaluate fine details of the

studies in the area of asymmetric organocatalysis (2013-present) have resolved long-standing debates,
uncovered novel mechanistic pathways, and probed origins of enantioselectivity in a wide variety of
reaction types. In 2018, NIH funding enabled us to expand our research program to the study of
palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions – an area of catalysis that is central to medicinal
chemistry. We have discovered that the magnitude of 13C KIE is highly sensitive to minor changes in
the carbon-palladium distance at the TS of the RDS – allowing us to distinguish between competing
pathways and probe the ligand environment at the metal center, all under catalytic conditions. Finally,
we have developed a novel methodology that utilizes symmetric reactants to obtain this information at a
fraction of the time and effort of traditional KIE approaches.
 This MIRA proposal seeks to further expand our research program to include new modes of
catalysis at the frontier of modern-day organic synthesis: (a) palladium catalyzed C-H bond-activation
and functionalization, and (b) nickel metallophotoredox catalysis. Over the next five years, our goal is to
establish our combined experimental and theoretical approach as the state-of-the-art to gain atomistic
understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these reactions. We chose these two areas to
expand our research program for two reasons – (a) new reaction discovery has far outpaced
mechanistic understanding of these reactions, and (b) our discoveries in palladium catalyzed cross-
coupling chemistry strongly indicate that our approach is ideally suited to resolve key mechanistic
questions in these contemporary areas of catalysis.
 The overall vision of our research program is to develop probes that can rapidly evaluate the
mechanism of catalytic reactions. We seek to change the paradigm that rigorous mechanistic

Desymmetrizing activation of prochiral C–H bonds via metal insertion has emerged as a
potentially transformative approach for the rapid and divergent synthesis of chiral compounds.
However, a significant challenge prohibiting the broad utility of this approach is the poor reactivity
of native substrates in the absence of externally-appended directing groups. This proposal directly
addresses this challenge by developing two approaches to achieve the enantioselective C–H
activation of a range of native substrates commonly found in organic synthesis and drug
discovery—carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and amines: (A) Development of chiral bidentate
L,X-type ligands containing N-acetyl or pyridone motifs to accelerate C–H cleavage; (B)
Development of chiral transient directing groups (TDGs) to enable enantioselective C–H
activation of ketones, aldehydes and amines. Following initial discoveries of chiral ligands and
TDGs, we will then develop various catalytic cycles to enable the enantioselective C–H activation
of diverse native substrates, forming a range of carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds
asymmetrically.
These novel reactions will provide a versatile platform for the construction of α-, β-, and γ-
stereocenters. These technologies will be applied to drug discovery in collaboration with the
pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories. Specifically, the one-step access to the
atypical chiral β-lactones and lactams via enantioselective C–H activation will be applied to the
discovery of covalent inhibitors for serine hydrolases and cysteine-dependent proteins using
activity-based protein profiling."
11100723,"1 Project Summary
 2 RNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This
 3 editing of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the ‘adenosine deaminase acting on
 4 RNA-1’ protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily
 5 through the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding
 6 domain named ‘Zα’ at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as
 7 Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a
 8 left-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such
 9 structures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many —if not most— regions proposed
10 to adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations
11 are generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Zα of ADAR1, as well as their
12 exact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding
13 of Zα to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to
14 answer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also
15 non-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-
16 RNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Zα? What are the structural
17 features of Z-RNA recognition by Zα at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically
18 characterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.
19 This aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an
20 RNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of
21 RNA fragments bound to Zα in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Zα binding
22 sites and Zα-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust
23 expertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted
24 company. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of
25 Z-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim
26 to explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of
27 ADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive
28 mechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and
29 contribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies."
11046486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (COMPONENTS A, B and C):
 Viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) remain major causes of morbidity
in children, making vaccine development and implementation a high public health priority. The overall goal of
the CDC New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) is to establish a network of US institutions that develop
and implement standard research protocols to answer important questions about the burden of disease and
natural history of vaccine preventable diseases, specifically, those causing ARI and AGE. A second goal of
population-based NVSN surveillance is to provide accurate estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) in
preventing pediatric hospitalization or medical care visits. A third goal is the ability to rapidly pivot to study
novel agents such as enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) or SARS-CoV-2, and syndromes such as acute flaccid
myelitis (AFM) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).
 The proposed work (comprising Mandatory Core A, and Optional Components B and C) will enhance
the NVSN site in Rochester, NY—one of 2 original members of the now 7-site network. For 20 years we have
published important studies on the burden of disease and natural history of AGE due to rotavirus and
norovirus, and ARI due to influenza, (RSV), and other viruses. These data helped inform AAP and ACIP on
pediatric influenza and rotavirus vaccination, and palivizumab use for RSV prevention. Our specific aims are:
 Mandatory Core Component A: Perform prospective, population-based active surveillance for ARIs and
 AGEs in inpatient and ED settings as well as asymptomatic controls, for children 0-18 years. We will use
 molecular diagnostics for rotavirus, norovirus, influenza, RSV, PIV, EV-D68, SARS-CoV-2, and other viruses.
 We will assess VE for influenza, rotavirus, and future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in preventing pediatric
 hospitalizations and ED visits. We will delineate the disease burden of ARI and AGE using our unique
 capture of virtually all pediatric hospitalizations and ED visits in our region. We will assess the impact of
 future vaccines and other immunoprophylaxis strategies. We will perform active surveillance and
 epidemiologic studies of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) syndrome in children. Finally, we will perform and lead
 epidemiological, implementation and laboratory studies based on population-based NVSN surveillance.
 Optional Component B: Implement active prospective population-based ARI/AGE surveillance studies in
 children seeking medical care in outpatient practices, as the burden of ARI and AGE are likely high.
 Optional Component C: Investigate the incidence, spectrum of disease, and risk factors associated with
 SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C.
 Our proposed research will provide high impact information to develop sound policies for the prevention
of pediatric vaccine-preventable diseases, and to improve the health of US children."
11046457,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Mandatory Component A
Acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are the leading causes of death worldwide in
young children. Established leading viral etiologies of AGE are rotavirus and norovirus and respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) and influenza virus for ARI. Our understanding of ARI and AGE epidemiology is constantly
changing due to spatiotemporal fluctuations, discovery of new or re-emerging pathogens [e.g. enterovirus D68
(EV-D68) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)], and use of rotavirus and
influenza vaccines. Hence, surveillance efforts are imperative to define ARI and AGE disease burden,
causative pathogens, outcomes, and vaccine impact. The primary influenza prevention strategy in the United
States is vaccination for all individuals six months or older. There is a paucity of data regarding vaccine
effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in children, and influenza viruses and vaccine
antigenic components change annually. Therefore, perpetual assessments of VE are needed to monitor the
impact of influenza vaccination on disease and inform strategies to improve magnitude, durability, and breadth
of protection. Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are an urgent public-health priority and likely will become
available on an accelerated timeline in an effort to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous, prospective
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VE is crucial to support reliance on vaccines as primary prevention. Thus, the
first main objective of this project is to conduct population-based active surveillance for respiratory and
enteric viral pathogens in pediatric inpatient and emergency department settings and asymptomatic
controls. Our team of Vanderbilt investigators is highly experienced in conducting prospective, population-
based ARI and AGE surveillance. We propose to conduct ARI and AGE surveillance with the following specific
aims: 1) To perform prospective, active surveillance to determine the etiology and burden of inpatient and
emergency department (ED) acute viral respiratory and enteric diseases among the pediatric population. 2) To
characterize the clinical and epidemiologic factors of pediatric infections (including in asymptomatic children)
through active surveillance. 3) To evaluate vaccine effectiveness and impact of vaccines and other
interventions (e.g., immunoprophylaxis with antiviral agents or other therapeutics) available or projected to
become available during the period of performance. The second main objective of this project is to conduct
surveillance and epidemiologic characterization of acute flaccid myelitis syndrome in children. Given
the epidemiologic connection between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), it will be important to
conduct rigorous, active, longitudinal surveillance for AFM across multiple consecutive seasons; carefully
define AFM clinical spectrum, risk factors, incidence rates, and laboratory parameters; and document local
circulation of EV-D68 and other ARI and AGE pathogens coincident with increased AFM occurrence. This work
underpins development of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for AFM."
11091800,"The function of rhythmic oscillations in brain activity has long been a subject of both
speculation and research. Recent evidence supports theories than synchronization of such
oscillations between brain areas can contribute to modulating the strength of their connectivity;
such changes in coupling between areas have been reported during cognitive functions including
attention and working memory. Information can also be encoded in the timing of neuron’s action
potentials relative to these oscillations; indeed, such ‘phase coding’ can sometimes represent
different information than is available in the firing rate alone. These experiments will determine
whether phase coding is used to represent visual information during working memory and eye
movements, and test the role of interactions between prefrontal and visual cortex in modulating
this phase coding. The role of prefrontal signals in modulating phase coding in visual cortex will
be tested using both correlative measures of synchronization between prefrontal and visual areas
during memory maintenance, and pharmacological manipulation of prefrontal activity.
Pharmacological activation will be used to test whether certain patterns of activity in visual cortex
are sufficient to gate entry of a sensory signal into working memory. Lastly, the ability of a phase
code to multiplex information around the time of eye movements, thus disambiguating the source
of sensory signals and expanding the information capacity of the visual system will be directly
examined. Understanding the contribution of phase coding to the visual representation, along with
the role of interactions between prefrontal and visual cortex in modulating such representations,
will provide a necessary comparison point for neurological disorders involving impaired prefrontal-
sensory interactions, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, and autism spectrum disorders."

11095070,"Abstract. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) regulates tissue growth and repair in multiple organs. A conserved
mechanism of synthesis and degradation modulates PGE2 levels in response to trauma, inflammation and
disease. In particular, the enzyme 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the main PGE2-degrading
enzyme and therefore a key regulator of tissue repair and regeneration. 15-PGDH is an attractive drug target
for diseases characterized by tissue damage. Our team successfully developed the first small molecule
inhibitors of 15-PGDH with in vivo activities. In rodents, our inhibitors 1) accelerate recovery following bone
marrow transplantation, 2) accelerate recovery from, or prevent, ulcerative colitis, 3) accelerate regrowth of
liver tissue following partial hepatectomy, 4) ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced disease
model, 5) enhance survival of new hippocampal neurons in adult mice, and 6) preserve cognitive function and
minimize neuronal damage in mice following traumatic brain injury. Independent reports have described
beneficial effects of 15-PGDH inhibition in models of renal disease and pulmonary fibrosis.
We now propose a collaborative chemical, structural and cell-signaling interrogation of the role and activity of
15-PGDH. Our expertise includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, pharmacology, and
structural biology. In Aim 1, we will define and exploit the structural basis for inhibition of 15-PGDH by small
molecules. This aims builds on the first cryoEM structure (2.3 Å resolution) of 15-PGDH and two unrelated
scaffolds of low-nM inhibitors of 15-PGDH. Proposed research aims to solve the structure of 15-PGDH in
complex with new small molecule inhibitors or substrate. Computational approaches will be employed to
interrogate substrate/inhibitor binding and the enzymatic mechanism. In Aim 2, we will define the cellular,
protein and cytokine signaling networks that are regulated by 15-PGDH and that are engaged by 15-PGDH
inhibitors to potentiate tissue regeneration and repair. The foundation of this aim includes the first
demonstration of 15-PGDH activity in the brain, the identification of macrophages and microglia as major
reservoirs of 15-PGDH expression in peripheral tissues and brain, respectively, and the discovery of cell and
cytokine networks that respond to inhibiting 15-PGDH. We now propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing to
determine the cell types that express 15-PGDH. Similar approaches will identify the cell-signaling network of
induced cytokines and the cell types activated to express them. These studies will be performed in mice
recovering from injury that have been treated with 15-PGDH inhibitors, along with appropriate controls. Finally,
we will engineer macrophage- and microglia-targeted 15-PGDH knockouts to define the role of 15-PGDH
expression in macrophages and microglia in mediating a conserved, cross-tissue response to PGE2 and 15-
PGDH inhibitors. This data set will provide a foundation for future advancement of therapeutics targeting 15-
PGDH and additional drug targets that modulate tissue regeneration."
11095775,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of death among teenagers in the United States. Teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation are at even greater risk. However, most parent-focused interventions target teen drivers during the learner phase, with very few interventions being implemented during the unsupervised independent driving phase or targeting high-risk teen drivers, such as those with traffic violations. Advances in technology, ranging from in-vehicle devices to smartphone applications, offer a new avenue to enhance teens’ safe driving. However, little is known about how to use this technology to actively engage parents, and subsequently, influence teens’ safe driving practices. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of providing driving feedback (with and without parent training) on reducing risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors, and recidivism (subsequent traffic violation) among high-risk teen drivers. Our central hypothesis is that driving feedback via a technological device and app will reduce risky driving events and behaviors, and that augmenting feedback with parent training will further improve outcomes. We will test the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the effects of the intervention on reducing teens’ risky driving events and unsafe driving behaviors; Aim 2: Determine the effects of the intervention on increasing frequency and quality of parent-teen communication about safe driving practices; and Aim 3: Determine the effects of the intervention on decreasing teen traffic violation recidivism. We will enroll teen drivers (age 16 to 17 years) who committed a moving violation along with their parents/legal guardians (n=240 dyads) from the Ohio Franklin County Juvenile Traffic Court following the teens’ mandatory court hearing. Enrolled parent-teen dyads will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (n=80 dyads/group): Group 1, control group with no device feedback nor parent training; Group 2, device feedback to teens only, providing no feedback nor training to parents; or Group 3, device feedback to teens and parents, who will also receive individualized virtual training with a traffic safety communication specialist. The expected outcome will establish the effectiveness of in-vehicle driving feedback technology augmented with parent training in reducing risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors and recidivism. Our project is significant because it targets safe driving among high-risk teens who have committed a traffic violation. The study is innovative because it partners with the local court system and utilizes novel in-vehicle technologies to provide objectively measured study outcomes. The findings of this study will have a significant impact on juvenile traffic court’s practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving safety by reducing crashes, injuries, and deaths."
11092979,"Abrupt menopause induction together with anti-estrogen therapy improves recurrence-free
survival in breast cancer and is a new standard of care for premenopausal women with hormone
receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. This near-complete estrogen deprivation (NCED) therapy
also places these women at risk of organ compromise associated with early hypoestrogenemia.
Early hypoestrogenemia in women with non-cancerous reasons for premature menopause is
associated with significant cardiovascular (CV) compromise including atherosclerosis and
coronary artery disease, which can be detected preclinically by myocardial perfusion imaging and
computed tomography angiography. Less is known about how NCED therapy will impact CV
health in the tens of thousands of premenopausal women diagnosed with HR-positive breast
cancer each year who will see NCED therapy. It is critical to understand the early natural history
of this risk because clinical CV disease related to hypoestrogenemia will not be reversible. Given
the prevalence of HR-positive breast cancer and marked improvements in survival following
breast cancer, long-term CV sequalae from cancer treatments have the potential to both impact
large numbers of women and offset these survival gains. We will study the early impact of NCED
on the CV system to identify pre-clinical markers of myocardial compromise. The CV health of
women initiating NCED will be assessed by comprehensive, quantitative serial cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging stress studies over a two-year period to document changes in flow of both
small and large CV vessels as well as overall left ventricular structure and function.
We will test the overarching hypothesis that premenopausal women receiving NCED for HR-
positive breast cancer have CV declines that can be identified preclinically using the following
aims: Characterize and quantify the extent of microvascular injury and perfusion changes
experienced during early NCED therapy; Characterize and quantify the extent structural and
functional alterations to the aorta and left ventricle while on NCED therapy; Identify potential
biomarkers and additional risk factors for CV decline in patients receiving NCED. The knowledge
derived from these aims will provide an understanding of which patients are at risk of CV
compromise from NCED. These studies will further enable development of standard of care
predictive tools to assess CV decline in women on NCED before it is clinically apparent with the
goal of allowing women to safely remain on anti-neoplastic regimens and thereby lower both the
burdens of cancer and cardiovascular treatment-related toxicity."
11098818,"Abstract of Funded R35 (GM152382): Structural Dynamics of Active Transporters.
The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to illuminate the structure, dynamics and
mechanistic principles that underpin active efflux of solutes, often of impressive size such as
protein domains, across cell membranes. Clinical multidrug resistance (MDR) in the treatment of
bacterial and fungal infections, and chemotherapy of neoplasms can be associated with
overexpression of membrane-embedded efflux pumps, collectively referred to as MDR
transporters, that selectively extrude cytotoxic molecules from the cell. MDR transporters harness
the free energy of ATP hydrolysis or that stored in electrochemical gradients to power a
conformational cycle that drives the energetically uphill vectorial translocation of substrates. The
cycle entails the energy-coupled isomerization of the transporter between multiple intermediates
thereby executing alternating access of the substrate binding site. Defining the structural elements
mediating alternating access and decoding the mechanism of energy conversion in a lipid bilayer
environment are central questions in the field and critical for elucidating transport mechanisms.
This MIRA proposal will continue support of two established, productive research programs
focused on addressing these questions for ATP binding cassette (ABC) and Multidrug and Toxin
Extrusion (MATE) transporters. Our innovative experimental blueprint capitalizes on recent
transformational advances in machine learning protein structure prediction, state of the art
electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR) tools in the context of high resolution cryoEM
structures. Project 1, motivated and grounded in the contribution of the PI’s group, seeks to
decipher ion-substrate coupling, to define conserved and divergent elements of alternating
access, and to reveal specific transporter-lipids interactions that shape the energy landscape of
conformational changes in MATE transporters. Project 2 will expand a long-standing investigation
of energy transduction and alternating access ABC efflux transporters in three archetypes that
represent a spectrum of energy conversion and substrate size. The two projects will illuminate
mechanistic principles for families of transporters implicated in the phenomena of drug resistance
and basic bacterial defense strategies."
11098819,"We propose to use a Luminex 200 System for multiplexed quantification of proteins and RNAs
from cell lysates. Our work focuses on post-transcriptional control of neural function with
emphasis on translational control of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We investigate
the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders that arise when this translation goes
awry. We find that mis-regulated translation leads to changes in alternative splicing and RNA
degradation, which in turn contribute to neuropathology. More specifically, our research is
comprised of three distinct but complementary areas: (1) CPEB1 and cytoplasmic polyadenylation
control of translation; (2) FMRP regulation of translation with emphasis on ribosome stalling and
codon usage; (3) FMRP regulation of alternative splicing. CPEB1-regulated cytoplasmic
polyadenylation governs translation in post-synaptic compartments, which in turn modifies
synaptic strength, the underlying cellular basis of learning and memory. Molecular,
electrophysiological, and behavioral experiments from our laboratory have demonstrated that
CPEB1 regulates activity-dependent cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation, which in
turn modifies synaptic strength, and cognition. CPEB1 nucleates several proteins that promote
poly(A) tail growth and removal and mediate translation initiation; they also regulate plasticity and
animal behavior. Another RNA binding protein important for brain function is FMRP, the product
of the Fragile X Syndrome gene FMR1. FMRP binds >1000 RNAs in the brain and regulates
translation, primarily by stalling ribosome translocation on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA
encodes the epigenetic factor SETD2, which catalyzes the chromatin mark H3K36me3. In FMRP-
deficient mouse brain, SETD2 levels are elevated and the H3K36me3 chromatin landscape,
which is principally located in gene bodies, is disrupted. H3K36me3 is linked to alternative pre-
mRNA splicing and there is widespread mis-regulation of splicing in FMRP knockout (KO) mice.
The main objectives our research going forward will address key unanswered questions regarding
RNA regulation of neural function, primarily using mouse models: (a) CPEB1-deficiency rescues
Fragile X pathophysiology in FMRP KO mice. Does this rescue involve ribosome stalling and/or
polyadenylation? (b) CPEB1 also regulates 3’UTR length. What is the mechanism by which this
occurs? (c) How does FMRP stall ribosomes on specific mRNAs? Does FMRP act as a molecular
roadblock to ribosome transit and/or does FMRP interact with the ribosome? (d) How does FMRP
regulate alternative splicing? Some of the mis-splicing events appear to involve H3K36me3, but
these are in the minority. Does FMRP regulate the translation of mRNAs encoding splicing factors,
and/or does FMRP, which is a shuttling protein, affect splicing directly? (e) How does FMRP
employ codon optimality to regulate translation and RNA stability? We will address these issues
by ribosome profiling, which we modified to distinguish between translocating and stalled
ribosomes, and direct nanopore RNA sequencing, which yields poly(A) tail size at near-nucleotide
resolution as well as RNA isoforms that arise by alternative splicing. We will deplete key regulatory
factors from the mouse brain and assess synaptic function and animal behavior."
11098821,"This supplement will critically update the instrumentation available for the parent R35 MIRA award, entitled The
RNA nanomachines of gene expression dissected at the single molecule level. The central features of the
proposed instrumentation, the AbbeLight SAFe M90 plug-in imaging module, are its versatility, turnkey
readiness, and ease of use for automated, multicolor, optimized total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and
highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) imaging of live and fixed mammalian cells. These features
will not only increase the information content and throughput of our measurements, but also greatly facilitate
access to these methods by the diverse group of junior and senior coworkers in the PI's group. Funding will
critically complement two recent NIH investments into the parent grant. First, we used a recent administrative
supplement to install a Cytosurge FluidFM OMNIUM, a versatile, turnkey instrument for injecting, sampling, and
manipulating the content of live mammalian cells. Second, we will use funds from the parent grant to update our
15-year old objective-type TIRF microscope (O-TIRFM) body for our intracellular single-molecule, high-resolution
localization and counting (iSHiRLoC) technology. Our MIRA grant aims to dissect the mechanisms of the
nanoscale RNA machines of gene expression at the single molecule level, so far focusing on bacterial
riboswitches and the yeast spliceosome. Combining the high-performance, ultra-wide-field, multicolor
capabilities and automation of the AbbeLight SAFe M90 imaging module with the upgrade of the O-TIRFM body
and the FluidFM OMNIUM semi-automated cell injector will transform our ability to incorporate studies of the
intracellular miRNA-guided silencing machinery into the parent grant. Building on our group's 25-year expertise
in this space, we then aim to: 1.) Apply our established mechanistic enzymology approaches to an ever broader
set of RNAs involved in regulating transcription, translation and splicing, seizing the opportunities arising from
the continuing discoveries of new functional RNAs; and 2.) Push the limits of our approaches to be able to probe
increasingly complex biological contexts and mechanisms, realizing opportunities for unprecedented discoveries
where individual RNA nanomachines interact. In pursuit of these aims, we will address the unifying hypothesis
that dynamic RNA structures are a major determinant of the outcomes of gene expression, as exemplified by
the fact that transient miRNA:mRNA interactions lead to the regulation of protein translation in mammalian cells.
To address this hypothesis, we have developed a suite of intracellular single particle tracking approaches
wherein we inject fluorophore labeled RNAs at defined time points and image them at the single molecule level
with high spatiotemporal resolution and multiple colors, an approach whose multiplexing and throughput will be
drastically expanded by integrating the AbbeLight SAFe M90 module. We anticipate that this addition will greatly
accelerate our progress in intracellular single particle tracking and functional analysis by completing an easy-to-
use cell injection and precise imaging instrument that postdocs and students can quickly deploy independently."
11098823,"PROJECT SUMMARY
V-ATPases are versatile, highly conserved, multi-subunit proton pumps responsible for
organelle acidification in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Under the parent proposal, we are seeking
to understand the regulation of V- ATPases, including the roles of subunit isoforms and enzyme
subpopulations, in order to distinguish, and eventually target, V-ATPases in specific locations.
V-ATPases are regulated by reversible disassembly of the peripheral V1 subcomplex from the
integral membrane Vo subcomplex, and RAVE/Rabconnectin-3 complexes play a critical role in
this process. Visualizing the localization of V-ATPase subunits and regulators by wide-field and
fluorescence microscopy is a critical component of this work. We have been able to visualize
reversible release of V1 subunits from Vo in membranes as extracellular conditions vary.
Recently, we have found that the V-ATPases become more disassembled as yeast cells age;
this disassembly results in vacuole alkalinization but can be reversed by caloric restriction, an
established mechanism for prolonging lifespan in multiple organisms. This result is exciting as
mammalian cells show declines in lysosomal acidification in age that are poorly understood.
We also observe glucose-dependent changes in association of the RAVE complex with the
vacuolar membrane and have shown that loss of RAVE function shortens lifespan, consistent
with its role in V-ATPase assembly. Much of our work continues to be in the yeast model
system, and in addition to the inherent challenges of imaging in small cells, some of the proteins
that signal and drive V-ATPase assembly changes are present at low levels in cells. We are
requesting an administrative supplement for purchase of an improved camera, along with an
updated workstation and software for its operation. These additions to an existing wide-field
microscope will allow us to better detect and localize the proteins involved in V-ATPase
regulation as cells respond to diverse conditions."
11099451,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic cell death process that can suppress tumor formation and
contribute to disease pathology. The long-term objective of this research is to understand the
molecular regulation of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is thought to occur through a stereotypical and
invariant lipid-dependent mechanism. However, in new preliminary studies we have uncovered
evidence for two different forms of ferroptosis defined by unique genetic regulation and metabolic
alterations. We find that ferroptosis triggered by direct inactivation of the enzyme GPX4 requires
the function of the lipid metabolic enzyme ACSL4. A second sub-type of ferroptosis, triggered by
cystine deprivation, does not require ACSL4 or related lipid metabolic enzymes and instead relies
on a novel set of genes. Guided by these new preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that
ferroptosis can be executed by two fundamentally distinct mechanisms. We will test this
hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (i) defining the role of ACSL4 and related lipid
metabolic enzymes in promoting ferroptosis in response to direct GPX4 inhibition, (ii) identifying
cellular and molecular features that distinguish the two ferroptosis mechanisms in vitro and in
vivo, and (iii) defining genes and processes that regulate ACSL4-independent ferroptosis in
response to cystine deprivation. These studies will be carried out using cutting-edge chemical,
genetic, functional genomic, lipidomic, and imaging tools and methods. This research will advance
our fundamental understanding of ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal of improving human health."
11099140,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The zoonotic transmission of viral pathogens from animals to humans contributes to the majority of emerging
infectious diseases, which pose a substantial and increasing threat to human health. While host innate
immunity—namely the production of Type I Interferon (IFN) and the subsequent production of Interferon
Stimulated Genes (ISGS) with antiviral activities—plays an important role in determining viral tropism and limiting
the cross-species transmission of viruses, much work remains on identifying and characterizing ISGs limiting
viral tropism. Our lab has determined that while the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and non-human
primate simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) are able to at least partly evade IFN-mediated defenses in cells
from their cognate host, they remain exquisitely sensitive to such defenses in cells from unnatural hosts. Since
HIV-1 and HIV-2 both arose from the cross-species transmission of diverse SIV species, the human and primate
immunodeficiency viruses are a rich model system for studying the relationship between host innate immunity
and viral adaptation. In order to identify human genes inhibiting SIV infection, we have modified a recently
described high-throughput, CRISPR-based screening assay to identify human ISGs with activity against
SIVmac239. Our preliminary data suggests that our model system is working as designed, as had identified a
number of candidate genes that inhibit SIVmac infection in human cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanism of action of novel ISGs with confirmed activity against SIVmac239. We will perform stepwise
mechanistic studies to dissect the point of inhibition in the viral lifecycle. We will additionally perform co-
immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies to identify viral components and cellular cofactors relevant to
mechanism of inhibition. In Aim 2, we will use our established pipeline to screen for ISGs inhibiting diverse
SIV strains. Preliminary data strongly suggests that we will be able to directly use the system we have developed
to screen diverse strains of SIV. We will assess multiple SIV strains for sensitivity to IFN and screen those that
are sensitive for inhibitory ISGs. We hypothesize that there will be both conserved and distinct inhibitory factors
targeting the various SIV species. Combined, these approaches will reveal novel restriction factors that inhibit
diverse SIVs in human cells, providing insight into the evolutionary adaptations that HIV-1 and HIV-2 made in
order to successfully colonize humans."
11100054,"Project Summary:
Numerous human diseases result from recurrent DNA rearrangements involving unstable genomic regions.
They are facilitated by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs) and are the result of nonallelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) between such paralogous genomic segments. The 22q11.2 region
undergoes a significant number of germline rearrangements and has been classified as one of the most
unstable regions of the human genome. Thus, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most
common microdeletion disorder. It is associated with phenotypic and neuropsychiatric pathology, both of which
are widely variable. In most affected individuals, the deletion is de novo and is the result of NAHR mediated by
four chromosome22-specific low copy repeats (LCRA, -B, -C and -D) in 22q11.2. Their size and the presence
of numerous segments with near-identical sequence render these chromosome specific LCRs as substrates
for NAHR. LCR22s are extremely difficult to reliably map and sequence because of their structural
characteristics. Currently, an accurate reference sequence for the region does not exist. Also, they are
recalcitrant to short and long read sequencing such that the level of their polymorphism and variability in the
general population is unknown. However, optical mapping of the region with Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr
technology has overcome this difficulty. Our optical mapping data suggests a complex organization of
duplicated 160kb modules within LCRA and LCRD, including copy number and orientation differences. Further,
a common inversion polymorphism within LCRD has been identified. Our preliminary data suggests that this
and other polymorphisms are less prevalent in African Americans (AAs), which may finally explain the relative
deficit of AAs in our CHOP-based 22q11.2DS cohort. Our funded R01 proposed to employ innovative Bionano
optical mapping technology to determine the frequency of 22q11 LCR polymorphisms in the general population
and explore the role they play in facilitating rearrangements. The prevalence of the LCRD inversion in several
different populations (CEU, African, and African American subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project; local white
and AA 22q11DS trios) is being determined. The LCR22-containing regions associated with 22q11.2DS is
being examined in these populations to determine their structure and variation. Hence, by leveraging the
increased sensitivity afforded by long single molecule optical mapping on nanochannel arrays, this proposal is
elucidating the previously unmapped structure and variation of LCR22s and surrounding regions in detail. The
data and maps generated herein will provide us with a roadmap to gain access to many other difficult to map
and sequence genomic regions and other genomic disorders. However, our Generation 1 Saphyr System is
being phased out of production by Bionano Genomics, Thus, to continue this work, we need to trade in our
Generation 1 Saphyr system for a Generation 2 Saphyr replacement."

Parent Grant: R35-GM122483. Metal Catalyzed Methods for Organic Synthesis
Research Plan:
 Our group's research focuses on developing methods for forming carbon-heteroatom and carbon-
carbon bonds. Creating highly functionalized molecules in a reliable manner is crucial for organic
synthesis, underpinning drug discovery, development, and scale-up. Our techniques are widely adopted
in academia and industry for synthesizing complex molecules, serving as important processes for
synthetic chemists. By inventing new methods, we not only gain access to important compounds but also
the ability to modify them efﬁciently and selectively, altering their properties and minimizing side effects.
 Our ongoing projects encompass various areas, including palladium-catalyzed cross coupling
methods for generating heterocyclic carbon-nitrogen bonds; copper-catalyzed methods for the
construction of carbon-oxygen or carbon-nitrogen bonds; copper-catalyzed methods for the highly regio-
diastereo-, and enantioselective synthesis of aliphatic amines; and copper-catalyzed methods for the
asymmetric formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Mechanistic studies have helped us to investigate the
fundamental aspects of these transformations, guiding us to enhance their efﬁciency and applicability.
The substrates we target are integral structural components found in pharmaceuticals, natural products,
agrochemicals and sensors.
 In our continued efforts in Pd-catalyzed cross coupling reactions we have developed easily
accessible precursors for Pd oxidative addition complexes.1 We have also designed new ligands and mild
reaction conditions for the C–N cross coupling of ﬁve-membered heteroaryl halides with secondary,
primary aliphatic amines and anilines.2
Ullmann-type C–N coupling reactions represent an important alternative to well-established
palladium-catalyzed approaches due to the differing reactivity, lower cost, and diminished toxicity of
copper. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods we have established a new class
of anionic ligands for Cu-catalyzed C–N coupling of aryl bromides and alkyl amines at room temperature.3
Using our newly developed N1,N2-diarylbenzene-1,2-diamine ligand class, we have also developed a Cu-
catalyzed method for the coupling of alcohols and (hetero)aryl bromides.4
 We have introduced new copper-hydride methods for the enantioselective oleﬁn
hydromethylation,5 alkyne hydroalkylation,6 and the asymmetric formal hydroformylation of vinyl arenes.7
 Since the submission of our last renewal in 2022, we have reported 14 publications that were
funded by the parent grant R35-122483. We dedicate signiﬁcant efforts to make our methods user-
friendly, practical, and applicable across a broad spectrum of compounds. We systematically optimize
the limitations and range of conditions and substrates they can accommodate. Several analytical
instruments play important roles in our studies including, nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR)
spectroscopy, supercritical ﬂuid chromatography (SFC), automated ﬂash column puriﬁcation system,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography (GC)
and mass spectrometry (MS).
 One of the most heavily relied on tools in our lab is the GCMS. Researchers employ the GCMS
to analyze volatile reaction products, identify intermediates and quantify reactants and products. By
coupling gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, it can separate and detect compounds based on
their mass-to-charge rations. The GCMS helps in the Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of reaction
components, monitoring reaction progress, elucidation of reaction mechanisms, characterization of
intermediates, analysis of catalyst stability and deactivation, and reaction optimization. It is a powerful
analytical technique that enables us to explore the intricacies of catalytic systems and its impact.
 Our current instrument is an Agilent GC model 6850 and MS model 5975 system. It was acquired
in 2006 and has undergone numerous repairs to address a range of issues. Just since 2020, we have
spent $15,000 in repairs and services. At this point, it is so outdated that Agilent can no longer offer us
repair options or service contracts for this system. It is essential to our work and used daily by researchers
in our lab. The duration of downtime resulting from these repairs has varied, spanning from a day to
several weeks, contingent upon the complexity of the issue, technician availability and awaiting
replacement parts.
 During method development, GCMS is used to analyze reaction mixtures, aiding in the
identiﬁcation of starting materials, intermediates, by-products, and ﬁnal products generated. By
comparing the mass spectra and retention times with authentic standards, we can identify and quantify
each component which helps us to assess the efﬁciency and selectivity of the reaction.
 By analyzing samples at different time points, GCMS allows for the monitoring of reaction
progress. We can see the consumption of starting materials and formation of products over time. It can
possibly also help to identify side reactions or undesirable decomposition pathways. In this manner, we
can adjust the reaction conditions such as temperature, solvent, catalyst loading and reaction times for
optimization.
 In combination with other analytical tools, we can use GCMS data to elucidate reaction
mechanisms. Analysis of reaction products, isotopic labeling studies and reaction kinetics would provide
insight into plausible mechanistic pathways. Understanding of the fundamental reaction mechanism is
essential for the rational design of new ligands and catalyst systems and predicting outcomes in related
transformations.
 A GCMS plays a pivotal role in our research and development of new organometallic-catalyzed
methodology by enabling the identiﬁcation, quantiﬁcation, monitoring, mechanistic elucidation, and
characterization of reaction components, intermediates, and catalysts. Its versatility and sensitivity make
it an indispensable tool for advancing our understanding of catalytic processes and facilitating the design
of novel catalysts for synthetic applications. A new system would help us optimize the workﬂow for all the
ongoing projects in our lab and provide comprehensive capabilities to identify diverse samples.
 We plan to cover recurring costs associated with the requested GCMS system through service
contracts for regular maintenance and repairs to ensure optimal performance and longevity. We have
budgeted in the expendable supplies (i.e., gases, sample vials, syringe needles, and septa) as part of
our routine operations and consumables of our parent grant. The initial training will be provided by the
manufacturer (Agilent) as part of the installation of the instrument. Additionally, we will designate a person
to internally maintain and be responsible for regular upkeep of the GCMS system. This includes in-house
protocols for use and providing ongoing training for new users and refresher courses for existing users.
By implementing these plans, we aim to ensure long-term reliability, performance, and accessibility of
the GCMS system for our research activities.

11100229,"Project Summary
It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical principles that
govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as
penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or
conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the
intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate
the efficiency and specificity of enzyme catalysis remains incomplete, especially regarding
contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design
highly efficient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of
our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying
mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to
what degree the chemical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active
site. Specifically, we aim to develop an efficient QM/MM framework to compute free energy
profiles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further
integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern
computational hardware enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling between the
chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique
position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact
of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory
mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a
transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic
activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational
method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental advances, such as time-
resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The
research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory
mechanisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus, the project
will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and
allostery in biomolecules."
11100231,"BRAF, a member of the RAF family protein kinases, works in the MAPK signaling pathway, which controls broad
cellular events like proliferation and differentiation. BRAF is the most frequently mutated kinase in human
cancers. Furthermore, tumors lacking BRAF mutations are contingent on BRAF activity when there are mutations
in upstream pathway members, such as RAS or growth factor receptors. Thus, BRAF represents an important
target for cancer therapy. Despite three decades of intense research, only recently has a sufficient understanding
of BRAF's mechanism creaked open the door to BRAF therapy. However, the current clinical BRAF inhibitors,
vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are limited to the class I mutant BRAFV600E. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib, the two
ATP-competitive inhibitors, can paradoxically activate non-BRAFV600E and wild-type BRAF, suggesting that
BRAF has functions that are independent of its kinase activity. Therapeutic strategies for tumors with non-
BRAFV600E mutations and wild-type BRAF are still lacking. Gaps in our knowledge contributed to the limitations
of ATP-competitive BRAF drugs. The proposed work centers around three questions regarding RAF activation
and regulation in health and disease states. Q1: how BRAF structural elements and ATP binding mediate the
catalytic-independent functions of non-BRAFV600E and wild-type BRAF? Q2: what is the mechanism of action of
the first BRAF allosteric inhibitor developed by our group and how can inhibitors targeting the catalytic and non-
catalytic functions of BRAF be developed? Q3: What factors contribute to the non-overlapping functions of RAF
isoforms, despite their structural similarity? The PI and her team will address these questions through
multidisciplinary approaches, including X-ray crystallography, binding kinetics, phosphoproteomics, live cell
imaging, chemical biology, and computational methods. Our findings will not only facilitate a better understanding
of the complex biochemical mechanisms of the RAF kinase family, also provide a molecular basis for novel
therapeutic approaches targeting BRAF-driven tumors."
11100348,"The Coats plus syndrome is a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by multi-system
developmental defects that lead to bilateral exudative retinopathy, retinal telangiectasias, growth retardation,
intracranial calcifications, bone abnormalities, gastrointestinal vascular ectasias, and common early-aging
pathological features. Like many other developmental disorders, Coats plus is caused by defects in genes
involved in maintaining global genome integrity. Specifically, it is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the
human CTC1/STN1/TEN1 (CST) complex, which is a trimeric complex that preferentially binds to G-rich ssDNA
or ss-ds DNA junctions and is critical for preventing genome instabilities arising from replication perturbation. We
hope to aid in better understanding of disease development and designing of effective therapeutic strategies by
investigating the mechanisms governing genome stability under replication stress. In response to fork stalling,
signaling cascades activate multiple pathways including fork reversal, translesion synthesis, repriming
downstream of stalled sites, and dormant origin firing to rescue stalled replication. Activities of these pathways
need to be tightly regulated to ensure replication fidelity. The objectives of this proposal is to delineate a novel
signaling pathway in response to replication stress, elucidate how it regulates protein interplays and recruitment
at stalled forks, and understand the mechanism regulating the repriming pathway. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that
a calcium-dependent signaling pathway phosphorylates STN1 to activate CST at stalled forks to protect the
stability of stalled forks. We will elucidate this new signaling pathway and determine how this pathway
antagonizes unscheduled nascent strand DNA degradation and regulates fork protection. In Aim 2, we will
investigate how this signaling pathway regulates the interplay of single-strand DNA binding proteins at forks and
other fork binding proteins. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism for restricting excessive repriming to
prevent ssDNA gap formation and genome instability. We will combine highly sensitive cell-based analyses,
single-molecule and powerful biochemical assays to accomplish the goals of the proposed research. We expect
that our efforts will identify new factors and pathways regulating the rescue of stalled replication and the
preservation of genome stability."
11100349,"ABSTRACT
There is a tremendous unmet need for effective synthesis methodologies and strategies for the construction of
aleutianamine and other members of the discorhabdin class of natural products. This has significantly hindered
the mechanistic, basic and applied science studies for this unique class of alkaloids which offers significant
value in the control of a variety of diseases and clearly warrants additional basic research into the synthesis,
mechanism of action and basic pharmacology. Natural Products (NPs) have played a key role as therapeutics
for a variety of diseases and the data presented in this application reveals the tremendous potential for these
molecules. After 25 years of studying marine organisms for new and innovative chemistry we have identified a
single truly remarkable molecule called aleutianamine. Aleutianamine has been recovered from a Latrunculia
sponge collected from the deep ocean off the coast of the Aleutian Islands by NOAA Alaska. We have
exhaustively interrogated extracts for any detectable quantities of this molecule and the only remaining option
to generate mechanistic and in vivo data is to first generate the drug through a reliable synthesis. This molecule
is extremely unique chemically and is a member of two very rare groups of bioactive natural products including
the iminoquinones and the thioalkaloids and is certain to be a product of the extreme conditions of these deep
ocean environments where cold temperatures, high pressure, and anoxic conditions deplete of UV irradiation
provides a unique environment for biosynthesis and rearrangement to form highly unusual molecules.
Aleutianamine and other members of this class as well as their synthetic intermediates offer unique controls for
a diversity of diseases including malaria, inflammation, viral diseases and cancer strongly supporting the
development of strategies to provide consistent supply of the drug and approaches to the generation and
diversification of the class. Due to the rare and limited supply of this molecule the specific aims of this program
involve the development of synthesis methodologies using two different routes in addition to the isolation and
characterization of starting materials and related molecules for SAR and investigations into alternative
approaches involving biosynthetic starting materials for the construction and optimization of the molecule."
11100414,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower-chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (LC-PCBs) are increasingly recognized as a significant risk to
human health, and a primary target of concern is the developing brain. LC-PCBs are the predominant PCB
congener type detected in the serum of pregnant women at increased risk of having a child with a
neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), and they are widely detected in not only school air but also the serum of
schoolchildren and teachers. The parent grant investigates how CYP-mediated metabolism influences the in
vitro and in vivo effects of LC-PCBs on CREB-dependent neurodevelopmental processes using state-of-the-art
mouse models that express human CYP2A6 or CYP2B6 but not mouse Cyp2a, 2b, 2f2, 2g1, and 2s1 proteins
(Cyp2abfgs-null mice). Preliminary data generated under the parent grant suggests that the LC-PCB, PCB 28,
interferes with axonal and dendritic growth in primary rat cortical neuron-glia co-cultures. This diversity
supplement leverages and extends findings from the parent grant to address the following questions: (1) Does
exposure to PCB 28 cause developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in vivo, and (2) To what extent does the route of
exposure influence the in vivo DNT of PCB 28, e.g., are different neurotoxic outcomes observed in pups born to
dams exposed to PCB 28 via diet vs. inhalation? To address these questions, the diversity supplement will use
Sprague Dawley rat dams exposed to varying doses of PCB 28 in the diet vs. the air to test the hypothesis that
maternal exposure to PCB 28 causes neurodevelopmental deficits in weanling pups and that the profile of
developmental neurotoxicity differs between inhalation and dietary exposure. This hypothesis will be tested by
addressing the following aims: 1) Characterize the disposition of PCB 28 and metabolites in dams and pups
following inhalational vs. dietary exposure; (2) Determine whether maternal exposure to PCB 28 via inhalation
vs ingestion differentially impacts neurobehavioral outcomes in juvenile rats; and (3) Evaluate the effects of
maternal exposure to PCB 28 via inhalation vs. diet on neurodevelopmental endpoints. The anticipated outcomes
of these research studies include the identification of LC-PCBs as a new class of environmental contaminants
that interfere with neurodevelopment and novel mechanistic data regarding how the route of exposure impacts
PCB DNT. Together with findings from the parent grant, this research will impact public health by providing
critical mechanistic insights regarding risk that LC-PCBs pose to the developing brain and strategies for
mitigating DNT risk in vulnerable subpopulations. The training goals of this Diversity supplement include: (1)
developing the trainee’s knowledge and technical skill set to enable them to successfully conduct research on
environmental influences on neurodevelopmental outcomes; (2) guiding the trainee’s research activity to ensure
the generation of data needed to support their preparation of a competitive F31 application and advance to
candidacy; (3) enhancing the trainee’s professional skills; and (4) actively working with the trainee to build their
professional networks to enhance their success in transitioning to an independent career in research."
11100425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell-cell communications among different cell groups, especially between the germline and somatic cells, are
key to the development of a functional egg. At the center of germline-soma interactions in the Drosophila
model lies the Notch pathway, which plays critical roles in a series of major events during oogenesis.
Determining how Notch signaling regulates diverse cellular processes is fundamental to the understanding the
regulation of oogenesis. On the other hand, the ovarian model offers an excellent platform to uncover novel
regulatory mechanisms of this notoriously important pathway, with roles crucial in development, tissue
homeostasis and pathogenesis of a multitude of human diseases. Despite many years of studies, there are still
a significant number of unknowns in the field. For example, how Notch regulates growth in different
developmental or pathological contexts, how the cell cycle machinery feeds back to modulate the Notch
pathway and how environmental stresses impact the signaling output during development and tissue
homeostasis. This proposal aims to address these questions using the genetically tractable Drosophila
ovarian model system.
 The proposed studies are based on a series of previous findings and preliminary results. We have
shown that Notch signaling induces cell differentiation by switching the follicle cells from the mitotic cycle to an
endoreplication cycle, thus restricting cell proliferation. Interestingly, when combined with a loss of cell polarity
gene lgl, we found that Notch promotes tissue growth in the follicle cell epithelium. We also found that String
(Stg), a Cdc25 homolog, regulates the nuclear access of an active form of Notch, the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD). Furthermore, we found that hyperactivation of Notch in follicle cells causes cell death and
degeneration of germline cells through phagocytosis. These findings provide us the opportunity to further
explore how germline and somatic development are coordinated during normal development and under
environmental stresses, and to understand how Notch signaling regulates growth and survival in various
biological and pathological conditions. The following three specific aims will be addressed using the ovarian
model.1. To determine how Notch regulates tissue growth in different genetic backgrounds. 2. To determine
how Cdc25/String regulates NICD nuclear access to impact Notch signaling. And 3. To determine how
upregulated Notch activity in follicle cells induces germline cell death. Successful completion of these aims will
lead to improved understanding of the diverse effects and regulatory mechanisms of Notch signaling during
development and tissue homeostasis. The findings from the proposed studies will help designing new
therapeutic strategies for diseases related to aberrant Notch signaling."
11100428,"Summary:
Regulation of gene expression along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of Drosophila embryos serves as a paradigm
of developmental patterning. Comparative studies of cis-regulatory elements that support expression along the
DV axis from many research groups have made it clear that combinatorial input into enhancers by multiple
transcription factors drives distinct spatial-outputs of gene expression. A pivotal regulator of this patterning
process is the maternally provided transcription factor Dorsal (Dl), homolog of NFκB. Dl functions as a
morphogen to activate target gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner along the DV axis,
contributing to the initiation of zygotic gene expression at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Using live
imaging, we quantified the Dl gradient in embryos and found, surprisingly, that levels change not only in space
but also build in time. Our focus during the previous funding period was to study the impact of these Dl dynamics
on target gene expression using quantitative approaches involving analysis of live imaging or fixed embryo time-
series data to provide insight. In the current proposal, we follow three new and exciting directions, which relate
to the timing of cell actions in early embryos and arose as a result of the previous work. Project 1 involves
studying how broadly expressed activators and repressors cooperate to control the onset of zygotic gene
expression during the MZT. We hypothesize that broadly expressed repressors are equally important to pioneer
activators in the control of chromatin accessibility and thereby also regulate initiation of zygotic gene expression.
Project 2 focuses on dissecting the function of short transcripts for long genes that are expressed specifically in
the early syncytial embryo. We hypothesize that these short transcripts act to regulate timing of cell signaling
pathway activation by functioning as dominant-negative variants of signaling molecules. Project 3 focuses on
identifying the mechanism by which FGF signaling regulates adherens junctions (AJs) and their interaction with
the actin cytoskeleton to contribute to the first epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryos; in
particular, to understand how a degron associated with one FGF ligand, Pyramus, limits signaling time. The
overarching goal of the proposed research program is to understand how the timing of these cell activities -
patterning, signaling, and movement - are controlled in developing Drosophila embryos and to provide general
insights applicable to higher animals. While many studies have focused on spatial outputs of gene expression,
less is known about the temporal dynamics of patterning. Drosophila embryos are a tractable system to study
MZT as it occurs in 3-4 hours, in contrast to taking days in preimplantation mammalian embryos. The Drosophila
embryo is also amenable to live in vivo imaging and tracking analyses making it well-suited to the study of
nascent transcription and cell morphology. Lastly, our proposed studies will provide general insight into early
embryo development of higher animals as many regulatory mechanisms are likely conserved."
11100453,"Abstract
The overall objective of the project is to contribute fundamental understanding of the exquisitely selective
recognition of protein tyrosine kinases for their protein substrates. Selectivity is generated from multiple factors.
One factor is spatial localization of the kinase to the proper regions in the cell through docking interactions
often mediated by domains independent of the catalytic domain. A second factor is amino-acid sequence
recognition of the substrate polypeptide chain near the cleavage site. Protein kinases play a major role in
disease and are second to only G-protein coupled receptors for the most targeted protein group for drug
development. Among all protein kinases, tyrosine kinases occur most frequently on a list of cancer-driver
genes, and are the most clinically targeted to date. The immediate objectives of this project are to 1) achieve a
physical rationale for a new entropy-driven allosteric phosphorylation mechanism that regulates tandem SH2
domains of Syk that dock Syk to membrane immunoreceptors; 2) determine if the tandem SH2 domains also
serve to localize Syk to cytoplasmic regions in conjunction with newly discovered functionalities of Syk; 3)
define the structure of the substrate polypeptide chain existing the C-terminal side of the catalytic site of Src
kinase and several other tyrosine kinases in order to evaluate a new perspective on kinase substrate
recognition determinants; and 4) identify new tyrosine kinase ligands that are substrate like and interact in the
shallow groove where the substrate polypeptide chain binds. To accomplish these objectives, a variety of
solution NMR studies will be conducted to characterize molecular interactions, define three-dimensional
structure and estimate thermodynamic parameters of tyrosine kinase-peptide substrate and tyrosine kinase-
protein substrate complexes. The NMR and biophysical analyses will be tightly integrated with computer
simulation methods selected to effectively explore large regions of protein conformational space. Finally,
chemical screening using a phosphorylation-based selection with DNA-encoded libraries of high complexity,
should identify new substrate-like inhibitor molecules of Src. The expected outcomes will advance scientific
knowledge on the physical mechanisms determining selective substrate phosphorylation by these key
enzymes in human health. Successful execution of the research plan would also identify small-molecule
ligands with potent and selective cellular activity, and impact future efforts to develop molecules useful for
studying disease in animal models or for cancer drug development."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as
NOT-CA-24-039. The proposed research project builds on the AVIVA-AI: A Mentored Approach to
Building Artificial Intelligence Capacity NOT-CA-22-036, a supplement of a parent U01 grant titled
Community, Home-based Education, Screening Services (CHESS) U01 study which focuses on
increasing HPV screening.
AVIVA app has been extensively used for three years, among healthcare workers in 5 states in Nigeria to
provide a higher-level expert review of VIA stained cervix visual image for improved screening diagnosis
in the country, and its implementation process has been reported in BMC Global Health Journal. The app
has assisted in improving diagnosis accuracy among the lower cadre of healthcare workers in lower-level
facilities in Nigeria. The AIVIVA-AI supplemental research project (NOT-CA-22-03) focused on adding
chatbot integration into the AVIVA application to improve awareness of cervical cancer screening
modalities, follow-up, treatment, and behavioral change activities among WLWH and those who treat
them. The study investigators, through this supplement, were able to build a local dataset of 130 unique
questions and concerns of WLWH and virtual healthcare providers’ responses on cervical cancer services
(CCS) and management and take the questions through a series of gynecological expert validation for
response appropriateness and exhaustiveness. While the unique questions might be representative of the
target population's opinions, questions, and concerns on CCS, if integrated directly into a simple AVIVA
chatbot app, it will be limited in catering to the inherent variability in the individual writing style that
might reflect in the way similar questions are asked by WLWH. This automatically affects the chatbot
response efficiency when scaled up to a larger WLWH population. The generative AI-powered chatbot
can handle complex inquiries without the need for human intervention. It has human-level creativity
ability to generate ideas on a possible wide range of questions based on learnings from previously
collected data and adapt to new situations to respond to inquiries of chatbot users. It detects patterns in
large data sets and improves people’s and technology's overall efficiency. This proposed supplement will
focus on training, evaluating, and integrating a customized large language models (LLMs) based
question-answering generative AI engine into the existing AVIVA-AI chatbot app for improved efficiency.
The mentee whose strength is in the cervical cancer program and epidemiological modeling, has
identified international experts and resources to build a generative- AI model into the AVIVA-AI chatbot
to improve the chatbot efficiency for future responsiveness and scalability. He will also be working with a
Nigeria AI programmer to facilitate generative AI knowledge transfer across borders and train a
conversational model in Nigeria using the resources available at large US institutions like Emory
University."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-039: Administrative Supplement for NCI Center for Global Health Research Programs''. While AIDS-related
morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH) have decreased substantially with the
introduction of combination antiviral therapy, the now aging PLWH population is at an increased risk of other
comorbidities, including cancer. This has been especially true of AIDS-defining malignancies, though more
recently the risk of developing several non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs), including Hodgkin lymphoma and
cancers of the mouth, throat, liver, lung, and anus, has also increased among PLWH. This elevated risk is
partially attributed to known behavioral risk factors among PLWH such as poor diet, low physical activity, and
higher use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances. The intersection of HIV and cancer presents a significant
challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where an estimated 75% of HIV deaths occur and cancer treatment
capacity is limited. There is an urgent need for early primary interventions to prevent cancer among PLWH.
Widely effective interventions have included clinician education and training and targeted behavioral
interventions that prevent and reduce the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances. However, there is a
lack of implementation research to properly adopt, integrate, sustain, and scale up these evidence-based
cancer interventions for PLWH within the health systems of SSA. We approach this gap by leveraging the
capacity and resources of two NIH-funded cancer research consortiums in Uganda, Quit4Life+
(5U01CA261624-03) and the Building independent research capacity in HIV-associated malignancies (HIVAM)
(D43TW009759). Together, we aim to build cancer-related implementation science research capacity to
strengthen cancer prevention programming, treatment access, and care infrastructure for PLWH populations
throughout the region. Guided by the WHO health systems building blocks and the Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) evaluation framework, the study includes 3 phases: 1)
Preparation and delivery of cancer-related implementation science research training sessions; 2) Adaptation
and testing of a health systems and service delivery assessment tool to evaluate implementation barriers
impacting Quit4Life+’s behavioral support interventions within the Ugandan and Zambian healthcare systems;
and 3) Evaluation of the assessment tool process and outcomes to inform future programs aimed at
strengthening sustainable models of cancer control for PLWH in LMICs. Study results will be widely
disseminated to healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Primary study partners

11094175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intracellular membrane trafficking mediates the intracellular delivery of proteins and lipids. The process is
bidirectional and consists of the anterograde (secretory) and retrograde (endocytic) branches. Intracellular
membrane trafficking is evolutionary conserved, and its machinery is modular, with functionally homologous
components operating on different trafficking steps. Therefore, a detailed understanding of one trafficking step
will help in understanding the entire intracellular membrane trafficking process.
The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex operates as a vesicular tether for intra-Golgi trafficking. The
Golgi is the central hub for protein posttranslational modifications, mostly glycosylation. Consequently, the
primary job of the COG is to tether vesicles that recycle resident enzymes and cargo receptors. To achieve its
function, the COG interacts with SNAREs, Rabs, and other tethers, but the detailed understanding of these
interactions is an enigma that we propose to solve by pairwise probing of COG/partner interactions, their
kinetics, and by defining their molecular environment through proximity-labeling studies. Depletion of COG
causes accumulation of specific transport intermediates – COG complex dependent (CCD) vesicles that are
likely to represent a major class of Golgi vesicles that recycle Golgi enzymes and cargo receptors.
Mutations in COG subunits result in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type II category, which belong
to a group of autosomal recessive multi-systemic disorders with several distinguishable symptoms that include
global developmental defects and microcephaly. These deficits are often accompanied by neurological and
liver impairment. COG-CDG defects are studied in patients’ fibroblasts, which do not represent the most
affected tissues; a more flexible cell base model will benefit our progress in developing a cure for this disorder.
We hypothesize that a revealing of the molecular basis of COG/partner interactions will help in deciphering the
mechanisms of assembly/disassembly of vesicle docking platforms and that a detailed analysis of different
populations of CCD vesicles will uncover their specific origin, budding and tethering machinery and a complete
set of proteins that traffic in a COG-dependent manner. The development of cell-based models for COG-CDGs
will allow us to test the effects of different COG mutations without the need for patient involvement and pave
the way for the development of treatment protocols. To test this hypothesis, first, we will characterize in
molecular interactions between COG and its key partner proteins (Aim1). Next, we will use a degrone-assisted
COG depletion to accumulate, purify and characterize CCD vesicles (Aim2). Finally, we will develop and
characterize a novel iPSC-based cellular model for COG CDGs (Aim 3).
Success in accomplishing these aims will provide a mechanistic understanding of COG complex function,
characterize COG-dependent trafficking intermediates, and create a set of isogenic stem cell lines bearing
human COG mutations. Moreover, these results will be necessary for a functional understanding of Golgi
dynamic and vesicular trafficking in general."
11098805,"Active membrane transport is central to many cell processes, including the acquisition of
nutrients, the establishment of ion-gradients, the regulation of osmotic balance, ATP synthesis,
and apoptosis. The proposed work will address key questions regarding the mechanisms of
nutrient uptake in Escherichia coli, and it will address questions regarding the structure and
organization of these proteins in the bacterial outer-membrane. In E. coli, a range of nutrients
are transported by specific outer-membrane proteins that derive energy by coupling to the inner-
membrane protein TonB. These TonB-dependent transporters include BtuB, which is
responsible for vitamin B12 transport, and FhuA, FecA and FepA, which are responsible for the
transport of various forms of chelated iron. TonB-dependent transporters are abundant in Gram
negative bacteria, and they are critical to the proper functioning of the human microbiome where
they are responsible for the acquisition and initial processing of some carbohydrates. They are
also essential for the success of many bacterial pathogens, such as those that result in
meningitis, cholera, pertussis and dysentery; and because TonB-dependent transport is unique
to bacteria, it is thought to be a target for the development of new classes of antibiotics.
High-resolution crystallographic models have been obtained for approximately two dozen TonB-
dependent transporters; however, the mechanism by which transport takes place is unclear.
One difficulty is that structural and biophysical studies in-vitro have never been made on TonB-
dependent transport proteins that are known to be active. The proposed work will test models
for the molecular mechanisms of transport and examine structural states that are only observed
in cells. The role of lipopolysaccharide in altering transport protein structure will also be
examined. The proposed work will employ site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy
where novel approaches have been developed to perform pulse experiments, such as double
electron-electron resonance, in intact E. coli. In the outer-membrane, proteins are sequestered
into domains or islands, which are thought to drive the turnover of outer-membrane proteins in
bacteria. EPR will be used in E. coli to characterize the protein-protein interactions that drive
domain formation and define the supramolecular structure of the outer-membrane."
11099097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The circadian clock is necessary to synchronize biological processes with daily changes in the environment, but it is also
required for organisms to measure photoperiod (daylength) and align physiology with the seasons. Rapid progress has
been made in understanding the transcriptional connections that drive daily and seasonal timing. We know less about
how post-translational mechanisms, such as protein degradation regulate the circadian clock and seasonal timing. Plants,
such as Arabidopsis, have served as preeminent model systems for understanding the circadian clock, and in particular,
how the circadian clock mediates photoperiod measurement. In the period of funding from the previous MIRA award, my
laboratory has worked at the interface of protein degradation and the circadian clock, discovering protein degradation
mechanisms that regulate the circadian clock and seasonal physiology. During the funding period, we also discovered that
one of the E3 ubiquitin ligases in our study is controlled by a non-canonical photoperiod measurement system in plants,
opening a new, but complementary, avenue of research in our lab. Our future work will build on these foundational studies
by addressing two major goals 1) performing detailed investigations of three E3 ubiquitin ligase families that control
important clock output processes and 2) continuing to identify and study non-canonical photoperiod measurement
systems in plants.
These studies will uncover general principles about how the circadian clock controls daily and seasonal biology. The
circadian clock regulates fundamental biological processes in many organisms, and clock dysfunction increases the
prevalence of human disease and mood disorders. Thus, the work that we perform will have far-reaching impacts and fits
the goals of NIGMS because: 1) it will provide basic principles and molecular logic for eukaryotic circadian clock systems,
2) it will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the post-translational mechanisms that overlay transcriptional
feedback loops of clocks, and 3) it will serve as a framework for similar studies in other eukaryotic timing systems, including
humans."
11099100,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this Focused Technology R01 project is to develop technologies for rapid discovery
of inhibitors of carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs). Carbohydrate-protein interactions are
critical in numerous processes including host-pathogen recognition, cell adhesion and cell
signaling, cancer angiogenesis, immune suppression, heart/liver/lung/eye fibrosis,
atherosclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few examples. However, selective
disruption of specific CBP interactions is challenging in vivo. CBPs generally bind weakly to
individual glycans, with higher affinity (avidity) or specificity coming from multivalent interactions
to clustered glycans or interactions with nearby non-carbohydrate elements. A given CBP also
usually binds to various glycans. To untangle the complex web of CBP functions, it is important
to have a way to rapidly develop a specific and potent inhibitor of a CBP that can be used in the
relevant in vivo context. To this end, we propose two Aims: 1) to develop multivalent glyco-F-RNA
aptamers, in which a nuclease-resistant, F-RNA backbone is evolved to present simple glycans
in a manner that is selectively recognized by a CBP of interest; 2) to develop monovalent glyco-
F-RNA aptamers, in which a simple glycan provides a binding “foothold” for the CBP of interest,
which the evolved F-RNA component confers additional binding affinity and specificity through
interactions auxiliary to the glycan-binding pocket."
11099099,"A powerful technology for characterizing subcellular proteomes is “proximity labeling” (PL), in which a catalyst is
localized to a specific cellular location, followed by promiscuous tagging of endogenous proteins in the vicinity.
The tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Although PL catalysts are powerful,
new PL catalysts are needed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spatially resolved proteomic mapping.
Genetically encoded enzymes can be conveniently targeted to cellular locations of interest, but they are limited
in their mechanisms of tagging, which hampers control over the labeling radius (limiting specificity) and restricts
which amino acids can be tagged (limiting sensitivity). Synthetic PL catalysts have recently introduced a greater
diversity of chemical labeling mechanisms, but new approaches are needed for selective activation of these
catalysts in highly specific subcellular regions of interest. We propose that hybrid biological-abiotic PL catalysts
can achieve improved sensitivity as well as specificity in spatially-resolved proteomic mapping. We are pursuing
this hypotheses through the development of three classes of hybrid PL catalysts, which offer complementary
advantages. In Aim 1, we have used directed evolution to discover heme peroxidase enzymes capable of
generating highly reactive radicals, which exhibit a shorter diffusion radius and label chemically diverse amino
acids, in contrast to the APEX approach that almost exclusively labels tyrosines. This ability to react with more
amino acids will enhance sensitivity for detecting proximal proteins. In Aim 2, we have developed hybrid DNA-
synthetic PL catalysts that become activated only in highly specific subcellular locations. We are applying these
switchable catalysts for activation of PL selectively at protein–protein interactions (PPIs) on the surface of cancer
cells, and we will extend this approach for activation at intercellular PPIs in neuronal synapses. In Aim 3, we
have developed hybrid DNA-synthetic catalysts that tag proteins through contact-dependent mechanisms,
instead of generating diffusible reactive species. We will attach these contact-dependent catalysts to DNA nano-
rod structures with tunable lengths and rigidities, enabling precise control over the labeling radius in the range
of ~1–50 nm. We are applying all three classes of PL catalysts for proteomic mapping in living mammalian cells,
in collaboration with Prof. Lloyd Smith, an expert in high-resolution biomolecular mass spectrometry. Additionally,
we are collaborating with Prof. Edwin Chapman to employ these PL tools in cultured neurons to benchmark their
performance against existing tools. Throughout the next five years, my laboratory will continue to develop new
mechanisms for PL using hybrid abiotic-biological catalysts. I envision that these technologies will be employed
not only in my laboratory, but also in the broader community, to elucidate novel protein functions in a variety of
biological contexts."
11099268,"Project Summary
Mitochondria multitask various functions such as generating vast amounts of cellular energy and regulating cell
survival. Owing to their numerous cellular functions, mitochondria are often targeted by pathogens as a means
to promote infection. Indeed, pathogenic microbes use various means to subvert mitochondrial function in order
to survive and establish residence in their new host environment. In response to this targeted attack,
mitochondria execute various mechanisms to counter the growing infection. This includes the activation of the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a stress signaling pathway that helps mitigate dysfunction to
mitochondria through transcriptional adaptation. The UPRmt stimulates mitochondrial recovery by promoting
mitochondrial proteostasis, reactive oxygen species detoxification, and metabolic adaptation, among others.
Critically, the UPRmt also elicits an innate immune response as an antimicrobial strategy to fight infection and
promote host survival. Consistently, loss of the UPRmt renders animals more susceptible to bacterial infection
while, conversely, priming animals prior to infection increases host survival times. The coupling of innate
immunity/antimicrobial defense with the UPRmt is intuitive when considering how often mitochondria are targeted
during infection. Here, we will continue to explore the fundamental question of how the UPRmt acts as a
host defense mechanism during infection. Our proposal will address three broad questions: What is the role
of diet and nutrient sensing in the regulation of the UPRmt during infection? How does microbial metabolism
impact the UPRmt and host survival during infection? What role does the UPRmt play in the mammalian immune
system to protect the host from infection? In addition to leveraging the powerful genetics of C. elegans to dissect
these intricate questions, we will implement mouse models of infection that, combined, will yield important new
and exciting insights into the UPRmt as a host antibacterial defense mechanism. Considering the significant rise
of infections by antibiotic resistant bacteria, new alternative clinical interventions may be necessary.
Understanding how the UPRmt provides protection during infection, therefore, will not only lead to conceptual
advances in the field of host-pathogen interactions, but may hold therapeutic value as well."

 As a naturally existing amber suppression system, the pyrrolysine (Pyl) incorporation machinery has turned
into an enormous tool for undergoing amber suppression-based noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis
in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. By ectopically expressing tRNAPyl and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase
(PylRS) or a PylRS mutant that charges tRNAPyl with an ncAA, about 200 ncAAs have been genetically encoded
by the amber codon in various cells. As one of the original pioneers in the research field of engineering the Pyl
system for the genetic incorporation of ncAAs, the PI’s group has contributed more than one third of the total
encoded ncAAs. These ncAAs contain a large variety of functionalities, allowing a myriad of applications in both
academia and industry possible. After more than a decade of engineering the Pyl system for the ncAA
incorporation, the field is now able to use the Pyl system-based ncAA mutagenesis technique to conduct grand
explorations to address fundamentally important biological questions. In the past, the PI’s lab has devised a
variety of ncAA mutagenesis-based approaches for the synthesis of proteins with posttranslational lysine
modifications (lysine PTMs). A novel method that allows direct functionalization of ubiquitin and ubiquitin like
proteins for their conjugation with other proteins has also been developed in the PI’s lab. With all these methods
coming to fruition, the PI’s lab is shifting its research focus to use their developed techniques to study basic and
fundamentally important biological questions. Five specific directions will be pursued. The first direction is to use
the ncAA mutagenesis technique to produce designer nucleosomes (nucleosomes with defined lysine PTMs) for
probing histone lysine sites and PTM types targeted by epigenetic erasers including SIRT6, SIRT7, HDAC1, and
LSD1 (HDAC1 and LSD1 in their native complexes). The second direction is to use reconstituted designer
nucleosomes as probes to enrich their binding partners from cells whose identities can be determined using
mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. The third direction is to conduct cryo-EM analysis of designer
nucleosomes bound with SIRT6, SIRT7, HDAC1, and LSD1 (HDAC1 and LSD1 in their native complexes) to
elucidate the structural basis of the four enzymes in their recognition of targeted lysine sites and PTMs in
chromatin. The fourth direction is to synthesize different triubiquitin isoforms and use them as probes to enrich
binding partners from cells whose identities will be confirmed with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.
The last but not least direction is to synthesize cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is a frontline sensor in
human cells that detect double-stranded DNA from pathogens and triggers innate immune responses, with lysine
PTMs and to study the functional roles of lysine PTMs in regulating activity, cellular localization and cellular half-
life of cGAS. A long-term goal of the PI’s research is to push applications of the Pyl system-based ncAA
mutagenesis technique in combination with other chemical biology techniques to enhance basic biological
research."

Background: My laboratory works at the interface of cell biology and nucleic acid chemistry to
modulate translation, splicing, and transcription. Ideal projects have three features: 1) Novel
oligonucleotides that allow us to probe the strengths and weakness of the chemical modifications; 2)
Challenging nucleic acid structures or mechanisms for nucleic acid-mediated regulation; and 3) The
opportunity to gain insights into significant biological process or therapeutic development. For 2021-
2026 our central goal is to investigate mechanisms of RNA recognition to gain greater insights into
cell physiology and therapeutic development.
 Since 2016, several nucleic acid drugs have been approved and oligonucleotide medicine is
poised to have a significant impact on broad patient populations. One obstacle to realizing this
potential is an incomplete understanding of RNA recognition in cells. For example, while over 1000
peer-reviewed publications appear every month that cite the term “miRNA”, we lack the detailed
insights necessary to necessary to predict function or appreciate the roles of RNA in complex
biological processes. Validation of proposed effects is often problematic and the predictive power for
studying novel genes is limited. We will focus on two project areas involving the recognition of RNA
within either the nuclei or cytoplasm of human cells.
 Cooperation of miRNAs and protein factors during RNAi. We will gain fundamental
insights into the mechanism of RNA using knock out cell lines deficient for key RNAi factors including
proteins of the argonaute (AGO) and trinucleotide repeat containing protein 6 (TNRC6) families. We
will combine mass spectrometry, RNAseq, and cross linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to define
where interactions occur how the number of protein or miRNAs affect the impact on gene regulation.
We will first examine detailed mechanisms for regulation in cell cytoplasm. We will then apply these
lessons to investigate the consequences of miRNA recognition in both cell cytoplasm and nuclei.
 Novel mechanisms and disease targets. We will gain a better understanding of two
diseases caused by mutant RNAs, Fuch's Corneal Endothelial Dystrophy (FECD) and Friedreich's
Ataxia (FA). One goal is to develop more potent compounds to facilitate drug development. A second
goal is to better understand mechanisms of action. Both diseases involve nuclear noncoding RNAs,
and we will use synthetic nucleic acids as tools to probe disease mechanism and better appreciate
how a small number of mutant RNA molecules can cause late-onset degenerative diseases."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects >35% of older adults in the US. It is now the primary etiology
of chronic liver disease and liver cancer, and the driver of the recent upward trend in these lethal diseases. A
dysbiotic gut microbiome has been associated with NAFLD, but mostly in small-scale, cross-sectional or clinic-
based studies. Population-based longitudinal studies are needed to provide evidence for the temporal
relationship of the gut microbiome with the progression of NAFLD. In the cross-sectional Multiethnic Cohort
(MEC) Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS; P01 CA168530), we showed a significant difference in gut microbial
composition and inferred microbial function by NAFLD status, including enrichment of Fusobacterium and
endotoxin-producing bacteria and altered microbial pathways for bile acid and simple carbohydrate metabolism
in NAFLD. We now hypothesize that specific gut bacterial features (genera, metabolic pathways and blood
endotoxin biomarker lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)) are associated with increase in liver fat and liver
fibrosis over time. We also hypothesize that several dietary factors are associated with NAFLD progression
and that fibrosis-promoting gut bacterial features mediate these associations. We propose a longitudinal
investigation by efficiently adding a ~10-year follow-up assessment among 300 of the MEC-APS participants,
aged 60-77 years at baseline and of three racial/ethnic groups (Japanese American, Native Hawaiian or
White), across a wide range of baseline liver fat. We will re-assess liver fat using MRI and measure liver
stiffness using MR elastography, gold-standard methods for non-invasive quantification of liver fat and liver
stiffness, respectively, and perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing (follow-up stool samples) and metagenomic
sequencing (baseline and follow-up stool samples). Specific Aims are to: 1) evaluate the change in specific gut
bacterial features (abundance of genera, metabolic pathways, and LBP) over time in relation to the change in
liver fat; 2) evaluate the change in gut bacterial features over time in relation to (2a) liver stiffness at follow-up
and (2b) change in a blood biomarker panel for liver fibrosis (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score), and (2c)
validate the top two bacterial features associated with liver stiffness using ddPCR; and 3) assess the
association of diet (3 dietary pattern scores for overall diet quality and 7 key components) with ELF-based
change in liver fibrosis and explore the mediation by fibrosis-promoting gut bacterial features from Aim 2,
stratified by liver fat level. Our results will identify gut microbial features associated with early NAFLD
progression, while specifically addressing the needs of understudied Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians
(NOT-HL-23-001), two high-risk populations for NAFLD and liver cancer. The strengths of the proposed
longitudinal design and rigorous imaging and laboratory methods will aid in understanding NAFLD progression
involving the gut microbiome. These findings may be used to inform novel targeted intervention strategies to
prevent NAFLD progression and, ultimately, reduce liver cancer burden in multiple racial/ethnic populations."
11098183,"In the past two to three decades, there has been a surge in the use, abuse, and misuse of opioids. Among
opioid users, Illicit fentanyl use has become widespread in the US. Moreover, synthetic fentanyls rapidly flood
the illicit drug market due to their cheap manufacturing, enhanced potency, and chemical composition that
evades toxicology screening. Furthermore, black-market drug makers create new fentanyl analogs to avoid
classification as illegal, to get around policy restrictions. Although drugs of abuse and HIV are entwined
epidemics, it is becoming clear that Fentanyl plays an alarming role in new outbreaks. Recent reports suggest
that there's an elevated risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection in those who inject fentanyl. Additionally, fentanyl is
commonly detected in urine drug-screen tests in people living with HIV (PLWH). Advances in antiretroviral
therapy has extended the lives of PLWH. However, as people live longer, the risk of altered neurological
manifestations increases. It is also well known that drugs of abuse compound these effects of HIV. Even
though it is known that opioids and their receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of NeuroHIVs, there's
essentially no information available about whether fentanyl has effects on the status of HIV infection in the
CNS. In this study, we will examine the overall hypothesis that: fentanyl and novel synthetic fentanyl
analogs facilitates HIV-1 leukocyte transendothelial migration, microglial HIV infection/replication and
impairs the integrity and function of the BBB. We propose three specific aims to explore the hypothesis.
In Aim 1, using our latest tissue-engineered microfluidic model of the human BBB, we will perform analyses of
the kinetic changes in BBB permeability, transporter status and immune-endothelial interaction in response to
fentanyl and other synthetic fentanyls. Since microglial is the primary refuge for HIV in the brain, Aim 2 will
determine the effects of synthetic fentanyls on dynamic HIV-1 infection in the resident immune cell of the brain,
the microglial. Comparisons will be made to monocyte derived macrophages. Aim 3 will examine the molecular
mechanism responsible for a dysfunctional BBB by fentanyls. This proposal comprehensively addresses the
key tenets of RFA-DA-23-012 and features multiple synthetic fentanyls, a translational model of the BBB, and
experiments to define the underlying molecular mechanism involved. Our studies will provide important insights
on how the interplay of two major pathologic factors (HIV and fentanyl) in the CNS impair the BBB and
compromise the intracellular anti-HIV immunity of microglia, the key mechanisms that could significantly
accelerate the development NeuroHIV."

Research during the last funding period of this NIGMS-funded MIRA award has
significantly advanced understanding of the molecular immunobiology mechanisms at the
interface between the nervous system and the immune system. As reported in a series of
high impact publications, our lab’s discoveries of vagus nerve control of inflammation,
termed “the inflammatory reflex,” the elucidation of the specific neural and molecular
mechanisms, culminated in successful clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s
disease. This NIGMS MIRA-supported work of basic immunobiology programs focuses on
the anatomy, electrophysiology, and molecular mechanisms of the vagus nerve circuits
controlling innate immunity. It is credited with establishing and leading the field of
bioelectronic medicine. The present competing renewal proposes a logical, significant,
innovative, and impactful continuation of this work delineating how the brain controls
immunity. There remain many major unanswered questions. For example, what is the
origin, anatomy, and function in the brain of neural signals that control inflammation? How
does the brain sense and record the presence of inflammation in the body? And, what are
the brain and nervous system mechanisms that stimulate inflammation? Some of these
questions will be answered directly, and other new questions will likely arise during the
course of work to guide additional exploration. The PI and his lab have assembled and
lead teams to accomplish this work. They have the necessary experience and a track
record in using optogenetics, transgenic, and knock-out mice, immunological disease
models, imaging technologies, electro- and neuro-physiology methods, and basic
immunology and neurobiology. They are in an ideal environment to successfully complete
the proposed studies, both to advance the MIRA mission of NIGMS, and to continue their
journey translating basic science into clinical investigation and practice."
11100326,"ABSTRACT
 Homeostasis requires most, if not all, pathways to function rapidly and precisely. While
cooperative interactions between proteins and cofactors helps ensure selectivity, the events
mediating dynamic action are less well understood. Further complicating pathway performance is the
nature of the cell interior, as it is densely packed and often contains multiple binding partners for each
protein—both features increase non-productive or off-pathway interactions. These variables present
great challenges for achieving homeostasis especially in the midst of fluctuating internal and external
stimuli that must be monitored constantly to appropriately initiate, continue, or halt cellular processes.
Hence, biological complexes must be actively and persistently disassembled in order to work on a
useful time scale. We suggest that the broad binding specificity and energy-independent molecular
chaperone activities of the Hsp90 chaperone system govern the kinetic behaviors of the diverse
proteins within cells. Basically, Hsp90 and its cochaperones resolve inherently stable cooperative
complexes into a dynamic machinery capable of rapid action that enables efficient and timely
biological pathways."

 This project summary pertains to the Supplement. Rhinosinusitis (RS) is one of the most prevalent airway
diseases, effecting approximately 15% of the U.S population. With symptoms of sinonasal mucus hypersecretion
and plugging, severe facial pain and breathing difficulties, RS significantly affects both quality of life and
socioeconomic burden. Despite these dire outcomes, the etiology of RS is completely unknown, severely
hampering the development of preventative or curative treatments.
 In the parent grant, we investigate how aberrant patterning of the nasal submucosal glands (SMGs), may
be causative for chronic RS (CRS, > 12 weeks). Based on the high penetrance of CRS in patients with mutations
in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (Cystic Fibrosis) and studies showing
aberrant SMG morphology and function are common to this disease, this proposal tests the hypothesis that
dysfunction in CFTR leads to aberrant SMG patterning and thus, CRS. This hypothesis will be tested via three
specific aims. (1) Define cell identities, lineage dynamics and cell-cell signaling networks during SMG
development. In this Aim, transcriptomic techniques and quantitative measures of morphological changes will
be employed to uncover processes governing human SMG development, which can then be utilized to delineate
mechanisms of disease SMG patterning. (2) Elucidate CFTR dysfunction in SMGs as an underlying cause
of CRS. This Aim will use the murine mouse model to test the hypothesis that mis- regulation in CFTR is a cause
of tissue remodeling and CRS. (3) Identify molecular and cellular signatures of SMG remodeling in human
adult CRS. This final aim will examine morphological and transcriptomic gland phenotypes common to healthy,
eosinophilic CRS without polyps, and eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps, providing insight into alterations in
gland structure and function, and thus contribution to different CRS pathologies.
 In this Diversity Supplement application, we build on our subsequent studies that have established the
emergence of nasal ionocytes during early SMG morphogenesis, with an enrichment of these cells in SMG ducts.
We confirm that Cftr expression is highly expressed in embryonic ionocytes and epithelial specific deletion of
Cftr significantly reduces ionocyte identity regulator genes. To this end, we hypothesize that CFTR regulates
ionocyte differentiation and SMG development. To test this, we will build on our AIM 1 and AIM 2 of the parent
grant and scrutinize the role of CFTR in ionocyte specification and airway SMG signaling mechanisms, at a
single cell resolution. Outcomes will determine how CFTR mediates ionocyte emergence and how this
contributes to aberrant SMG morphogenesis."
11100431,"Our goal is to understand the mechanisms of cell type- and stimulus-specific regulation of the
human TNF gene and the TNF/LT locus genes (LTA and LTB) in T cells and monocytes/macrophages and
to identify genomic regions that could potentially be targeted in TNF-driven disease states. Using unbiased
next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and CRISPR editing of human cells and mice, we will
identify and elucidate function of transcriptional regulatory elements that modulate TNF, LTA, and LTB gene
expression in T cells and monocytes/macrophages during activation and differentiation conditions and
infectious challenges. Our preliminary studies using the NGS approaches of stranded RNA-, ATAC-, and
HINT-seq reveal multiple novel highly conserved non-coding elements that transcribe eRNA in a cell type-
specific manner in naïve T cells and in human monocytes/macrophages. They also show the cell type-
specific hHS-8 enhancer that controls IFN-γ priming in monocytes/macrophages and enhances TNF and
LTA in activated T cells we previously described. Our first goal will be to define the transcriptional territories
and potential intrachromosomal interactions between the novel elements and hHS-8 with the TNF, LTA, and
LTB genes. We will use ChIP-seq to determine the recruitment of the architectural protein CTCF, which
mediates chromatin conformation, and the enrichment of H3K27Ac and H3K24Me, which are associated
with enhancers. To select high potential regulatory areas this data will also be evaluated by a phylogenetic
analysis of the TNF/LT locus in non-human primates to define highly conserved regions that predict
regulatory function. These studies will guide our 3-dimensional analysis of locus architecture with Hi-C and
CRISPR deletion of potential regulatory elements in cell lines and primary cells to establish their function.
These studies then will provide a powerful framework and data set from which to interrogate these sites and
new regulatory elements we will uncover in our analyses of (i) different states of human T cell and
macrophage differentiation stimulated with TCR ligands or LPS and/or IFN-γ, respectively; (ii) the TNF/LT
locus in primary T cells and BMDM from C57BL/6 and Balb/c mouse strains to evaluate concordance
between the regulation of the murine and human TNF/LT loci as a baseline for performing studies in
CRISPR-edited mice and testing the role of elements in acute (sepsis) and chronic (arthritis) TNF-mediated
disease models. We will also characterize the role of distal elements that regulate TNF and the IL-6 gene
expression, which shares regulatory similarities with TNF during infection with M. tuberculosis (MTb) or
RNA viruses (Sendai and SARS-CoV-2), to elucidate broader gene expression programs. We anticipate
that these studies will lead to a new understanding of how the TNF/LT genes are coordinately regulated,
provide fundamental insights into gene regulation and the role of distal elements, and provide potential
genomic targets to regulate TNF in a cell type-and inducer-specific manner in disease states."
11100440,"PARENT PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite their diminutive length, 20-30-nucleotide-long small RNAs affect nearly all developmental and disease
processes, from fertility in flies to cancer in humans. Small RNA associate with Argonaute proteins to direct
sequence-specific degradation or translational repression of matching mRNAs in a process called RNA
interference (RNAi). Small RNAs can also function in an alternative mode to promote gene expression. Within
the germline of the tiny nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, two broad classes of small RNAs – piwi-
interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) – interact with nearly all genes, silencing
some and promoting the expression of others. Remarkably, some piRNAs and siRNAs are transmitted from
one generation to the next, providing a heritable mechanism for regulating gene expression without changes to
the underlying DNA. In C. elegans, piRNAs and siRNAs are required for optimal fertility and germline
immortality. We and others identified a role for maternally-derived piRNAs and siRNAs in protecting essential
genes from silencing. We also showed that these small RNAs have a role in establishing proper gene
expression in the embryo that is crucial throughout development, although the mechanism underlying this
phenomenon requires further study. To identify the roles of piRNAs and siRNAs in ensuring proper gene
expression from one generation to the next, we will address two related questions: 1) How do piRNAs and
siRNAs regulate gene expression to promote fertility and germline immortality? and 2) What are the molecular
roles of maternally deposited piRNAs and siRNAs? A second area of my research centers on gene regulatory
mechanisms involving a third class of small RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We recently uncovered a
distinct branch of the miRNA pathway required for proper developmental timing and optimal fertility in the
germline. How this pathway regulates gene expression is an important area of future research. This relates to
the third question we will address: 3) How do miRNAs regulate developmental timing in the germline? miRNAs
are processed from a limited number of transcripts that form hairpin-like secondary structures. The hairpin itself
is not sufficient to mark a transcript for processing, and in many species, including humans, primary transcripts
contain additional sequence elements that promote miRNA formation. Not all miRNA transcripts contain these
elements and in some animals, including C. elegans, they are completely lacking. We developed a sensor that
reports on miRNA transcript recognition. Using the sensor, we will address a fourth question: 4) How are
miRNA transcripts distinguished from other RNAs in C. elegans? The ease in which genetics, genome editing,
and genomics assays can be done in C. elegans makes it an ideal system to address these four questions.
The mechanism of miRNA formation and the molecular roles of miRNAs, piRNAs, and siRNAs are highly
conserved in animals. The knowledge gained through this study will have important implications in our
understanding of the counterparts in humans and how their dysfunction contributes to sterility and disease."

Modern metabolomics have revolutionized biology and biomedical research. It is now possible to identify specific
metabolic biomarkers associated with disease or response to treatment, which can translate into improved
diagnostics. However, key gaps in knowledge remain that limit the impact of metabolomics. First, advances in
analytical instrumentation that fueled the growth of metabolomics are limited to biofluids or extracts of tissues or
cells. Metabolism is a highly dynamic process that can change rapidly with environmental conditions, but most
metabolomics techniques are not able to monitor the dynamic process directly in vivo. Rather, when they are
measured at all, dynamics are measured by discrete sampling, which leads to multiple samples and added
variance. A second limitation in metabolomics is our ability to identify unknown metabolites with high confidence.
Many of the “features” measured by LC-MS or NMR in metabolomics studies remain unknown, limiting the
biological impact.
Our laboratory has recently developed methods to address these gaps in knowledge. Through NIGMS funding,
we have developed improved NMR probes that allow for greater sensitivity in NMR measurements. This is
important because NMR is the best method for unknow metabolite identification. Our current probe will be
commissioned in February 2022 and is optimized for 13C detection at 21.1 T (900 MHz 1H); we expect that it will
provide the highest possible 13C NMR sensitivity available. This technology allows for data that will substantially
improve our ability to identify unknown metabolites. We have also developed metabolite “fraction libraries”, which
start with chemical separation of a specific sample followed by measurement of each fraction by 1D and 2D NMR
and LC-MS/MS. The data from a fraction library will allow unknowns to be identified by efficiently linking the NMR
and LC-MS data. In this MIRA we will make a fraction library knowledgebase by developing tools to connect the
different datasets. We have also developed an approach called continuous in vivo metabolism by NMR (CIVM-
NMR). We have applied CIVM-NMR to growing Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus that has been used to
link genetics to metabolism. We can monitor the growth of N. crassa in real-time with about 1 minute resolution
for over 1 week. This allows us to measure quantitative metabolic details of all the metabolites and lipids with
concentrations greater than 25 µM. We have made computational tools to extract over 300 growth curves from
a single CIVM-NMR dataset, allowing us to functionally characterize the metabolic changes over time as a
function of carbon source, temperature, or oxygen availability. In this MIRA project, we will expand CIMV-NMR
by measuring metabolic mutants under different environments and build a web server that connects all the data."
11100449,"Our research focuses on molecular recognition, with the goal of providing methods and software for solving
biomedical problems. The primary areas of interest are protein-protein interactions and the ligand binding
properties of proteins. We believe that predictive methods will be substantially improved during the next five
years due to the increasing amount of information on sequences, structures, and interactions of molecules in the
cell, and the development of powerful machine learning tools. To take advantage of these opportunities we will
integrate the use of structural templates, co-evolutionary information, and machine learning into classical
biophysical methods. This part of the research is facilitated by the availability of much improved neural network
algorithms. We already combined our popular ClusPro protein-protein docking program with Alphafold2 and
Alphafold-Multimer. For the prediction of antibody-antigen complexes the combined method substantially
improves the rates of generating acceptable models when considering the five top ranked predictions, but the
top ranked model is not necessarily the best one. The quality and the selection of the models can be improved
by forced sampling, i.e., re-running the AFM program many times with perturbed initial weights of the neural
network, which require substantial GPU resources. Examples of applications include the design of PROteolysis
TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) for modulating a target protein by degradation, the prediction of antibody
epitopes, and searching for epitope-specific antibodies. Several tools will be combined for the structural analysis
of protein interaction networks, including a novel method of constructing multi-protein complexes based on pre-
calculated tables of interaction energies between pairs of proteins. To study the ligand binding properties of
proteins we focus on binding hot spots, regions of proteins that are major contributors to the binding free energy.
Our FTMap server globally samples the surface of target proteins using fragment sized molecular probes and
provides reliable hot spot and pharmacophore information. We are in the process of improving the scoring
function using neural networks, and substantially expanded the set of probes to obtain generalized
pharmacophores that identify regions in the protein binding site with preferences for specific functional groups
and a number of bound fragments. This can be achieved by iterative mapping, first using the standard probe set,
and then adding specifically selected probes from a large library for functional characterization of the site, again
increasing the need for computer power. Since the bound fragment positions can be used to find larger ligands,
the goal is to convert FTMap into a fragment-based ligand discovery platform. We will also improve our template-
based server LigTBM, which docks small molecules to proteins, and will integrate models based on machine
learning with FTMap."

Metabolomics offers a comprehensive analysis of thousands of small molecules in biological samples. It plays
an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to unravel the relationships between
metabolites and diseases. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been used for high-throughput analysis of
thousands of metabolites. However, the potential values of many disease-associated metabolites discovered by
using these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery
due to lack of computational tools and resources to: (1) accurately determine the identity of most of the analytes;
(2) investigate the rewiring interactions among the metabolites due to diseases; and (3) integrate metabolite
profiles with other omics studies to evaluate the relationships between the metabolites and the diseases at the
systems level. Partly due to these limitations, poor generalizability of previously identified metabolite biomarker
candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent platforms and
validation sets. The parent award aims to fill the gaps in metabolite identification and multi-omics integration by
using systems metabolomics approaches that enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches
for biomarker discovery. Specifically, it utilizes multiple resources (biological databases, mass spectral libraries,
etc.) and innovative statistical, deep learning, and network-based methods for: (1) developing a comprehensive
workflow for ranking putative metabolite IDs; (2) differential analysis of metabolite profiles and integration of
metabolomics data with proteomics, glycomics, glycoproteomics. and phosphoproteomics data to identify highly
promising metabolite biomarker candidates. The selected candidates are evaluated by targeted quantitation
using independent samples and platforms compared to those used for discovery. However, the successful
implementation of one of the critical tasks proposed in the parent award relies heavily on analytical platforms
that have high resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity for identification and quantitation of various analytes.
To this end, in this administrative supplement application, we request support to purchase the Thermo Scientific
Orbitrap Exploris Mass Spectrometer that offers the resolution, accuracy, sensitivity, and throughput needed by
our multi-omics approach for biomarker discovery. Availability of this instrument will not only provide the much
needed sensitive, robust, and reliable platform but also address unforeseen circumstances that occurred due to
the significant amount of machine time required to develop instrument methods for the identification and
quantitation of biomarker candidates relevant to the parent award."

 The goal of our Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA) is to develop and apply olfactory-based
(OR)-based sensors, and, more generally, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-based sensors for biomedical
applications. In Focus Area 1, we elucidate the role of ectopically expressed olfactory receptors (exORs),
identifying endogenous ligands for exORs, and assessing exORs as therapeutic targets. Our long-term goal is to
use the identified ligands that activate the exORs to tease out their role in human health, including identifying the
endogenous exOR ligands in the tissues in which they are overexpressed, and determining the downstream
processes in which they are involved. This understanding should enable an assessment of exORs as therapeutic
targets, and open the door to new, first-in-class therapeutics. In Focus Area 2, we unravel how GPCR signaling
pathways talk to one another and the consequences this crosstalk has for cellular processes and organismal
behavior. Our long-term goal is to enable combinatorial control of up to 17 different GPCR signaling pathways,
providing access to cellular phenotypes that may teach us how combinatorial GPCR activation can be leveraged
for the development of new therapies and the GPCR-based circuit architecture could inspire the development of
next-generation sense and response therapeutic cells.
 The objective of this Equipment Supplement to the parent MIRA is to purchase a benchtop fluorescence
activated cell sorter (FACS) with capability to sort up to three colors with a speed of 100,000 events/sec and ability
to deposit into 96-well plates. The requested equipment will support the objectives of the parent MIRA. With respect
to Focus Area 1, the increased availability of a FACS will facilitate the acquisition of large olfactory receptor (OR)-
ligand datasets to train machine learning algorithms for ectopically expressed OR deorphanization. With respect
to Focus Area 2, the cell sorter will accelerate the engineering of GPCRs to bind human orthogonal ligands for
use as chemogenetic tools to probe GPCR signaling crosstalk."
11093022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Organization is a fundamental and defining feature of life at all degrees of scale, from the subcellular
level all the way up to the level of the organism. On the cellular level, molecules and organelles must be situated
with appropriate temporal and spatial precision such that processes may proceed according to the needs of the
cell. Similarly, cells are arranged into appropriate layers to define underlying tissue organization, which provides
the basis for organ function, and to support health of the organism. Major determinants of subcellular and cellular
organization are molecular motors that transport diverse cargoes throughout the cellular environment. One such
motor is cytoplasmic dynein, which transports numerous types of cargoes along microtubule tracks during all cell
cycle stages, and within many cell types. For instance, dynein is the major retrograde microtubule motor that
transports many vesicular and protein cargoes toward the cell body of neurons. In addition to orchestrating
appropriate subcellular organization, dynein plays a major role in the establishment and maintenance of tissue
architecture. For instance, a major determinant of cell fate and consequent tissue organization is the orientation
and position of the mitotic spindle with respect to the boundaries of the cell. In addition to localizing to the
membrane of small vesicular cargoes – from where it effects their transport – dynein motors are anchored at
the plasma membrane from where they orient and position the spindle through precisely tuned interactions with
microtubules. During such processes as organismal development and tissue homeostasis, spindle orientation
and position dictate the plane of cell division, and thus whether a cell divides symmetrically or asymmetrically.
Symmetric stem cell divisions result in two identical stem cells, whereas a switch to asymmetric division results
in one stem cell and a differentiated cell, which promotes tissue stratification. Thus, dynein is a critically important
molecule that dictates biological organization on many levels of scale. The precise mechanisms by which dynein
performs all these disparate functions with appropriate spatial and temporal control are unclear. The lack of such
information presents an impediment towards the development of effective therapies that may prevent or reverse
defects in cellular and tissue organization that can lead to various devastating disorders (e.g., malformations of
cortical development, motor neuron diseases). In the proposed studies, we will use a combination of in vitro and
cell biological approaches to determine the mechanisms by which dynein is regulated to perform its cargo
transport functions. Specifically, we will: (1) resolve the mechanism by which the lissencephaly-related protein
LIS1 initiates dynein-mediated cargo transport; (2) determine how dynein effects spindle movements with precise
directional precision; (3) determine how, and the molecular basis by which various critical regulators affect dynein
activity; and, (4) investigate the coordination and interplay between cell cycle state and dynein activity. Our
studies will provide critical insight into fundamental mechanisms that dictate transport of numerous cargoes with
spatial and temporal precision such that cellular and ultimately organismal health is established and maintained."

Inflammation is a complex process with many lipid and peptide mediators involved. A large number of these
mediators elicit either pro-inflammatory or pro-resolving effects through the action on G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs). My lab is interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory and pro-
resolving GPCRs sense diverse signaling molecules and transduce chemical signals across the cell membrane
to regulate inflammation. We employ a combination of research approaches in structural biology including cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM), pharmacology, and computational biology. We are also making efforts to develop
novel ligands of those GPCRs as potential new drugs through structure-based approaches. In the last funding
period, we have determined structures of several members of a chemotactic GPCR family including the C5a
receptor (C5aR), the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2), and the formylpeptide receptors bound to diverse
agonists or antagonists at different conformational states, which allowed us to define the molecular basis for the
action of several drugs and drug candidates. In the current proposal, we will study the signaling and
pharmacology of three lipid GPCRs that regulate different aspects of inflammation, the chemerin receptor
CMLKR1, GPR32, and GPR84. Both CMLKR1 and GPR32 are closely related to the C5aR, DP2 and FPRs.
They have been shown to respond to resolvins, which are SPMs derived from ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), to induce the resolution of inflammation. In contrast, GPR84 is a newly characterized pro-inflammatory
GPCR that can be activated by endogenous medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) to augment inflammatory
responses and enhance phagocytosis by macrophages. Through a combination of approaches in structural
biology, pharmacology, computational biology, and immunology, we aim to provide a comprehensive molecular
understanding of how diverse lipid, peptide, and synthetic small-molecule ligands act on and regulate the
activities of these three lipid GPCRs. Our studies will exploit unique properties of CMLKR1, GPR32, and GPR84
to address several fundamental issues of GPCR signaling and pharmacology including lipid recognition, receptor
antagonism, allosteric modulation, and biased signaling. Our research strategies developed in this proposal will
be applied to our future research on the structure and pharmacology of other fatty acid receptors (FFARs) in
immunometabolism. We will also develop new agents for these GPCRs as useful pharmacological tools and
potential drugs to control inflammation. The new compounds will serve as the leading compounds for our future
drug development effort through structure-based compound optimization and functional characterization."

 Advances in synthetic biology provide powerful tools to interrogate the complex relationship between
network structure and function. In this study, we will combine synthetic biology with computational modeling to
investigate network-mediated regulation of cell damage and deterioration, a complex biological process. As
similar studies in mammals are prohibitively time- and resource-intensive, we choose to focus on
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has proven to be a genetically tractable model for many fundamental
processes in mitotic cells and has allowed identification of many conserved genes that regulate cell-fate
decisions in eukaryotes. Emerging questions include how these genes interact and how the interactions change
dynamically to drive multi-generational cell deterioration dynamics. We recently found two distinct phenotypes
in genetically identical yeast cells as they approach cell death: one with decreased ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
silencing and nucleolar decline (Mode 1) whereas the other with heme depletion and mitochondrial decline (Mode
2). We found that stochasticity plays an important role in choosing one of the two paths, but once the fate decision
is made, it is almost always irreversible. We identified a core molecular circuit, consisting of the lysine
deacetylase Sir2 and the heme-activated protein (HAP) transcriptional complex, that governs the decision to
select one of these two paths. Based on the model, we were able to engineer cells to follow a third path with a
dramatically extended period of growth and survival, free of deterioration (Mode 3). In this proposal, we will
expand these efforts and systematically perturb and rewire the core circuit that controls cell fate in order to
reprogram its decision-making process. In Aim 1, we will use chemically-inducible promoters to control
expression of Sir2 and HAP and thereby modulate cell-fate decisions in isogenic cells. We will use microfluidics
to generate distinct, dynamic patterns of Sir2 and HAP expression and evaluate their effects on damage
accumulation, physiological changes, and cellular decline. In Aim 2, we will genetically rewire the core Sir2-HAP
circuit under the guidance of computational modeling and examine how these engineered circuits govern cell-
fate decisions and cell deterioration dynamics. In Aim 3, we will use high-throughput microfluidics to identify the
gene expression programs associated with Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3 and examine how perturbations of
these programs affect multi-generational deterioration dynamics. These analyses will uncover the genes and
processes that underlie the missing connections between the Sir2-HAP core circuit and downstream modules
that underlie cellular decline leading to cell death. They will enable us to expand our computational model and
improve its predictive power. Throughout the study, we will construct deterministic and stochastic models, which
will produce testable predictions and guide engineering of synthetic gene circuits. If successful, this research will
advance a quantitative and predictive understanding of cellular fate decisions and cell deterioration."

 Diets low in fruits and vegetables are associated with chronic disease disparities for Latinos living in rural
areas. Furthermore, in rural areas, structural and social factors like low wages, limited public transportation,
and inability to access social services, can limit access to healthy food for Latinos. Despite these barriers to
healthy foods, many Latinos regularly shop at retail food stores (tiendas), which provide access to culturally
desired foods and services. El Valor is an effective, culturally tailored retail food store (tiendas) intervention to
promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables among Latino shoppers. This theory-informed, multi-level
intervention addresses customer behavior, social, and structural factors at the tienda. We propose to shift our
knowledge on adapting evidence-based interventions such as El Valor to rural areas by incorporating social
determinants of health and partnering with community leaders and members to tailor this intervention for
Latinos living in rural communities, tiendas, and the environmental factors that impact these communities.
Using a hybrid type I cluster-RCT design, we aim to augment and adapt the El Valor intervention for Latinos
living and shopping in tiendas in rural communities; to assess the implementation of the adapted El Valor
intervention on access to fruits and vegetables at the tienda level; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
adapted El Valor intervention on Latino customers’ consumption of fruits and vegetables. We engage in a
community-based participatory research process to create new knowledge on translating evidence-based

This research aims to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based interventions to promote health,
reduce health disparities, and contribute to health equity for Latinos in the United States."
11091683,"OBSCN encodes a family of giant, cytoskeletal proteins, obscurins, that play key structural and regulatory
roles in striated muscles. Consistent with this, mutations in OBSCN have been associated with different forms
of cardiomyopathies. Obscurin-B (~870 kDa), the largest known obscurin isoform is a modular protein consisting
of immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin-III (Fn-III) domains followed by an array of tandem signaling motifs and
two COOH-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domains, Kin1 and Kin2 that share ~45% homology with Myosin Light Chain
kinases. Although the presence of Kin1 and Kin2 was discovered almost two decades ago, their enzymatic
activity, catalytic substrates and (patho)physiological roles have remained largely elusive. Recently, our group
demonstrated that both Kin1 and Kin2 are enzymatically active. In particular, Kin1 undergoes autophospho-
rylation and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin. N-cadherin is an essential component of the
adherens junctions (AJ) present in the intercalated disc (ICD), the unique microdomain of the sarcolemma that
mediates the mechanical and electrical coupling of neighboring cardiomyocytes. In view of these findings and
given the coincident distribution of obscurin-B containing Kin1 and N-cadherin at the ICD, we hypothesize that
obscurin-Kin1 plays key roles in cardiomyocyte adhesion and/or communication (at least in part) by modulating
the activities of N-cadherin via phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. We will address this hypothesis by
elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate Kin1 activation (Aim 1), determine the role of Kin1-mediated
phosphorylation of N-cadherin in cardiac structure/function (Aim 2), and assessing the impact of a missense
mutation in Kin1 linked to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in humans (Aim 3). During the last
decade, mounting evidence has accumulated, highlighting the intimate involvement of obscurins in cardiac
structure/function in health and the pathogenesis of heart disease when mutated or truncated. Moreover, the
pivotal role of N-cadherin in the mechanical and electrical coupling of adjacent cardiomyocytes has been
extensively documented, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate its functional properties have only
been scantily examined. Our proposal is motivated by this view and will provide important information about the
role of the novel obscurin-Kin1/N-cadherin signaling axis at the ICD in health and how it is compromised in
disease. It will therefore address a fundamental biological question that has translational relevance."

An emerging model of obesity pathogenesis posits a central role for the inflammatory activation of
hypothalamic microglia localized to the arcuate nucleus (ARC, a key brain area for the control of food intake
and body weight) in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO), a finding observed in mammalian species
ranging from rodents to humans. While microglia activation in the ARC is a known determinant of weight gain
in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, it paradoxically improves glucose tolerance in DIO, but the mechanisms
underlying both of these metabolic effects remain unclear. Herein, we report the novel finding that in mice, DIO
induces loss of specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) structures known as perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the
same brain area where reactive gliosis occurs. PNNs can powerfully influence the activity of neurons that they
enmesh, and in the ARC, a large proportion of AgRP and a subset of POMC neurons are among those
enmeshed by PNNs. These neurons are central regulators of energy homeostasis, and their altered function in
DIO is strongly implicated in obesity pathogenesis and glucose regulation. Importantly, ablating or silencing
microglia reduces Npy and AgRP levels and increases POMC neuron excitability, suggesting a link between
microglial activation and ARC neuronal function that promotes weight gain. Furthermore, DIO is associated
with loss of hypothalamic PNNs in proportion to the degree of microglial activation, with PNN stability
enhanced by interventions that ablate or limit the inflammatory capacity of microglia. Finally, removal of
hypothalamic PNNs experimentally causes gliosis, hyperphagia and rapid weight gain with preserved glucose
tolerance in rodents, providing strong evidence that microglia and PNNs are linked in a critical mechanism that
underlies obesity pathogenesis. Here, we investigate the inter-related hypotheses that obesity-associated
microglial activation induces loss of PNN enmeshment of ARC neurons, thereby altering AgRP and Pomc
neuron function in ways that promote excess fat accumulation but maintain glucose tolerance. Proposed
studies will first quantify the role played by microglia to regulate ARC PNN turnover. We will then 1) determine
whether the effect of DIO to induce loss of ARC PNNs depends on microglial activation, 2) identify the roles of
both microglial activation and PNN loss in obesity-associated dysfunction of AgRP and POMC neurons, and 3)
determine the bidirectional contributions linking ARC PNN loss and microglial activation to DIO susceptibility."

 The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to understand how biology uses transition metals to
control the speciation of redox-active substrates including reactive or “fixed” nitrogen species (RNS). Reactive
nitrogen species serve vital roles in biology. For example, nitric oxide (NO) is a cellular signaling agent that
regulates vasodilation in mammalian systems. In a separate context, nitrate (NO3–) can substitute for dioxygen
(O2) as the terminal electron acceptor during cellular respiration by bacteria that include human pathogens.
This proposal describes a continuation of efforts to elucidate mechanisms of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle
via the study of metalloenzymes as well as model complexes that interconvert RNS. A key knowledge gap that
will be addressed through proteomics and enzymology concerns the means by which ammonia oxidizing
archaea derive chemical energy from the oxidation of hydroxylamine. The operative enzyme and the product of
this reaction remain unknown. Activity guided purification and mass spectrometry will furnish the identity of this
globally proliferated nitrogen cycle protein for subsequent characterization by spectroscopy, X-ray
crystallography, and kinetics. Further work will explore product selectivity in RNS oxidation biochemistry by
heme P460 proteins to determine how NO is selected over nitrous oxide (N2O) to differentiate metabolic from
detoxification proteins. The PI will continue to collaborate with leading bioinorganic chemists to understand
how transition metals prime RNS for oxidation or reduction and how selectivity in these reactions is achieved.
These collaborations will leverage the PI’s expertise in X-ray spectroscopic as well as in other inorganic
spectroscopies. Key examples of these collaborations involve site-selective spectroscopic probing of metal
atoms in the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase, the means by which multicopper clusters reduce N2O, and studying
the electronic structures and reactivities of Lewis-acid stabilized RNS that have been rendered capable of
undergoing redox transformations independent of proton transfer."

Nearly all cells in our bodies contain the same genome, and thus each of them has the capacity to adopt one of
many cell identities. Normal development is characterized by progressive restriction in cell identity from
multipotent progenitor cells toward terminally differentiated cells. Most cells choose a single identity and maintain
it over time. However, defects in cell fate determination or maintenance can allow cells to escape the restrictions
on cell identity, endowing them with new properties that cause disease. For this reason, the steps leading to
disease have been described as development gone awry. More importantly, it suggests that cells proceed down
the path to disease by inappropriately accessing genetic information controlling cell identity. Thus, studying the
mechanisms controlling access to genetic information during normal development can inform how deregulation
of these mechanisms contributes to disease. My lab studies two different regulatory layers controlling access to
DNA-encoded information and their importance in controlling gene expression. Research during the term of this
grant will interrogate the mechanisms underlying (1) how chromatin-based packaging of transcriptional
enhancers determines where and when transcription factors bind DNA to switch genes on or off, and (2) how
modifications of histone proteins contribute to chromatin organization and transcriptional control. DNA is wrapped
around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the repeating unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes are barriers to
transcription factor binding, inhibiting early steps of gene activation. Thus, understanding how chromatin is made
accessible to transcription factors is necessary for understanding gene control. More importantly, returning open
chromatin to a closed state and reinstating this barrier is critical for preventing gene activation at the wrong time
or place. However, the mechanisms controlling chromatin closing are uncharacterized. We have uncovered a
temporal cascade of transcription factors, which we term “chromatin gatekeepers” due to their requirement for
opening and closing access to enhancers, that we study to decipher these mechanisms. We will also investigate
how information about decisions made earlier in development is propagated over time. A key to unlocking this
question is a unique genetic resource we recently generated that enables us to directly test the function of
histones. Histones are subject to a diverse array of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are thought to
carry epigenetic information to control DNA-templated processes, including transcription. However, evidence
supporting the role of histone PTMs in animals is largely correlative due to the difficulty in creating mutant histone
genotypes in animals. Drosophila is distinct among animal models in that the histone genes reside at a single
locus in the genome. We can replace the endogenous histone genes with tailor-made versions, thereby providing
us with the first opportunity to distinguish between regulatory information that is directly encoded in the DNA
sequence and information that is epigenetically propagated. We will employ this approach to interrogate the role
that histone PTMs play in transcriptional regulation and in control of 3D genome organization."

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and cis-
regulatory elements (CREs) are central to most biological processes. Research in my laboratory aims to
characterize the structure and logic of human GRNs with the ultimate goal of devising therapeutic
strategies. Current gaps in our understanding of GRNs include: determining how TF combinations provide
transcriptional specificity, determining how GRNs are rewired in response to environmental cues and
pathogens, and designing strategies to manipulate GRNs to modulate biological outcomes. Cytokines
present an archetype model to study GRNs because cytokines genes are highly regulated at the
transcriptional level in different cell types and stimulation conditions. We have recently delineated a large-
scale cytokine GRN by determining the binding of individual TFs to cytokine promoter regions and
integrating with expression datasets. Here, we will expand these studies to identify the role of
heterodimeric TFs in cytokine regulation by integrating TF-wide screens using a novel heterodimer yeast
one-hybrid approach we developed, and multi-CUT&tag to profile TF heterodimer binding genome-wide.
This will identify the rules by which heterodimers confer transcriptional specificity and will provide targets
for modulation of cytokine expression in disease. Viruses can rewire or leverage host GRNs for productive
viral replication and to evade immune responses. Given the coexistence of viral genomes and host TFs
and host genomes and viral TF within infected cells, this provides the opportunity for viral-host cross-
transcriptional regulation. For example, CREs of DNA viruses and retroviruses can bind host TFs to
regulate viral gene expression in the appropriate cell types and states to promote viral replication or
latency. We will identify the viral CREs from dsDNA viruses and retroviruses that are active in different cell
types and activation states using high-throughput reporter assays, as well as the human TFs that regulate
these viral CREs. Viral TFs can bind to host CREs to modulate the expression of host genes to promote
cell proliferation, metabolic changes, and immune suppression. We will continue to characterize the
function of viral TFs including identifying targets, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interactions, and
changes in transcriptional programs. Altogether, the proposed studies will identify general principles and
generate a framework to study and manipulate immune GRNs, and will identify mechanisms by which
viruses control host GRNs to replicate and evade immune responses."

Fungal pathogens infect humans, animals, and plants and cause severe consequences on
global human health and crop production. Communication between hosts and pathogens is
essential for host defense and pathogen virulence, but the underlying mechanisms are not
well understood. Previous studies in my lab discovered that some non-coding regulatory
small RNAs (sRNAs) from fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, which causes grey
mold disease on more than 1000 plant species, can be transported into host plant cells and
suppress host immunity genes, a mechanism called “Cross-Kingdom RNAi”. Recently, we
discovered that such sRNA communication is bi-directional. Plant hosts have also
developed the ability to deliver sRNAs, mainly using extracellular vesicles, to fungal cells
and induce cross-kingdom RNAi of fungal virulence-related genes. Such sRNA
communication was also observed between mammals and parasites. Although more and
more studies across diverse systems demonstrate that mobile sRNAs are key regulatory
molecules in host and pathogen interactions, the field of cross-kingdom/cross-species RNA
communication is still in its infancy. This proposal is designed to use plant Arabidopsis
and fungal pathogen Botrytis as a model system to address the outstanding questions in this
field, including, how host cells control sRNA transport upon infection, how specific classes
of small RNAs are sorted into extracellular vesicles, how fungal cells deliver sRNAs into
host cells, what are the mechanisms of RNA and vesicle uptake in the host cells and fungal
cells, and whether other classes of RNAs, such as mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs,
move between host and fungal cells, how they function in the counter party, etc.. A
combination of genetics, genomics, biochemical and molecular biology approaches will be
used. This project is expected to provide unprecedented insight into the underlying
mechanisms of cross-kingdom/cross-species RNA communications, which will ultimately
help develop innovative and eco-friendly disease control strategies and RNA-based
fungicides or antifungal drugs."

and Accuracy” is to further develop and validate the EmCAST algorithm, which uses sequence/structure data
available in the Protein Data Bank to predict stabilizing mutations at surface exposed sites of proteins. This
goal will be accomplished in three aims. Aims 1 and 2 apply the method to four all- domains, two all-
domains and a set of four / domains. Aim 3 applies EmCAST to the problem of tuning the equilibrium
between two protein conformers. Reliable methods to stabilize proteins are essential for increasing the shelf
life of protein pharmaceuticals and for providing stable scaffolds for evolving new protein functions and high-
specificity binding agents. A key need of this project is the ability to efficiently express multiple variants of
eleven different proteins from Escherichia coli. Recently, one of two incubator shakers in the PI’s lab has
become less reliable leading to substantial downtime. This has significantly slowed the ability of the PI’s lab to
express the proteins needed for this project. To remedy this problem, we are requesting funds through this
equipment supplement to purchase an Eppendorf Innova 44R Incubator Shaker. This incubator shaker has
refrigeration providing for tight temperature control in the 30 – 40 oC range (±0.1 oC) and incubation at
temperatures up to 20 oC below ambient temperature. Shaking speeds can also be controlled to within ±1 rpm.
These features will permit readily reproducible expression of the proteins needed for this project. The
refrigeration capabilities of the Innova 44R are not available on our current incubator shaker and will facilitate
expression of isotopically labeled proteins required to evaluate the effects of protein stability on dynamics in
Aims 1 and 2 using NMR relaxation methods. Efficient production of isotopically labeled proteins on minimal
media often requires incubation at ambient temperature or below. Finally, the robust and well-tested design of
the Innova 44R ensures that the cost of its upkeep and maintenance will be minimal."

This project focuses on elucidating the mechanisms of evolution at the molecular and population-genetic levels
by integrating theoretical and experimental work in a wide phylogenetic framework. The molecular focus is on
cellular rates of error production in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, in particular erroneous protein
production resulting from messenger RNA mistranslation. This work will test the drift-barrier hypothesis, which
postulates that the level of refinement that natural selection can achieve with any trait is limited by the power of
random drift but enhanced by the effective genome size and/or number of molecular transactions. Newly
developed methods in proteomics will yield rigorous estimates of the apparently high rates at which erroneous
amino acids are incorporated into proteins, complementing prior work at DNA and RNA levels.
 The genetic mechanisms of evolution will be clarified by integrating population-genomic surveys of 1000s
of genotypic isolates of the model microcrustacean Daphnia pulex and related species with functional analyses
of key genes known to be involved phenotypic divergence. This work will reveal the relative magnitudes of drift,
mutation, and recombination in a collection of ~30 populations, far beyond that for any other species. Combined
with a long-term temporal survey, the results will enable a test of the hypothesis that variation at the level of gene
structure and genomic architecture is directly driven by the local population-genetic environment. The D. pulex
system has unique features for gaining insights into major unsolved mysteries in evolutionary genetics, including
the causes and consequences of the loss of meiotic recombination, the genetic mechanisms of sex determination,
and the coevolutionary constraints within and among mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genes as determinants
of ribosome structure and bioenergetic capacity.
 A third project develops evolutionary theory, which combined with the empirical observations, is
designed to clarify how phenotypic divergence emerges among isolated lineages. Special attention will be given
to the joint roles played by genetic drift and fluctuating selection in driving adaptive and nonadaptive patterns
of evolution, as well as to matters of molecular coevolution that form the basis of most intracellular features.
 Because cellular integrity depends on the production of proper proteins, our work on translation fidelity
has broad significance for diverse human-health issues, including matters related to cellular toxicity and protein
aggregation. By integrating direct observations on the relative power of drift, mutation, recombination, and
fluctuating selection, the population-genomics work will yield insight into the factors driving the efficiencies and
mechanisms by which all species respond to natural selection. Elucidation of the molecular/cellular mechanisms
converting sexual reproduction to asexual propagation via unfertilized eggs and the separate mechanisms
preventing male production will open up possibilities of clonal propagation in diverse species as well as possible
strategies for pest control."

 Protein phosphorylation defines one of the most important and pervasive regulatory mechanisms in cell
signaling. A precise control of the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is crucial for living
organisms to maintain normal physiological functions. While protein kinases have attracted a significant amount
of attention given the promise of developing inhibitors for targeted therapies, significant knowledge gaps exist
on the opposing actions of protein phosphatases. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, regulates Wnt signaling and
normal intestinal homeostasis. A large body of evidence indicates that Wnt signaling is required for the
maintenance of normal intestinal stem cells; and dysregulation of Wnt signaling is often the first step leading to
the development of colorectal cancer. In our efforts to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling,
we identified PTPRF, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a novel positive regulator in the Wnt pathway
that promotes the activation of Wnt signaling upstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. To further determine
the functional importance of PTPRF, we utilized Ptprf knockout mice to investigate if Ptprf-loss alters Wnt
signaling and the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo. Our exciting new data showed
that intestinal crypts isolated from Ptprf knockout mice have reduced ability to form organoids, which coincides
with decreased expression of Wnt target genes. In addition, we found that PTPRF interacts and co-localizes with
LRP6 and caveolin upon Wnt stimulation; and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PTPRF in 293T cells
attenuates Wnt-stimulated TOP-Flash reporter activity as well as LRP6 phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified
NEDD4L as a novel E3 ligase that controls PTPRF ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, the central
hypothesis driving this proposal is that that PTPRF positively regulates Wnt signaling by promoting the
formation of Wnt signalosome and the expression of PTPRF sustains intestinal stem cell function. The following
specific aims are proposed: 1) to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying PTPRF-mediated regulation
of Wnt signaling; 2) to determine the role of NEDD4L in controlling PTPRF protein stability; and 3) to define the
functional importance of PTPRF in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo.
Results from our studies will fill an important knowledge gap on how protein phosphatases are involved in
regulating complex biological processes. To ensure the success of this study, we have assembled a strong
investigative team with collective expertise in protein phosphatases, Wnt signaling and intestinal epithelial cell
biology. Ultimately, by providing new mechanistic insights into PTPRF-dependent regulation of Wnt signaling,
our findings will help identify new strategies for treating Wnt-driven diseases by using PTPRF as a target."
11099383,"Project Summary from the Parent Award
In response to membrane potential depolarization, voltage-dependent channels undergo a series of
conformational changes from a non-conducting state (closed) to an activated (conducting), finally
stabilizing in a non-conducting inactivated state. K+ channel function has been associated with such basic
cellular functions as the regulation of electrical activity, signal transduction and osmotic balance. In higher
organisms, K+ channel dysfunction may lead to uncontrolled periods of electrical hyperexcytability, like
epileptic episodes, myotonia and cardiac arrhythmia. Consequently, efforts to understand K+ channel
structure function and dynamics relate directly to human health and disease. The continuing long-term
goal of this project is to further understand the molecular mechanisms of gating in voltage-dependent
channels, by focusing on the analysis of K+ channel gating in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
Specifically we will address the following key questions: What are the atomic structures of the key
conformations that determine channel activity? This question will be answered for membrane embedded
systems as well as those ordered in a lattice. What are the molecular bases of voltage-dependent
gating? We will be testing the hypothesis that a specific sliding helix movement (the one click motion) can
explain charge translocation in certain voltage sensors, but perhaps not others. The more charge a sensor
translocates, the larger the number of clicks its sensor needs to move. And how different parts of the channel
interact to define open channel activity? We plan to study these problems by combining spectroscopic
techniques (EPR and NMR), X-ray crystallography electrophysiological and computational methods. We
intend to continue these structure-function studies by investigating a wealth of biochemically-defined
systems from KcsA and KvAP, to the Shaker voltage sensor and the hyperpolarization-activated channel
from Methanococcus janschii (MVP). In addition, we will focus our attention on the voltage-sensing
domain from the Ciona intestinalis-Voltage-Sensor-containing Phosphatase (Ci- VSP) aiming to improve the
resolution of our recent crystals structures. Finally, we will examine the structure of the human voltage-
dependent proton channel Hv1 in membranes though an extensive site-directed spin labeling analysis and
computational modeling. This proposal should open new experimental avenues that will contribute to our
understanding of biologically important events such as electrical signaling, signal transduction and ion
channel gating."
11099244,"Project Summary/Abstract
The main objective of the proposed studies is the elucidation of fundamental processes of translation,
translational regulation and translational quality control. To this end, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy,
the technique pioneered in the PI's lab, is used in collaborations with world specialists on bacterial and
eukaryotic translation. We make use of two techniques of sample preparation, standard and time-resolved
cryo-EM. In the standard application of cryo-EM, samples are pipetted onto the grid, excess liquid is removed
by blotting, and the grid is then plunged into the cryogen. Since this procedure requires several seconds, it is
not possible to capture short-lived (less than 1000 millisecond) states of a molecule following a reaction. The
alternative technique developed in this lab is time-resolved cryo-EM, whereby a reaction is started by mixing
two components in a microfluidic chip, allowing them to react in a channel of defined, variable length (10 to
1000 ms), and then spraying the reaction products onto the grid as the latter in plunged into the cryogen. In
this way, the kinetics of a reaction can be followed and, at the same time, intermediate states can be captured
and visualized at high resolution. These two techniques are used to study the following processes: translation
initiation in E. coli and yeast, translation termination, recycling and quality control in mammalian, EMCV virus
takeover of the host's ribosome. Another objective of the proposed studies is the exploration of a novel method
of data analysis that seeks to generate a low-dimensional map of states existing in a continuum from a large
dataset of single-particle cryo-EM images of a biological macromolecule. Such a mapping can be used to
determine the free-energy landscape of the molecule, containing information on the function-related
conformational trajectories. This method will be applied in collaborations with leading experts to two
membrane-associated molecules with eminent biological and public health significance: rotary ATPase and
Cystic Fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR)."
11099331,"ABSTRACT
Oxidative stress is a prevalent and dangerous cellular condition resulting in deleterious modifications to the
structure of DNA. These modifications promote mutagenesis and consequently the development of numerous
human maladies, including cancer. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the cells primary defense
against oxidative DNA damage and is a vital guardian of genome stability. While the roles of individual
enzymes during a classical BER cycle are largely established, it remains enigmatic how these enzymes
function together in a multi-protein/DNA complex to facilitate the channeling of toxic DNA repair intermediates
between each protein. Importantly, BER not only occurs on naked duplex DNA, but also within chromatin that
is composed of nucleosomes. These nucleosomes present a barrier to BER enzymes accessing and
effectively repairing DNA damage. The mechanisms by which DNA repair proteins overcome this barrier to
repair DNA damage in the nucleosome is poorly understood. The major goals of this proposal are to
understand the molecular mechanisms of each BER factor both individually and within larger multi-
protein/DNA complexes using naked duplex DNA and chromatin; and to decipher the molecular mechanism
by which telomerase replicates the telomere. Elegant biophysical approaches are required to elucidate these
BER complexities and to provide both a foundation for interpreting the biological response and the
development of therapeutic treatments. We are in a unique position to advance this scientific front based on
my strong track record in DNA damage and repair, assembled team of collaborators, and multidisciplinary
approach. To meet this goal, we utilize a comprehensive approach of time- lapse X-ray crystallography,
molecular dynamic simulations, enzyme kinetics, single-molecule total internal reflection microscopy, and
cryo-EM. Using these methodologies, we will determine 1) how do new fundamental mechanistic steps alter
the DNA polymerase and telomerase mechanism; 2) how do individual BER enzymes assemble into a multi-
protein/DNA complex to facilitate the channeling of toxic DNA intermediates; 3) how are multi-protein/DNA
BER complexes structurally organized; 4) how is DNA damage identified and repaired within nucleosomes;
and 5) how are multi-protein/DNA BER complexes formed on nucleosomes containing DNA damage. This set
of questions will go from an atomic level mechanistic understanding of key BER components to the structural
and dynamic interactions within the entire BER multi-protein complex. By doing this, we will lay the foundation
to address an inherent challenge in establishing cellular models and developing new therapeutic treatments
that target DNA repair. With this information in hand, we will be closer to our long-term goal of providing a
basis for rational drug design towards the development of more effective chemotherapeutics and synergistic
drug combinations that target proteins involved in the DNA damage response."
11100080,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE PARENT PROJECT
The supplement will facilitate the parent grant summarized here by supporting an equipment purchase to fulfill
the original scope of work. Nonsense mutations pose a serious challenge to fitness and survival of cells and
organisms. To suppress mRNAs carrying such nonsense mutations, all eukaryotes possess a conserved mRNA
surveillance pathway called Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD). NMD is also an essential post-
transcriptional regulator of normal mRNAs that shapes processes such as stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis,
germ cell development and anti-viral response. In all eukaryotes, NMD is governed by three UPF proteins, UPF1,
UPF2 and UPF3. In multicellular organisms, NMD is also regulated by a conserved multi-protein exon junction
complex (EJC), which binds upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions. During translation, if at least one EJC
remains present downstream of a terminating ribosome, it can signal premature termination and trigger NMD.
Understanding NMD mechanism and its regulation by EJC is crucial for betterment of human health as mutations
in EJC and NMD proteins cause developmental defects, intellectual disability and mental retardation. The
overarching goal of this research program is to understand how the remarkable variation in composition and
function of EJC/UPF machinery regulates NMD to dictate cellular function and fate in animal cells. To achieve
this goal, we are using a combination of genetic, genomic, molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches in
cultured human cells and in zebrafish embryos to pursue four main directions. (1) We will identify the mechanism
of a switch in EJC composition that we recently discovered and define the role of distinct EJC compositions in
gene expression. (2) Our recent discovery that mammalian UPF3 paralogs and their interaction with EJC are
non-essential for NMD challenges a decades old model of EJC-dependent NMD in eukaryotes. We will apply
new genomic technologies that probe in vivo ribosome function to identify the role of UPF3 and other UPF
proteins in premature termination complex assembly and activity on hundreds of human mRNAs. We will also
identify the factors and features that govern signaling between the termination complex and the EJC. (3) We and
others have previously shown that EJCs are often detected at unexpected locations on RNAs. By exploiting a
new step in EJC recycling that we have uncovered, we will define the assembly mechanisms and functions of
EJCs at such unexpected sites. (4) We have developed zebrafish mutants that lack one of the EJC or its NMD
adapter proteins, which will be used to identify the genetic and cellular processes controlled by these factors
during motor neuron and muscle development. Overall, our work will advance the knowledge of NMD
mechanisms and how they regulate post-transcriptional gene regulation to control cellular function and
organismal development. This progress will also elevate our ability to target NMD for therapeutics."

Every cell must constantly monitor its energy level and appropriately adjust energy generation
rates, based on metabolic demand to maintain homeostasis. Continuous fulfillment of this energy
demand depends on sufficient nutrient supply, sensing nutrient availability, metabolizing and
converting into chemical energy. In eukaryotic cells energy, in the form of ATP, is mainly produced
by mitochondria. Not only how much total ATP is generated, local energy level is also important
for cells to carry out critical functions, such as neuronal activity, cell migration, tumor cell invasion,
wound healing, and immunity. Intracellular transport and positioning of mitochondria shape
spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ATP distribution. My overall goal is to understand the molecular
pathways regulating the interplay between cellular metabolism, mitochondrial positioning and
function. The estimated mitochondrial protein number is ~1,300 for mammalian cells. Post-
translational modifications can further magnify the functional diversity of proteins. Metabolic flux-
sensitive post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, uniquely couple nutrient status to
cellular metabolism and signaling pathways. While my research will be focused on O-
GlcNAcylation-dependent regulation of mitochondrial functions and inter-organelle
communications, systematic analysis of metabolic enzyme functions within the intracellular space
will add extra dimension to our understanding of metabolic pathways. Our experiments will
decipher the metabolic biochemistry and metabolite kinetics within the context of cellular
architecture. My interdisciplinary research program is poised to reveal fundamental insights into
the mechanisms that orchestrate the nutrient and energy supply, and pinpoint the underlying
causes of energy impairments that lead to diseases."

The Baylor-Hopkins Clinical Genomics Center (BHCGC), comprised of teams at the Baylor
College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC), John’s Hopkins University
Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) and the University of Texas School of Public Health
(UTSPH), will provide short read whole genome sequences (srWGS), genotyping arrays and
genetic interpretation for the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program (All of
Us). The BHCGC has provided ~1/3 of the program’s genomic and genetic data so far, generating
171,226 genotyping arrays, 154,349 srWGS sequences and populated reports for ~36,000
individuals via 54,349 variant interpretations, with ~1,000 positive findings. The team can provide
data for up to 100,000 participants in the next year and the capacity can easily be further scaled to
complete the remainder of the programs goal of 1,000,000, through outyears. For srWGS, the
Illumina NovaSeq X platform will be validated for FDA IDE approval, while automated literature
scanning will speed and simplify the task of variant interpretation. New tools will be introduced
to speed variant re-analysis of All of Us data, so that updated reports can easily be generated.
While collaboratively building infrastructure for the All of Us program, the BHCGC has made
major contributions, including (i) array choice and design of content, (ii) calibration of the variant
interpretation workflow, (iii) collaborative variant harmonization, (iv) to reprocessing of 240,000
array samples and 330,000 srWGS for the All of Us Data and Research Center (DRC), (v)
development of the FDA IDE, (vi) identification of sample contamination at the Biobank, (vii)
design of all the aspects of sample flow and manifests and (viii) contributing to critical decisions
related to overall program management. Each benefited from engagement with the All of Us
network, via individual meetings and regular group interactions. In the next year, this continued
engagement will ensure network coordination, cohesion, and synergism.
Additional Pilot, Demonstration and Driver projects are also proposed: Pilots aim to (i) greatly
increase the data from proteomic assays, at minimal cost to the program, (ii) develop an untargeted
metabolomic data resource and analysis workflow for the Researcher Workbench (RWB) and (iii)
continue long read DNA sequencing assays to complete previous commitments and to serve
Demonstration Projects and other network demands. Demonstration Projects will pave the way for
All of Us completion by (i) defining the pathway to a complete whole genome report, (ii)
determining how mixtures of long read data and srWGS can be combined to better resolve
important health related genomic variation, (iii) provide infrastructure, integrated RWB workflows
and illustrative examples of multiomic studies (DNA, methylation, RNA, protein, metabolomic).
Driver Projects will (i) analyze ‘missingness’ of All of Us Health Data on the RWB, with a view
to providing paths to metadata completeness, (ii) analyze extant long read data from Hispanic
Populations and (iii) study DNA methylation in a key mental health disease state. The Pilots,
Demonstration and Driver Projects together contribute to the final All of Us product, of
comprehensive genetic reporting and a complete research resource.
Together these contributions address all eight of the objectives of the current phase of the program,
paving the way for the ultimate success of All of Us."

This Diversity Supplement proposal aims to support Vanessa Lopez, an incoming Postdoctoral Fellow, in
extending the objectives of the Parent R00 grant. The focus of this supplement is on elucidating the impact of
disrupting the Top2a-PRC2-H3K27me3 pathway on brain’s epigenetic state at a single-cell level. This goal aligns
closely with the Parent R00's objectives and will further the aims of the Parent R00, particularly Specific Aim 2.
The Parent R00 has uncovered a novel toxicological pathway implicating Top2a in sensing environmental
toxicants during vertebrate development and leading to social behavior deficits in zebrafish and mouse.
Additionally, it has highlighted the role of PRC2 and H3K27me3 in this pathway, especially in regulating autism
risk genes. The proposed research aims to delve deeper into this pathway using single-cell multimodal omics
sequencing and computational analysis.
Bulk sequencing methods used in the Parent R00 provided valuable insights but lacked cell-type-specific
information crucial for understanding complex epigenetic regulations of brain function. To overcome this
limitation, the proposed Diversity Supplement will employ cutting-edge single-cell multimodal omics technologies,
including Paired-Tag and Paired-seq, to map the single-cell transcriptome and epigenome of wild-type larval
zebrafish brains as well as in zebrafish brains depleted of Top2a. This will enable the characterization of cell-
type-specific epigenetic changes induced by Top2a inhibition.
Specific Aim 1 will apply Paired-Tag to profile single-cell transcriptome and H3K27me3 in wild-type and Top2a
knockout zebrafish brains to identify cell-type-specific changes. Specific Aim 2 will deploy Paired-seq to assess
single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility to identify cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) regulated by
the Top2a-PRC2-H3K27me3 pathway and discover toxicant-responsive CREs targeting autism risk genes.
Collaboration with a mentoring team consisting of experts in single-cell multimodal omics analysis, environmental
toxicology, and autism research will provide Ms. Lopez with a unique skill set to conduct her research and
advance her career to becoming an independent researcher. Overall, this Diversity Supplement aims to bridge
knowledge gaps in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic toxicity and its implications
for neurodevelopmental disorders like autism."

Project Summary/Abstract:
 The PI’s lab studies natural genome editing systems in microbial eukaryotes, bringing a strongly
molecular and mechanistic approach to understanding genome evolution and diversity. The surprisingly
sophisticated variations on DNA and RNA processing in microbial eukaryotes display a wide range of genome
architectures and genetic systems. Some pathways erode the notions of a gene (e.g. scrambled genes and
RNA editing) and even Mendelian inheritance, reminding us that a draft genome sequence can be a far cry
from knowledge of its products. Genome rearrangements occur in diverse organisms, and contribute to many
human diseases, especially cancer—a disease of the genome, but the extreme level of programmed DNA
rearrangements required for development in the ciliate Oxytricha make it an ideal model system to study
genome remodeling and the roles of RNA in orchestrating this process. The proposed research will expand
the lab’s focus on the molecular mechanisms and evolution of this remarkable natural phenomenon. Goals for
the next five years include understanding the roles of DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) during development
and rearrangement, and the interactions between small and long noncoding RNAs and their associated RNA-
binding proteins, together with the rearranging genome. Tools from molecular genetics, biochemistry, and
chromatin biology provide the platform for functional studies, while comparative genomics offers insight into
the evolutionary origins of scrambled genomes and complex genetic architectures, addressing the
fundamental questions of how programmed rearrangements are executed during development and how this

 Data-driven discovery methods are a novel class of methodologies and computational approaches, revolutionizing the
modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems, while remaining scientifically explainable and interpretable. These
methods learn governing equations directly from data and have found considerable success in a wide range of applications
including turbulence, climate, robotics, and autonomy. However, the first generation of these methods has proven poorly
suited to the study of biomedical data. To realize the full potential of data-driven approaches, they must be extended
and adapted to deal with the noise, sparsity, and variability intrinsic to experiments with living organisms. My group has
extended the seminal Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method to the Weak form SINDy (WSINDy).
Weak form equations are a transform of the original data that enables learning of the equations even in the presence of
substantial noise and sparsity. The approach effectively recasts scientific discovery from proposing and validating/refuting
a single scientific hypothesis to simultaneously proposing (in many cases) more than 10180 hypotheses and using sparse
regressing to prune the hypotheses which are not supported by the data. Moreover, our approach currently takes on the
order of minutes on a standard laptop.
 While we have made substantial progress on improving the method, we have encountered a bottleneck for unlocking
the applications of our novel approach. Our collaborators in Biochemistry in the Liu lab are able to perform experiments
in which sheets of cells are induced to migrate collectively. Videos of these experiments can be 50GB each and their
system can quickly generate terabytes of data. While our methodology can learn governing equations for an individual
cell on the order of minutes, there can be thousands of cells in each video and the robotic experimental setup can
simultaneously performs 96 experiments. Accordingly, learning models for all cells in these experiments can take days
and a massively parallel computational resource will remove this bottleneck from our research. In particular, modern
multi-GPU systems are ideally suited to deal with this type of parallel-processing computational task.
 We recently ported our current equation learning code to pytorch (a GPU-specific machine learning software library)
and using an older model NVIDIA GPU, we able to reduce our learning time for a single cell by an order of magnitude
(from minutes to seconds). Therefore, using our updated code on the requested computational server will transform our
research program by enabling near real-time analysis of experiments."

Macromolecular interactions are the basis of cellular processes. Structural characterization of these interactions
is important for better understanding of these processes and for our ability to manipulate them. The number of
macromolecular interactions in a cell is significantly larger than the number of individual macromolecules.
Structures of their assemblies are more difficult to determine experimentally than that of the individual molecules,
which further emphasizes the role of modeling in reconstruction of life processes. The project will advance our
understanding of macromolecular interaction and will facilitate development of better tools for their modeling.
The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) Resources for development of docking techniques, (2) Resources for
knowledge-based docking, and (3) Assessment of predicted interactions and CAPRI community-wide
experiment. Our long-term goals are: (a) development of resources and tools for reliable cell-scale modeling of
macromolecular interactions, which will account for dynamic changes in the molecular structures and kinetics of
association, and (b) application of these resources and tools to structural modeling of a cell, a new frontier and
a grand challenge of computational structural biology. The focus of the proposal is further development of the
integrated resource for studying macromolecular interactions. The DOCKGROUND system will be radically
expanded and diversified to become an ultimate resource for structural modeling of cellular processes, and
eventually the cell itself. The DOCKGROUND system of databases of soluble protein-protein complexes will extend
to other types of macromolecules, to serve as a source of knowledge on molecular recognition and a data
resource for docking procedures. The core of the resource will consist of regularly updated and maintained sets
of experimentally determined macromolecular complexes. The databases of unbound and modeled structures,
built upon the core bound set, will be significantly expanded and improved to advance their role in comprehensive
benchmarking for the development of docking methodologies. The database of docking decoys will provide
community-wide scoring benchmark and an important resource for development of new docking tools.
Downloadable template sets and libraries of rotamers and rotamer transition probabilities will be valuable
resources for data-driven docking. The automated template set updater will maintain the template sets for all
types of macromolecules in the expanded and diversified DOCKGROUND resource. The rotamer libraries and
rotamer-rotamer transition probabilities will be recalculated according to the growth of the DOCKGROUND sets.
Automated assessment protocols will be developed in a joint effort with the CAPRI blind prediction experiment.
The resource will integrate the developed databases and assessment protocols, with a user-friendly interface,
combining options to build customized sets of complexes based on various criteria, easily accessible and
downloadable standard sets, visualization, and assessment tools."

The proposed studies address unresolved principal features of the adaptive immune system we have identified
in lampreys and hagfish. Instead of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-based system of all jawed vertebrates,
adaptive immunity in the jawless vertebrates is mediated by highly diverse sets of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
proteins, named Variable LRR Receptors (VLRs). We have shown that three types of VLR in lampreys (VLRA,
VLRB and VLRC), while structurally unrelated to Ig and T cell receptors (TCRs), are nonetheless expressed by
cells with functional characteristics and gene expression profiles similar to those of mammalian B cells (VLRB),
αβT cells (VLRA), and γδT cells (VLRC). Here we will characterize the diversity of the agnathan T-like cells and
the structures of their VLR signaling complexes. Along with VLRA and VLRC cells, we will characterize two
novel VLRs that we recently identified, VLRD and VLRE, that are distantly related to VLRA and VLRC. We will
investigate the receptor diversity of VLRD and VLRE and the characteristics of subpopulations of lymphocytes
that express them. We have found orthologs of VLRD and VLRE in all six currently available lamprey genomes.
We will extend our phylogenetic survey of the presence and genomic organization of these new receptors to
more divergent lampreys and hagfishes. Like VLRA and VLRC, VLRD and VLRE are transmembrane proteins
with short cytoplasmic tails that lack recognizable signaling motifs. This implies the presence of VLR-associated
signaling molecules, as in jawed vertebrate TCR signaling. We will investigate the nature of signaling partners
in the composite VLRA/C/D/E receptors using pulldown/mass spectrometry strategies with our monoclonal
antibodies. We have identified transcripts for several candidate transmembrane proteins with ITAM motifs that
are expressed by VLRA+ and VLRC+ lymphocytes. We have also identified a sea lamprey ZAP70-like kinase
gene with preferential expression in the VLRA and VLRC T-like cells. We will use the sea lamprey ZAP70 tandem
SH2 domains as bait to identify potential interacting ITAM proteins from lysates of activated lamprey
lymphocytes. We will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to delineate the subsets of T-like cells from
lamprey larval tissues. We will further characterize the early development of the T-like cells using CRISPR/Cas9
to mutate candidate regulators of VLRA/C/D/E assembly and signaling, followed by assessments of VLR
expression, repertoire diversity, and lymphocyte development. We will also characterize the emergence of T-
like lymphocytes in development with scRNA-seq analysis of cells isolated from early feeding larvae throughout
the onset of VLR assembly. These investigations will elucidate T-like cell function in a divergent branch of
vertebrate phylogeny. They will highlight common mechanisms of adaptive immunity across vertebrates, ancient
features that are retained in the agnathan lineage from a common vertebrate ancestor, and reveal novel
agnathan innovations. Collectively, these studies will contribute insight into the origins of vertebrate adaptive
immunity and provide a deeper understanding of T cell biology."

The Sterolbiome Laboratory focuses on working out host-associated bacterial steroidogenic pathways. The focus
of the parent R01 is in identifying bacterial 17α-HSDH and 17β-HSDH involved in conversion of androstenedione

from the gut bacterium, Clostridium scindens, and 17β-HSDH from urinary isolates of Propionimicrobium
lymphophilum. These initial discoveries led to a manuscript that is currently under review in the journal Nature.
However, we are now focusing on identifying additional isoforms of bacterial 17α-HSDH and 17β-HSDH in
human stool samples (>200 samples). To accomplish this, we will use sequence agnostic and culture
independent functional metagenomic library screening. In this approach, community DNA is partially digested
and ligated into an expression vector before transformation into E. coli. Colonies are transferred to wells of
microplates containing bacterial medium and steroid substrates. After extraction of steroid products, hundreds
to thousands of wells need to be analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The Sterolbiome lab at
Illinois has a much larger collection of steroids than the Metabolomics Core on campus, and even core labs at
other institutions that specialize in steroid quantification. Using core labs is both time consuming, and results in
inconsistencies as different facilities utilize different instruments, columns, and solvent systems. The throughput
we are approaching with functional metagenomic subaims makes a dedicated instrument a necessity. Since
functional metagenomics is expected to result in identification of novel enzymatic reactions, we require MS/MS
application to produce unique daughter ions which act as “fingerprints” to assist in identifying unknowns. Knowing
the mass(es) of each peak is critical to differentiating steroid ions from other compounds and provides immediate
information on likely products. Without MS/MS, we would still need to submit most samples to core labs which
is the problem to begin with. Instead, we can develop a custom standardized workflow with the ThermoFisher
Vanquish Flex UHPLC coupled with VWD & IR, and TSQ Fortis Plus electrospray ionization (ESI) Triple
Quadrupole MS. PI Ridlon has support from both his Department and College and with matching funds, the
overall cost to NIGMS for the equipment has been significantly reduced."
11094505,"Summary: Far from the overly simplistic understanding of mitochondria as ‘the powerhouse of the cell’, these
organelles play crucial roles not only in the production of ATP, but also in a wide variety of other biochemical
processes, making mitochondrial function a key determinant of cellular health. Disruption of mitochondrial
homeostasis contributes to a number of chronic diseases, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, and
cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and even aging. Mitochondria undergo constant surveillance and
homeostatic rebalancing to avoid spiraling into a dysfunctional cascade that will inevitably trigger apoptosis or
other cell death pathways. A variety of readouts, including mitochondrial proteostasis and bioenergetics, are
constantly tracked and these inputs are integrated into coherent, retrograde signaling programs that coordinate
gene expression with the nucleus. The most studied of these is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
(UPRmt), which primarily responds to compromised mitochondrial protein import. Recent results from my lab
have increasingly demonstrated that another key component of mitochondrial surveillance is the ESRE
pathway. The ESRE (ethanol and stress response element) pathway is comprised of evolutionarily-conserved
genes containing a strongly conserved, 11-nucleotide motif (TCTGCGTCTCT) in their promoters. These genes
were first identified by their upregulation during acute ethanol exposure, but we have demonstrated that the
ESRE pathway detects mitochondrial damage, specifically increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.
Importantly, compromised ESRE function reduced survival during stress and overexpression of ESRE
machinery extended lifespan in unstressed conditions. Recent discoveries from my lab have identified box C/D
snoRNPs and the Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 as critical regulators of ESRE activity. Finally, we have
identified a strong candidate for the transcription factor that binds the ESRE motif.
 Despite our recent progress, critical gaps remain in our understanding of how ESRE contributes to
mitochondrial health. Questions of particular interest include: how is the signal for ESRE activation propagated
to the nucleus once it is detected? Have we correctly identified the transcription factor that binds the ESRE
motif? What is the mechanism used by box C/D snoRNPs to regulate ESRE function? Is MDT-15 acting in a
non-canonical role to regulate ESRE activity? We will continue to use a variety of biochemical, genetic, and cell
biological techniques, supplemented with new ‘omics-based approaches to expand our understanding of this
network and its role in maintaining mitochondrial health. This enhanced understanding will be key to translating
our discoveries into tangible gains in improvements in health across the lifespan."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. In addition, metastatic BC has a 5-year
survival rate of only 27% and metastases are associated with the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Recent
research has highlighted a complex dynamic between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment as essential
for the formation of macrometastases. Within this field, tissue stiffening through matrix accumulation and altered
matrix organization were recently linked with sustained proliferation and increased migration of tumor cells.
Elevated levels of the glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) have been correlated to poor patient survival in BC and are
linked to enhanced seeding of disseminated tumor cells at metastatic sites. My previous work has indicated
several mechanisms through which accumulated FN impacts the metastatic potential of BC cells. Foremost, I
helped identify a transient increase in extracellular FN in the lungs, which peaked before overt metastasis,
coupled with a non-transient increase in total lung volume. I further found that cyclic mechanical force acted as
a suppressor of cancer cell growth in a biomimetic lung model, implicating the accumulation of extracellular
matrix (ECM) as an attempt by the cancer cells to alter the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and resist
entering dormancy. However, my results showed that BC cells could not organize FN into ECM independently.
Instead, BC cells altered the accumulation and architecture of FN by conditioning resident fibroblasts through
soluble factors and extracellular vesicles. I observed that the FN produced by conditioned fibroblasts varied not
only based on the phenotype of the BC cell, but also from the method of conditioning which tested paracrine and
endocrine signaling. These preliminary results indicate that unique subtypes of cancer associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) may develop based on the BC cell conditioning mechanism, where unique subtypes may be associated
with the specific needs of the various stages of the metastatic cascade. Therefore, Aim 1 of the proposed studies
during my Ph.D. research will define the contribution of cyclic strain on BC cell phenotype and dormancy using
our novel actuating platform. Aim 2, which I will undertake during my postdoctoral research, will seek to better
define the varied roles of CAFs in metastatic progression through the development of a foundation of subtypes
after conditioning with media, isolated extracellular vesicles, and contact from BC cancer cells, including
metastatic and non-metastatic BC cells with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. These findings will enable
advanced interaction studies and promote the development of novel targets for fibroblasts, which may be a more
consistent target than genetically unstable cancer cells and lead to more effective treatment. In addition, the
proposed studies and training plan will expand my current tissue engineering skillset to include advanced
understanding of mechanotransduction pathways and CAF formation as well as improve my communication,
mentoring, and teaching. Together, these skills will place me as a competitive candidate for an independent
principle investigator position in a research university at the intersection of cancer biology and engineering."

The endolysosomal network is the portal by which extracellular material enters the cell. As such, the
membranes of the endosomes, phagosomes, and lysosomes that comprise this network face challenges from
pathogens and other internalized materials as well as from metabolic and chemical stresses. Consequences of
damage vary according to the specific compartment and degree of damage, but extensive lysosomal
membrane permeabilization triggers cell death while limited disruption of endosomes and phagosomes by
particulate material and pathogens leads to inflammasome activation and ensuing cytokine responses. A
widely deployed strategy for removing damaged organelles involves the use of selective autophagy, referred to
as lysophagy. Removal is, however, unnecessary if organelles are instead repaired. We recently discovered a
new role for the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery in responding to nano-
scale disruptions in endolysosomal membranes and promoting their repair.
In this project, we are building on this discovery and testing the hypothesis that ESCRTs (and in particular
ESCRT-III proteins) play a key role in maintaining endolysosomal integrity and function by recognizing and
repairing nanoscale membrane damage. This role for the ESCRT machinery is distinct from its widely
recognized function in intralumenal vesicle biogenesis and appears applicable at both the plasma membrane
and on internal organelles. Nanoscale damage involves short-lived nm-size pre-pore or pore(s) that reseal or,
above a critical threshold, expand to allow unrestrained content exchange. We are using a range of chemical,
physical, and biological stressors to define the signals as well as molecular and physical mechanisms
underlying ESCRT-mediated repair. The high-sensitivity and fast camera requested in this administrative
supplement application will replace a previous generation camera that has failed, allowing us to continue our
studies of the signals and molecules responsible for maintaining endolysosomal membrane integrity."
11099385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intense natural disasters including hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes have become more frequent and
closely spaced in recent years. Large scale natural disasters can severely damage and degrade health care
facility structural integrity and equipment, create environmental hazards, and negatively affect health service
delivery (e.g., cancelled surgeries; postponed preventive care; pharmacy closures; staffing, medication, and
medical supply shortages; large transient surges in emergency department volume) – all of which contribute to
increased stress among health care providers. Superimposing infectious disease epidemics on the natural
disasters further exacerbates stress on the health care system. Over the span of 3 years, Puerto Rico suffered
from 3 major back-to-back public health emergencies including 2 natural disasters and a pandemic. First,
Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 causing major devastation throughout the island. Communities lost
access to essential services such as electricity, potable water, safe roads and bridges, and health care. Most
of the island’s public and private health care facilities closed or had limited capacity for months. Second, in
December 2019, a series of more than 500 quakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater struck Puerto Rico causing
more infrastructure damage to many struggling health facilities and leaving thousands homeless or living
outside in their yards. Third, Puerto Rico continues to deal with the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)
pandemic. This study will provide a unique opportunity to understand the effects of 3 distinct public health
emergencies on a minority population with significant health and health care disparities. We have designed a
mixed methods, multi-level study that will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to study the pre and post
effects of the 3 public health emergencies on Puerto Rico’s health care system’s preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts and how the emergencies have affected the resiliency, experiences, and utilization of the
island’s health care system. The study will use administrative utilization data from 50 general hospitals and 20
federally funded health centers on the island, qualitative interviews of health system leaders and providers, and
follow-up interviews of a representative cohort of 3,062 island adult residents. Using the Donabedian quality of
care model and concepts from an emerging literature on health system resilience as our study framework, we
will 1) identify factors that influenced the capacity of Puerto Rico’s health care system to prepare for, respond
to, and recover from Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes, and COVID-19, 2) model the cumulative effects of
multiple disasters on health system resiliency and how these effects interact, and 3) elicit lessons learned from
health care leaders and providers. We will synthesize the information from our triangulated research approach
to provide data driven recommendations for an effective and coordinated approach to mitigation,
preparedness, response, and resiliency under conditions of increasing frequency and intensity of disasters."

RNA silencing is a gene regulatory mechanism by which small RNAs (18-30 nucleotides) and their Argonaute
protein co-factors modulate the expression of both foreign and endogenous mRNAs. Small RNAs play a critical
role in maintaining proper gene expression by identifying fully or partially complementary mRNAs and targeting
them for either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. The role of RNA silencing in gene regulatory
pathways is conserved across most eukaryotes and is thus of fundamental importance to the developmental and
cellular biology of humans. C. elegans is an excellent system to study RNA silencing because of its short
generation time, its transparency which is ideal for microscopy, and the powerful genetic tools available for
genome manipulation. In C. elegans germ cells, proteins involved in RNA silencing are organized into sub-
compartments of perinuclear condensates, with each sub-compartment playing a unique and critical role. Many
protein factors have been identified that localize to these structures, yet we know little about how they are
organized and assembled. In the first part of this proposal, we will identify factors and conditions that promote
assembly of RNA silencing components into perinuclear condensates. We will further identify the RNAs in each
sub-compartment, with the ultimate goal of dissecting the trajectory of a targeted mRNA through each of its
phases: beginning with transcription, continuing through this assemblage of perinuclear condensates, and
ultimately with translational repression or degradation by the RNA silencing pathway. Because there are ~27 C.
elegans Argonaute proteins, many of which colocalize at P granules, we will next identify the factors contributing
to sorting of small RNA into the appropriate Argonaute proteins. This sorting is critical because many Argonaute
proteins bind different small RNAs from one another, target distinct groups of mRNAs, and can have very
different regulatory effects on these target mRNAs. Finally, we will focus on how protein modifications such as
phosphorylation and methylation can regulate RNA silencing pathways, including affecting localization,
interacting partners, and dynamics of Argonaute proteins and other key factors. Together, the proposed
experiments will uncover the key details of how RNA silencing pathways are organized, how the specificity of
the pathways is defined, and what mechanisms regulate these pathways. This work will lead to a better
understanding of how small RNAs modulate gene expression in healthy cells, which can ultimately be applied to
discerning how changes in these pathways cause misregulation of genes in humans and transition to a disease
state."

Replication protein A (RPA) is required for nearly every DNA repair and replication process. RPA binds single-
stranded DNA and interacts with dozens of proteins at sites of DNA maintenance. We are interested in the
protein complexes that form between RPA and other proteins when performing specific DNA repair tasks. The
current project examines RPA’s role as a central scaffold in uracil base excision repair. Our approach is to
manipulate the binding of RPA to Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG2) to examine the relevance of their
interaction. We have developed a strategy to covalently tether together RPA and UNG2 to form mini DNA
repair complexes that resemble the architecture of the two proteins when they interact in cells. Our Preliminary
Data demonstrates our success at forming RPA-UNG2 protein complexes in both cellular and recombinant
systems. This allows us to definitively determine how RPA functions as part of a protein complex with UNG2,
and complementary studies examine the effects of weakening their association. Specifically, Aim 1 uses
purified RPA and UNG2 constructs to examine the activity of the proteins alone or as part of a complex.
Binding and enzymatic experiments using synthetic DNA substrates will determine the structural nature of their
substrates in vivo. We focus specifically on the action of RPA and UNG2 at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions, their
known substrates, by preparing uracilated fork-like DNA structures that resemble replication forks found in the
nucleus. Aim 2 examines the RPA-UNG2 protein complex in human colorectal cells under conditions of uracil
stress that are induced by commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. The strength of RPA’s interaction with
UNG2 will be controlled and correlated with UNG2’s uracil excision efficiency at the replication fork. Finally,
additional cellular proteins that associate with RPA and UNG2 will be identified. The function of these proteins
will be examined in the context of multi-protein complexes that form during uracil base excision repair. The
targeted scope of this project examining RPA in base excision repair will facilitate our methodological
development, which will be widely adaptable for examining RPA-containing protein complexes in other DNA
repair processes."

11099531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical Need: Sarcopenia and frailty represent significant and growing clinical challenges whose rates increase
with age, and place patients at risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance exercises are
strongly recommended in this age group to promote muscle regeneration and strength and are routinely a part
of evidence-based home exercise programs prescribed by physical therapists. If conducted as advised, patients
can recover from acute illness, preserve their independence, and reduce their risk of morbidity. Current Clinical
Challenge: A major gap in home exercise programs is a clinician's reliance on self-report diaries or verbal reports
that may be inaccurate or may be subject to recall bias. Remote patient monitoring systems that measure, track,
analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and have the potential to
enhance exercise adherence. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and
clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our product – BandPass – SynchroHealth is
a small business entity that developed a remote monitoring solution to fulfil this market need. BandPass consists
of a remote-sensing, Bluetooth-enabled, resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through
potentiometric and multi-axial sensors, rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance exercise
training. The device is visually similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients.
However, the device has a significantly novel addition of integrating force monitoring while connecting to the
cloud through a patient app. A mobile app and a clinician cloud-based platform will provide computational
resources for data visualization, storage, and analysis. This will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring
of patient compliance and progress, and will serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic
exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and
mobile device). Specific Objectives: We propose to commercialize the custom design electronics and housing
for BandPass and perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability.
BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform for its data transmission, storage, and
analysis. We will collect data on correct and incorrect usage of BandPass to drive classification algorithms that
will facilitate automatic guidance to patients in completing effective exercise programs. Then, we will conduct a
user-centered design study to examine how to communicate data to patients and clinicians. Finally, we will
deploy BandPass in a pilot study to show initial efficacy at home. Future Directions: SynchroHealth's vision is
to develop a mobile health, user-friendly platform using internet-connected devices to improve the quality of life
and physical function of older adults. At the end of Phase II, we will have demonstrated BandPass' functionality
by providing evidence that it can be deployed at home. This will position us for commercial success by preparing
this Class II exempt medical device for marketing, production, and execution of commercial engagements."
11099654,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Metalloproteins containing Mn and Fe in a redox-active role are involved in a variety of physiologically
important reactions of dioxygen metabolism and activation. Perhaps the most complex is the Mn4CaO5 cluster
that is involved in the oxidation of water to dioxygen in photosystem II (PS II), a multi-subunit membrane protein
complex. The water-oxidation reaction in PS II involves removal of four electrons from two water molecules, in a
stepwise manner by light-induced oxidation, to produce a molecule of oxygen. PS II and the Mn4CaO5 cluster
generate almost all of the dioxygen that supports aerobic life, and it is abundant in the atmosphere because of
its constant regeneration by the oxidation of water. The light-induced oxidation of water to dioxygen is one of the
most important chemical processes occurring on such a large scale in the biosphere.
 Although the structure of PS II and the chemistry at the catalytic site have been studied intensively,
understanding the sequence in the chemistry at atomic-scale from light absorption to water-oxidation requires a
new approach beyond the conventional steady state X-ray crystallography and X-ray spectroscopy at cryogenic
temperatures. Following the dynamic changes in the structure of PS II and the Mn4CaO5 cluster at ambient
conditions at physiological temperatures, while overcoming the severe X-ray damage to the redox active center
is key for deriving the mechanism. The very intense, ultra-short femtosecond (fs) X-ray pulses from a X-ray free
electron laser (XFEL) provide an opportunity to overcome the current limitations in room temperature data
collection for biological samples at traditional X-ray sources. The fs X-ray pulses allow us to acquire the signal
before the sample is destroyed, thus making the light-induced snapshot study possible.
 The objective of this proposal is to study the protein structure and dynamics of PS II with X-ray diffraction, as
well as the chemical structure and changes in the Mn4CaO5 cluster (charge and spin density, and covalency)
with X-ray spectroscopy during the light-driven process of PS II. We will use the XFEL facilities at Stanford and
elsewhere to collect X-ray diffraction and emission spectra simultaneously, and X-ray absorption spectra of the
Mn cluster in its native and intermediates states at room temperature in a time-resolved manner, to capture
short-lived intermediates and the step that includes the O-O bond formation. We have also started studying the
chemistry of other Mn/Fe/Ni containing metalloenzymes of importance such as methane monooxgygenase,
ribonucleotide reductase, isopenicillin N synthase and other related enzymes.
 These studies have the potential to provide an unprecedented combination of correlated data between the
proteins and the metal co-factors, providing the geometric and electronic structure and the changes that occur
during the catalytic cycle, all of which are necessary for a complete understanding of the mechanism of the
enzymatic reactions."
11100721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Converging evidence indicates that neuronal and network hyperexcitability is an important early event in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The cellular and molecular basis of this hyperexcitability is a critical area of
investigation and the presence of similar hyperexcitability in animal models enables studies to dissect
underlying mechanisms. A key insight is that hyperexcitability in both AD patients and mouse models has a
strong diurnal rhythm. Emerging data also indicate that neural excitability in the forebrain is normally under
control of the circadian clock, which regulates seizure thresholds and susceptibility to epileptiform activity.
Circadian variation in cellular function is driven by transcriptional molecular clocks expressed in most cells, and
molecular clock ablation increases AD pathology. We have compelling preliminary evidence for rhythmic
variation in neuronal excitability that is at least partly due to circadian regulation of the membrane properties of
inhibitory interneurons, especially fast-spiking cells expressing parvalbumin (PV). Given that PV+ interneurons
in the cortex and dentate gyrus are strongly implicated in AD, and that circadian rhythms are disrupted in AD
patients and AD mouse models, we propose rigorous experiments to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of
the molecular clock and resulting changes in PV+ interneuron gene expression and activity contribute to AD-
related neuronal hyperexcitability. Specifically, we will evaluate the differences in circadian clock and clock-
controlled gene expression in PV+ interneurons vs. excitatory neurons in the mouse models of AD, using a
combination of RNA sequencing, state-of-the-art bioinformatics, and recently developed tools to evaluate
molecular clock rhythmicity and transcription in a cell-specific manner (Aim 1). We will record from inhibitory
and excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus and cortex to determine if clock-driven changes in PV+ inhibitory
neuron activity are disrupted in AD models and contribute to overall hyperexcitability (Aim 2). Finally, we will
utilize an innovative chemogenetic chronotherapeutic approach to manipulate PV+ interneuron physiology to
determine whether reinstating the normal circadian patterns of PV+ interneuron activity in AD mice protects
against hyperexcitability, cognitive impairment, and pathology (Aim 3). The proposed studies led by a strong
interdisciplinary team use powerful approaches to determine how disruption of circadian rhythms facilitates
neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to early stages of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may
catalyze development of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions."
11100046,"The applicant seeks this K99/R00 award to achieve research independence in intervention science, with a focus
on using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to reduce the negative psychological and
behavioral sequela that result from stigma. Transgender (trans) women are at high risk for HIV and substance
misuse due in part to elevations in three interrelated areas underpinned by stigma: internalized stigma,
psychological distress, and healthcare avoidance. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) improves
internalized stigma, psychological distress, and treatment engagement and may thereby reduce substance
misuse and HIV risk. However, the effects of a gender affirming ACT intervention on internalized stigma,
psychological distress, healthcare avoidance, and subsequent substance misuse and HIV risk among trans
women are unknown. Peer-led interventions are essential to decrease trans women’s sense of isolation, share
skills for coping with daily sources of stigma, and encourage pride in one’s gender identity. ACT is a promising
evidence-based intervention for peer delivery as ACT has been effectively delivered by non-therapists before.
The applicant thus proposes to adapt ACT to create a gender-affirming wellness intervention (ACT+GA) that
targets substance misuse and HIV risk among trans women (K99 phase), conduct an open pilot trial of ACT+GA
(K99 phase), and then run a rigorous test of its effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility (R00
phase). During the K99 phase, she will collaborate with her mentorship team and the assembled community-
advisory board to develop the ACT+GA manual based on focus group (k = 4-6, n = 4-6 trans women/group) and
stakeholder feedback (n = 10-15 treatment providers, organizational leaders, and peer staff), and then address
any necessary refinements identified during open pilot testing (n = 10 trans women). During the R00 phase, trans
women will be randomly assigned to ACT+GA (n = 62) or treatment-as-usual (n = 62). Internalized stigma,
psychological distress, healthcare avoidance, substance use, and HIV risk will be assessed at baseline, post-
intervention, and at three and six-month follow-up. The coordinated training plan will allow the applicant to build
on her strong foundation in CBPR and scholarship of HIV disparities in sexual and gender minoritized (SGM)
populations, developing new skills in three areas critical to her independence: (1) adaptation of ACT for telehealth
delivery by trans women, (2) early phase behavioral intervention development and testing, (3) depth of learning
and application of qualitative and longitudinal quantitative methods. During the K99 Phase, her mentorship team
will draw on its sustained track record in mentoring junior scholars to full independence. This will be accomplished
through regular meetings, directed readings, hands-on tutorials, and support of her activity in workshops,
seminars, and conferences. Completion of the R00 phase will generate data to support a future R01 application
to test the effectiveness and implementation of ACT+GA on a larger scale. The K99/R00 award will thus provide
the applicant with a platform to launch her independent career in transgender health and intervention science."

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, essential for cellular electrical activity, are generated by tetramers of
pore-forming α subunits, often in complexes with other, non-pore-forming β subunits and other protein classes.
Sodium-coupled solute transporters provide a mechanism for transport of water-soluble ions,
neurotransmitters, vitamins, sugars and other small molecules across cell membranes and against the
electrochemical gradient. In prior award cycles we discovered that Kv channels form physical complexes with
sodium-coupled solute transporters and we defined multiple modes of co-regulation in these “chansporter”
complexes, establishing a new class of cellular signaling hub. Concomitant with this work, we discovered a
range of novel small-molecule modulators of Kv channels and chansporter complexes, including synthetic
compounds and plant metabolites, some with therapeutic potential. In this latest cycle, we propose to pursue
both these fields of study, focusing primarily on the Kv1 (KCNA) and Kv7 (KCNQ) Kv channel families,
disruption of which causes disorders as diverse as ataxia, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, achlorhydria,
hypothyroidism, and epilepsy, and the transporters with which they interact. We will build on our prior work and
preliminary data that include novel chansporter complexes, novel modes of Kv channel chemosensing in
chansporter complexes, and screening results revealing abundant new Kv channel modulators from plants. We
have established two new, unpublished transgenic rodent lines for this project that will facilitate study of new
therapeutic approaches to treat Episodic Ataxia 1 (EA1) (a mouse model), and of the precise roles in vivo of
KCNQ5 and KCNQ5-transporter complexes (a Kcnq5 knockout rat line). We use a highly integrated approach
to investigate the molecular mechanistic bases for channel and chansporter biology and pathophysiology,
drawing from our long experience in studying molecular basis of biology and disease in multiple tissues,
cellular electrophysiology, transport and radioligand assays, transcriptomics, various imaging modalities,
structure-function studies, and biochemical techniques. In the next five years, we aim to address several
critical knowledge gaps, pursuing the following novel research directions: (1) Molecular mechanistic studies of
new and known channel-transporter complexes to dissect novel forms of co-regulation and signaling; (2)
Channel/transporter-active small molecule discovery from plants, drawing from our completed dual-target
screen of 1444 plant extracts; (3) elucidation of novel roles for KCNQ5 in the vasculature and brain; (4) in vivo
testing of the first compounds known to directly rescue EA1-linked Kv1.1 sequence variants. Our overarching
goals are to uncover new chansporter complexes and their roles in vivo, enhance understanding of Kv channel
biology, and discover novel and therapeutically relevant channel/transporter-targeted small molecules. This
supplement application is for the purchase of an automated patch clamp rig to greatly speed, enhance

I am interested in the molecular biology and genetics of microbial social interactions. We use the
saprophyte and opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model to study social
behaviors. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling system called quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate
gene expression. Because gene expression is coordinated at the population level, QS in P. aeruginosa,
and other bacteria, is a means by which these single-celled organisms can cooperate and engage in
specific group activities.
In our prior NIGMS funded work, we established an experimental evolution system in which we
demonstrated that P. aeruginosa QS can circuits diversify in response to changing environments. We
also developed microbial co-culture systems, which allow us to ask about interspecies competition and
how QS might impact interspecies interactions. The thrusts in this application ask 1) in cooperating
populations of bacteria, what is the genetic basis for the diversification of the QS circuity, and does this
diversification result in a division of labor where different individuals contribute separate functions to the
group? and 2) how do the interactions between P. aeruginosa and other microbes influence P.
aeruginosa behaviors, and how does QS contribute to these interactions?
Bacteria, because of their rapid generation time and large population sizes, allow us to ask questions
about social behavior that are not possible in organisms with smaller populations or longer generation
times. The questions asked in this proposal will advance our knowledge of P. aeruginosa QS,
cooperative behaviors in populations and interspecies interactions, and will inform efforts to target P.
aeruginosa QS as a therapeutic approach."
11091407,"Background: Thiamine deficiency (TD) causes a variety of thiamine deficiency disorders (TDDs) such as
neuropsychiatric disturbances, polyneuropathy, ataxia, weakness and falling, and non-ischemic heart failure.
Left untreated, TD can be associated with poor quality of life, loss of independence, and inability to complete
activities of daily living. The prevalence of TD in non-alcohol using hospitalized Veterans is not known but is
probably much higher than the general population. Loss of functional ability leads to increased need for
rehabilitation.
The objective of this proposal is to measure the prevalence of TDDs in Veterans who do not use excess
alcohol who are ill enough to require hospitalization, determine if inflammation increases the risk of developing
TD, and determine the optimal cutoff points for two biomarkers of TD to diagnose of TDDs. The central
hypothesis is that TD prevalence is as high as 25% in hospitalized non-alcoholic Veterans, far greater than
the historically reported prevalence of 3% or less, and that TDD’s occur in the “low normal” range of current
cutoff values for available thiamine bioassays. A secondary hypothesis is that inflammatory conditions, which
are known to cause cachexia and malnutrition, put hospitalized Veterans at increased risk as they often
present with acute inflammatory conditions. The rationale underlying this proposal is that hospital practitioners
currently underdiagnose and undertreat TDDs which leads to continued morbidity and loss of function. If our
hypothesis is correct that the prevalence is as high as 25%, this knowledge will increase awareness of the
problem and lead practitioners to diagnose and treat them more often. In addition, clarifying the “abnormally
low” biomarker cutoff levels by measuring them in Veterans with TDDs is very important as the current
“normal” ranges were determined in healthy volunteers. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three
specific aims: 1) determine the prevalence of TD, as defined by whole blood and plasma thiamine levels
together with symptom responsive disease in consecutively hospitalized medicine patients who do not use
excessive alcohol; 2) define TDDs as cases with low or “low normal” thiamine levels and symptoms that
improve with thiamine replenishment; 3) determine if acute and chronic inflammatory conditions with elevated
biomarkers of inflammation increase the risk of developing TDD. We expect to find the prevalence of TD is
closer to 25% and that the low end of “normal” biomarker levels as published by reference laboratories is too
low, missing a percentage of TDDs.
Research design: To accomplish these aims, we will utilize a prospective cohort study design to determine
the prevalence of TD in consecutively hospitalized non-alcoholic medicine patients, as defined by low or “low
normal” thiamine biomarker levels and thiamine responsive symptoms. Nested within this we will conduct an
open label treatment study with those exhibiting symptoms and define TDDs as cases with low or “low normal”
thiamine levels and symptoms of TD that improve with thiamine administration. Lastly, utilizing a nested case
control study design with cases being those with a TDD and controls being asymptomatic Veterans with normal
biomarkers, determine if acute and chronic inflammatory conditions with elevated biomarkers of inflammation
increase the risk of developing TDDs.
Impact to the VA mission: Determining the prevalence of TDDs in Veterans who don’t use excessive alcohol
and require hospital admission will increase awareness of these conditions and improve the rate of diagnosis
and treatment to mitigate the consequences. This would address some Veterans who experience persistent
loss of function after the primary condition has been treated leading to improved quality of life, independence,
and function. This could also reduce the cost of care by improving their response to rehabilitation efforts."
11091408,"Military traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex, often involving both diffuse and multi-focal components, and/or
repetitive TBI. While the high incidence of epilepsy following TBI in Veterans is well known, PTE is often resistant
to standard anti-epileptic therapeutics. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the transition from trauma to
injury are unclear, making new treatment development challenging. However, the long gestation period between
injury and seizure development (epileptogenesis) make this process an attractive target for intervention. Due to
the key role of network localization of hyperexcitability in epileptogenesis, we propose that a large animal model
(pig) with a gyrencephalic brain and complex white matter pathways may be the only way to model these injury
phenotypes and epileptogenesis accurately. We will therefore utilize our large animal pre-clinical model of brain
injury induced epileptogenesis in order to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to the transition to
PTE, and investigate whether repetitive TBI can also induce these network states. Early epileptiform activity,
blood biomarkers of axonal and glial pathology, and white matter imaging will be utilized to assess their predictive
value for prognosis and risk stratification. This unique combination of large animal TBI models,
electrophysiology, neuropathology and biomarkers will allow us to address the fundamental mechanisms of
epileptogenesis following trauma as well as develop predictive models of PTE development. Our analyses will
allow for greater understanding of the pathological and neurophysiological mechanisms whereby trauma leads
to epilepsy. In addition, an understanding of the effects of this progression on waking behavior and mechanisms
underlying sleep disruption are important questions for treating Veterans with PTE related chronic dysfunction.
We will therefore characterize and validate a PTE model of controlled cortical impact injury and compare with
diffuse, repetitive injury. We will also examine the progression of sleep and behavioral dysfunction associated
with TBI induced epileptogenesis, and compare biomarkers for PTE (blood, sleep, neuroimaging, early
electrophysiology) with electrophysiological outcomes to develop predictors of PTE development in the VA
population. We will also correlate chronic post-mortem neuropathology with electrographic characterization and
behavioral outcomes in order to develop mechanistic understanding of progression for future treatment
development. In order to carry out these goals, we will compare a focal injury model (CCI) with the repetitive,
sagittal injury in order to assess the long-term development of PTE and hyperexcitability. We will chronically
implant pigs following injury with cortical and hippocampal electrodes, and characterize epileptogenesis and
seizure progression over 9 months to 1 year. Pigs will be monitored chronically using video-EEG and will be
assessed for progression of epileptogenesis and development of partial and generalized epilepsy using a
combination of expert assessment and seizure detection algorithms using established procedures in the
laboratory. We will collect blood serum, sleep data, imaging, and electrophysiology for these animals during this
time course. In addition, pigs will be assessed for neurological and behavioral deficits using a hole-board task
that we have developed in our laboratory. These are established procedures in the laboratory, and the CCI
injury has led to PTE in a number. Pigs will be monitored up to a year post injury and will be assessed for
progression of epileptogenesis and development of partial and generalized epilepsy using a combination of
expert assessment and seizure detection algorithms. Post-mortem neuropathology will be performed in order to
compare the chronic neurodegeneration and hippocampal neuropathology with the outcomes of the
electrophysiology, as well as the blood biomarkers. This proposal will therefore compare PTE outcomes in two
large animal TBI models (focal and repetitive mTBI), leading to a translational platform for mechanistic
investigation and therapeutic development in order to benefit those Veterans suffering from PTE, and to develop
prognostic markers for those with TBI yet to develop PTE."
11095009,"Project Summary
 The pluripotent potential of a cell is generally assumed to be a product of its nucleus, regulated by gene
expression and chromatin state. This view informs most approaches to drug discovery, where an ideal
therapeutic would target nuclear processes to induce pluripotency and proliferation to heal a wound or inhibit
pluripotency and proliferation in cancer. Often overlooked are somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments that
definitively show cellular potential is also a product of the cytoplasm, specifically, the cytoplasm of germ cells.
The long-term objectives of this research are to understand how cellular pluripotency and regenerative capacity
are retained in germ cells through their specialized cytoplasm. We expect these findings to inform and expand
approaches to drug discovery and lead to therapeutics that function by targeting the cytoplasmic milieu.
 Cytoplasmic processes unique to germ cells often occur in protein/RNA assemblies that reside on or near
the nuclear periphery. These assemblies are collectively called germ granules. Because core germ-granule
composition is conserved from nematodes to humans, we can use C. elegans nematodes to visualize germ
granules in vivo and to expedite studies into their function. Mutations that displace or severely disrupt germ
granules in C. elegans cause sterility and germline-to-somatic reprogramming. In this proposal, we look at the
earliest events of somatic reprogramming to determine how processes within germ granules antagonize this fate.
We investigate the contribution of glycine-rich repeat motifs to the specialized germ-granule microenvironment.
We then describe two novel interactions with a core germ-granule protein called GLH-1 (DDX4 in humans).
Lastly, we follow up on another core germ-granule protein that we named LOTR-1 (TDRD5/7 in humans) and its
LOTUS-domain-dependent interaction with a 3’UTR binding complex. Together, these findings will provide an
understanding of cytoplasmic processes within germ granules that ensure the pluripotent potential of germ cells.
 The parent grant proposed the creation of numerous new C. elegans and bacterial lines, along with the
maintenance of existing C. elegans strains and bacterial RNAi libraries. Currently, these reagents are stored in
a -80°C ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezer, which we inherited when we established our lab in 2012. We
estimate this freezer to be over 15 years old and approaching the end of its useful life. The administrative
supplement will replace the aging freezer with a modern, energy-efficient model, ensuring the continued
preservation of our strains, nucleic acids, protein samples, and other reagents necessary for required resource
sharing and the continuation of the experiments outlined in the parent grant."

Advancing racial equity in the U.S. starts by collecting valid and reliable data on structural racism. Structural
racism represents the totality of ways in which multiple systems and institutions interact to assert racist
policies, practices, and beliefs about people in a marginalized group. The patterns and practices of structural
racism, such as inequitable distribution of health care treatment and health-promoting resources, create and
perpetuate health disparities. To date, measures of structural racism have been limited in a number of ways:
First, our preliminary data revealed that Blacks and Whites interpret social indicators collected at the individual
level differently for reasons other than those intended by the measure. That difference indicates a bias
operationalized by the lack of measurement invariance (or equivalence). Second, existing measures are overly
focused on a single population—Blacks—and overlook the Hispanic/Latino population, which is expected to be
21% of the U.S. population by 2030. Third, current indices based on individual- and societal-level variables
capture limited domains and lack indicators from the economic sector, which is indispensable to measuring
structural racism. The wealth gap across race and ethnic groups is directly related to structural racism and its
downstream causal effects on health. According to leading social epidemiologist Dr. Nancy Krieger, “you can't
understand the system of racial injustice without understanding how it ties to economic injustice”
(2022). To identify effective interventions to reduce structural racism, there is an urgent public health need to
capture the complex nature and impacts of structural racism in a multicultural and multiracial society. Our
overall objective is to develop an intersectional, comprehensive, multilevel, and multidimensional Structural
Racism Measure that has measurement invariance and is valid for both Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. We use
modern psychometric techniques and incorporate economic indicators that better capture social disadvantage.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Incorporate novel data sources that comprise economic indicators to assess
ecological-level determinants of health disparities; 2) Create an item bank from existing discrimination
measures and items of economic discrimination practices with measurement invariance across Blacks and
Hispanics/Latinos; and 3) Test the validity of the new Structural Racism Measure with a diverse sample of
Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. At the completion of the proposed research, the expected outcome will be a
theory-driven, culturally- and racially-relevant, and psychometrically sound measure available to the public to
assess structural racism. The overall positive impact of the tool will be its use in research settings to find
effective interventions to reduce racial health inequities."

 The overall goals of this research proposal are to define specific pathways of sphingolipid metabolism,
define specific roles, define mechanisms, and help place the field of bioactive lipids on solid mechanistic
grounds. Based on strong ongoing data, we propose the overall hypothesis that individual enzymes of
ceramide metabolism serve as transducers of specific inputs, and the product bioactive sphingolipids function
to mediate key responses. This proposal will develop this paradigm in the case of the DNA damage response
and other stimuli activating mammalian and yeast neutral sphingomyelinases in distinct compartments leading
to formation of compartmentalized and species-specific ceramides. We propose the following major goals: 1.
Advance our understanding of structure and activation of nSMase2; 2. Develop tools and approaches
to probe compartment-specific functions of bioactive sphingolipids and neutral sphingomyelinases; 3.
Define functions and mechanisms of neutral sphingomyelinases in the nucleus, especially in the DNA
Damage Response; and 4. Define mechanisms of regulation of protein phosphatases by ceramides. Taken
together, we endeavor to advance our understanding of bioactive sphingolipids and reduce the complexities of
the field to manageable and specific components that promise to shed important light on how these specific
pathways function, and their specific roles in stress responses. The ongoing results are defining totally
unexpected roles for neutral sphingomyelinases in distinct compartments, including the eukaryotic DNA
damage response through a nuclear lipid-mediated pathway. These are critical towards the understanding of
human disease (cancer) and therapeutics."
11099155,"Molecular mechanisms of intersecting human telomeric functions
Project Summary/Abstract
Telomeres perform three essential functions in human cells. First, telomeres protect chromosomes against
catastrophic end-to-end fusions by shielding them from the DNA damage sensing pathways. A six-membered
protein complex called shelterin binds specifically to telomeric DNA to afford end protection. Second, telomeres
facilitate end replication, allowing proliferating cells like stem/progenitor cells and cancer cells to replenish
chromosome ends. A complex ribonucleoprotein enzyme called telomerase helps solve end replication.
Telomerase facilitates end replication by adding telomeric DNA to chromosome ends using its RNA template.
While telomerase activation in somatic cells is a hallmark of cancer, telomerase dysfunction in stem cells
results in diseases called telomeropathies. Shelterin must protect chromosome ends from illicit DNA fusions
but allow telomerase to access the same ends. A shelterin protein called TPP1 is instrumental in recruiting
telomerase to telomeres, allowing shelterin to facilitate end protection and end replication, but the molecular
mechanism of how TPP1 switches from end-protection mode to end-replication mode during S-phase is not
known. Third, telomeres help homologous chromosomes undergo pairing and meiotic crossover to facilitate
gamete production. To perform this function, telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope with the help of a
meiosis-specific protein complex called TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN and connect with the cytoskeletal force-
generating machinery. This allows chromosomes to move, enabling homologous chromosomes to pair up and
undergo meiotic crossover. Paired meiotic chromosomes must be protected from telomeric recombination at
the nuclear envelope, but how this occurs is not known at the molecular level. Illuminating the molecular
interplay between the three telomeric functions will enrich our understanding of how genome integrity is upheld
and suggest novel therapeutic avenues for diseases like cancers, telomeropathies, and infertility. This proposal
aims to apply the knowledge of telomeres, telomerase, and meiotic assemblies, and expertise in biochemistry,
crystallography, and cell biology to understand how human telomeres perform their three critical functions,
especially in the contexts where these clash with one another. It also aims to discover new factors responsible
for upholding these functions and reveal their underlying biochemical activities. Finally, this proposal aims to
dissect the molecular mechanism of disease caused by the disruption of these functions and test new
strategies for therapeutic development. The proposed approach to dissect the molecular mechanisms of
intersecting telomeric processes will enhance our knowledge of how telomeres enable genome integrity and
suggest therapeutic opportunities to tackle telomere dysfunction in disease."
11099164,"Unanticipated adverse drug reactions remain a major cause of post marketing withdrawals of drugs and of
restricted access to new medications. Adverse drug reactions are often caused by reactive metabolites that form
covalent adducts with proteins, but the identity and extent of protein adducts formed is often difficult to predict
and characterize. Despite decades of research, current methods are unable to produce a comprehensive and
quantitative catalog of xenobiotic protein adducts. This hinders progress in optimizing safety of novel medications
and limits our ability to define mechanisms of clinically observed adverse drug reactions. To bridge this gap, we
have developed innovative proteomic methods for discovery, characterization and quantification of protein
adducts in simple and complex biological matrices. The goal of this proposal is to establish these methods for
rapid, reliable and quantitative identification and characterization of drug-protein adducts, and uniquely
customize these methods for human adductomics research impacting drug safety assessment. We will focus on
covalent protein modifications resulting from metabolic oxidative activation of drugs. We will use a set of model
compounds that are known to cause adverse events in patients and form reactive metabolites that likely result
in protein adducts. In our aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that the modification masses and chemical
characteristics of protein adducts formed by reactive metabolites in recombinant enzyme systems predict adduct
formation in more complex systems such as liver microsomes and S9 fractions. Through this work we will
optimize our proteomics methods for complex human liver preparations from individual donors. In aim 2 we will
test the hypothesis that adduct formation varies quantitatively between individuals and due to differences in
metabolic activity and individual genotype. In this aim we will establish quantitative adductomics for individual
donors and define the basis for inter-individual variability in drug-protein adduct formation. In aim 3 we will test
the hypothesis that human hepatocytes exposed to reactive metabolites generated in situ secrete proteins that
have been adducted by the reactive intermediates. In this aim we will establish the in vitro relationship between
hepatocyte adductomic burden and secretion of adducted proteins as biomarkers. When completed, the
proposed studies will be transformative in integrating novel suite of cutting-edge tools and high-dimensional
proteomics data to characterize the deep adductomic profiles of key drugs resulting in adverse drug
reactions. The methods developed will enable the assessment and quantification of a broad range of adducts
across the human proteome. The results will generate unprecedented insight into mechanisms of enzyme
inactivation, liver adductomes formed after exposure to reactive metabolites and quantitative relationships
between adduct formation and metabolic activity in the liver. The results may ultimately lead to novel drug
discovery approaches that mitigate risk of adverse drug reactions resulting from adduct formation and to
development of targeted therapeutic interventions designed to treat adverse drug reactions."
11099158,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Vimentin intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton play an underappreciated physiological role in
epithelial tissue development, repair, and tumor progression. In particular, vimentin knockout impairs
mouse mammary gland development and regeneration in vivo, and disrupts 2D collective cell migration in vitro.
Gain of vimentin is also associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where tightly-connected
epithelial cells downregulate cell-cell adhesions and increase motility. For instance, “leader cells” at wound
fronts can exhibit an elongated morphology with vimentin, while remaining partially connected to migratory
followers. Indeed, a combination of vimentin and keratin 14 are associated with partial EMT states in
genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. Nevertheless, the functional role of vimentin in multicellular
migration, tractions, and coordination remains poorly understood, particularly in 3D matrix.
 Our long-term goal is to elucidate how the mechanobiology of the cytoskeleton regulates collective
migration in organ formation, tissue repair, and disease. This goal requires addressing several fundamental
questions: 1) How does vimentin affect directed migration and cellular deformability? 2) How does vimentin
affect collective tractions? 3) How does vimentin affect cell-cell adhesions and collective migration? 4) How do
vimentin-high and vimentin-low cells interact during collective migration? Based on these challenges, our
objective is to elucidate the role of vimentin in collective migration through directed cell motility, multicellular
tractions, as well as cell-cell coordination.
 Our approach will integrate several complementary technologies for precision measurement of collective
cell migration and mechanobiology. MPI: Guo is an Early Stage Investigator with extensive expertise in the
mechanics of soft and living materials, including vimentin networks and extracellular matrix. MPI: Wong is a
New Investigator with extensive expertise in collective migration and EMT, particularly single cell tracking and
analyses. Co-I: Goldman is a leader in the molecular biology of vimentin. This proposal is structured around 3
aims: elucidate how vimentin affects cell shape, migration and deformability of multicellular collectives in
confinement (AIM 1), multicellular tractions in 3D matrix (AIM 2), and collective interactions of “mosaic”
spheroids with heterogeneous vimentin expression (AIM 3). Overall, this work will reveal new fundamental
insights into the role of vimentin in cell shape, motility, and mechanical integrity."

Parent U01 Project Summary and Abstract for the SEAL (Stopping Eczema and ALlergy) Study
Food allergy (FA) is an epidemic among children in the U.S., U.K., and other countries. There is increasing
evidence that epicutaneous allergen sensitization through a dysfunctional skin barrier results in allergic
responses whereas early consumption of food allergens induces oral tolerance, as described by the dual
allergen exposure hypothesis. In the Learning Early About Peanut LEAP and Enquiring About Tolerance
(EAT) studies, dry skin and the severity and the duration of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) in the 1st year
of life were predictors of peanut allergy (PA) and sensitization. In the SEAL study, we aim to intervene very
early in a high-risk infant group, as soon they have the earliest onset of dry skin or eczema in the 1st 10
weeks of life, but before they have developed allergies. By reducing the duration and severity of eczema
and preventing eczema exacerbations, we aim to prevent epicutaneous allergen sensitization and
significantly reduce the incidence of FA. Our primary objective is to test if the combination of trilipid skin
emollient use early in life with proactive topical steroids decreases the prevalence of FA compared to
controls. We propose a randomized (1:1), controlled trial design for infants with dry skin or eczema (n=750
total) to compare the effect of proactive treatment against a reactive treatment group for the prevention of
FA, by reducing dry skin, and the severity and duration of eczema in early infancy. We will test our
hypothesis with the following specific aims using world-class clinical research units known for excellent
recruitment and retention of patient cohorts, mechanistic testing, and state of the art research. Specific
Aim 1: To determine if proactive versus reactive treatment will reduce the occurrence of FA in a
prospective, randomized, and controlled intervention trial of infants with eczema. Specific Aim 2: To test
whether the skin of children in the proactive treatment will show improved epithelial barrier markers with
increased commensal bacteria colonization. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether proactive treatment will
be associated with protective immune responses. If the aims are achieved, our proposal will make a clinical
impact by providing a new, clinical strategy to prevent the occurrence of FA in young infants that present
with the earliest signs of dry skin or eczema.

We propose purchasing a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system to place
in-line with an existing multi-angle laser light scattering instrument in the Harms lab. This will
allow us to precisely characterize the oligomeric states of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and its
associated proteins. The overall goal of the funded parent project is to dissect the evolution of
the TLR4 protein complexes over the last 400 million years. TLR4 is an important driver for
inflammation in both healthy contexts (e.g, response to infection, wound healing) and
pathological cancers (e.g., chronic inflammation, cancer). It interacts with multiple protein
partners as part of these functions, including MD-2, CD14, and S100A9. To understand the
evolution and mechanism by which the TLR4 complex has its effects, we need sharp tools to
dissect the interactions between these proteins.
All three aims of the parent project will benefit from the requested instrumentation. The first
two aims require understanding how TLR4 binds to different agonist molecules and
oligomerizes in response; the third aim looks the evolution of the key support molecule CD14,
which directly binds TLR4. The ability to directly measure protein-protein interactions and
oligomerization is critical to achieving these aims."

The ovary and its functional unit, the follicles, are critical for the secretion of sex steroids and peptide hormones
as well as the maturation and release of oocytes for ovulation and fertilization. Increasing evidence has revealed
that a wide spectrum of environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals cause ovarian toxicity (ovotoxicity) and
heighten the risk of premature ovarian failure, hormonal imbalance, and infertility in both reproductive aged
women and prepubertal girls. With over 85,000 chemicals used in consumer products as well as emerging
contaminants such as harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins, there are few means to screen for potential toxicity to
the ovaries. We have previously developed an ovary-on-a-chip (OvaryChip) that maintains the 3D architecture
of follicles and produces human menstrual cycle-like follicle development, hormone secretion, oocyte maturation,
ovulation, and luteinization. Yet, one remaining challenge of this innovative model is the critical need to
accelerate throughput. The central hypothesis of this research is that in vitro microfluidic follicular
cultures can be used to identify novel mechanisms of ovarian toxicity for environmental toxicants. In
Aim 1, we will integrate follicle vitrification, 3D in vitro follicle growth, and a new OvaryChip with high-content
culture and imaging to develop a high-throughput ovotoxicity testing of growing follicles. In Aim 2, we will develop
a new OvaryChip for ovotoxicity testing of primordial follicles by using triple transgenic mouse ovarian explants.
In Aim 3, we will develop a liver-ovary-on-a-chip to incorporate liver metabolism into ovotoxicity testing. In these
studies, we will assess follicle and oocyte reproductive outcomes at morphological, functional, and molecular
levels for 1) chemicals with known ovotoxicities (validation studies) and 2) novel HAB toxins alone and in mixtures.
These studies are critically significant because the OvaryChip models will (1) translate a bench assay for a single
compound into a robust high-throughput ovotoxicity screening platform; (2) reveal novel insight into chemical-
induced ovotoxicity (stage- and metabolite-dependent mechanisms); (3) minimize the cost and use of whole
animals; and (4) prioritize chemicals of high ovotoxicity concern, including HAB toxins, for further risk assessment."
11100087,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent recognition of the prevalence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in biology and human diseases
has challenged the traditional paradigm that stable structure is required for protein function. Furthermore, many
IDPs have been found to remain disordered even in specific complexes and functional assemblies. These
discoveries have now dramatically expanded the meaning of “structure” in the protein structure-function
paradigm, to include a continuum from disordered ensembles to well-defined conformations. Importantly, these
disordered proteins and dynamic interactions are central components of the regulatory networks that dictate
virtually all aspects of cell decision-making. They are associated with a growing number of human diseases
including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and heart diseases. There is thus a crucial need to
establish the molecular basis of how conformational disorder mediates protein function, so as to understand how
these functional mechanisms may be perturbed in diseases, or rescued by drug molecules for therapeutics. The
key challenge towards achieving these overarching goals is quantitative description of the disordered protein
states in relevant biological and disease contexts. Experimental measurements of averaged structural properties
alone are inadequate to define the disordered protein ensemble, and reliable molecular simulations have a
crucial and transformative role to play. This project aims to continue to develop advanced molecular modeling
and simulation methodologies that can provide accurate description of disordered protein states, expand the
accessible time and length scales, and enhance our ability to embrace critical questions in molecular level
biomedical research. Through strategically chosen experimental collaborations, this project will further tackle
questions and problems centered around several systems of great biomedical significance: 1) To establish the
sequence-structure-function-disease relationship of IDPs, we will determine how multisite phosphorylation and
cancer-associated mutations modulate the structure, dynamics and interactions of the transactivation domain
(TAD) of tumor suppressor p53; 2) To understand dynamic protein-protein interactions in relevant contexts, we
will determine the molecular basis of how molecular chaperone Hsp70 achieves selective promiscuity to help
the cell cope with protein folding challenge and how a novel family of virulence protein named SPIN from S.
aureus inhibits human myeloperoxidase for evading the host innate immune defense. 3) To develop effective
strategies for targeting disordered protein states, we will determine the molecular basis of how the anti-cancer
drug EGCG inhibits p53-TAD through dynamic interactions and study the functional dynamics and inhibition of
flaviviral proteases. Integrated computational and experimental approaches deployed throughout these studies
will enable us to direct our development efforts to critical areas for which advances are needed in computational
methodologies, while at the same time push and test our methods with tangible feedback.

be for the NIGMS-funded laboratory at the University of Miami School of Medicine of Dr.
Emmanuel Thomas (R35GM124915). Dr. Thomas is requesting funding to cover the cost
of this PCR system. The ultra-sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR instrument would provide
the laboratory with day-today capabilities to obtain large data sets of nucleic acid levels
including DNA and RNA biomarkers of cellular function related to antiviral innate
immunity. The laboratory does not currently have unrestricted access to these analytic
capabilities. Additional investment in the MIRA funded project led by Dr. Thomas, from
the NIGMS, would enable his research group to improve and enhance their cellular
analytic techniques to meet and exceed the stated and emergent research objectives.
Furthermore, since the PI is a relatively new investigators only recently receiving his first
NIH R grants, this additional piece of equipment would additionally support him on his
established trajectory of scientific success. Dr. Thomas received his NIGMS R35 grant
in 2017 with funding starting on September 10, 2017. Given that his lab currently consists
of a laboratory manager, a technician and three graduate students, the original grant
budget was distributed to cover supplies and salaries for the laboratory team that includes
the PI, until July 2028. Therefore, funding from the R35 grant has already been committed
to support the daily activities of the laboratory for the next 4 years. Given these budgetary
restrictions, initially, there were no funds available in the budget to request the purchase
of specialized equipment to support the research objectives of the grant. Importantly,
with the R35 currently providing a solid foundation of funding for daily standard laboratory
activities, there is now an emergent need for increased analytic capabilities to support
the research objectives that are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. In Dr.
Thomas' Laboratory, this PCR system would be specifically used for quantitation of
nucleic acid levels to study the cellular interactions that control host defense to viral

11100340,"Over the past decade, roles for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the biogenesis of select nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial precursors and the degradation of mutant, mis-localized, or non-productively imported proteins
from the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) have begun to emerge. Our interest in this unanticipated, novel
ER-associated mitochondrial biology was serendipitous. In our ongoing efforts to characterize the lipid
substrate trafficking requirements for phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylase 1 (Psd1 in yeast, PISD in
humans), an evolutionarily conserved, integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein that produces
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), it became a priority for us to independently ascertain if a small fraction of wild
type (WT) Psd1 is glycosylated and thus targeted to the endomembrane system, as recently claimed. Our
generated results support the unavoidable conclusion that in yeast, the vast majority, if not all, of functional
Psd1 is mitochondrially localized. However, we did uncover an intimate relationship between Psd1 and the ER:
unlike the WT protein, non-functional forms of Psd1 are dually localized to the ER, where they are
glycosylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded. Given the role of the ER as a staging ground for the efficient
removal of non-functional Psd1, we then asked two questions ― 1) Is Psd1 biogenesis supported by a recently
discovered Djp1-mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Surface Retrieval pathway (ER-SURF)? and 2) Does the
accumulation of ER-associated non-functional Psd1 depend on Msp1, an outer mitochondrial membrane
resident AAA-ATPase known to remove mis-targeted proteins and non-productively imported mitochondrial
precursors from the outer membrane? The resulting answers establish the premise for our proposed aims and
identify Psd1 as an ideal model substrate to define novel mechanisms of ER-SURF and protein degradation
that will undoubtedly apply to other mitochondrial proteins. The goal of Aim 1 is to define the early, pre-
mitochondrial steps of Psd1 biogenesis that are mediated by specific interactions that occur at the ER. Other
than a critical role for the Hsp40 cochaperone, Djp1, virtually nothing is known about ER-SURF. Results from
Aim 1 will provide mechanistic insight about mitochondrial targeting through this novel pathway and whether it
can be coerced in specific contexts to support non-mitochondrial biology. Over the past seven years, it has
become increasingly appreciated that the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors outside of this organelle
activates a range of cellular stress responses. In this context, our discovery that non-functional mutant Psd1
temporarily associates with ER membranes prior to being degraded is particularly exciting. The goal of Aim 2 is
to determine the molecular mechanisms of non-functional Psd1 resolution. Results from Aim 2 will transform
our understanding of how cells cope with mitochondrial precursors that fail to reach their correct destination, an
emerging focus in the field."
11100346,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Transdermal drug delivery has many benefits including ease of product application for patients and more
consistent plasma drug concentrations compared to oral or IV dosing. However, many active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) do not meet the strict physicochemical properties needed to permeate through the
hydrophobic outer skin layer. For APIs that cannot adequately absorb through skin, microneedles (MNs)
temporarily increase skin permeability through formation of epidermal micropores. There are two major routes
of API transport to consider with MN treatment: micropores (a hydrophilic environment), and intact skin around
the micropores (a hydrophobic environment). Effects of API properties and formulation are well understood for
delivery through intact skin, but they need to be systematically considered for MN delivery because of the
introduction of the second parallel transport pathway (micropores). In vivo micropore closure time and human
skin characteristics also impact API delivery with MNs, and these variables cannot be well simulated in vitro. The
long-term goal of this work is to improve API delivery and treatment options for a wide range of health conditions
through development of innovative MN dosage forms. The goal for the next 5 years is to determine significant in
vitro and in vivo factors impacting absorption of small molecule APIs through MN-treated skin. We will use in
vitro permeation tests and in vivo pharmacokinetics studies (in animals and humans) to answer key questions
about how API properties, formulation, and in vivo skin characteristics impact permeability and flux through
micropore vs. intact skin pathways. The main physicochemical characteristics we will initially investigate include
ionization/charge, logP, and pKa. Permeation will be examined in vitro under heated vs non-heated conditions
(heat can synergistically enhance skin API permeation), and MN properties (length, number) will be examined
for effects on permeation. This will give a mechanistic understanding of the API and MN properties having the
greatest impact on micropore permeation. Pharmacokinetics studies in guinea pigs will be completed so that in
vivo factors impacting permeation can be assessed and compared to in vitro predictions. A second major area
of study will involve pharmacokinetics studies in healthy human subjects. We will enroll a cohort of subjects >50
years of age, along with younger (<50 yrs) control subjects so we can 1) correlate age-related micropore closure
estimates with API absorption, and 2) study age-related skin changes on MN API delivery. The combined in vitro
and in vivo studies will maintain the high clinical relevance of the work. We expect to identify key physicochemical
properties and increase our understanding of structure-permeability relationships and biological aspects
impacting API permeability with MNs. This will generate fundamental knowledge that can result in direct clinical
applications and supports the NIGMS mission in the areas of drug delivery, absorption, transport, and kinetics."

Resolution in skin wound healing is coordinated by intercellular communication processes that
include extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing biologically active protein and nucleic acid. In injury
models, EVs have been shown to be important mediators of tissue repair, although the
mechanisms underlying the formation of specific EV subsets, loading of EV payloads, and cell-
type specific EV uptake remain poorly understood. We address this knowledge gap with a
comprehensive genetic approach to modify the regulation of EV biogenesis to change the EV
Profile, Payload and Activity in cutaneous wound models that have well-defined biological
relevance. We have recently established that genetic tools regulating EV biogenesis `re-program'
EV payload. Moreover, over-expression of specific pro-reparative payloads that were identified
by mass spectrometry can be engineered and delivered to promote resolution in models of
impaired wound healing. With a focus on the discovery of novel EV mediators of crosstalk
between immune and epithelial cells in the wound bed, we have focused on the biology of EVs in
mediating intercellular signaling in EVs formation (Project 1-EV Biogenesis), the engineering of
biologically active payloads (Project 2-EV Payloads), and identifying specific cell types that
internalize EVs in the wound bed (Project 3-EV Uptake). Together, these Projects address the
over-arching goals of creating therapeutic EVs with a systematic approach that is optimized for
specific cell types based on an understanding of 1) How and where EVs are made?; 2) How EVs
are loaded and whether they are biologically active ?; and 3) Which cells uptake EVs to promote
durable tissue repair."

Compared to peers in other racial groups, Black emerging adults (18-28 years old) have the highest risks of
short sleep duration and cardiovascular disease. This increased risk may be partly explained by greater stress
levels resulting from race-related stress (experiences of racial discrimination and heightened feelings of
vigilance). Insufficient sleep (longer sleep-onset latency, shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality and
efficiency, lower amounts of slow-wave sleep) may also lead to greater arterial stiffness (hardening of the
arteries, reducing their elasticity and ability to expand and contract as blood is pumped through them) and
unfavorable hemodynamic characteristics (physical factors such as high blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean
arterial pressure, and heart rate that govern blood flood and heart function), which are well-known risk factors
for cardiovascular disease. This supplemental project aims to examine cross-sectional associations between
measures of insufficient sleep and race-related stress with arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics in 55
Black emerging adults. The parent R01 grant follows a measurement burst design that includes data collection
over 3 bursts (baseline, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up), each lasting 7 days. Measures of arterial
stiffness and central hemodynamics will be added to the Day 5, in-laboratory protocol prior to measures of resting
energy expenditure. Measures of arterial stiffness (via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) and central
hemodynamics (via pulse wave analysis) will be captured with the SphygmoCor XCEL system. Insufficient sleep
variables will be measured with three methods: sleep diary, actigraphy and polysomnography. Race-related
stress will be self-reported. Aim 1 will examine cross-sectional associations between insufficient sleep with
arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics. Aim 2 will examine cross-sectional associations between race-
related stress with arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that higher
amounts of insufficient sleep and race-related stress will be associated with higher arterial stiffness and
unfavorable hemodynamic characteristics. This proposed supplemental project is a logical extension of the goals
of the parent grant by adding a clinically relevant outcome (measures of arterial stiffness and central
hemodynamics) to the parent R01 project which focuses on sleep, race-related stress, and obesity risk. This
proposed supplemental project could also have significant public health implications by investigating initial
associations between sleep, race-related stress, and well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Black
emerging adults."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest membrane protein superfamily in the human
genome, with over 800 unique sequences. GPCR-mediated signaling pathways play a key role in all
physiological systems as well as many pathophysiological conditions and therefore represent important drug
targets. GPCRs have a seven-transmembrane-helix (7TM) topology and contain multiple binding sites for
orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators. Upon recognition of their native ligands receptors transmit signal
across the cell membrane to intracellular partner proteins, such as G proteins or β-arrestins. Developing a
detailed understanding of functional mechanisms of GPCRs and facilitating design of novel drugs with high
selectivity and potency require access to high-resolution three-dimensional structures, determination of which,
however, remains a challenging task. We propose here a comprehensive research program which combines
technology development with integrated structure-function studies focused on GPCR superfamily. The proposed
research directions are designed to accelerate high-resolution structure determination of membrane proteins,
improve our understanding of GPCR superfamily and answer specific questions on ligand specificity and
selectivity as well as molecular mechanisms of action using several specific receptors as targets. Our approach
integrate structural information on new receptors and complexes with data obtained from biophysical,
biochemical and functional experiments through computer-based analysis and modeling. The long-term goal of
our laboratory is to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of GPCR using the
tools of structural biology and to apply the achieved insights towards the design and development of novel and
efficacious therapeutics."

This project addresses an important limitation of existing culture-based markers used in Phase 2b/c tuberculosis
(TB) trials that determine which regimens advance to Phase 3 testing. Unfortunately, the existing legacy marker
of treatment effect (sputum culture) predicts clinical outcomes poorly and fails to detect residual M. tuberculosis
(Mtb) that leads to relapse. Consequently, there is a critical unmet need for improved pharmacodynamic (PD)
markers to de-risk clinical trial transitions.
The over-arching objective of this project is to advance a novel non-culture assay of treatment effect called the
RS ratio®. Unlike culture which estimates Mtb burden, the RS ratio demonstrates Mtb activity by quantifying
ongoing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis based on the abundance of short-lived Mtb precursor rRNA. Murine
studies show that rapid and profound suppression of the RS ratio is associated with faster cure. Additionally, the
RS ratio is extremely sensitive, enabling detection of Mtb activity beyond the limits of culture. Results in human
sputum indicate that detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) (i.e., positive RS ratio but negative sputum
culture) at the end of treatment is associated with subsequent microbiologic relapse. The RS ratio assay is being
developed by an academic collaboration called the Consortium for Applied Microbial Metrics (CAMM).
Five key objectives have been included to support the acceleration of the RS ratio towards practical application
as a PD marker for ACTG TB trials. Objective 1 is achieving Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA) certification for the CAMM laboratory to assure that the RS ratio meets regulatory standards. Objective
2 is completing analytical method validation of RS ratio assay that will formally assessing the performance
characteristics and the optimal conditions for that will generate the reproducibility and accuracy of the assay.
Objective 3 is external laboratory replication of RS ratio assay in conjunction with the NIH TBQA through a multi-
step process of transferring technology and assessing between-lab concordance. Objective 4 is development of
a statistical analysis plan and initiation of the FDA Biomarker Qualification Pathway which will rigorously define
a precise context of use for the RS ratio in Phase 2 TB trials. Objective 5 will compare the RS ratio with
conventional PD markers in a recently completed Phase 2a trial to further document the performance
characteristics of assay relative to existing PD markers. Collectively, this body of work will advance a novel PD
marker that can accelerate and de-risk development of more effective TB treatments."

Interactions of proteins with other biomolecules regulate fundamental cellular events and misregulation of these
interactions leads to disease states. Proteins often utilize small folded domains for recognition of other
biomolecules. The basic hypothesis guiding our research is that by mimicking these folded domains we can
specifically inhibit chosen protein complex formation with rationally designed synthetic molecules. Based on this
hypothesis, we have developed a suite of Protein Domain Mimics (PDMs) that faithfully reproduce binding
epitopes on protein surfaces. This work has created a foundation for the development of a new class of
structure–based therapeutics. Equipped with our platform of PDMs, we will focus on a currently intractable
class of targets in IDPs or Intrinsically Disordered Proteins. Therapeutic targeting of intrinsically disordered
proteins is attractive because they interact with a multitude of partners and influence numerous signaling
pathways. However, targeting of IDPs remains underexplored. We hypothesize that we can engage cellular IDPs
with biomolecular receptors and scavenge them away from their natural binding partners. This strategy would
constitute a distinct mechanism for targeting of IDP-mediated protein-protein interactions. In a new direction for
the group, we will develop encodable ligands to sequence-specifically target double-stranded RNA, the most
abundant class of cellular RNA. dsRNA has proven to be recalcitrant to therapeutic intervention; although, it is
central to many biological events. In preliminary results, we have discovered a new class of molecular scaffold
that can be engineered to provide sequence-specific recognition of dsRNA. Studies in each Aim will advance
general approaches to inhibit protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes, and establish PDMs as distinct
constructs spanning the molecular size space between small molecules and proteins."

 Catalytic Processes for Stereoselective Radical Cyclization Reactions
 Cyclic structures, including both carbocycles and heterocycles, are common motifs of natural
products and synthetic compounds with important biomedical activities. Among different approaches for
preparing cyclic molecules, radical cyclization represents one of the most powerful approaches for
construction of ring structures. Among a number of inherent synthetic advantages, radical reactions
typically proceed at fast reaction rates under mild and neutral conditions in a broad spectrum of
solvents and exhibit significantly high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, radical processes have
the capability to perform in a cascade fashion, allowing for the rapid construction of complex molecular
structures with generation of multiple stereogenic centers. To further enhance the synthetic applications
of radical cyclization, new approaches will be needed for achieving high control of their reactivity as well
as stereoselectivity, especially enantioselectivity, challenging issues that are intrinsically associated
with the “free” nature of radical chemistry.
 Guided by the mechanistic principles of metalloradical catalysis (MRC), this proposed research
explores a fundamentally different approach for controlling stereoselectivity of both C- and N-centered
radical reactions. Cobalt(II) porphyrins [Co(Por)], as stable 15e metalloradicals, can enable the
activation of diazo compounds and organic azides to cleanly generate C- and N-centered radicals,
respectively, with N2 as the only byproduct in a controlled and catalytic manner. The initially-formed C-
and N-centered radicals, which are termed as a-Co(III)-alkyl radicals and a-Co(III)-aminyl radicals,
respectively, remain covalently bonded with [Co(Por)]. They can undergo common radical reactions,
such as radical addition to alkenes and hydrogen-atom abstraction, but with effective control of
reactivity and stereoselectivity by the porphyrin ligand environment. In addition to the radical nature of
[Co(Por)], the low dissociation energy of Co–C and Co–N bonds plays a key role for the successful
turnover of the Co(II)-based catalytic processes, resulting in effective radical cyclization reactions.
Through the support of D2-symmetric chiral amidoporphyrin ligands with tunable electronic, steric, and
chiral environments, Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis (Co(II)-MRC) will be applied for the
development of various radical cyclization processes for stereoselective construction of both carbocylic
and N-heterocyclic compounds with different ring sizes and varied degrees of molecular complexity.
 We hope these studies will ultimately lead to the development of cost-effective and environmentally
benign radical cyclization processes that can be successfully applied for the stereoselective synthesis
of biologically important natural products and pharmaceutically interesting small molecules."

Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria are collectively responsible for over 5 million deaths annually. A number of
species also exhibit high levels of antibiotic resistance, comprising nine out of twelve members on the World
Health Organization’s list of priority pathogens. Gram-negative bacterial infection is often mediated by so-called
autotransporters, a class of proteins that cross the outer membrane to the extracellular space where they act
as virulence factors, such as adhesins, proteases, and other harmful agents. Autotransporters consist of a
translocator domain, which remains in the membrane, and a passenger domain, which secretes across the
membrane to the other side, even without the use chemical energy, e.g., ATP. Targeting these autotransporters
for inhibition represents a promising means of controlling infection while limiting the development of resistance.
However, first, research into the molecular mechanisms of autotransporter folding, secretion, and expression
beyond the cell surface is critically needed. This project will meet that need through three specific aims. In
the first aim, how the passenger domain folds will be characterized, answering why folding in vivo is orders
of magnitude faster than in vitro. The second aim focuses on the secretion of the passenger domain across
the membrane through a hybrid-β-barrel of the translocator domain with BamA, the protein responsible for its
membrane insertion. The pathway through the combined barrels will be determined, as well as the influence of
the outer membrane on the process. In the third aim, another class of autotransporters, two-partner secretion
systems, will be modeled, with a goal of identifying both commonalities and differences between them and other
classes. The primary methodological tool to be used for this project is atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. These simulations will all be carried out in realistic environments, including an accurate model of the
asymmetric Gram-negative outer membrane. Multiple innovative approaches will also be used, including deep
learning for modeling the folding process, Markov state modeling for extracting kinetics information, and coarse-
grained Brownian dynamics for observing spontaneous secretion. Close collaboration with multiple experimental
labs will provide key inputs to and validation of the MD simulation results."

Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma into Adulthood (R01MD019027)
The prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non- Hispanic
White children. Asthma disparities become even more pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the
highest prevalence of asthma as compared to all other racial/ethnic groups in the US, with 60% uncontrolled.
Asthma is influenced by social and environmental factors (SEF) including adverse childhood events (ACEs),
tobacco smoke, and everyday life stressors that may alter immunological state. ACEs in particular, including
abuse, neglect, and household challenges have been associated with immune dysregulation, may have
implications for clinical outcomes of respiratory viral infections in children that have been linked to asthma and
persistent respiratory symptoms. For example, Infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of
life are more likely to develop asthma, and children with asthma are at increased risk of experiencing
complications from respiratory viral infections due to SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza,
and rhinovirus C. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including children from a Northern
Plains American Indian community, we found children with asthma experienced an increased clinical burden
from RSV infection and had lower levels of serum RSV-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) than children without
asthma, indicative of immune suppression or dysfunction. However, the complex interplay between social,
environmental and immunological response to viral respiratory infections remains largely unknown, and these
factors have not been investigated among AI children with respect to their influence on immunological
response and asthma development and control of asthma symptoms. In this continued AI community-focused
study, we will test the hypothesis that social and environmental factors contribute to asthma susceptibility
through stress-induced immune dysregulation, including the alteration of immunological response to viral
respiratory infections. We will also investigate the role of viral respiratory infections and SEF on asthma
control, including frequency of symptoms, exacerbations, ER visits/hospitalizations, and use of asthma
medications.
 Aim 1: Identify social and environmental factors (SEF) that contribute to asthma susceptibility,
asthma control, and long-term respiratory health in American Indian children. We will follow-up on our
previously NIMHD-funded case/control study of 324 children recruited between the ages of 6-17 from 2013-
2017 as they transition into adulthood (now ages 11-27). We will recontact original study participants,
evaluating their current asthma status to investigate the role of age and gender on long-term respiratory health
including current asthma and asthma control. We will also expand our study to 400 new participants with and
without asthma between the ages of 6-17, including Tribal members living in Rapid City, SD, and offspring of
original study participants (~30% of original study participants have since become parents). We will obtain
detailed measures of SEF, and retrospective information on adverse childhood events (ACE) using an
established screener to evaluate their role in asthma susceptibility and asthma control, including comparisons
between urban vs. rural and multi-generational effects in this community-engaged study. We hypothesize that
domains of biological and behavioral influences acting on the individual and interpersonal levels generate
social stress and have an impact on asthma development and control.
 Aim 2: Investigate the role of SEF on immunological response to viral respiratory infections
(VRIs) in AI children with and without asthma. We will investigate the impact of social and environmental
factors measured using validated and Tribally-developed surveys on the immune system of AI children with
and without asthma, including response to viral respiratory infections (viral-specific serum IgG and IgM
concentrations to RSV and other VRI pathogens known to cause long-term respiratory sequelae). We will
quantify serological measurements of participants’ humoral immune responses including serum biomarkers of
inflammation (Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines), atopy (serum total IgE), and total immunoglobulins. We will test our
hypothesis that interactions with detailed survey measures of SEF with immunological and clinical outcomes of
VRIs, including viral responses in participants with and without asthma are the strongest and most significant
predictors in our AI participants.
 Aim 3: Engage with an existing Tribal Community Advisory Board (CAB) using continuous
bidirectional process evaluation to develop an intervention and policy framework of asthma
prevention. We will engage with the CRST’s dedicated community and Tribal cultural experts and active
volunteers in building our local CAB. We will leverage the scientific knowledge gained under this proposal to
work with the CAB to create a sustainable, feasible, and Lakota-driven, intervention and policy framework,
including the creation of structures to allow integration of social stressers including ACEs into existing referral
services and policy initiatives. We will collect detailed information using questionnaires and semi-structured
interviews among CAB members and the community about the study development and processes. We
recognize that Tribal children with mild, moderate to severe asthma who are experiencing humoral immune
response alterations and a combination of SEFs need very targeted and specialized preventive measures that
this study will be able to develop and support with implementation.
B. RESEARCH PLAN: Environmental Toxicants and Asthma in American Indian Children
Background: Viral respiratory infections in early life have been linked to the development of asthma and
persistent respiratory symptoms in children 1–3, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of which the majority
of children are exposed before age 2. Infants who develop RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life have a high
chance of developing asthma 4, and children with asthma have an increased risk of experiencing complications
and lasting respiratory symptoms from infections such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and rhinovirus-C 5–8.
The prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non-Hispanic
White children 9. This is a serious but understudied, pediatric health disparity in the U.S. that becomes even
more pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the highest prevalence of asthma as compared to all
other racial/ethnic groups 9. Asthma has been linked to a number of social and environmental factors 10–15
including exposure to social stress, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and environmental toxicants including per-
and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 16. There is mounting evidence that PFAS, a “forever chemical” in the
environment has a deleterious effect on many aspects of health 17, including thyroid and immune activity 18,
inflammation in pregnancy 19, fetal growth 20, immune response to childhood vaccines 21 and viral respiratory
infections 22,23. Thus, exposure to PFAS and environmental toxins during childhood may have a lasting effect
on Tribal health. In summary, we propose to address newly emerging chemical exposures including PFAS in
an at-risk, low income, Native American community in consultation with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe
(CRST), including children living in Rapid City South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota
Reservations. In this area of South Dakota, the proportion of children living below the Federal poverty line is
47% and 57% in Ziebach 24 and Dewey 25 Counties, respectively. The adverse health effects of PFAS and
environmental toxins due to community-level exposure in this area of high childhood poverty has yet to be
investigated, nor their effects on immunological response to viral respiratory infections and immune
dysfunction.
Preliminary Research: In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study we found that AI children
with asthma living on the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota Reservations were more likely to reside in
multi-unit housing, and in residences with rodent or insect infestation resulting in poor indoor air quality as
compared to asthma controls 26. Children with asthma also had higher BMI, total leukocyte counts, %
eosinophils, total serum IgE, and specific IgE to five common indoor airborne antigens 27. We also found
children with asthma to have lower levels of RSV-specific IgG during the winter (Figure 1) and to report
increased hospitalizations and RSV diagnoses (Figure 2), suggesting immune dysregulation with clinical
implications 28. We hypothesize that exposures to environmental toxins, some of which have been linked to
immune dysregulation may play an important role.
Figure 1: A. Asthma cases recruited during the winter (RSV season) had significantly lower RSV IgG as compared to asthma cases
recruited during the summer (p=2.5x10-6). There was no observed difference in seasonality for asthma controls (p=0.60).
B. More children with asthma have low levels of IgG (<40 IU/mL).
In unpublished results, Dr. Erdei (co-PI of parent
study) detected PFAS in 83% of samples from 50
CRST adults who fish regularly from the Tribe's
main public water sources. She has identified an
association between PFAS and a number of tissue-
specific and antinuclear autoantibodies, and found
serum PFAS and other compounds to be predictors
of autoimmune markers indicative of a
hyperreactive immune response in adults (Figure
3). Consuming locally caught fish as part of AI Figure 2: Children with asthma in the FIPA study report a higher
culture and as a dietary source of protein was also clinical burden from RSV.
associated with overall elevation of serum PFAS.
Similar investigations among children in the CRST
will allow us to learn more about PFAS exposure patterns as it relates to immune dysregulation, viral respiratory
infections, and its effect on children’s health in the community.
Figure 3: Quantile Regression plots in CRST adults showing that A. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposures are predictive of anti-
native DNA response. B. PFOS and C. PFOA exposures are predictive of thyroid-specific (anti-thyroglobulin) autoimmune response,
with PFOA having an immunosuppressive effect.
In summary, we hypothesize that exposure to environmental toxins, specifically PFAS, contributes to immune
dysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in American Indian children with asthma. As
recruitment for FIPA2 is starting, this is an opportune time for Dr. Spear to lead a study investigating the role
of PFAS and environmental toxins on the health of AI children. This opportunity will afford Dr. Spear to narrow
in on the role of PFAS on immune dysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in children with
and without asthma, while making new connections with scientists in the field of environmental research.
Overall, our study will advance knowledge of the effect of environmental toxins on immune dysregulation of
children to inform future policies and interventions.
Thus, our specific aims for this diversity supplement are:
Specific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian
children from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations.
Specific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and
immunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without
asthma.
Approach: We will perform suspect screening and test for levels of 12 PFAS in serum samples of 52 children
with and without asthma and living in urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations (Figure 4). We will identify suspect
chemicals present in AI children, and perform preliminary correlations with immune biomarkers, viral-specific
immunoglobulins, PFAS and suspect chemicals identified. Characterizing the presence and effect of
environmental toxins on the immune system is an essential step for understanding environmental health
disparities, which the community has been struggling with for decades.
Figure 4: Location and summary of serum samples for study to measure PFAS/suspect chemicals in children ages 6-17 years old in
FIPA2. Recruitment is beginning 5/2024. We also have stored samples for >300 original FIPA participants at -80C (living on
Reservation, only).
Specific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian
children from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations. We will work with
the UCSF Bioassay Facility Core to develop a protocol for PFAS and untargeted suspect screening of serum
samples from 52 AI children, including 26 asthma cases and 26 matched controls living in an urban (Rapid City
SD) vs. rural (Reservation) environment.
Specific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and
immunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without
asthma. We will test for a correlation of PFAS/suspect chemicals with levels of immune biomarkers and viral-
specific immunoglobulins. Immune biomarkers will include cytokines, Creactive protein, CBCs (white blood cell
counts), total serum IgE, and viral specific IgG/IgM (SARs-CoV2, RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus C). Results
from this aim will provide insights in to 1) the variability in exposure to environmental toxicants in children living
in urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations and 2) the role of exposure to PFAS/suspect chemicals on immune
dysregulation and asthma.
Statistical analyses: We will examine the distribution of individual PFAS chemicals plus untargeted suspect
chemicals to determine the relevant statistical test. In general, for commonly detected chemicals we will utilize
linear and logistic regression models (or nonparametric tests) to test for associations between PFAS/suspect
chemicals adjusting for multiple covariates selected through an iterative process (e.g. BMI, sex, household
size, asthma medications); we will also contrast models with and without an asthma interaction. For rare
chemicals we will apply a fisher’s exact test for detected/undetected. ROC curves will be generated for
individual chemicals by asthma and location, and cluster analyses will be performed over all chemicals using a
principal component analysis (with UMAP projection) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
for predictive modeling and Cox regression. Lastly, we will attempt a mediation analysis to evaluate if exposure
to PFAS/suspect chemicals contributes to asthma via immune dysregulation.
Relevance to the parent grant: The parent grant is centered on identifying social determinants of the
environment including adverse childhood experiences that contribute to the development of asthma through
altering the immunological response to viral respiratory infections. However, there is substantial evidence to
suggest that exposure to environmental toxicants contribute to immune dysregulation in both the context of
asthma and general immune function as discussed above. In this proposal, Dr. Spear will focus on the physical
environment, specifically the role of exposure and accumulation of environmental toxicants on immune
dysregulation in children with and without asthma."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large family of short, non-coding, regulatory RNAs that modulate protein
expression. Abnormal miRNA levels are associated with many diseases, including developmental defects and
various cancers. To generate functional miRNAs, primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) generally need to be first
cleaved by an RNase III, Drosha. This critical step of miRNA biogenesis needs to be controlled, in both
accuracy and efficiency, to maintain proper gene regulation. The processing enzyme Drosha requires its
partner protein, DGCR8, for protein stability and substrate specificity. A Drosha molecule binds homo-dimeric
DGCR8 to carry out pri-miRNA processing, but higher-order complexes may also form because clustering of
pri-miRNAs in the genome enhances processing. Our recent groundbreaking cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-
EM) structures provide atomic models of the Microprocessor-pri-miRNA complex in action. Elucidating how the
proteins are organized around the RNA stem-loop also revealed how each distal end (basal or apical) is
independently recognized but also linked to each other via a molecular ruler connecting the detection modules.
The proposed research builds on our previous successes, as the structural framework will enable us to gain
novel fundamental insights into how the macromolecular recognition is accomplished. Our overall goal is to
understand the recognition of pri-miRNAs by Microprocessor at the molecular level. We hypothesize that RNA
structural features and context-dependent sequence preferences dictate the processing fate of each individual
pri-miRNA. We will dissect how the recognition is accomplished at each of the basal and apical junctions of pri-
miRNAs. We will also investigate how diverse RNA sequences and structures from different pri-miRNAs affect
proper recognition at each junction, to reveal the plasticity of the multipart machinery. Our previous work has
also left us poised to address urgent questions on how clustering of pri-miRNAs enhances processing by
Microprocessor, which is crucial for our overall understanding of miRNA biogenesis and has profound
implications for the interpretation of previous and future results in a wide variety of fields obtained by
manipulation of miRNA genes. A better grasp of the core recognition mechanisms will help us explain unique
targets such as clustered pri-miRNAs. Together, the proposed studies will provide a comprehensive
understanding of processing and regulation of miRNAs, important regulators of gene expression. Our work on
deciphering how structure affects RNA recognition is a fundamentally important question and likely be
insightful for many processes involving structured RNAs beyond miRNAs.

11100089,"Recombination is essential in maintaining genome stability, and even minor deficiency in
recombinational double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways results in cancer or other severe
diseases. The initial processing of DNA DSBs to single strands, a process termed DNA end
resection, is the critical first step of homologous recombination needed for the loading of damage
response and repair proteins. Resection is tightly controlled in the cell cycle and determines the
usage of homologous recombination versus nonhomologous end joining for repair. In yeast and
human cells, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1/Xrs2 complex initiates resection, whereas Exo1 or Sgs1-
Dna2 mediates extensive resection. Systematic studies of resection have thus far only been done
in euchromatin, whereas we propose to study it in three different types of silenced
heterochromatin. We designed many new assays to examine resection within transcriptionally
silent chromatin in fission yeast (Aim #1). The fission yeast system provides an excellent model
organism for this study as chromatin features are well conserved with those in human cells. In
Aim #2 we focus on control of one of the most mutagenic pathways of DSB repair called Break
Induced Replication (BIR). BIR is normally used for the repair of a single-end DSB. Here the goal
is to understand how this pathway is suppressed during the repair of two-ended DSBs. We focus
on the role of ssDNA annealing by Rad52 and synchronous resection of two ends of a DSB by
the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex. In Aim #3 we focus on the resection-independent function of
Dna2 nuclease/helicase during homologous recombination."

The process of cell division requires that each cell receive an identical complement of the genome. Errors in
chromosome segregation give rise to chromosomal aneuploidies that are causative for human genetic disease
such as Down syndrome and promote the progression of most human cancers. The work in this proposal is
focused on understanding the functions of the centromere and kinetochore, the primary site on the
chromosome that attaches each chromosome to the mitotic spindle for proper segregation during division. The
centromere and kinetochore serve as the primary control center for chromosome segregation through their
roles in microtubule attachment, force coupling for chromosome movement, and error correction when
chromosome attachment or alignment on microtubules is perturbed. Underlying the centromere is a specialized
chromatin domain that is delineated by replacement of histone H3 in nucleosomes with a centromere specific
histone variant termed CENP-A. The position of CENP-A defines where the centromere and kinetochore will
form and defects in CENP-A assembly or maintenance cause centromere and kinetochore loss which result in
chromosome missegregation. In this proposal we study three different aspects of CENP-A chromatin. In our
first Aim we work to understand how the assembly of CENP-A chromatin is controlled so that the centromere is
replenished during each cell cycle and maintained through replication and cell division. We focus on three
important factors for CENP-A assembly, CENP-C, HJURP and the Mis18 complex that are essential for
building new CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres. Our second aim studies the problem of how the presence
of CENP-A in chromatin dictates the sites of new CENP-A assembly. We apply a new method we have
developed called DiMeLo-seq that overcomes existing limitations in studying the complex repetitive
centromeres of vertebrates. This approach uses directed methylation to mark the sites where proteins are
bound to chromatin and then uses long read sequencing to map the binding sites through the repetitive
centromere sequences. We use this approach to study the density, distribution, and sites of regeneration of
CENP-A through the cell cycle. In our third aim we study how centromeres are condensed and organized by
the activities of CENP-A nucleosome binding proteins. We discovered that two centromere proteins (CENP-C
and CENP-N) can bridge CENP-A nucleosomes and condense centromeric chromatin. We use human cells to
test the role of this condensation activity in centromere condensation, resistance to force, and chromosome
segregation. Overall, our proposal will elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and structural organization of
vertebrate centromeres and how those properties ensure accurate chromosome segregation."

Twenty homologous Karyopherin- (Kap) proteins mediate the majority of protein transport
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The Chook Lab is a leader in understanding the
mechanisms by which Kaps control macromolecular traffic. We achieve this understanding
through a combination of structural, biochemical, cell biological and bioinformatic analyses of
Kap-ligand interactions. Our studies of the nuclear import receptor Kapβ2 led to discovery of
the proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS), which it recognizes. This study led
to a new concept—that many nuclear targeting signals are defined not merely by sequence
but by a collection of physical features—which explained how Kapβ2 can recognize hundreds
of different sequences, and enabled us to design the first nuclear import inhibitor. Although
two additional NLS types have recently been determined, cargo recognition by most importins,
including Importins-4, -7, -8, -9 and -11 is not understood even though they account for 50%
of nuclear import. Few of their cargos are known and the NLS classes that they recognize are
unknown. The missing knowledge obscures our understanding of how a significant portion of
the proteome lacking recognizable NLSs are trafficked into the nucleus. We aim to discover
new cargos, classes of NLSs and pathway-specific inhibitors for all importins. We will combine
this knowledge with bioinformatic analyses and experiments to define the full cargo repertoires
of each importin, and thus map both the traffic and cellular processes that they each control.
We showed that in addition to mediating nuclear import, importins also act as chaperones.
We will learn how Kap2 chaperones RNA-binding proteins, preventing their aggregation and
understand the functional significance of the Importin-9 histone-chaperone function in histone
storage and nucleosome assembly. In our studies of nuclear export, we were the first to reveal
how CRM1 recognizes the only known nuclear export signal (NES). This work was
foundational for development of the anti-cancer drug Selinexor, and the physical/chemical
mechanisms of inhibition that we later revealed contributed to FDA-approval of the drug. We
also revealed the sequence and structural degeneracy of the NES, explaining how CRM1 is
able to recognize hundreds of diverse NES sequences. CRM1 also exports thousands of
mRNAs, but little is known about the mechanism. We will study CRM1-mRNA export
complexes to shed light on this critical step of gene expression. Finally, we will expand study
to the exportin Msn5, which binds intrinsically disordered and phosphorylated segments of
multiple cargos. This work will reveal a second, new class of NES."

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Donor-derived alloreactive T cells can kill
recipient leukemia cells, mediating the graft-vs-leukemia effect (GVL). GVL failure leads to post-
transplant relapse, affecting 30-40% of alloSCT recipients and leading to extremely poor
prognosis, with a median survival of 6 months. The clinical sensitivity of leukemias to GVL
varies by disease type. Dr. Shlomchik, Co-PI, sought the mechanism of GVL resistance using
preclinical GVL models and discovered that myeloblastic leukemia required the expression of
the IFN-γ receptor for GVL. Two independent groups reported lower levels of human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) expression in myeloid blasts post-transplant relapse, which IFN-γ can restore in
vitro. These data supported conducting a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety of IFN-γ
(ACTIMMUNE®) in AML/MDS patients with post-transplant relapse (NCT04628338). 4 out of 6
patients who received IFN-γ and subsequent donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) achieved durable
complete remissions with full donor hematopoiesis recovery. Given these favorable results, we
propose a multicenter phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of IFN-γ/DLI compared to the
outcomes in a synthetic control generated from the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. Patients with AML/MDS who developed relapse with
>5% bone marrow myeloblasts after an HLA-matched alloSCT will be eligible. Subjects will
receive 100mcg of IFN-γ thrice weekly by self-subcutaneous injection for four weeks. If IFN-γ is
tolerated, subjects will receive DLI concurrently with IFN-γ for eight more weeks to complete the
12-week treatment intervention. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IFN-γ/DLI,
measured by event-free survival at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of IFN-γ/DLI measured by secondary endpoints, including measurable disease-
negative complete remission at 6 months and overall survival at 12 months. The incidence of
steroid and ruxolitinib-refractory graft-versus-host disease will be used for the stopping rule. 45
participants will be enrolled to receive IFN-γ/DLI. The major clinical endpoints will be compared
to 3 CIBMTR synthetic cohorts of patients treated with 1) chemotherapy only, 2) chemotherapy+
DLI, or 3) DLI only. Each control group will have 135 subjects (1:3 ratio of treated subjects). In
exploratory studies, we will analyze IFN-γ induced transcriptomic changes in leukemic and
immune cells to find the biomarkers that could be used to select subjects for future studies."

RNA Silencing is a blanket term for a diverse group of biological processes in which small RNAs, including
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence
genes. This proposal aims to leverage my group’s expertise in structural biology and biochemistry to
address outstanding questions that stand as roadblocks to advancing the current understanding of RNA
Silencing biology. Specifically: 1) piRNAs, essential for defending the genome against transposable
elements (TEs), have been studied extensively using molecular genetics, but how piRNA-associated
factors work together to produce the potent TE-silencing observed in animals remains unclear. We will
address this knowledge gap by discovering the structures and biochemical activities of RNA-protein
complexes central to piRNA function. 2) miRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of cellular gene expression in
mammals, but how miRNAs themselves are regulated has only recently come to light. We will advance
this emerging area by determining the structural basis for targeted ubiquitination and destruction of miRNA-
protein complexes by the recently discovered ZSWIM8 Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. 3) Although the
canonical function of miRNAs is to silence targeted mRNAs, certain RNA viruses have evolved
mechanisms to repurpose cellular miRNAs to instead stabilize their viral genomes and stimulate viral
production. The mechanisms by which miRNA complexes are redirected to achieve these non-canonical
functions are poorly understood. We are addressing this knowledge gap by investigating interactions
between Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and the liver-specific miRNA miR-122, with a focus on understanding the
structures of miR-122–HCV RNA complexes that modulate HCV translation to enable replication of HCV
RNA. 4) One of the oldest and most intriguing mysteries of the RNA Silencing field is that, in some cases,
silencing RNAs readily pass between animal cells. 25 years after this discovery, the mechanisms for RNA
transport into animal cells remain unclear. We are addressing this shortcoming by determining the
structural basis for RNA recognition and transport by SID-1, a broadly conserved integral membrane
protein that transports double-stranded RNA into animal cells. The combined studies are expected to
produce insights necessary to overcome the major knowledge barriers described above, with implications
for understanding human health, fertility, viral infection, and the advancement of RNA-based therapies."

Organs “know” when and how to stop growing to arrive at the correct size and shape. Disruption of organ size
control mechanisms leads to congenital abnormalities, poor organ homeostasis and tissue repair, and tumors.
Exemplifying this fundamental mystery, adult zebrafish fins perfectly regenerate to their original size and shape
regardless of injury extent. Therefore, zebrafish fin regeneration is a compelling and tractable system to
interrogate “organ scaling” mechanisms. Bioelectricity, or ion flows across cell membranes, is long-associated
with both organ size control and regeneration. However, links between ion signaling and their effectors to
specific cell behaviors determining organ size are limited. Perturbed ion signaling, notably by elevated voltage-
gated K+ channel activity and inhibited Ca2+-dependent calcineurin signaling, leads to dramatic overgrowth of
regenerating zebrafish fins. A distal fibroblast-lineage pool of ""niche"" cells within the fin's regenerative
blastema sustains fin outgrowth. The niche progressively depletes as outgrowth slows, likely by net re-
differentiation to a non-growth promoting state. We recently discovered the classic longfint2 mutant phenotype
is caused by ectopic expression of the Kcnh2a potassium channel within the fibroblast/niche lineage. Ectopic
Kcnh2a disrupts orderly niche depletion, thereby prolonging the outgrowth period. Kcnh2a likely blocks Ca2+-
calcineurin signaling with both acting uniquely during late stages of regeneration. We made a Ca2+ responsive
GCaMP6s transgenic reporter line and found distal fibroblast / niche cells exhibit dynamic Ca2+ fluxes. Our
single cell transcriptomics identified candidate upstream voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We mutated the genes
encoding each channel, generating the first recessive model of dramatically elongated fins. We now
hypothesize niche-specific Ca2+ signaling, modulated by a cadre of Ca2+ channels, activates calcineurin to
promote niche-to-mesenchyme state transitions. We will pursue three Specific Aims to test this model and
identify mechanisms linking ion signaling to cell behaviors restoring fin size: 1) Characterize spatiotemporal
cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics and calcineurin activity in wildtype and long-finned zebrafish, 2) Determine how
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels modulate regenerating fin Ca2+ dynamics and fin outgrowth, and 3) Determine
how Ca2+ dynamics and calcineurin promote cell behaviors for fin growth cessation. Our proposed research will
associate voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-modulated intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, downstream calcineurin signaling,
and a novel “niche” state transition towards answering the classic mystery of robust organ scaling during fin
regeneration. Our study's broader impacts include identifying conceptual and mechanistic links of bioelectricity
to specific molecules and cell behaviors that determine organ size and form. Finally, studying robust adult
zebrafish skeletal regeneration will inform regenerative medicine approaches for human bone disease."

Cellular communication is essential for the development of all multicellular organisms, and is a key phenomenon
that is disrupted in many human diseases. Cell-surface receptors mediate cellular communication and are the
targets for 50% of FDA-approved drugs, highlighting their disease relevance and druggability. However, many
cell-surface receptors remain understudied and undrugged. The research proposed in this application is focused
on two families of such receptors, adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs), and teneurins. The
structures, mechanisms of action and disease relevance of these two receptor families remain largely unknown;
as their large size and complex biochemical nature has made them difficult to study. Recent genetic studies
revealed that aGPCRs and teneurins have essential roles in development of the nervous system, skeletal
system, and heart. These receptors are linked to diseases including cancer, developmental disorders, and brain
malformations, raising an urgent need for mechanistic studies on aGPCRs and teneurins. My research program
aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors are activated, and to develop new tools
to modulate their activity against relevant diseases. The research proposed in this application involves an
interdisciplinary approach, integrating structural studies of these receptors and their ligands, biochemical and
biophysical assays, protein engineering approaches, and functional assays. This research will build on our
previous successes using this approach, which has yielded many three-dimensional structures of aGPCRs and
teneurins, has revealed crucial mechanistic concepts in the field, and has allowed a better understanding of the
mechanisms of action of these receptors. A major revelation from our work is that the large extracellular regions
of aGPCRs and teneurins are directly involved in regulating receptor function. Despite these advances,
fundamental questions remain unanswered. The ultimate goals of this proposal are to reveal how signal
transduction is mediated within the domains of these large receptors, what exactly activates them under
physiological conditions, how their evolution from early organisms to higher eukaryotes have changed and
diversified their critical functions, and finally how, at the molecular level, we can inhibit or activate these receptors
using synthetic ligands. Our structural studies will be complemented with mutagenesis, signaling assays, the use
of synthetic binders to understand how the different components of these receptors control receptor function,
and physiological analyses performed by collaborators that will test the relevance of the structural and functional
studies. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of aGPCR and
teneurin function that will be highly informative for the development of future therapeutics; we will also produce
potent and selective synthetic ligands which can serve as tools for the scientific community to study aGPCRs
and teneurins."
11093024,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
As genetic and disease-modifying interventions emerge, there is an urgent need for early and accurate
assessment of disease-specific motor impairments in people with Huntington’s disease (HD). Traditional
measures are subjective and episodic and have a limited ability to capture early, subtle motor features. Digital
measures have the potential to remotely quantify disease-specific impairments in individuals with HD. A key
next step is to evaluate the most promising digital measures in the early stages of HD.
 Gait impairments and involuntary choreic movements are clinical hallmarks of HD and two of the earliest motor
signs. Chorea, which is characterized by involuntary writhing movements, can affect gait characteristics and
make conventional approaches to quantifying gait using wearable sensors inaccurate in HD. Our pilot work has
shown that wearable sensors can evaluate the quantity and quality of daily living gait in people with HD, even in
the presence of chorea, with the aid of tailored machine learning. Exciting initial findings also suggest that chorea
severity can be captured using digital health technologies (DHTs) like wearable sensors. Daily physical activity,
heart rate variability, and sleep also differ in individuals with HD and healthy controls. All of these measures have
the potential to be meaningful endpoints in HD clinical trials, but critical gaps first need to be addressed.
 We aim to demonstrate the reliability, validity, and meaningfulness of two key digital measures, daily living
mobility (gait) and chorea, captured remotely and continuously using wearable sensors. We will also explore
daily physical activity, heart rate variability, and sleep. In this remote, cross-sectional study, 40 individuals with
early HD (HD Integrated Staging System, HD-ISS Stage 2, and early Stage 3) and 20 control participants will
wear two sensors (trunk and wrist) for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, and will complete telehealth assessments
and interviews. Our long-term objective is to fully establish these digital measures as drug development tools
and treatment response endpoints in early HD. Our two specific aims are: 1) demonstrate the construct validity
and test-retest reliability of a) real-world gait and chorea and b) daily living physical activity, heart rate
variability, and sleep quality using wrist-worn wearable sensors in people with early-stage HD; and 2) a) to map
personally bothersome and important symptoms/impacts of HD and assess relevance of selected digital
measures and b) to evaluate the relationship between the digital measures and patient-reported outcomes.
 The proposed work will be the first time that our innovative symptom mapping approach is applied to HD,
the first time that DHTs are connected to patient-reported meaningfulness in HD, and the first time that real-
world study of gait and chorea in HD is assessed as a function of the recently developed HD-ISS staging. This
will also be the first study that brings together recently developed HD functional scales, patient symptom
mapping, and novel digital measures. The study will inform larger-scale validation efforts and clinical endpoint
studies in HD and other, more common diseases with involuntary movements (e.g. Parkinson’s disease)."

As important signaling molecules, proteases precisely control a wide variety of physiological processes both in
health and in diseases, and thus represent one of the largest families of pharmaceutical targets. Despite decades
of intensive efforts, conventional drug discovery strategies have only achieved a limited success by targeting a
small fraction of all therapeutically relevant proteases. It is because small-molecule inhibitors are often lack of
specificity and/or appropriate pharmacokinetic properties required for effective and safe protease-based therapy.
In these aspects, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are emerging as attractive alternatives with significant
advantages such as high selectivity, long serum half-life, potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, and as
inducible prodrugs. Since the invention of hybridoma technology, tremendous progress has been made in mAb
discovery and engineering. However, routine discovery of protease-inhibiting mAbs is still a considerable
challenge in general, due to the incompatibility of human antibody paratope for enzyme inhibition, and lack of
functional high-throughput screening methods. My laboratory has been committed to the development of
streamlined methodologies that facilitate the generation of therapeutic mAbs as safe and effective protease
inhibitors. Over the past five years, we have made significant progress, and established a series of novel
technologies, including camelid-inspired convex paratope human antibody libraries, and inhibition-based rather
than binding-based selection/screening methods. Combining these enabling approaches, we discovered,
characterized, and optimized panels of potent and specific mAbs inhibiting numerous proteases of biomedical
importance. Furthermore, our protease inhibitory mAbs have shown significant therapeutic efficacy in mouse
models of cancers, neuropathic pains, obesity, and stroke. By overcoming longstanding challenges, these
achievements have opened the exciting opportunity. In the next five years, we will extend our powerful
technologies to many other well-documented proteases, of which therapeutic inhibitors are urgently needed.
Furthermore, we will develop additional technologies to achieve unique and therapy-desirable features: (1)
function-specific (substrate-dependent) inhibition, (2) broad-spectrum inhibition on a group of proteases, and (3)
epitope-specific inhibition by rational design. Overall, it has been estimated that proteases account for 5-10%
of all drug targets have been studied for pharmaceutical development. The completion of proposed research will
unambiguously advance therapeutic mAb developments targeting biomedically important proteases, e.g. against
the present danger, SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) as a broad
neutralization approach without the unwanted antibody-dependent enhancement."

Many cardiovascular and neurological disorders result from changes in cell mechanics.
Assessment of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that these diseases share a root
cause: abnormal mechanotransduction – the process by which cells respond to physical stress
and forces. Mechanosensitive ion channels convert external forces into electrical response and
are emerging targets of interest for understanding biological processes and therapeutic
development. The PIEZO family (PIEZO1 and PIEZO2) was discovered in 2010 as the first
excitatory mechanosensitive ion channels in vertebrates. PIEZO channels are critical sensors of
touch and pain (somatosensation), volume regulation (osmosensation), shear stress
(cardiovascular tone), baroreception, proprioception and respiratory physiology, and may have
other important functions. PIEZO dysfunction has been linked to diverse pathologies including
hypertension, lymphatic disease and anemias, somatosensory and neurological disorders, cancer
and metastasis, amongst others.
Despite their biological and medical relevance, the mechanism behind PIEZO-dependent
mechanotransduction remains elusive. Our lab’s goal is to understand how physical forces
such as pressure and membrane tension control PIEZO1 function. The parent research proposal
focuses on ion permeation and force-dependent gating mechanisms of PIEZO1 channels in cells
and reconstituted lipid bilayer systems. We will employ biochemical and biophysical techniques
to understand how lipid bilayers control the gating of PIEZO1 and subsequent ion conduction
across the membrane. Moreover, we have identified robust expression and protein purification
protocols to examine the function of PIEZO1 channels. Droplet lipid bilayers will be used to study
the single channel conductance and open probability of the purified protein in biologically relevant
lipid compositions. Structurally and functionally identified pore domain of PIEZO1 will be used as
a template to understand the pressure sensitivity and voltage-dependent inactivation, hallmarks
of PIEZO channels. To study global effect of PIEZO in cellular context, calcium flux assay will be
used. The preliminary data is striking and shows the droplet bilayer approach coupled with
traditional cellular patch clamp assays are ideally suited to study mammalian PIEZO1 channel
function. Our unique proposal represents the application of single molecule investigation of
PIEZOs. Completion of this proposal will provide a path to development of effective therapeutics
targeting neuropathic pain, brain ischemia and gliomas, amongst others."

The stress hormone, cortisol, coordinates the body’s chronic metabolism, but also coordinates acute responses to stress by
regulating stem cell differentiation in different tissues, restraining inflammatory and immune responses from
being hyperactive, and coordinates acute metabolic responses to nutrient composition and feeding or fasting. Cortisol
is also known as a glucocorticoid because it controls glucose metabolism. Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are wide
used for reducing pain and inflammation across many diseases, but can cause insulin resistance, muscle atrophy, and
osteoporosis. We have developed an approach to studying GCs that enables us to understand how the glucocorticoid
receptor coordinates these activities by binding to specific genes and changing the proteins made by those genes to
control tissue-selective activity. This occurs as the GCs bind to the receptor and change its shape, enabling it to interact
with different enzymes that control transcription. Previous efforts to understand these processes have been hampered by
the fact that most of the existing GCs that we study are very similar. We instead make GCs that have a full range of
desirable and undesirable activities, which gives us the statistical variance to understand them, a technique we call ligand
class analysis, as we identify different classes of GC ligands that interact with different transcriptional regulatory enzymes
to control expression of specific genes. Another major barrier has been the very wide expertise needed to understand the
links between the GC chemical structure, receptor structure, the interacting coregulators, the regulated genes, and the
tissue selective activities. We have assembled the required expertise and approaches to overcome these barriers by
studying GC action on skeletal muscle, stem cell differentiation into bone, inflammation, and immune responses to
colitis. We will use a chemical systems biology approach with novel GCs along with an integrative structural biology
platform to define the signaling code for the glucocorticoid receptor in these aims: Aim 1 Biology: Identify which
GC effects are correlated and which can be separated using physiologically relevant biology for the study of
skeletal muscle, T cell differentiation, inflammation, and colitis, and osteoblast mineralization and effects on bone.
Aim 2 Chemistry: Development of GCs to perturb GR structure and function in novel ways. We will enlarge three classes
of compounds based on specific structural hypotheses to enlarge the chemical-structural space and test a novel steroidal
scaffold to access new chemical space. Chemistry will focus on creating a diversity of effects on bone versus skeletal
muscle while maintaining anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds. Aim 3 Structure: identify the structural
underpinnings of selective GC signaling. We will apply machine learning and regression approaches to our structural and
biological data to build and test models defining the mechanisms drive tissue-selectivity and identify which processes
are globally coordinated to control differentiation and stress responses at an organismal level. Understanding
the structural and molecular mechanisms of selective modulation will lead to breakthrough understandings of allostery and
the development of improved GCs for medicine."

In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis reduces the chromosome complement by half to generate haploid
gametes. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo pairing, synapsis, recombination, and faithful
segregation. As such, defects in meiosis are a leading cause of both infertility and birth defects in humans. While
a large number of meiosis-specific factors are involved, ubiquitously expressed factors also play critical roles.
The meiotic process is generally conserved from single-cell eukaryotes to multicellular metazoans; however,
species-specific meiosis factors and functions have evolved. Our genomic and proteomic screens have identified
a large number of novel mammalian meiosis factors and we plan to determine the molecular function of a number
of key factors in the regulation of meiosis in both sexes. Meiotic recombination is essential for genome integrity
in gametes and critical for genome evolution by increasing genetic diversity at the population level. Meiotic
recombination begins with formation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). There are major knowledge
gaps in our understanding of this meiotic process. One main challenge is to understand the mechanism that
prevents meiotic DSB formation from getting out of control. Only a subset of the meiotic DSBs are processed
into crossovers by a large protein network. What is the molecular mechanism underlining the crosstalk in this
protein network? What additional proteins are involved in the processing of DSBs into crossovers? In many
species, chromosomal synapsis is tightly coupled with meiotic recombination. However, the process of synapsis
initiation and maintenance remains poorly understood. These challenges will be tackled in this application
through deciphering novel molecular networks underlying regulation of mammalian meiosis. Our innovative
combination of genetic, genomic, proteomic, cell/molecular biological, and biochemical approaches will focus on
the following critical but challenging aspects of meiosis: initiation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks, regulation
of meiotic recombination, initiation and maintenance of chromosomal synapsis, and origin of sex chromosome
aneuploidy. Completion of the proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into key meiotic
processes, identify new candidate fertility factors, and elucidate the molecular etiology of sex chromosome
aneuploidy."

 TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a deeply conserved protein kinase that regulates eukaryotic
metabolism. TOR senses and integrates upstream signals, especially nutrient availability, to coordinate
metabolism and promote growth only when conditions are favorable. TOR dysregulation causes or
contributes to a broad range of human diseases, including cancers, age-related health disorders, and
metabolic disorders, which are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
Therefore, a major goal for biomedical research is to develop therapeutic treatments that specifically
target components of the TOR signaling network without broadly disrupting metabolism and
homeostasis in healthy cells that rely on TOR. Recently, there have been significant advances to that
goal with the discovery of several putative amino acid sensors for TOR. Conflicting reports about the
relative contributions, importance, and molecular mechanisms of these sensors have stymied these
advances, however. This project uses an innovative approach to bring fresh perspective to these
ongoing debates by shifting focus to the other major eukaryotic lineage, plants.
 In my lab’s ongoing work to elucidate the TOR signaling network in plants, I discovered a novel amino
acid sensor for TOR, an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS). This aaRS is necessary to maintain TOR
activity and sufficient to stimulate TOR in plant cells. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular,
genetic, and systems-level approaches, I propose to precisely define how the aaRS activates TOR in
plant cells through three independent aims. In Aim 1, I propose to mutate key enzymatic residues and
structural features of the aaRS to determine the molecular features it requires to activate TOR. In Aim
2, I propose to map the signal transduction pathway mediating aaRS-TOR activation using robust
orthogonal interactomic approaches. Putative signal transduction components will then be validated
using reciprocal assays and functional genetics to comprehensively define how aaRS-TOR interactors
contribute to TOR regulation. In Aim 3, I propose to establish the selective sensitivity of TOR for specific
amino acids and determine whether the aaRS is a bona fide amino acid sensor for TOR.
 Taken together, these three aims will define the molecular mechanisms underlying the putative amino
acid-aaRS-TOR signaling axis and open new directions for future research on metabolic regulation in
eukaryotes. Moreover, this pathway will serve as a model for understanding how tRNA synthetases
have evolved functions beyond translation in signal transduction pathways and illuminate how the
complex TOR signaling network evolved to integrate diverse physiological cues in humans. Long-term,
our findings will make significant contributions to a major goal of contemporary biomedical research:
fine-tuning TOR signaling networks to improve and lengthen healthy human lifespans."

Regulated transcription of genes is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation and
viability. Any misregulation may lead to a disease or a developmental abnormality. The
transcription cycle of eukaryotic genes consists of multiple steps. The accomplishment
of each of these steps requires a number of accessory factors. The initiation of
transcription by RNAPII requires gene-specific factors and the general transcription
factors (GTFs). The conventional view is that the general transcription factors (GTFs)
operate exclusively at the initiation step of transcription. Many recent studies have
challenged this dogma. The successful execution of the transcription cycle requires
some GTFs to function at the termination step as well. Evidence from my laboratory
and others has demonstrated that the general transcription factor TFIIB has an
evolutionarily conserved role in termination of transcription. My laboratory has further
implicated TFIIB in promoter directionality. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that
the mechanistic basis of TFIIB action is, in both cases, dependent on its ability to
interact with the termination factors and facilitate their recruitment on the gene. An
investigation into the role of TFIIB in termination and directionality is critical to
understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and may provide clues into the
role TFIIB plays in several diseases. The overall objective of this application is to
determine the prevalence and the molecular basis underlying termination of
transcription and promoter directionality by TFIIB. The central hypothesis of this
application is that TFIIB is involved in termination and promoter directionality of at least
a subset of genes. We propose that these apparently unrelated processes rely on the
ability of TFIIB to recruit termination factors. To accomplish the objectives of the
proposal, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Genomewide analysis of TFIIB
functions in termination and promoter directionality; (2) Elucidate the molecular basis
underlying role of TFIIB in termination and promoter directionality; (3) Purification and
characterization of the holo-TFIIB complex. The successful completion of this proposal
will enable us to comprehend the role of transcription factors in the broader context, and
will serve as a paradigm for understanding the coordination among steps of the
transcription cycle in yeast and mammalian systems."

The accurate segregation of chromosomes by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle during mitosis is
essential for the preservation of genomic integrity. Errors in mitotic spindle function lead to chromosome
missegregation, aneuploidy, and the formation of micronuclei, all hallmarks of tumor cells. Molecular motors
of the kinesin superfamily play important mechanical roles in controlling the movement and organization of
chromosomes within the spindle, including the generation of forces on chromosome arms, regulation of
spindle microtubule length changes, and the crosslinking and sliding of microtubule overlaps. Many of the
molecular mechanisms underlying kinesin function in cells remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to
fill knowledge gaps in our understanding of how kinesins function at the molecular level to ensure the accuracy
of mitotic chromosome segregation. How do the structures of kinesins tune their activities for particular roles
in cells? How are these activities spatially and temporally regulated? What is the molecular basis for cell type
specific requirements of kinesin function? What are the short and long-term consequences of abnormal
kinesin activities? An interdisciplinary approach combining biophysics, quantitative live cell imaging, and
structural mutagenesis will be employed to address these outstanding questions across biological scales from
the single molecule to single cell, to tissue and whole organism levels. This administrative supplement
application seeks funds to purchase a spinning disk microscope system essential for successfully addressing
these questions."

 This proposal will be focused on the understanding of mechanisms of two fundamental
biological phenomena in eukaryotes: the circadian clock and codon usage bias. Circadian
clocks control diverse cellular, physiological, and behavioral processes in eukaryotic organisms.
Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that permit the
measurement of time and the output of circadian rhythms in eukaryotic circadian clocks. Our
previous studies made fundamental contributions to the understanding of the eukaryotic
circadian clock mechanisms. Synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies in all
genomes examined, a phenomenon called codon usage bias. Even though the phenomenon of
codon usage bias has been known for several decades, the functions and mechanisms of
codon usage bias are unclear. Our previous work demonstrate that codon usage is a novel layer
of the genetic code that can determine both gene expression levels and protein structures. Our
lab uses Neurospora, Drosophila and mammalian systems to study these two phenomena.
 For the circadian clock project, we propose to focus on several key aspects of the
circadian oscillator mechanism in both Neurospora and mammalian clock systems. We will
determine the role and mechanism of FRQ-CK1a interaction in circadian period determination in
Neurospora. In addition, we will expand our study into a mammalian system by determining the
role of the PERIOD-CK1 interaction in the mammalian circadian clock. These studies will
establish a conserved mechanism for period determination in fungi and animals. Although FRQ
in Neurospora and PER proteins in animals are not considered homologous, most of the
domains in both proteins are predicted to be intrinsically disordered and both are progressively
phosphorylated. We will determine how FRQ and PER function in the circadian clock using
biochemical and molecular methods. For the codon usage project, we will build on our ground-
breaking discoveries on the roles and mechanisms of codon usage biases in determining gene
expression and protein structures. We will determine the mechanism of the codon usage effect
on gene transcription in Neurospora based on a previously performed large-scale genetic
screen. This study will reveal the mechanisms that underlie the conserved effect of codon usage
on gene transcription. We will evaluate how codon usage influences gene expression in mice by
creating an in vivo codon usage reporter. This study will establish the mechanism that
contributes to effects of codon usage on tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression in
mammals. In addition, we will develop a method to modulate translation elongation speed based
on the role of codon usage in regulating protein folding that will have potential for use in
treatment of many diseases. Together, these studies will address fundamental questions that
are critical for our understanding of these two biological phenomena in eukaryotes."
11098841,"Abstract of Parent Award: (R01 GM141284 “The role of geometric structure in avoidance of oxygen rebound
to enable aliphatic halogenation and oxacyclization by non-heme Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) complexes”)
Iron(II)- and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases catalyze hydroxylation, halogenation, cyclization,
dehydrogenation, and stereoinversion of aliphatic carbon centers, C–H-bond-activation reactions that collectively
represent a holy grail of synthetic chemistry. Biosynthetic pathways to important natural-product drugs are
replete with these enzymes, and the pharmaceutical industry is beginning to leverage evolved versions of
Fe/2OG oxygenases as biocatalysts for ""green"" processes to their synthetic drugs. Recent studies of Fe/2OG
hydroxylases, halogenases and cyclases by the Penn State group show that the disposition of the substrate
relative to the common iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) and iron(III)-hydroxo/substrate-radical intermediates may be crucial
for control of reaction outcome. On the basis of data available so far, we hypothesize that the structural
rearrangement of the metallocofactor rather than the substrate positioning is the primary factor directing
regioselectivity. Therefore, in this work, we will perform spectroscopic characterization of faithful reactive-state
analogs to gain first-hand insight as to how the individual enzymes adjust the structure of the active complex and
to uncover common modes that direct reactivities in the superfamily of Fe/2OG oxygenases. In this project, we
will innovate and deploy a suite of novel intermediate mimics and spectroscopic probes/methodologies to resolve
the geometries of the key intermediate states in the pharmaceutically relevant subclasses of Fe/2OG enzymes.
Our elucidation of how the cofactor structures and relative dispositions of the substrates dictate the divergent
outcomes will inform efforts to discover novel members of this superfamily and assign their phenotypes.
Ultimately, information obtained in this project will be instrumental in developing new biocatalysts for drug
synthesis."

 Nitrogen-rich small molecules are critical to human health as they constitute the vast majority of all known
pharmaceutical agents. As the requirements for new drugs become stricter, and as the diseases that are targeted
become more complex, the chemical structures of those compounds are also becoming more complex. This is
driving the need for more efficient means to prepare ever more complex nitrogen-containing small molecules.
 The parent R01 Research Project (R01GM145617-03) focuses on the development of new synthetic chemistry
methods for preparing nitrogen-rich small molecules by developing novel reactions of electrophilic nitrogen
centers. This program relies heavily on the use of High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) to accomplish these
goals, but we are currently very limited in our ability to accurately and rapidly measure solids into the 96-well
plates used in these work flows. The propose instrument will automate these steps, while providing much greater
accuracy and speed. In addition, the on-deck balance of the propose instrument will provide us with exact
quantities of added reagents in these experiments, which is critical for accuracy and is currently data we are not
able to obtain using the manual pipet methods we are currently employing. The proposed instrument will greatly
expand our ability to investigate solid reagents in HTE studies, and thus greatly expedite the proposed research
from the parent award."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play essential roles in the central regulation of
energy and glucose homeostasis. BDNF signaling greatly influences many aspects of neuronal function,
including survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity and transmission. Deficits in BDNF function have been
linked to over feeding and severe obesity in humans and mice. Accordingly, we showed that mice with BDNF
depletion in the brain (BDNF2L/2LCk-cre) exhibit increased food intake, obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.
Diminished a2d-1 (Cacna2d1) function in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice contributes
to the metabolic alterations that they exhibit. In support, viral-mediated rescue of deficient a2d-1 expression in
the VMH of BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice mitigated their hyperphagia and obesity. Importantly, it dramatically improved
hepatic lipid accumulation and normalized deficits in glycemic control even though rescued mutants remained
significantly heavier than wild type controls. Furthermore, a2d-1 knock down in the adult VMH resulted in
susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO). a2d-1 serves as a receptor for astrocyte-derived thrombospondins
(TSP) to mediate excitatory synapse assembly. Electrophysiological analysis indicates that the metabolic effects
of a2d-1 are related changes in the excitatory tone onto VMH neurons, implicating thrombospondin signaling.
This project will test the hypothesis that TSP/a2d-1 signaling in the VMH facilitates synaptic remodeling during
conditions of positive energy balance to increase the excitatory drive onto neurons mediating energy, glucose
and lipid homeostasis. Aim 1 will determine how gain or loss of a2d-1 function in the adult VMH affects metabolic
function and mechanisms activated by a2d-1 that prevent hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance during
obesogenic conditions. Aim 2 will examine the effects of gain or loss of astrocytic TSP function in the adult VMH
in the regulation of metabolic function and whether these effects are a2d-1-dependent. Aim 3 will determine
whether a2d-1 and TSP mediates the effects of caloric status on the excitatory synaptic physiology and activity
of VMH neurons. Finally, Aim 4 will map the connectivity of VMH a2d-1+ neurons, examine their responses to
caloric signals in vivo and the effects of stimulating or inhibiting these cells on metabolic function. Findings from
this project will inform novel mechanisms facilitating metabolic health in individuals who are persistently
overweight and new targets for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction. Importantly, they have the potential to
inform pathological mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in individuals administered the anti-epileptic
and anti-nociceptive drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind and inhibit a2d-1."
11099060,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Aggregates of amyloid peptides, such as amyloid fibrils are highly cytotoxic, as exemplified by the role of amyloid
β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease. To maintain a healthy proteome, a number of proteases target the monomeric
form of amyloid peptides because this form fuels both seeding and elongation of amyloid fibrils. Insulin degrading
enzyme (IDE) is a 110 kDa metalloprotease that degrades various amyloid peptides, including Aβ and three
blood glucose-regulating hormones, namely insulin, amylin, and glucagon. Defects in IDE alter the progression
of type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease in animal models and are linked to these diseases in humans.
IDE inhibitors can control blood glucose level in mice and hold promise for treating diabetes. One of the key
steps in the IDE catalytic cycle is the selective recognition and unfolding of amyloid peptides prior to degradation.
Our premise is that the understudied conformational dynamics of IDE provide the mechanical basis for the
unfolding of peptide substrates. Thus, we can leverage our understanding of these processes to selectively
modulate the activity of IDE towards specific substrates. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the molecular
details of how IDE selectively recognizes amyloid peptides and utilize this knowledge to develop novel IDE-
based therapies to improve the human condition. Toward this goal, we have integrated ensemble structural
determination and solution-based methods to show that IDE is a member of the chamber-containing protease,
aka cryptidase, family that uses a sizable catalytic chamber to engulf monomeric amyloid peptides. We have
also generated a working model that explains how IDE uses two key conformational switches to selectively
degrade amyloid peptides. Our objectives for this application are to determine key unsolved conformational
states and probe the conformational dynamics of IDE during the catalytic cycle by applying state-of-art integrative
structural approaches. We will then combine MD simulation and screening to identify strategies to modulate the
catalytic activity and selectivity of IDE. Our research rationale is that a deeper understanding of the regulation
and functions of IDE will allow us to modulate its activity through engineering or novel small molecules and
ultimately facilitate the design of IDE-based therapies to combat proteostatic imbalances. We will use time-
resolved cryoEM and SAXS to understand the structural basis for substrate recognition during the key time
window when IDE first encounters substrate in combination with advanced cryoEM image processing algorithms
and MD simulation to address how IDE motions can unfold physiologically relevant substrates. We will apply the
knowledge gained from the substrate recognition and unfolding studies to develop a screening strategy to identify
methods to selectively modulate the degradation of Aβ by IDE. This work will significantly enhance our
understanding of the IDE catalytic cycle by defining key conformational states under physiologically relevant
conditions and offer a platform to merge integrative structural analysis and MD simulation towards the discovery
of innovative enzyme modulating strategies as the developmental foundation of novel IDE-based therapies."

The continuing discoveries of RNAs and their critical roles in cellular and viral machinery
are inspiring novel antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, and genome-editing therapies
based on disabling, manipulating, and repurposing the RNAs involved. Unfortunately,
our poor biophysical understanding of `how RNAs work' is slowing the development of
these potentially life-saving efforts. A critical bottleneck has been the inapplicability of
crystallography, NMR, phylogenetic analysis, and biochemical methods to determine the
partly ordered conformations of non-coding RNAs in all their functional states. To resolve
this bottleneck, we are advancing experimental methods and complementary
computational approaches that give rich information sufficient to infer and engineer RNA
secondary and tertiary structures and their heterogeneous ensembles, evaluated
through community-wide blind trials, prospective compensatory mutation/rescue
experiments, and global RNA design challenges. Here, we continue research that will
rigorously address four biomedically significant problems that have so far seen limited
progress in molecular modeling efforts: the heterogeneity of RNA structures within their
native cellular and viral contexts; modeling and design of RNA's biological interactions
with proteins and other molecules, modulated by chemical modification; high-accuracy
calculation of RNA folding energetics; and the automated design of dynamic 3D RNA
structures for eventual medical applications. We will evaluate success through
continuing blind trials, independent tests by more than a dozen expert biological and
bioengineering collaborators, and through adoption of our methods and software tools by
the broader research community. In the same way that specialized structural biology
tools and computational design are establishing a firm understanding of protein behavior
and regulation, we propose that the technologies outlined here will transform our
understanding of structure in non-coding RNAs, providing a stronger basis for their
biomedical activation or disruption."

The long-term research program in the Xiao lab focuses on structural and biochemical studies of innate immune
signaling, particularly the inflammasome pathways. Activation of inflammasomes may lead to the maturation and
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18, as well as pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory
form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD) and other gasdermin family members downstream of
diverse signaling pathways implicated in infections and autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders. As such,
understanding the mechanisms of gasdermin regulation is highly significant. Despite recent progress on the
identification of gasdermins as effectors of pyroptosis, and on the mechanisms of GSDMD activation by
inflammatory caspases, contributed by the Xiao lab and others, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of gasdermin function remain incompletely understood. In particular, gasdermin processing by
different caspases and other proteases that may activate or suppress pyroptosis remain understudied. Even
though protease processing, an irreversible form of post-translational modification (PTM), is the most intensively
studied mechanisms of gasdermin regulation, emerging evidence suggests that gasdermins are regulated by
several other PTMs such as ubiquitination and Cys modifications. The regulation of gasdermins by host and
microbial proteases, ubiquitin ligases, and palmitoyltransferases remain key knowledge gaps that have
hampered mechanistic understanding of pyroptosis regulation under physiological and pathological conditions.
This proposal is based on emerging evidence from the rapidly evolving field of gasdermin biology that serve as
strong scientific premise and rationale. The proposed studies leverage our expertise in structural and
biochemical studies of gasdermin activation by inflammatory caspases, and target critical gaps in our
understanding of gasdermin regulation using complementary structure-function approaches. We hypothesize
that post-translational modifications of gasdermins by host and microbial enzymes, such as proteases,
ubiquitin ligases, palmitoyltransferases, and other enzymes, regulate their function in pyroptosis. Better
understanding of how gasdermins are regulated will not only furnish new insights into pyroptosis modulation, but
also stimulate the development of novel therapeutics that target gasdermins and pyroptosis. Overall, this
proposal builds upon the PI’s past research program that enables the long-term pursuit of the mechanisms for
gasdermin regulation on a scale that is broadly compatible with the MIRA mechanism."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous neurological disorder characterized by autoimmune inflammation
coupled to demyelination and eventual neurodegeneration, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide.
Relaxation-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive in revealing macroscopic tissue abnormalities
in the brain, they are not specific to the pathological substrate of the MS lesion and have a limited prognostic
role. These methods are sensitive to the MS lesions in white matter (WM), characterization of MS lesions in the
cerebral cortex has been proven to be difficult by clinical MRI. Advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques offer
the potential to improve the understanding of axon and dendrites damage in MS. Quantitative susceptibility
mapping (QSM), as a novel MRI technique, has been demonstrated to show high correlations with myelin and
iron content. Our long-term goal is to develop specific and reliable whole brain imaging biomarkers for early
diagnosis of MS and monitoring the disease progression. We have developed the whole mouse brain dMRI and
QSM methods at 25 µm isotropic resolution using 3D under sampling acquisition and nonlinear reconstruction.
Our recent results have showed that QSM of corpus callosum decreases significantly (more diamagnetic) after
2 weeks cuprizone administration. Our hypothesis is that combining novel dMRI and QSM technologies at
high spatial resolution affords robust and quantitative imaging-based biomarkers of MS by detecting the
progression of iron dysregulation, demyelination, and axon damage through the whole brain. In this
proposal, we will perform both in vivo and ex vivo MRI to quantify the whole brain demyelination, iron
dysregulation, and axon damage using Thy-1 YFP-16 transgenic mice with cuprizone administration. The QSM
values and dMRI outcomes from basic diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model to the advanced neurite orientation
dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) model will be measured at
different timing points (Aim 1). Currently, directly correlating MRI findings to histology is still challenging due to
the limited spatial resolution and various image contrasts derived from water diffusion, relaxation, and magnetic
susceptibility characteristics. The 3D MRI quantitative mappings will be validated against with the whole brain
light sheet microscopy (LSM) at each timing point. The imaging-based biomarkers will be observed by the voxel-
based comparison between MRI and LSM. The 3D co-registration comparison will also help us to fundamentally
understand the origin of MR image contrasts and properties (Aim 2). The high-resolution multidimensional brain
atlas at each timing point will be generated and shared at both Waxholm space and Allen Brain Mouse Atlas
space at different spatial resolution, from 25 µm to 200 µm isotropic resolution (Aim 3). This project is expected
to provide novel insights to improve the specificity of MRI for the diagnosis of MS and understand the complex
mechanism of the disease."

 The long-term goal of our research program is to develop general and selective nitrogen atom transfer
methods that can generate new molecular entities through precise functionalization of both complex molecules
and simple commodity chemicals. A large number of therapeutic molecules and small-molecule biological
probes have at least one nitrogen atom; therefore, synthetic methods based on direct nitrogen atom transfer to
organic molecules are important synthetic tools. Although a variety of valuable olefin amination methods have
been established, new selective nitrogen atom transfer methods based on novel reaction mechanisms are still
urgently needed which can be effective and exquisitely selective across a broad range of substrates and
thereby fill important gaps of existing synthetic approaches. Inspired by these outstanding synthetic challenges,
we intend to discover new reactivity in three directions of selective nitrogen atom transfer and we will develop
new synthetic methods that hold the promise to become unique and enabling tools for organic synthesis and
medicinal chemistry.
 First, we will explore uncharted territory in iron catalysis and discover the iron-catalyzed olefin
amination that does not involve radical intermediates and would thereby be compatible with a range of
functional groups which are problematic with the alternative amination methods. Completion of this project will
provide effective methods for selective olefin amination in complex molecules. Next, we will discover a
fundamentally new cis-glycosylation reaction that does not proceed through an oxocarbenium ion and develop
a series of iron-catalyzed one-step glycal amidoglycosylation methods that efficiently connect glycals and
glycosyl acceptors to selectively afford 1,2-cis-amido glycosidic linkages that are known to be difficult to form
reliably in high stereoselectivity using traditional glycosylation methods. Completion of this project will provide
an array of unique methods that fill an important gap in complex-carbohydrate synthesis. Furthermore, we will
explore an entirely new HN3 activation mechanism and develop a range of metal-free methods that enable
direct addition of HN3 at ambient temperature across a wide variety of unactivated olefins for azido-group
labeling of complex molecules. Completion of this project will provide a valuable tool of azido-group labeling for
applications in synthetic chemistry and chemical biology."

Reproducible assembly of protein molecules from free amino acids requires external information stored
in DNA/RNA (genome). In contrast, assembly of higher-order structures from individual protein molecules
is thought to occur de novo, relying on information intrinsic to each protein component. How higher-order
complexity emerges efficiently without error using only the scattered information in each building block
remains a question hindering core understandings of life. Here we address this question using the
biogenesis of the centriole organelle as the example. We found that a proteinaceous structure called the
cartwheel is grown inside existing centrioles, which is then split, shed and used as structural templates
(or guidance) for reproducing a copy of the centriole with the same size/shape. Uncontrolled cartwheel
shedding was further found to underly a human disease called Alström syndrome. By erasing the old
guidance, we showed that new/naive centrioles varying widely in size and shape arise, which can
propagate reproducibly thereafter in cells otherwise genetically identical. The simplest model explaining
our results is that one or more steps of centriole biogenesis are template-based, instructed by information
stored and transmitted outside of the genome. This model on which the current proposal is based on will
shed light on how cellular complexity emerges reproducibly from components randomly distributed in the
cell, redefining the scope of biological information as we currently understood."

the U.S. who having smoking-attributable diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, lung and other cancers, 
respiratory disease). ATI-1013’s MOA reduces nicotine exposure without acting on nicotinic receptors, offering 
a novel strategy compared to existing smoking cessation medications. 
The overarching objective of this proposal is to progress development of ATI-1013 from its current “mid” preclinical development stage to an approved IND for subsequent conduct of a first in human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical

cortical (CSTC) circuitry, involving the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and striatum, at rest and in 
response to affective and attentional tasks. However, findings have been mixed, perhaps in part due to the 
heterogeneity of tasks that are presumed to mirror OCD-relevant processes. Advances in the understanding of 
the basic neural mechanisms of threat-related behavior offer a promising path forward. Experimental research 
has identified neural circuitry implicated in a wide range of defensive behaviors that protect against threats of 
varying severity, predictability, and imminence. This literature has largely focused on active avoidance, in 
which the individual moves away from the source of perceived threat, and passive avoidance, in which the 
individual withholds an action to avoid encountering a perceived threat. However, compulsions in OCD are 
distinct from active and passive avoidance in that they consist of repetitive, often highly effortful behavior 
aimed at neutralizing a perceived threat, a phenomenon which has received limited attention to date. This is a 
significant omission, given that compulsions contribute substantially to distress and impairment. To address 
this gap, we propose a cross-sectional, task-based neuroimaging approach investigate behavioral and neural 
biomarkers related to effortful neutralization of threat (ENT) in OCD. Individuals with OCD (n=35) and healthy 
comparison individuals with no psychiatric diagnoses (HC; n=35) will complete a novel fMRI paradigm 
developed by the RPL, the Tap-To-Safety (TTS) task, which is the first to directly elicit repetitive, effortful, 
threat-neutralizing behavior. The task will assess ENT in various threat contexts, and will measure neural 
activity associated with stimulus onset and decision-making. We hypothesize that individuals with OCD will 
demonstrate excessive neutralization behavior during the task, as well as heightened activity in and 
connectivity within CTSC circuitry during the task. The RPL is currently conducting a funded pilot study with 
healthy participants to inform task development; the aims of the current proposal therefore focus on identifying 
OCD-specific patterns of behavior and neural activity associated with ENT. The ultimate aim is to establish 
foundational knowledge regarding decision-making in OCD for future research involving treatment outcome 
prediction and novel treatment development."

disorder. When it comes to decision-making, individuals with MUD often prioritize drug over non-drug rewards 
despite negative life consequences; in addition, they may not sufficiently “explore” all available choices to 
“exploit” the best one (in other words, make the optimal choice leading to positive consequences). Therefore, 
the “explore-exploit” trade-off is often dysfunctional in MUD. Decision-making imbalances in the explore-exploit 
trade-off may extend well into abstinence, a period marked by a negative affective state (low mood, high 
depression and anxiety, withdrawal), which in turn triggers heightened craving and subsequent drug use urges. 
The insula, anterior cingulate cortex and striatum are crucial brain regions involved in explore-exploit behaviors 
and affective state signaling that have also been linked to drug reward processing in MUD. We propose that 
reducing negative affective state (improving mood) could help normalize explore-exploit behaviors and the 
response of these brain areas in individuals currently abstinent from methamphetamine and other drugs. This 
project will use a non-drug-related autobiographical memory recall to improve the mood of individuals with 
MUD and measure whether it normalizes non-drug decision-making, using a functional magnetic resonance 
imaging-based 3-arm bandit task and a behavioral contextual reinforcement learning task. A mixed 
experimental design in n=80 (72 completers, assuming 10% attrition) allows the identification of a between 
subjects 
effect of positive (n=40, 36 completers) vs. neutral (n=40, 36 completers) mood modulation and 
assess the within-subject impact on explore-exploit behaviors pre- versus post-mood modulation. Mood groups 
will be compared on positive and negative affect, and behavioral/brain responses to reward valuation, 
outcomes and learning rates. The overarching goal is to establish that improving mood in individuals with MUD 
can [1] reduce their negative affective state, [2] normalize outcome sensitivity in key brain regions and 
associated learning, and [3] reduce the influence of drug rewards on the valuation of non-drug rewards. This 
approach of this proposal embodies the goals of the NIH RDoC Initiative and the NeuroMAP Center by 
identifying an actionable disease-modifying target (mood) and studying its effect on the cognitive and neural 
dysfunction underlying a specific cognitive process (explore-exploit behaviors) relevant to MUD, and possibly 
other related neuropsychiatric disorders. By targeting the intertwined mechanisms between negative affect and 
explore-exploit biases, innovative, effective intervention strategies for MUD may be unveiled, addressing a 
critical public health challenge."

are leading causes of childhood disease, accounting for a large proportion of hospitalizations, Emergency
Department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits annually in the US. These illnesses are caused by diverse
pathogens, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses,
rhinovirus, enterovirus (EV), coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2, adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus,
and sapovirus. Moreover, some of these viruses are associated with other emerging childhood syndromes,
including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) associated with EV, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children
(MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral AGE and ARI are of major public health importance, and
result in serious long-term consequences for some children. There are few or no effective antivirals for these
viruses and vaccination is the most promising intervention. Our goals are to conduct active, prospective
population-based surveillance for AGE and ARI; to define the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases;
describe the clinical features, natural history, and population dynamics; and establish vaccine effectiveness
(VE) of licensed and impending vaccines and monitor VE over time. The New Vaccine Surveillance Network
(NVSN) will facilitate these goals. We propose four Specific Aims:
Aim 1: to conduct prospective active surveillance for AGE due to norovirus, rotavirus, and other
enteric viruses among children seeking healthcare in ED, inpatient, and outpatient settings.
(Component A, Mandatory Component 1; Optional Component B)
Aim 2: to conduct prospective active surveillance for ARI due to respiratory viruses in these settings.

million people and admits >95% of hospitalized children in the surrounding county of >1.2 million. Thus, the
environment is excellent for population-based research. The experienced investigative team includes experts
from pediatric infectious diseases, critical care, rheumatology, and cardiology. The data and samples collected
in this project will facilitate the capacity to calculate VE for multiple licensed and pending vaccines. The results
of this project will inform best practices for diagnosis and treatment, guide vaccine recommendations, and
determine public health interventions to prevent viral illness-related medical visits among children."

healthy control (HC) surveillance in children at SCH and affiliated clinics in the Seattle
metropolitan area. We will enroll subjects to describe the population-based burden of AGE and
ARI in King County and Snohomish County, WA and evaluate effectiveness of licensed
vaccines, such as influenza (Flu) and rotavirus (RV) vaccine (vx). We will assess the
epidemiology and natural history of pediatric respiratory and enteric viral diseases and assess
transmission dynamics for vx-preventable (RV, Flu) and potentially vx-preventable pathogens,
such as norovirus (NV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. After obtaining
informed consent and assent, if applicable, in English or Spanish, we will interview families to
collect epidemiological and clinical information, vaccine history, and obtain study specimens
including respiratory and/or stool specimens, depending on clinical symptoms. Vaccination data
are recorded in our state vaccine database, which is very reliable and complete. During times of
COVID-19, novel methods of enrollment and capturing data may be utilized as per IRB-
approved protocols including verbal or online consent, telephone interviews to complete data
capture, and home specimen collection. Respiratory specimens and stool samples will be tested
for multiple respiratory and enteric pathogens using sensitive and specific molecular PCR tests
in laboratories using approved testing strategies that have been validated by proficiency testing.
With this information, in addition to publicly available state-wide data describing inpatient and
acute care visits in WA, we will obtain incidence rates of ED and inpatient visits and
characterization of illness for multiple viral pathogens, including those responsible for vx-
preventable disease and potentially vx-preventable disease, and others related to acute
respiratory and enteric diseases, such as rhinovirus, EVD-68, parainfluenza viruses,
adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus. Additionally, we will continue ongoing surveillance

The Kansas City-New Vaccine Surveillance Network (KC-NVSN) program has been performing
population-based, laboratory-confirmed, active surveillance of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) illness
and acute respiratory illness (ARI) in children seeking care at Children’s Mercy (CM), in Kansas
City (KC), MO since 2009 and 2015, respectively.
In the current proposal, the KC-NVSN program seeks to continue the existing pediatric AGE and
expand the pediatric ARI surveillance to the six county KC metropolitan area for children seen in
CM’s inpatient and emergency department (ED) settings. Age- and time-matched healthy control
children seeking well-child care in the outpatient setting will also be enrolled. We will enroll eligible
children (as defined in the proposal) visiting or admitted to our hospital system using permission
and assent forms approved by CM’s institutional review board (IRB). After enrollment, we will
interview parents, collect EMR chart data, and retrieve hard copies of receipt of influenza and
rotavirus (RV) vaccine, and any future vaccines (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, NoV). Stool specimens will
be tested for RV, norovirus (NoV), and other GI pathogens, and respiratory specimens for 23
respiratory pathogens, e.g., influenza (types and specific subtypes) and other non-influenza
viruses (RSV, EV-D68, and SARS-CoV-2, etc). We will use prospective surveillance for acute
flaccid myelitis (AFM) characterizing the clinical disease spectrum and burden rates. KC-NVSN
data will provide population-based estimates to address the following specific aims:
 1. To assess the burden of AGE and ARI pathogens among enrolled children.
2. To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended illness due to RV,
 influenza, and upcoming vaccines via laboratory-confirmed testing among enrolled children.
 3. To assess AFM clinical spectra and burden and associations with ARI and AGE illnesses.
The KC-NVSN program data will be combined with other geographically diverse sites’ data to
estimate the national incidence, burden, and etiology of community-acquired AGE and ARI and
VE for rotavirus and seasonal influenza vaccinations. This network will also address several
important scientific questions related to the natural history of pediatric infectious diseases,
transmission dynamics, impact of vaccine on targeted and vulnerable populations, and factors
influencing VE. The surveillance data generated from this network will provide timely and highly
useful data to inform public health measures and pediatric vaccine-related policies aimed at

11099179,"Bacterial biofilms are a public health threat because they cause chronic and hospital-acquired infections but are
resistant to antibiotics. Failure to characterize the biochemical machinery that drives biofilm dispersal risks
missing key targets for treatment of infectious disease. Although nitric oxide (NO)-triggered biofilm dispersal in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), a principal pathogen in cystic fibrosis and hospital-acquired infections, is well
documented, the underlying biochemical processes responsible are not understood. To bridge this knowledge
gap, a long-term goal of the PI is to determine the mechanism of NO signaling in bacteria and to use this
knowledge to develop therapeutic strategies to disperse biofilms. In her previous RO1 funding period, the PI
established the NosP (NO sensing protein) family of hemoproteins, which were discovered in her laboratory, as
NO sensors that regulate biofilm in many bacteria. Based on studies from the previous funding period, the
objective of the proposed work is to characterize the NosP-associated histidine kinase (NahK) and determine
the molecular mechanism underlying NO/NosP/NahK regulation of biofilm and virulence in PA. It is hypothesized
that NO produced downstream of RsmA binds NosP to trigger biofilm dispersal through NahK and the GacS/Rsm
MKN. The GacS/Rsm MKN integrates signals from many sensor kinases to control RsmA, the master regulator
of motility/acute infection v. biofilm/chronic infection in PA. The proposal is innovative because it challenges the
established GacS/Rsm MKN and forges new logical connections between anaerobic respiration, NO, biofilm,
and virulence. This proposal is significant because elucidation of the basis for NO signaling in PA will open new
therapeutic opportunities for controlling infection caused by this important human pathogen. The hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to identify NosP/NahK interactions within the GacS/Rsm MKN; (2)
to delineate the role of NosP/NahK in modulation of RsmA-controlled phenotypes; and (3) to establish the link
between RsmA-regulated denitrification and NosP/NahK signaling. Under aim 1, NahK protein-protein and
phosphotransfer interactions with GacS/Rsm MKN members will be characterized as a function of NO/NosP
regulation. Under aim 2, the effect of NO/NosP/NahK on virulence, quorum sensing, and cyclic-di-GMP pathways
controlled by the RsmA will be quantified. Under aim 3, the effect of NO/NosP/NahK on RsmA-controlled
denitrification will be quantified and investigated as a regulatory feedback loop. The PI has significant experience
with the proposed assays. Upon completion of these aims, NO/NosP/NahK is expected to be established in
controlling the GacS/Rsm motility/virulence switch. This would represent a fundamentally important discovery,
defining a new signaling pathway and novel antibiotic targets, for which there is a pressing need, especially
considering the increased antibiotic resistance typically seen in biofilming organisms. NO-triggered biofilm
dispersal has been widely observed in bacteria, so clinical interventions based on NO signaling have the potential
for widespread application, furthering the significance of this project."

The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate specific crosstalk mechanisms between the integrated stress
response (ISR) and circadian timekeeping, two fundamental biological processes in neurons. Circadian rhythm
regulates neuronal differentiation, plasticity, and tissue regeneration and its disruption contributes to a variety of
human health problems. Circadian clock genes are widely expressed in almost all cells. To function properly, the
cellular clock must integrate and synchronize with cellular physiology and metabolism. ISR is a conserved
intracellular signaling network for cells to respond to stressors and restore homeostasis. Little is known, however,
on whether and how ISR integrates with the circadian clock, which forms a major gap in our understanding of
homeostatic integration in neurons. Our recently published work indicates that ISR may be a conserved
mechanism that couples cellular stress response to circadian timekeeping. Based on the published work and
unpublished preliminary data, here we propose to test the overall hypothesis that ISR interacts with the
mammalian circadian clock: ISR regulates fundamental clock properties including entrainment and
circadian period, whereas the clock controls ISR response based on the time of day. We will leverage our
expertise and unique mouse models to test the hypothesis using a combination of molecular, cellular, and
behavioral approaches. Aim 1 will define a role for the ISR inhibitor IMPACT (imprinted and ancient gene protein)
in regulating photic entrainment of the circadian clock. Aim 2 will identify a role for unfolded protein response
and PERK (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) in circadian timekeeping. Aim 3 will elucidate
eIF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2)-dependent translational control mechanisms in the circadian
clock. The proposed work is innovative, because it utilizes new mouse genetic tools to address conceptually
novel questions regarding the crosstalk mechanisms between ISR and the clock. The contributions are expected
to be significant, because it is expected to uncover mechanistic links between the two fundamentally important
cellular processes. Importantly, ISR frequently goes awry in complex brain disorders, which are often associated
with disrupted daily rhythms in patients due to unknown mechanisms. As ISR can be targeted by FDA-approved
drugs, understanding its role in circadian physiology may offer new opportunities to regulate the body clock
function and to treat clock dysfunctions in these diseases."

Copper is an essential micronutrient required for the growth and development of aerobic organisms. Copper
serves as a catalytic cofactor for many enzymes involved in various cellular pathways, the most important of
which is cytochrome c oxidase required for mitochondrial energy generation. Not surprisingly, mutations that
cause systemic or subcellular copper deficiency give rise to various fatal infantile disorders, including Menkes
disease and a subset of mitochondrial disorders. Despite decades of work, there are currently no approved
treatments for these lethal disorders, which in large part reflects a limited understanding of the mechanisms by
which copper is trafficked to mitochondria and the role it plays in mitochondrial metabolism. Filling this knowledge
gap will require a multidisciplinary approach that leverages the strengths of different model organisms to
understand the mechanisms by which copper is transported, stored, and distributed within cells. Over the last
decade, we have taken a multidisciplinary approach to discover new players in copper transport and delivery to
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. Through these efforts, we have identified a promising copper-transporting
drug, elesclomol, that circumvents disease-causing mutations in the mitochondrial copper acquisition by
promoting copper delivery to cytochrome c oxidase and restoring aerobic respiration. Building on this success,
we will now focus on identifying critical regulators of mitochondrial copper by leveraging our copper-deficient
yeast, zebrafish, and mouse models to decipher the fundamental roles of copper in mitochondrial metabolism.
The overarching goals of our research program are to 1) determine the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial
copper acquisition and delivery to cytochrome c oxidase; 2) identify novel roles of copper within the mitochondrial
matrix; and 3) develop small molecule adjuvants to enhance the efficacy and safety of elesclomol. To achieve
these goals, we will employ genomic, proteomic, and small molecule screens in copper-deficient yeast models
to identify endogenous copper-transporting molecules, new copper-dependent mitochondrial metabolic
pathways, and small molecules that improve the therapeutic properties of elesclomol. We will translate these
discoveries to mammalian model systems to significantly advance our understanding of mitochondrial copper
biology."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by α-synuclein-rich
neuronal inclusions. Recent genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) and epidemiological studies have
identified multiple candidate genes and environmental factors which can modify PD risk. However, studying
polygenic interactions with environmental factors has been difficult due to the lack of a model system. However,
studies have hinted at a complex relationship between α-synuclein, genetic risk factors, and environmental
factors. In our preliminary data, we have established a multiplex model using the Drosophila model of PD. In this
model, we express human α-synuclein, simultaneously modify GWAS candidate genes in neurons, and expose
adult flies to rotenone. Using a combination of scalable techniques in this model, we identified novel interactions
among α-synuclein, environmental factors, and GWAS genes. The overarching hypothesis is a multiplex
model, in combination with iPSC-derived neurons, can be used to identify and study the mechanism of
novel gene-environment interactions. Further, this model system will identify potential drug targets that
can modify the gene-environment interactions.
In Aim 1, a series of experiments, including super-resolution microscopy and iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) neurons, will be performed to characterize the interaction among LRRK2, rotenone, and α-synuclein, which
was identified using the multiplex model. Aim 2 will involve understanding the mechanism of interactions among
LRRK2, rotenone, and α-synuclein. Previous studies and preliminary experiments have shown that actin
hyperstabilization plays a central role in regulating neurotoxicity. Herein biochemical, immunohistological, and
neurotoxicity assays will be performed in Drosophila and iPSC-derived TH neurons (obtained disease-causing
LRRK2-G2019S and protective LRRK2-R1398H iPSCs) to study the role of actin dynamics in regulating this
gene-environment interaction. Aim III will identify a druggable target that can modify the interaction among
LRRK2, rotenone, and α-synuclein. Further, we will screen for other PD-related neurotoxicants that interact with
LRRK2 and α-synuclein through actin hyperstabilization. Finally, we will genetically and pharmacologically inhibit
MRCKα, a kinase that can regulate actin hyperstabilization, in flies, iPSC-derived neurons, and a mouse model.
This project may elucidate a novel model system that can be used to identify and study the mechanism of gene-
environment interactions. My training during the K99 phase enabled me to transition to an independent position
at URMC. I will lead a laboratory investigating the molecular mechanisms of gene-environment interactions in
neurodegenerative disorders."

Embryogenesis from a fertilized egg into an individual is a precisely controlled process. One of the critical aspects
of embryogenesis is developmental patterning, which determines organ size and shape by orchestrating many
developmental and cellular events. Any abnormality from this patterning process will lead to congenital diseases
in humans. However, understanding the mechanisms that pattern embryos remains a central challenge in
developmental biology. The status quo of embryonic developmental patterning centers on the conceptual
framework that development is governed predominantly by morphogenetic proteins that activate transcription
factor networks in responding cells. The roles of bioelectricity in regulating embryonic developmental patterning
have just started to be recognized as a new mechanism of cellular signaling. Given many ion channels and
solute carriers are frequently involved in human congenital diseases, there is a critical need to understand ion
channel-mediated bioelectricity in developmental patterning. The lack of information about this bioelectric
patterning mechanism is a significant obstacle to understanding fundamental biological sciences and developing
therapeutic strategies for many human congenital diseases.
To address the demanding need, we will investigate the embryonic patterning mechanism of bioelectricity in the
zebrafish model using newly developed technologies for neuroscience, such as chemogenetic tools and
genetically encoded voltage indicators. Aim1. To elucidate the roles of bioelectricity in regulating zebrafish fin
patterning. Aim 2. To reveal the roles of bioelectricity in pigment cell patterning. With this long-studied pigment
system, we will further demonstrate bioelectricity as a general patterning mechanism in vertebrate
embryogenesis.
The expected outcomes will elucidate a less recognized developmental patterning mechanism by bioelectricity
in both zebrafish fin and skin pigment. This knowledge will establish a new concept for patterning in
developmental biology, provide the foundation for understanding vertebrate morphological diversity in evolution,
and principles for developing prevention or therapeutic strategies for congenital diseases."
11095328,"Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is associated with increased voiding frequency, nocturia, bladder fibrosis, and chronic pelvic pain. It affects between 2.5 to 6.7% of women in the United States. Current treatment options are ineffective for all patients and are associated with detrimental side effects. One understudied signaling peptide/hormone in IC/BPS is angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition to its role in vasoconstriction, water retention, and stress response, Ang II contributes to several diseases by promoting oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine release, and fibrosis, resulting in increased nociception and sensory sensitivity. However, compared to other organ systems (cardiac, kidneys, and lungs), relatively little is known about the function of Ang II signaling in the bladder under pathophysiologic conditions. There are several intriguing links between IC/BPS pathology and angiotensin signaling. 1) IC/BPS patients have increased infiltration of mast cells, which represent a source of increased renin and Ang II. 2) IC/BPS patients and animal disease models have increased bladder oxidative stress, and angiotensin signaling increases ROS production.
3) IC/BPS patients have increased expression of inflammatory mediators, which can be released by Ang II downstream signaling. 4) Fibrosis is observed in patients and animal models of IC/BPS, and Ang II signaling has been linked to fibrosis in heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Given the foundation of IC/BPS research demonstrating increases in local mast cells/macrophages, oxidative stress, inflammatory mediators, fibrosis, and the wealth of literature describing similar Ang II molecular signaling events in other tissues, we believe it is essential to further explore the role of Ang II in bladder diseases. We hypothesize that Ang II signaling plays a vital role in developing inflammation, oxidative damage, and fibrosis associated with an animal model of bladder dysfunction. We will test this hypothesis by dissecting the contribution of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) (Aim 1) and angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) (Aim 2) to the pathophysiologic symptoms of oxidative stress, the release of proinflammatory molecules, and fibrosis associated with a mouse model of IC/BPS-like symptoms. We will use pharmacological and transgenic approaches to determine the cell type expression of AT1R and AT2R in the bladder, how expression levels may change under disease conditions and their importance in developing and maintaining disease symptoms. This proposal will help determine the role of Ang II in IC/BPS, potentially opening this disease to treatment with the widely available and safe angiotensin signaling inhibitors, which would have a substantial impact on patient treatment options and quality of life."

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma that leads to irreversible vision
loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to dysfunction of trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue is a hallmark of
POAG. However, the pathological mechanisms leading to TM dysfunction and IOP elevation are poorly
understood. Our recent studies have shown that chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with
the pathophysiology of glaucomatous TM damage and IOP elevation. However, the exact mechanisms of TM
cell dysfunction/loss are not completely understood. The ER and mitochondria communicate constantly via
mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) to regulate vital cellular functions including autophagy.
Autophagy degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles including mitochondria (known as mitophagy)
via lysosomes. Impaired mitophagy is known to cause abnormal accumulation of damaged mitochondria
resulting into cell death. In our preliminary studies, primary human TM cells exhibited an abundant mitochondria
and MAMs. Interestingly, human primary TM cells and TM tissues from POAG donor eyes demonstrated
increased accumulation of mitochondria. Moreover, chronic ER stress-induced transcriptional factors, ATF4 and
CHOP led to increased reactive oxygen species and impaired mitophagy in primary human TM cells. Our overall
goals are to define the role of MAMs and impaired mitophagy in TM dysfunction and IOP elevation in POAG and
to further target these pathways for the treatment of glaucoma. We hypothesize that chronic ER stress induces
impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to TM dysfunction/loss and IOP elevation in POAG.
We will determine whether impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with TM
dysfunction and IOP elevation in human and mouse glaucoma (Aim 1). We will further determine whether chronic
ER stress induces impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to TM dysfunction/loss and IOP
elevation (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform proof-of-principle studies exploring whether the mitophagy enhancers
improve outflow facility and reduce elevated IOP in mouse models of glaucoma (Aim 3). We will utilize human
primary TM cells and post-mortem TM tissues from normal and glaucoma donor eyes, mouse models of
glaucoma and mitophagy flux reporter mouse model (mito-qc) as well as transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and the Seahorse assays to determine the role of MAMs, mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in TM
function and IOP homeostasis. The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide novel crosstalk
between ER stress and mitophagy and target the pathological mechanisms for the treatment of general POAG."

Most mammalian genes harbor multiple cleavage and polyadenylation sites, or PASs, across the gene body,
resulting in mRNA isoforms with different coding sequences (CDS) and/or 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs).
Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is an important layer of gene regulation, affecting gene
expression levels, protein diversity, and mRNA metabolism. The APA isoform expression varies across cell
types and is dynamically regulated in a growing number of cell conditions, such as cell proliferation and
differentiation, change of metabolic states, and cellular stress. Our lab employs interdisciplinary approaches to
study APA, involving molecular biology, functional genomics, and computational biology. Our long-term goal is
to understand the functional genomics of APA across species as well as molecular mechanisms and cellular
consequences of gene regulation by APA in different cell contexts and pathological conditions. In the next five
years, we plan to address a few key gaps in the field: First, we plan to examine regulatory rules governing
intronic polyadenylation that leads to early termination of transcription. Second, we will examine the role of
3’UTR isoform regulation in cell metabolic reprogramming, such as growth and autophagy. Third, we will
investigate the mechanisms and consequences of the unique APA isoform profile in secretory cells."

 Understanding and leveraging molecular diversity within the phytochrome superfamily
 R35 GM139598; Principal Investigator: J. Clark Lagarias
Our proposal focuses on the phytochrome superfamily of photoreceptors. We have a longstanding
interest in these proteins and in the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophores they use to detect light.
Members of this superfamily control growth and development of plants (seed germination,
photomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering, among other processes), making
phytochromes important research targets for enhancing agricultural efficiency to meet the demand
for food in the face of increasing human population. Other members of this family allow bacteria
to move, form biofilms, or adjust their metabolism in response to the light environment.
Phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs), the two families of proteins in the
phytochrome superfamily, are able to detect every color of light between the near-ultraviolet and
the near-infrared, including red and far-red wavelengths that are optimal for imaging in
mammalian tissue. Thus, basic research to understand phytochrome diversity, the mechanisms
underlying its function in plants, algae, and bacteria, and development of new imaging tools well
fits the mission of NIGMS.
Research in the Lagarias lab leverages the natural diversity that has arisen in this superfamily
during evolution. We seek to understand the mechanisms that allow these proteins to sense
different colors of light, to either exhibit bright fluorescence or switch between photostates, to
integrate signals such as temperature or pH with light, and to report this information to the cell. In
the course of this research, we have also developed useful reagents including fluorescent
phytochromes, constitutively active plant phytochromes, and phytochrome-null plants. In the next
five years, we envision making further progress in understanding detection of far-red and near-
infrared light by these proteins. We expect to learn how to “re-tune” the color-sensing mechanisms
of a range of phytochromes and CBCRs, an insight which be applied to existing reagents and
systems to allow new imaging applications, multiplexing of synthetic biology systems to respond
to different colors, or tissue-specific applications in which specific targets are activated with light
rather than with gene promoters. These goals fit well with our overall goals of understanding of
the photochemical, biophysical, and biological processes of this family and potentially yield
advances in biomedical imaging and synthetic biology via development of a knowledge base,

The objectives of our R01 award, Biophysical Control of Cell Form and Function by Single Actomyosin Stress
Fibers, are to investigate contributions of cofilin-1 to front-back mechanical polarization during migration and to
understand the role of stress fiber networks in confined migration. Our work takes advantage of a unique and
innovative combination of single-cell biophysics, computational modeling, molecular reconstitution, and use of
engineered culture platforms. These disparate methodologies all share a reliance on high-resolution optical
imaging of live cells, reconstituted assemblies, or combinations thereof. Our laboratory's live-cell imaging needs
are currently supported by a Nikon TE2000E2 system, which we purchased with institutional startup funds in
2006. While this system has served us very well over the past 17 years, it has been plagued of late by a series
of component failures as specific pieces of hardware reach the end of their natural lifetimes. Moreover, this
microscope system is now several generations out of date, complicating maintenance and making it increasingly
difficult to replace components as they fail. We therefore request an Administrative Supplement for
Equipment Purchases to support acquisition of a new Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with extended live-cell
imaging capabilities and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This purchase will critically
facilitate the work in this award in three ways: (1) It will replace our existing Nikon TE2000E2 microscope system,
which we purchased nearly 20 years ago, has suffered from repeated component failures, and is no longer fully
serviced by the manufacturer or vendor. (2) TIRF capabilities will enable us to establish Aim 1 actin-cofilin
reconstitution studies – currently restricted to collaborator Bruce Goode's laboratory at Brandeis – in the Kumar
Lab at UC Berkeley. This will greatly expand our experimental bandwidth and allow cross-checking of key results
across two laboratories. (3) Extended (24-48h) live-cell TIRF will enable us to image SF remodeling events
during confined migration at far superior resolution than with conventional epifluorescence imaging and on a
time scale longer than would be practical in a confocal or two-photon system in a core facility. We will also be
able to integrate this system with an innovative microfluidic platform we are developing, which we are aiming to
integrate with -omics screens to understand the molecular basis of confined migration."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-041: Administrative Supplements for Assessing and Enhancing Survivorship Care.” The goal of this proposed
supplement is to examine the extent to which survivorship care for young adults (ages 18-39) with cancer aligns
with the recently developed National Standards for Survivorship Care and to identify barriers and facilitators for
obtaining high-quality survivorship care in this group. Young adults with cancer have unique emotional, social,
and practical needs relative to other age groups due to the intersection of cancer treatment and normal
developmental processes. The transition from cancer treatment into survivorship follow-up care can be
challenging for young adults. In particular, the delivery of survivorship care is often fragmented and there is a
lack of coordination between providers who are often not even in the same health system. Existing data indicates
that young adult survivors report persistent unmet practical, emotional, and social needs that negatively impact
their quality of life many years into survivorship. The parent award aims to address the diverse and extensive
needs of young adults newly diagnosed with cancer by evaluating a problem-solving skills training intervention
called “Bright IDEAS-Young Adult” (Bright IDEAS-YA). This intervention provides a skill to effectively manage
the stressors of cancer care. The aims of the parent award aims are to evaluate the efficacy of the Bright IDEAS-
YA on psychosocial outcomes, determine the extent to which problem-solving ability mediates treatment effects,
and explore moderators of treatment effects (i.e., sex, financial strain, unmet needs, baseline distress). A total
of 344 young adults with cancer were enrolled in the parent award and are being followed for two-years post-
enrollment. The ultimate goal is to improve quality of life outcomes for young adults with cancer. This proposal
is consistent with the aims of the parent award and logically extends the work to understand the transition to
survivorship care and its impact on young adults’ quality of life. This proposed supplement offers a very timely
and meaningful opportunity to fill an identified gap in cancer survivorship research by gathering rich qualitative
data from young adults at the time of their transition into survivorship care, rather than retrospectively recalling
the transition. The aims of the supplement are to determine the extent to which survivorship care for young adults
aligns with the National Standards for Survivorship Care and to identify barriers and facilitators for obtaining
high-quality care. The approach will include mixed methods, conducting in-depth interview to supplement survey
data among a subset of participants enrolled in the parent trial. Results will guide future intervention development
tailored to address the unique survivorship care needs of young adults."

Enhancer formation at precise chromatin loci by transcription factors enables appropriate gene activation
to biological demand. This essential process is challenged by the millions of matches to transcription
factor binding motifs present in the human genome. Chromatin structure is also known to act as a
physical barrier for many transcription factors. How do transcription factors overcome chromatin barriers
and selectively activate appropriate genomic loci while they are competing against chromatin barriers?
The answer to this fundamental question is still largely unknown. Recently, a subset of transcription
factors, so-called pioneer factors, have been identified as essential proteins required to modify chromatin
accessibility during cellular reprogramming. Unlike other transcription factors, pioneer factors are capable
of binding to nucleosomes at closed (inactive) chromatin sites and inducing chromatin opening. Since
nucleosome formation was thought to act as a physical barrier, identification of pioneer factors’ action on
chromatin is fundamental to understanding the cellular reprogramming processes. Misregulation of
pioneer factors is associated with various human diseases including cancer. Therefore, there is a critical
need to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying pioneer factor-induced cellular reprogramming.
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcription factor-induced cellular
reprogramming. We previously demonstrated that GATA3 acts as a pioneer factor that can directly bind
closed chromatin and activate epithelial marker genes during the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET) in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Using this cellular reprogramming model system, we further
identified the unique nucleosome positioning enriched at GATA3 target loci. Our Cryo-EM structure
analysis of the GATA3-nucleosome complex revealed that the motif recognition by GATA3 on the
nucleosome differs from histone-free DNAs. Chromatin structural analysis during MET also identified that
chromatin opening and de novo enhancer formation by GATA3 is site-specific and only observed at a
subset of GATA3 binding sites. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that nucleosome positioning and
structure at the pioneer factor GATA3 binding site dictate the readout (chromatin opening and gene
activation) of GATA3 binding and is directly involved in MET. The primary goals of this application are to:
(1) identify specific nucleosome positioning and conformation that are essential for successful GATA3-
induced cellular reprogramming; (2) identify the roles of chromatin remodeling enzymes during GATA3-
induced MET, and; (3) discover minimum chromatin components for GATA3-induced enhancer
formation. We will use several novel approaches including high-resolution mapping methods for
nucleosome positioning and transcription factors’ footprint. These results will provide a basis for
understanding cellular reprogramming processes induced by transcription factors."
11100885,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Significance. One-third of patients with severe lung infection by influenza A virus (IAV) develop secondary
infection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Coinfection by IAV and SA causes about 30% mortality despite
therapy. It remains unclear how IAV promotes secondary SA infection, particularly in lung alveoli. This issue is
important because alveoli are the anatomical site of fatal SA-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI), but alveolar
defense mechanisms, including alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion, should prevent SA stabilization and
coinfection initiation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine alveolar responses to IAV that
promote secondary SA infection in alveoli, resulting in SA-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. The
hypothesis is IAV lung infection inhibits AWL secretion, a homeostatic mechanism by which alveoli clear inhaled
particles. The inhibition causes alveolar retention of SA and the secreted SA toxin, alpha hemolysin (Hla). The
retention enhances alveolar contact with SA and Hla, promoting SA stabilization against the alveolar wall and
Hla-induced alveolar fluid barrier loss, leading to alveolar edema and fatal ALI. In addition to directly supporting
the hypothesis, preliminary data indicate IAV lung infection caused: (A) dephosphorylation, hence inactivation of
the alveolar cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, the critical protein for
AWL secretion; and (B) methylation of the CFTR-dephosphorylating protein, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), which may promote PP2Ac-CFTR interactions. Specific Aims are as follows. Aim 1
will define the role of CFTR in alveolar retention of inhaled SA. Aim 2 will define the role of PP2Ac methylation
in IAV-induced inhibition of AWL secretion. Since our preliminary data suggest CFTR and the PP2Ac-
methylating enzyme, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) may represent new therapeutic targets to
restore AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, Aim 3 will test the therapeutic potential of CFTR- and LCMT1-
targeted approaches to protect against coinfection-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. These Aims
will be achieved using our established methods, which include cell culture, mouse models of ALI, and real-time
confocal microscopy of live, intact mouse and human lungs. Determinations in IAV-infected mice will include
measures of: (1) alveolar retention of SA; (2) AWL secretion; (3) alveolar CFTR phosphorylation status;
(4) alveolar PP2Ac methylation status; (5) SA- and Hla- alveolar epithelial damage and alveolar barrier loss; and
(6) SA-induced pulmonary edema and mortality. We will use: (i) wild type mice treated with inhibitors of alveolar
PP2Ac-CFTR and PP2Ac-LCMT1 interactions, including drug inhibitors, plasmid DNA encoding mutant proteins,
and siRNA; and (ii) transgenic mice lacking alveolar epithelial CFTR and LCMT1 expression. This proposal is
expected to achieve new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which IAV disrupts critical alveolar function
leading to fatal ALI, and to establish restoration of AWL secretion – that is, “AWL rescue” – as a new therapeutic
approach for ALI caused by IAV-SA coinfection. Therefore, this proposal addresses the NHLBI mission."

range and low volume viscometer for determining developability and injectability of biopharmaceutical
formulations, from prototypes to sales. This objective is motivated by the needs of the growing protein-based
biopharmaceutical therapeutics industry (with global market size over $100 billion). Protein-based therapeutics
are administered as high concentration formulations due to the volume constraints of subcutaneous injections.
However, increased protein-protein interactions at these high concentrations can cause injectability and
manufacturability issues, which cannot be determined at early stages of drug development due to the high
sample volume requirements of conventional rheology techniques. By developing a wide shear rate range, low
volume viscometer, protein molecules can be optimized for injectability/manufacturability and candidates with
better developability can be selected for scaling-up. This TABA will address crucial gaps in QATCH’s current
expertise and team and will advance commercialization. In this TABA work, QATCH’s sales consultant will assist
QATCH for product sales through 1) developing marketing strategy, 2) preparing to execute marketing and sales,
3) executing the strategy and optimize it through feedback."

 The atomistic change of C(sp3)–H to C(sp3)–O, –N, or –C can profoundly impact the biological function and
physical properties of small molecules. Traditionally, introducing these functionalities relies on functional group
transformations from pre-oxidized carbon-heteroatom precursors. This approach limits the direct installation of new
functionality into complex molecules, often necessitating de novo synthesis that is impractical for rapid exploration of
biological function. Our proposal aims to provide selective C(sp3)–H functionalization reactions that install O, N and
C in the hydrocarbon scaffold of complex molecules. This will enable late-stage functionalizations that expedite drug
discovery processes, streamline total syntheses, and empower exploration of natural products as drug candidates.
 Our group has shown that C(sp3)–H bonds in complex molecules can be distinguished based on their electronic,
steric, and stereoelectronic properties, resulting in a paradigm shift within the chemistry community that prior to 2007
viewed aliphatic C–H bonds as preparatively indistinguishable. To do this, we have discovered and commercialized
iron and manganese PDP-based catalysts for C(sp3)–H oxidations; palladium(II)/sulfoxide catalysts for allylic C–H
functionalization; and manganese phthalocyanine catalysts for both intra- and intermolecular C(sp3)–H aminations.
These catalysts proceed with excellent levels of reactivity and selectivity in complex molecule settings, without the
need for directing groups. The late-stage functionalization approach that has emerged from this work has been utilized
in both industrial and academic settings. Building on this considerable foundation, we will undertake major challenges
required to broaden the application of late-stage functionalization in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. We will
innovate new base-metal complexes for aliphatic C–H oxidations that increase chemoselectivity for tolerance of -
functionality and unprotected alcohols, as well as explore catalyst chiral recognition through non-bonding interactions.
These advances will make possible new reactions such as oxidative alkylations and catalyst-controlled asymmetric
induction and site-divergence. We will develop new base-metal complexes for intermolecular C–H aminations and
alkylations with unprecedented selectivities, and discover new ligand types amenable to asymmetric induction. New
palladium(II)/sulfoxide catalysts will be invented with an emphasis on introducing functionality in complex settings.
Cross-coupling reactions will be developed where O and N are introduced as part of complex fragments. Additionally,
asymmetric C–H functionalizations that feature catalyst-controlled diastereoselectivities in substrates with pre-existing
stereogenic centers will be advanced. Collectively, this program will change the way synthetic chemists make and
diversify complex molecules in pursuit of therapeutics, metabolites, and biological probes."

The integral roles of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), including lysine
methylation and acylation, in chromatin remodeling is well established, but new roles of histone
PTMs in disease are continually discovered. This rapidly evolving field necessitates the
development of new molecular approaches to probe the biological impacts of these PTMs.
Herein we focus on the reader proteins for lysine methylation and acylation as reader proteins
are responsible for sensing the PTM and triggering the biological outcome, and both r have
biomedical relevance. Our research will encompass development of new chemical biology tools
to investigate binding mechanisms, improve detection of PTMs, and to generate designer
nucleosomes to study the role of dual PTMs in biological pathways. This research is expected to
advance the ability to develop selective inhibitors and molecular probes for these two classes of
proteins. To develop new methods for creating new sensing methods and designer
nucleosomes, we will exploit the inherent selectivity of reader proteins to develop engineered
reader proteins (eReaders and eWriters) for sensing, labeling, and introduction of dual PTMs in
a site selective manner. This combined effort will advance the field by providing new insight and
new tools to study the biological pathways that depend on these PTMs and their role in disease."

Heart failure is defined as the inability of cardiac output to meet demand. Cardiac hypertrophy,
defined as an increase in cardiomyocyte size and heart muscle mass, leads to maladaptive
remodeling and is a significant precursor of heart failure. We aim to overcome the past
obstacles of focusing on a single signaling molecule by employing a systems approach that
considers the more extensive network of signaling interactions and FDA-approved drugs that
are viable candidates for drug repurposing. Our overall goal is to identify drugs and network
mechanisms as therapeutic targets to control cardiac hypertrophy. To achieve this goal, we will
test the overall hypothesis that a systems pharmacology network model can accurately
predict the context-dependent effects of drugs on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro
and in vivo. In Specific Aim 1, we will apply a systems pharmacology model to predict drugs
and drug combinations that cause context-dependent regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
We will develop a computational model that integrates the cardiomyocyte signaling network with
the pharmacologic mechanisms of FDA-approved drugs. We will then use this model to predict
the drug combinations and network mechanisms that inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under
distinct environmental contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will validate our model predictions of
candidate drugs using cultured rat and human cardiomyocytes to test the context-dependent
inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In Specific Aim 3, we will translate the model and cell-
based experimental data to in vivo mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy and determine
whether the modeling accurately predicts the effects of drugs in a context-dependent manner.
Overall, these studies will establish a systems pharmacology model, new computational insights
into how drugs modulate cardiac hypertrophy, and a wealth of new experimental data that will
validate these predictions."

Circadian clocks throughout the body drive rhythmic expression of thousands of genes, resulting in
rhythms in biochemistry, physiology and behavior. Disruption of circadian clocks through genetics or
environmental perturbations such as jet lag or shift-work, can have profound negative consequences
and has been linked to obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental illness. In
particular, circadian clocks exert control over nearly every major metabolic pathway, allowing optimal
utilization of typically cyclic availability of nutrients. Our work is focused generally on
understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock
machinery and the mechanisms by which these clocks control rhythmic metabolism. In this
Equipment Supplement request, we seek funds to purchase an integrated plate reader system that
allows determination of fluorescence and luminescence signals both in a typical plate reader fashion
(total signal per well) and also as high quality and high-resolution images due to the integrated
spinning disk confocal microscope. Because of the built-in CO2 incubator with temperature control
and shaker, this piece of equipment will allow us to measure circadian rhythms of gene expression or
metabolites continuously for many days – a requirement for assessing circadian periodicity. Our
studies on the central clock mechanism require careful determination of circadian period length,
amplitude and phase following different experimental manipulations and this reader will allow these
measurements in multi-well format. The sophisticated time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence
polarization detection will allow the quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions within the clock
mechanism. In addition, our work on circadian control of metabolism is focused on the control of
NAD(H) and NADP(H) by the circadian NADP(H) phosphatase Nocturnin. Nocturnin is present in two
forms, a mitochondrial form and a cytosolic form that is myristoylated and associates with ER and
other intracellular membranes. In order to determine the role Nocturnin plays in controlling these
metabolites, it is necessary to examine their levels in different intracellular compartments. Because
this plate reader system has spinning disk confocal imaging capabilities, this will allow us to use
NADP(H) fluorescent sensors to follow the flux of NADP(H) and other associated metabolites over
time in different organelles and subcellular locations over time and in response to perturbations in the
clock. These types of experiments are currently impossible since the NADP(H) measurements
cannot be done on a normal confocal microscope and require a spinning disk (we do not have access
to a spinning disk confocal within our department). Furthermore, the length of the experiments and
the need for high throughput require a dedicated instrument. In conclusion, this piece of equipment
will have a major impact on both of the main objectives of our R35-funded work."

Post-translational modification of N-terminal α-amino groups is a highly conserved and vastly utilized process
seen in all species from bacteria to mammals. Dr. Schaner Tooley pioneered the field of N-terminal
methylation by identifying the first two eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, NRMT1 and NRMT2. She
went on to characterize the consensus sequence of these enzymes, identify dozens of their substrates, and
show N-terminal methylation regulates protein/DNA interactions. Her lab was also the first to show that, like
histone PTMs, Nα-PTMs are part of a functional code. They identified the first protein known to exist in both
Nα-acetyl and Nα-methyl forms, Myosin Light Chain 9 (MYL9). They demonstrated that these two Nα-PTMs
create distinct proteoforms of MYL9, with unique protein binding partners, internal PTM patterns, and cell
compartment-specific functions. They have also demonstrated important roles for NRMT1 in oncogenesis
and aging. NRMT1 loss in breast cancer cells promotes proliferation, migration, colony formation, and
xenograph growth. NRMT1 knockout in mice promotes phenotypes associated with premature aging,
including early graying, kyphosis, and dermal fibrosis. They now want to expand understanding of the
biochemistry of NRMT1 regulation, identify additional substrates regulated by the Nα-PTM code, and
mechanistically characterize a newly discovered role for NRMT1 in stem cell fate determination. Successful
completion of these goals will provide a more global understanding of NRMT1 function and help better
develop NRMT1 as a therapeutic for human cancers and age-related disorders."
11100470,"The pathogenic bacterium responsible for Legionnaires’ disease, Legionella pneumophila, uses
SidE family of effectors (such as SdeA) to target several host proteins through a noncanonical
ubiquitination mechanism radically different from the ATP-driven, E1-E2-E3 ubiquitination of eukaryotes.
This mechanism involves an all-in-one ubiquitination machinery in SdeA which employs, first, mono-
ADP-ribosylation (mART) of ubiquitin (Ub) at Arg42, catalyzed by its mART domain, to produce ADP-
ribosylated ubiquitin (ADPR-Ub), which is then subjected to an additional catalytic step, executed by
the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity embedded in a separate domain, resulting in phosphoribosyl (PR)
ubiquitination of serine residues of host targets. Essential to the pathogen’s intracellular life cycle, SdeA
and its orthologs target numerous host proteins involved in a range of processes, from vesicular
trafficking to nutrient acquisition and autophagy. While resistant to host deubiquitinases, the PR
ubiquitination is regulated at multiple levels at the hands of other effectors: the SidJ effector (and its
paralog SdjA) can shut off mART activity by modifying a key catalytic residue though a pseudokinase-
based polyglutamylation activity; whereas the DupA and DupB effectors can reverse PRubiquitination
by restoring host targets to their native form. This sort of deubiquitination activity, while releasing the
native host target, still leaves Ub as a modified derivative, with a phosphoribosyl appendage at Arg42
(PR-Ub). Accumulation of such a Ub derivative, that cannot be used in host ubiquitination pathways,
has the effect of poisoning the cellular Ub pool which could be detrimental to Legionella’s replication.
 In this proposal we explore regeneration of free, functional Ub from PR-Ub through a two-step
process involving an unusual AMPylation reaction catalyzed by a novel S-HxxxE motif-containing, actin-
activated AMPylator, called LnaB, producing ADPR-Ub, which is then further processed by a
macrodomain (ADPribosyl)hydrolase, MavL, returning Ub to its native form. Using single particle cryo-
EM we will provide structural basis of actin activation, PR-Ub recognition and the ATP binding site of
LnaB. The EM studies will be complemented with x-ray crystallography of apo LnaB and its ATP-bound
form. Together with biochemical studies aimed at capturing enzyme intermediates, our work will provide
key insights into the novel AMPylation reaction. The MavL effector, while using macrodomain for deADP-
ribosylation, features a unique motif which we found was shared by a group of previously
uncharacterized proteins in the DUF4804 family of the Pfam database. Such a motif appears to confer
residue-level selectivity for arginine de-ADP ribosylation, a novel aspect of macrodomain function. We
seek to provide structural basis of ADPR-Ub recognition, while elucidating the basis of arginine
selectivity across the newly found MavL-like enzymes."

Understanding how the coordination of transcription factors bind to non-coding DNA provides mechanistic
insights into transcriptional regulation. Recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs) have
revolutionized our ability to study regulatory genomics. While they have demonstrated improved predictions
compared to previous methods based on traditional computational genomics, their low interpretability has earned
them a reputation as a black box. To address this gap, post hoc model interpretability methods have emerged
to interrogate important features that the network has learned. Of these, attribution maps have demonstrated
promise, providing importance scores for each nucleotide in a given sequence; these have a natural
interpretation as single-nucleotide variant effects. In principle, attribution maps should contain information to
identify motifs that are important for cell-type specific regulatory functions and annotate their positions at base-
resolution. However, attribution maps are often noisy in practice; in addition to motifs, they contain spurious
importance scores for arbitrary nucleotides for reasons that are not well established. Despite their promise,
interpreting a DNN through attribution maps remains challenging. Here we propose three complementary aims
that serve to maximize the biological insights that we can achieve from attribution maps for genomic DNNs. In
Aim 1, we will develop a model selection framework to identify the optimal DNN from a set of candidate DNNs
that yields high generalization performance and interpretable attribution maps. In Aim 2, we will develop robust
training strategies based on regularization and data augmentations tailored for genomics, with the broader aim
of ensuring that DNNs yield high-quality attribution maps and high generalization. In Aim 3, we will develop and
employ interpretable computational methods to directly analyze attribution maps to facilitate discovery of
functional motifs and annotate their positions. Each aim will be implemented as open-source software in
TensorFlow and PyTorch. As the number of deep learning applications in genomics is rising quickly, the
biomedical community will greatly benefit from these user-friendly computational tools by enabling the
deployment of robust training and interpretability analysis for any DNN trained on functional genomics assays.
This, in turn, will drive new discoveries in cis-regulatory biology across the many biological systems that deep
learning has already been applied to and the new applications that will continue to emerge in the future."

In eukaryotes, chromatin replication is responsible for the transmission of genetic and epigenetic information
between daughter cells. Interfering with this process can lead to genetic and/or epigenetic mutations, which are
both causative for many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although
epigenetic features like histone variants, histone modifications and DNA methylation need to be properly copied
during chromatin replication, they also serve important roles in regulating DNA replication itself, as well as other
cellular processes occurring simultaneously like transcription and DNA repair. Our research group seeks to
understand the contribution of epigenetic information in regulating these processes during chromatin replication.
We are particularly interested in the roles played by conserved histone H3 variants in maintaining genomic and
epigenomic stability. Recently, we demonstrated that the replication-dependent histone H3.1 variant, which is
conserved in all multicellular organisms, directly regulates TSK/TONSL-mediated DNA repair to resolve stalled
and broken replication forks. This discovery revealed the first protein domain (the tetratricopeptide domain of
TSK/TONSL) that can “read” H3.1 to mediate a specific function at chromatin (i.e., DNA repair). One of our goals
over the next five years is to understand the impact of the H3.1-TSK/TONSL pathway in protecting the genome
against replication-associated mutations. We are also interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by
which TSK/TONSL initiates homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair during replication. Another related
goal is to uncover and functionally characterize other proteins that are regulated by the conserved H3.1 variant.
Finally, we aim to explore if the H3.1-TSK/TONSL interaction plays additional roles during chromatin replication
aside from DNA repair. The proposed research will reveal novel functions for histone H3 variants. In the long
term, our work will provide a better understanding of the multiple roles played by chromatin-based molecular
mechanisms in promoting the maintenance of genetic and epigenetic information. Protecting this information
during replication is critical for proper development in multicellular eukaryotes, and for preventing the occurrence
and accumulation of mutations that can negatively affect human health."
11100094,"Research Summary
The overarching goal of my research program is to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In most eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria are the primary source of the energy that they provide in the form of ATP by
performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is a two-step process. First, substrate
oxidation by the respiratory chain results in the generation of the electrical potential on the mitochondrial
inner membrane. This potential energy drives the generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP at
the ATP synthase complex. To prevent energy dissipation and ensure that OXPHOS is efficient
mitochondrial inner membrane permeability should be tightly controlled and maintained at low levels.
Stress conditions associated with dysregulation of calcium and ROS homeostasis can lead to an increase
in mitochondrial inner membrane permeability – a phenomenon known as Mitochondrial Permeability
Transition (mPT). mPT causes dissipation of the membrane potential and loss of mitochondrial ATP-
generating capacity leading to cell dysfunction and death. mPT is critically involved in a broad spectrum
of diseases ranging from heart attack to neurodegeneration. Prevention of mPT is highly protective
against cell death and tissue damage suggesting high therapeutics potential. However, molecular
mechanisms of mPT are not well understood, and this gap in knowledge prevents mPT from being a drug
target. Over the past five years, we demonstrated that mPT is a multifaceted phenomenon and depending
on the disease type and stress severity, it can occur through different pathways. The central goal of our
research program is to identify the link between specific molecular mechanisms of mPT and specific
stress conditions. We have already established several original animal and cell disease-relevant models
causing different types of mPT. In our approach, a variety of methods that measure the mPT and tissue
damage at the organismal, cellular and mitochondrial levels are coupled with a number of our original
electrophysiological (patch-clamp) assays that allow direct measurement of mPT at the level of
mitochondrial membranes and give us a unique opportunity to dissect and characterize its multiple
identities and regulation. The results of our study will provide a detailed understanding of one of the most
critical events in cell death cascades and will bring an essential framework for the development of
therapeutically approaches that will selectively target mPT."

individual enzymes, a major gap in our knowledge is what structural features are responsible for the differences
in their functions. To fill this gap, we plan to use small and stable proteins as “scaffolds” to make “biosynthetic
models” of native enzymes with similarly high activity. By placing different heme–nonheme metal ions into the
same protein scaffold, we plan to a) understand how a heme-Cu center can exhibit either HCO or SiR activity;
b) elucidate structural features responsible for catalytic activity and substrate binding affinity in SiR; c) clarify the
roles of tyrosine in HCO and SiR activities; and d) investigate roles of heme cofactors in HCO, NOR, and SiR
activities. Accomplishing this goal will offer deeper insight into metalloprotein structure, function, and have a
broad impact on biocatalysis, allowing design of biocatalysts for biochemical and biomedical applications.
 In the second project, we plan to select DNAzymes with high selectivity for different metal ions with oxidation
state specificity and explore applications of these DNAzymes as imaging agents for paramagnetic metal ions
(PMIs) such as Fe and its Fe2+/Fe3+ redox cycle in living organisms. While progress has been made in developing
sensors for metal ions, sensors that can selectively detect PMIs are limited; few, if any, can detect two oxidation
states of the same metal ions simultaneously. To overcome this barrier, we have obtained DNAzymes sensors
with high selectivity for either Fe2+ or Fe3+ using in vitro selection and demonstrated imaging of both Fe2+ and
Fe3+ simultaneously in living cells using catalytic beacons. We plan to develop methods for spatiotemporal control
of DNAzyme-based imaging and for intracellular generation of DNAzymes to explore their imaging applications.
Accomplishing this goal will offer deeper insight into the roles of PMIs and their redox cycles in processes such
as ferroptosis that has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and bacterial infections.
 Finally, in a high-risk and high-return endeavor, we propose to expand DNAzyme’s applications as new
genetic engineering tools for cleaving double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and for genome editing, as alternatives to
protein restriction enzymes and CRISPR/Cas, respectively. To achieve the goal, we plan to develop novel peptide
nucleic acid-assisted DNAzymes for dsDNA cleavage and then establish an intracellular gene-editing platform.
Achieving this goal will allow smaller and more robust DNAzymes for highly customizable recombinant DNA
cloning and high-fidelity genome editing."

Emerging data indicates that doxycycline prophylaxis (doxyPEP) may be a promising strategy to
prevent bacterial STIs. Open-label studies among SMM found that doxycycline 200mg within 72
hours of STI exposure reduced gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis infection by 47-66% among
SMM in the United States and France. However, the only data surrounding doxyPEP in
cisgender women did not show an impact on STI incidence rates, due to low adherence. While
local and state-level public health agencies have advocated for the use of doxyPEP among
SMM and trans women with increased likelihood for STIs, these recommendations have not yet
been uniformly extended to people AFAB due to lack of data. This study seeks to address this
gap by evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, tolerability, and adherence of doxyPEP among
young and adolescent people AFAB at increased likelihood of STI exposure through the
following aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of doxyPEP (both on-demand and weekly dosing) in
reducing incident bacterial STIs, compared to standard of care (quarterly STI testing and
treatment) among adolescent and young people AFAB; Aim 2: Assess the acceptability and
tolerability of doxyPEP among adolescent and young AFAB; Aim 3: Evaluate self-reported
adherence and objective use of doxyPEP; Aim 4: Determine the impact of doxyPEP on
prevalence of tetracycline resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. To
achieve these aims, participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1) on-demand doxyPEP
(doxycycline 200mg within 72 hours of condomless sex), 2) weekly doxyPEP (doxycycline
200mg weekly regardless of sexual exposure), or 3) standard of care (quarterly STI testing and
treatment). Participants will participate in quarterly study visits that will consist of sexual
behavior surveys, STI testing, and specimen collection, including plasma and hair samples to
measure systemic doxycycline levels to assess for objective markers of adherence. Participants
will additionally utilize the HealthMPowerment mobile app to promote engagement and
adherence as well as to complete weekly surveys evaluating sexual behavior and doxycycline
use."
11100635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The United States is grappling with the urgent challenge of worsening mental and behavioral health
outcomes, with over 4 million deaths from suicide, assault, and psychoactive drug use in the past four
decades. These deaths, referred to as deaths of despair and violence, account for 5% of all US deaths and
are increasing faster than population growth. Significant disparities exist across sociodemographic groups,
with young adults, lower-income communities, and non-white populations experiencing worse outcomes,
including higher rates of stress, anxiety, depression, and suicide. Climate-related stressors, such as tropical
cyclones, further exacerbate mental health issues, potentially leading to increased rates of anxiety disorders,
intimate partner violence, and drug use behaviors. Tropical cyclone exposure is plausibly linked to deaths of
despair and violence through biological, mental, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts. Major
hurricanes often result in trauma, conflict, property loss, injury, and displacement, which can lead to suicidal
or violent behavior and substance misuse. As climate change intensifies, increasing the frequency and
severity of tropical cyclones, disparities in mental health outcomes are expected to worsen. There are critical
knowledge gaps in understanding the trends and disparities in deaths of despair and violence, the short-term
impacts of tropical cyclone exposure, and the long-term effects on vulnerable populations. In this supplement,
we will leverage data and methodology prepared for the parent R00 grant. To address these gaps, we will
analyze comprehensive mortality data and tropical cyclone exposure records. Our team, experienced in
environmental epidemiology and advanced statistical methods, will investigate the links between tropical
cyclone exposure and psychological distress-related deaths. Aim 1 will characterize long-term trends and
disparities in deaths of despair and violence by modelling trends in suicide, assault, and psychoactive drug-
related deaths from 1982 to 2022 and analyzing disparities by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and county. Aim 2 will
determine the short-term association of tropical cyclone exposure with deaths of despair and violence by
estimating death rate ratios by county-month following cyclone exposure from 1988 to 2022. Aim 3 will
evaluate the long-term impact of recurrent tropical cyclone exposure on these deaths and disparities by
utilizing synthetic control methods to estimate long-term effects and examine impacts by Social Vulnerability
Index scores. This project complements and extends the parent R00, and is consistent with NIH and Surgeon
General priorities, aiming to inform public health strategies, improve disaster response, and enhance mental
health resources for vulnerable communities. This research will provide the candidate with advanced skills,
training and research opportunities to a graduate student training in environmental epidemiology as applied
to climate and health. This supplement will also enhance diversity in our research team at Columbia
University and more broadly in the field of environmental health sciences at large."
11100894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mammalian lung has the capacity to repair itself following various injuries. Alveolar repair is
a dynamic and coordinated process whereby stem/progenitor cells in the lung undergo
differentiation into specialized cells to repair the damaged epithelium. Recent studies have
uncovered a distinct intermediate progenitor cell state that exists during the transition between
stem/progenitor cells and these specialized cells; however, the dynamic cellular behaviors and
molecular regulatory landscape that drives intermediate progenitor cell transitions toward repair
is poorly understood. Here, we propose two aims to dissect the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that control alveolar repair in vivo in the regenerating mammalian lung. First, we
investigate IPC transitions in the context of homeostasis instead of in acute injury models (virus
and bleo) as in the parent grant. We use single cell laser ablation to model the death of a single
cell, as occurs occasionally over a lifespan, and then investigate whether and how IPCs form in
response using fluorescent cell lineage-reporter mice. In the second aim, we turn to bleomycin-
induced lung injury – the most common mouse model for pulmonary fibrosis – but instead of using
single cell ‘omics approaches as in the parent grant, we take a spatial transcriptomics approach
that preserves the spatial architecture and cell-cell neighborhoods in alveoli. We apply spatial
transcriptomics at a time point that matches the parent grant and will allow integration of both
datasets. This project will generate extensive, high quality imaging and ‘omics datasets that
together with the parent grant enable quantitative and predictive models of the key regulatory
mechanisms that mammalian drive alveolar repair in vivo. Given that many of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of lung biology are conserved between mouse and human, our findings
have the potential to uncover putative targets for modulating alveolar repair in the context of
human disease."
11100897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal seeks to understand how proteins located in the cell membrane work as gatekeepers to
selectively allow compounds into or out of the cell. Such gatekeepers are known as or ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, because they use the energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis
to transport compounds across the cell membrane. Bacterial ABC importers are essential for organism
survival, controlling the rate of uptake for nutrients scavenged from the bacterium’s environment.
Control of the rate of transport precludes over-accumulation of a nutrient that is beneficial at low
concentrations, but is potentially toxic at high concentrations. While a subset of ABC proteins contain
an additional “accessory” domain that can regulate the uptake of compounds by shutting off the
transporter, it is unclear why certain transporters contain these domains while others do not. However,
we do understand that certain transporters are “turned off” when a specific compound or protein binds
to this accessory domain. Other accessory domains regulate by “sensing” changes in the
microenvironment and reacting accordingly. To decipher this mechanism of regulation, the PI’s
laboratory combines biochemical and biophysical experiments with structural biology to understand how
these accessory domains play a role in transport regulation, which in restricts or allows nutrients to
enter the cell. This research program will define the molecular mechanism that controls nutrient uptake
and allow researchers to understand how multiple transport systems work in concert within an organism
to maintain cell survival. We will test our hypothesis that regulation of transporter activation via a sensing
accessory protein. The proposed research will decipher the complex circuitry of regulation in a model
system in three Aims to: (1) understand how PepT SBPs select for different substrates within the
microenvironment (i.e., nutrients, cofactors and peptides); (2) determine how the assembly of the core
transporter dictates transport selectivity and efficiency (3) reveal how PepT transporters regulate the
import of substrates into the cell through the activation of a novel regulatory domain. This research
program has set out to close critical gaps in the understanding of the fundamentals of the transport
mechanism present in all bacteria. The results will yield insights into how regulatory domains modulate
transport across all organisms, crucial for cell viability."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Ribosomes are a central hub for controlling gene expression. They not only synthesize proteins, but also regulate
bacterial stress responses, human neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Understanding how ribosomes
control gene expression requires high-resolution structural and accurate biochemical characterization of
ribosome dynamics and interactions, both in vitro and in complex cellular environments. We are uniquely
positioned to address these key challenges by investigating the following questions:
 How do ribosomes regulate bacterial stress responses? In bacteria, ribosomes sense cellular stress via
several pathways, which control the transcriptional adaptation to stress. The direct and indirect pathways that
couple translation with transcription are promising antibiotic targets. We will dissect the structural and cellular
mechanisms of using novel biochemical approaches and ensemble cryo-EM.
 How do ribosomes rapidly and accurately synthesize proteins? Translation is a major pathway for
sensing problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes, and dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms leads to disease.
To determine how the ribosome recognizes dysfunctional mRNAs with premature nonsense codons, we will use
cellular, biochemical and structural (time-resolved cryo-EM) methods to visualize ribosome interactions with
problematic mRNAs.
 How does translation regulate neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and contribute to neurological
disorders? Translation regulation in neurons is essential for neurodevelopment, memory consolidation, and
learning, whereas translation dysregulation drives neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
The synaptic proteome—far from the nucleus—is controlled by local translation and requires brain-specific
translation factors and auxiliary proteins. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuronal translation
regulation, we will use genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, including cellular EM at Ångström-level
detail in functional neurons."
11093778,"This is an application for the Administrative Supplement to the currently active R35GM148158 grant entitled
“DNA replication and cytokinesis”. The major thrust of the parent grant is to understand the functions of
replication initiators Orc6 and ORC in eukaryotic cells and tissues using Drosophila and human cells as model
systems. ORC, heteromeric six-subunit protein complex, is essential for DNA replication. The smallest of ORC
subunits, Orc6 protein, is important for DNA replication in all eukaryotes. We have shown that in Drosophila Orc6
has an additional role in cytokinesis through interaction with the septin complex, a highly conserved polymerizing
protein assembly that is critical for cytokinesis in many species and is recognized as important component of the
cytoskeleton. In preliminary studies we have identified structural features of Orc6 that contribute directly to the
functions of the protein in replication and cytokinesis. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the distinct
mechanisms of Orc6 function in DNA replication and in cytokinesis using Drosophila as a model system. All
major objectives of the parent grant require constant purification of the wild type and mutant protein complexes
(such as ORC and septin complex and their subunits) to study protein functions and protein/DNA interactions.

of applications in basic research and life science. The Administrative Supplement will allow us to purchase a
new Synergy H1 that will greatly facilitate and advance our studies and workflow. The purchase of new

This research project aims to compare multi-domain pain phenotypes across various pain conditions, with a
specific focus on the lower back, knee, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The objective is to bridge a crucial
gap in our comprehension of pain perception and manifestation within clinical patient populations, which holds
significant implications for developing targeted and personalized pain management strategies. The proposed
supplement seeks to conduct a comprehensive comparison of clinical pain phenotypes across these
anatomical sites by integrating data and research methodologies from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Healing Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative's Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) and the Restoring Joint
Health and Function to Reduce Pain (RE-JOIN) Consortium. By combining data on patients' pain experiences,
psychological distress, functional impairment, and quality of life with evaluations of innervation shifts at
pathological sites, this study aims to delineate similarities and differences in how chronic musculoskeletal pain
manifests across different anatomical locations. Musculoskeletal pain is a significant driver of opioid abuse and
a central focus of multiple HEAL programs, including BACPAC and RE-JOIN. Collaborative efforts between
principal investigators from BACPAC (Sowa and Vo) and RE-JOIN (Allen, Almarza, Cruz-Almeida) are
underway to bridge gaps between these initiatives. As part of these efforts, Specific Aim 1 aims to expand the
RE-JOIN Human Study to include blood collection and perform BACPAC analysis, comparing biomarkers
across chronic pain conditions. Specific Aim 2 focuses on characterizing the innervation patterns of BACPAC
samples obtained from different anatomical sites, while Specific Aim 3 aims to compare deep pain phenotype
data among patients with back, knee, and TMJ conditions. Through these aims, this research endeavor seeks
to deepen our understanding of pain mechanisms and pave the way for more effective personalized pain
management interventions."

 It is being increasingly recognized that changes in chromatin state are associated with a wide spectrum of
lung diseases, ranging from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). However, the mechanisms by which these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases,
and how to manipulate the epigenome for therapeutic benefit, remains largely unknown. Modulation of chromatin
accessibility is an important epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression is controlled, even across repeated
cell divisions. However, as a prerequisite to understanding how altered chromatin accessibility contributes to
disease, the mechanisms by which chromatin accessibility patterns first establish and maintain cellular identity
within the lung must be defined.
 This proposal is based on studies from our group that identified the SWI/SNF proteins Arid1a and Arid1b
as key mediators of the chromatin accessibility changes that occur during development of the SOX9+ lung
epithelial stem/progenitor cell population. Our data demonstrate that loss of Arid1a or Arid1b led to persistence of
the SOX9+ progenitor cell population, impaired alveolar differentiation, and neonatal death due to respiratory
distress. In addition, ARID1A directly interacts with NKX2-1 and SOX9. The central hypothesis of the present
proposal is that ARID1A and ARID1B interact with key lung developmental TFs to direct the SWI/SNF complex to
remodel chromatin at specific loci, silencing progenitor cell gene expression programs and promoting the
maturation and function of the mature alveolar epithelium. The proposed studies will: A) Define the role that
Arid1a/Arid1b, and the larger SWI/SNF complex, play in establishment of mature alveolar cell type identify in
mouse and human. B) Identify the mechanism(s) by which this SWI/SNF complex remodels chromatin, in
conjunction with key lung transcription factors, to establish and maintain gene expression modules controlling
type I & II AEC identity and function. C) Determine how Arid1a/Arid1b-mediated chromatin remodeling contributes
to the lung epithelial repair response following influenza infection.
 These studies will provide conceptual advances in our understanding of how mature alveolar epithelial
cells are established and maintained, how the chromatin accessibility landscape interacts with previously well-
defined transcription factor networks, and how chromatin remodeling direct the normal repair process after lung
injury. Emerging epigenomic tools and systems biology approaches will be applied to the epithelium for the first
time. Taken together, these data will inform future translational studies seeking to understand how alterations in
the epigenome contribute to lung disease, and will provide a foundation for future efforts to manipulate the lung’s
epigenomic code to restore normal lung structure and function."

This project examimes the structure, spectroscopy, function, and mechanism of metallproteins that regulate cell
cycle progresion in response to programmatic fluctuations in intracellular zinc concentration. Zinc fluxes have
recently been discovered to be key regulatory events in human physiology, including cortical neuron function,
immune response, fertilization, and insulin secretion. Despite its apparent roles in these profound physiologies,
the biochemistry of zinc action is not well understood. Little is known regarding the inorganic chemistry of
metalloproteins involved in the instructive mechanisms that mediate cellular responses to zinc fluxes, zinc
trafficking pathways, or the role of specific metalloprotein receptors in signaling events. To interpret and
eventually intervene in diseases caused by disruption of such pathways, we must first elucidate the fundamental
molecular mechanisms of zinc-dependent switching events.
While zinc has traditionally been viewed as a static cofactor involved in protein structure and enzyme catalysis,
recent studies support the idea that zinc binding sites in regulatory proteins respond to transient fluctuations in
zinc availability and are switched on and off in ways that regulate key cellular events. We will test the hypothesis
that regulatory zinc fluxes exert instructive control over the mammalian cell cycle through specific, receptor-
mediated processes. This hypothesis is based on multiple lines of evidence, including: (1) data showing
fluctuations zinc distribution at various points in the cell cycle for single cells; (2) live cell imaging demonstrating
the movement of waves of zinc; and (3) physicochemical approaches showing colocalization of zinc with specific
factors. The overarching objective of this proposal is to use biochemical, protein biochemistry and spectroscopic
approaches to understand how the influx and efflux of zinc regulate the cell cycle. New Chemical tools to probe
and control the concentration of zinc will utilized to further our understanding of this zinc signaling physiology. In
addition, we will leverage emerging techniques in X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy, NMR, and mass
spectrometry to understand the chemical environment of zinc and probe the zinc occupancy of zinc-containing
proteins that regulate cell cycle progression. Taken together, the results from these studies will describe a
mechanism of zinc signaling during the meiotic cell cycle."

Understanding proton-gating (H+-gating) of GPCR activity is a major new frontier in signaling biology.
GPCRs regularly encounter coincident H+ signals in various contexts, such as endosomes, tumors,
synapses, inflamed tissue, and immune responses. However, the extent to which these signals regulate
GPCR function represents a significant gap in our understanding of cellular sensing, communication, and
drug discovery. Our research program aims to provide this insight for much of the GPCRome. Recently,
using in vitro cell models and mass spectrometry, we discovered that changes in extracellular pH rapidly
alter the lipid composition of cell membranes. Because lipids are critical regulators of GPCR activity, this
unexpected finding led us to question whether coincident pH signals can (in)directly modulate GPCR
function by rapidly altering the membrane lipid composition. Our preliminary studies indicate this
hypothesis is correct, which has motivated our developing lipidomics as a new and unanticipated branch
of our R35 research program. To this end, we have acquired an Agilent mass spectrometer, but we lack
a proper instrument for extracting cellular lipidomes without oxidizing or degrading the lipids we seek to
quantify. We are requesting support for a ThermoFisher SPD140P1 speed vacuum concentrator to solve
this problem. The capability of the SPD140P1 would help us greatly accelerate our understanding of lipid-
GPCR interactions and the ability of coincident acid signals to alter cell membranes (e.g., their
composition, thickness, and curvature) to modulate GPCR function. As such, NIGMS support for our
instrument request would help to catalyze a substantial leap forward in the GPCR field and beyond."

The unifying theme of our research on synthetic biology is to utilize the principles of Darwinian

of a gene of interest by a mutagenic T7 replisome, in combination with continuous culturing of its
microbially tractable host E. coli, will greatly accelerate such evolution campaigns in our lab.

The ability to manipulate the expression of genes in cells and organisms is foundational to the
study of genetics. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing toolkit has revolutionized our ability to
modify the genome and epigenome precisely. While CRISPR tools have been optimized to allow
for robust, tunable, and predictable repression and inactivation of gene expression, approaches
to induce gene expression (CRISPR activation, or CRISPRa) are less robust and reproducible.
Through a combination of innovative high-throughput screens and cutting-edge computational
modeling, we will develop a cohort of simple, robust, tunable, and predictable CRISPR-based
tools to increase the expression of any mouse or human gene.
We have developed a high-throughput sequencing-based assay system, Self-sustaining Peptide
Activator Reporter-seq (SPARq), which enables quantitative screening of thousands of
candidate gene activating peptides and combinations thereof to monitor and optimize their gene
activation strength. In Aim 1, we will iteratively employ SPARq to systematically evaluate and
optimize multiple features of gene activating peptides, including activation peptide identity,
combination, linker, and CRISPRa method. We will perform SPARq screens in distinct cell types
and with distinct promoter architectures to identify tools that work consistently, designing a set of
CRISPRa tools that are significantly more potent and consistent than the current state-of-the-
art.
In Aim 2, we will improve the predictability and consequently the utility of CRISPRa through a
novel high-throughput reporter assay and a computational effort to model the features
associated with CRISPRa potency. We have designed an approach, CRISPR Outcome and
Phenotype screening, that combines a sensitive reporter assay with a native genomic
phenotypic measurement to profile the activity of a CRISPRa tool at thousands of target sites.
Using data collected through this pipeline, we will develop an algorithm that takes as input one
of the CRISPRa tools developed in Aim 1, a cell type, gene, and CRISPR guide RNA and
outputs an accurate estimate of the expression of that gene following CRISPRa treatment. We
will validate the accuracy of this algorithm to enable tunable gene activation over an extensive
dynamic range in human HepG2 and K562 cells, providing it to the genetics community as a
webtool.
Altogether, the efforts described in this proposal will pioneer a next generation toolkit to enable
more robust gain-of-function genetic manipulation and screening."

This NOSI response is an instrumentation request for a Nicoya Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) equipment
that will supplement the parent award (5R01GM149659-02) and will foster the parent award research scope and
have long-term impact on the research in my lab in the study of both ligand-receptor and receptor-transducer
interactions. In the parent award, we created a series of conformation-biased mutants that can populate different
conformational states, ranging from the inactive state S1 to the fully activated state S5, that lie along the GPCR
activation process into different mutants, a result that has allowed us to study the function and structure of each
individual conformation. Specifically, we can trap an intermediate state S4 into a single point mutant R291A and
two conformational states S3 and S5* into a double mutant R291AR293A. These progresses allow us to study
the roles of intermediate states S3 and S4 in the signaling, in reference to the fully activated state S5. Of note,
S5* state is a pseudo-active state, in which two intermolecular salt bridges are knocked out due to the R to A
mutagenesis, distinct from the real S5 state. Most recently, we also made progress in resolving the first
intermediate GPCR- mini-Gasbg complex. The requested equipment acquisition will add a digital tool to study
the interactions between the S3/S4 states and Gasbg without a specific labeling (e.g.,19F-labeling for NMR and
isotopic-labeling for GDP and radioligand binding assays). The SPR will also help us to study the kinetics of
nucleotide exchanges in the G proteins that are regulated by different conformational states. All noted
experiments are in the scope of the proposed parent award. Furthermore, given our current work on multi-GPCRs,
the equipment acquisition will significantly elevate our lab’s capacity to screen drugs for different physiological
GPCRs and interrogate the interactions of receptors with different downstream transducers, including various G
proteins, GRKs, and b-arrestins in the future."

The open availability of authenticated, well-documented research materials is essential for scientific progress.
Plasmids have become essential research tools to address almost any question in biology, and together with
other forms of engineered DNA molecules, are essential for clinical research applications including gene therapy,
vaccine development, and the production of recombinant drugs. Currently, the two common links between a
plasmid and its documentation are the plasmid names and the plasmid sequence. Despite the central role that
plasmids play in biomedical research and development, there is no guaranteed way to connect a physical
plasmid in a tube to its documentation. A pipetting error, a labelling error, a spontaneous mutation, or an
undocumented modification of the plasmid are some of the events that could result in a tube containing a different
plasmid than what is indicated on the label. In addition, there is no standardized, secure approach to
documenting the sequence, function, and lineage of a plasmid. As a result, there are widespread discrepancies
between the physical sequences of the plasmids in circulation in the life science community and their supposed
reference sequence. This situation creates reproducibility issues, slows down R&D efforts and raises significant
security and safety issues for biotechnology applications.
We are proposing to develop a new digital certificate technology, enabled by a web-based resource called
MyPlasmid.org, that will provide a robust, physical link between engineered DNA molecules, their electronic
documentation, and their authors. This technology will produce unique DNA sequences generated by
cryptographic algorithms that can be inserted into an engineered DNA molecule. MyPlasmid.org will allow users
to document their genetic designs by aggregating the documentation of individual genetic elements as well as
combinations of elements. In addition, it will link the computer records of the engineered DNA sequence directly
to the molecule itself and provide a method to retrieve documentation without a priori knowledge of the plasmid's
identity. Short unique DNA sequences called certificates will be inserted between the functional blocks of
engineered sequences. Unlike DNA barcodes, certificates will be computed by cryptographic algorithms using
the DNA sequence itself and the author's identity as input so that users of engineered DNA molecules can verify
the origin and integrity of certified DNA molecules. The technology described in this proposal is expected to
foster a transition similar what has been observed in the semi-conductor industry where different stakeholders
invest in the development of circuits that can be easily combined in larger designs that can then be manufactured
by foundries not involved in the chip design. By ensuring that the sequence, origin, function, and lineage of
engineered DNA molecules is accurately tracked and conveyed to all users, the proposed technology will
improve the reproducibility, utility, and potential application of engineered DNA molecules in the life sciences."
11091111,"SUMMARY: My lab studies circadian-regulated processes and their contributions to health and disease.
Circadian regulation refers to daily oscillations in biological functions and is an evolutionarily conserved feature
from bacteria to humans. At its core, circadian regulation is governed by a transcriptional negative feedback
loop called the circadian clock. Circadian clocks generate 24-hour oscillations in the expression of hundreds of
genes in almost every tissue examined and drive the daily oscillation of cellular, tissue-specific, and behavioral
functions. Chronic disruption of circadian regulation due to jetlag or night-shift work is associated with multiple
defects in innate immunity, metabolism, and sleep. Many disease states are also associated with loss of
circadian regulation, including bacterial infection, metabolic diseases, and neurological diseases. Despite the
known profound effects of loss of circadian regulation on human physiology, a major gap in knowledge is the
identification of circadian-regulated functions that contribute to the pathogenesis of specific diseases.
 In the last funding period, our MIRA supported the development of tools to enhance or inhibit Drosophila
circadian clocks; the investigation of glial function in both Drosophila and mice; and the investigation of a core
function for sleep in Drosophila. In the current proposal, we focus on circadian-regulated metabolism, which has
emerged as a major theme in our work. We describe two projects involving circadian-regulated metabolism in
Drosophila: sensitivity to oxidative stress due to chronic short sleep (Project 1) and metabolic regulation of host
tolerance of bacterial infection (Project 2).
· Project 1: One of the most obvious manifestations of circadian rhythm is sleep. Sleep, or obligate rest
 during the 24-hour circadian cycle, is evolutionarily conserved. Yet the physiological function of sleep
 remains unclear. Our published MIRA-funded results support the hypothesis that a key function of sleep is
 defense against oxidative stress. Our more recent preliminary data suggest that chronic short sleep causes
sensitivity to oxidative stress due to underlying changes in metabolism. We will investigate this in Project 1.
· Project 2: There are two types of defense mechanisms against infection: resistance and tolerance.
Resistance mechanisms kill pathogens, while tolerance mechanisms limit the pathogenic effects of infection.
Tolerance is much less well understood than resistance. In NIGMS-funded research, my lab previously
identified a circadian-regulated, TORC2-mediated mechanism of host tolerance against B. cepacia infection.
In preliminary data, we found that Sting mutants also have increased tolerance against B. cepacia infection.
The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is a conserved innate immune response and known
resistance mechanism. STING also has a second distinct function in both mammals and Drosophila:
regulation of lipid metabolism. We will investigate whether STING’s roles in immunity and metabolism
intersect during infection in Project 2."
11094160,"The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate trachoma, the world's leading infectious cause of
blindness. To determine if trachoma treatment is needed in an area, the WHO recommends eye examinations
on a population-based sample of children by personnel certified in trachoma grading. The WHO's successful
trachoma elimination campaign has created a situation in which some areas have too many to trachoma cases
to declare elimination but too few trachoma cases to certify trachoma graders. Adopting smartphone-based
trachoma telemedicine addresses this issue by allowing workers with little clinical experience to perform
trachoma photo-surveys for remote trachoma diagnoses. However, the WHO's current data collection platform
for trachoma surveys, Tropical Data, does not currently support ocular photography. We propose here to
integrate smartphone photography with Tropical Data and add functionality that will transform it into a more
user-friendly, open access suite of smartphone-based survey modules. This would enhance flexibility and
facilitate broader health surveys that can be used to better target limited health resources.
This first part of the study aims to develop and refine the hardware and software necessary to integrate
smartphone conjunctival photography into the Tropical Data platform, and to assess the feasibility of the
resulting product in remote community-based settings in Peru. First, modules for photography, visual acuity
assessment, autorefraction, sample collection, and user-defined questionnaires will be added to the existing
Tropical Data application. Second, the impact of varying smartphone models and/or ambient lighting will be
assessed for each module. Third, the updated mobile application will be tested in a small number of villages to
determine the feasibility of testing multiple modules per child.
The second part of the study validates the components of the smartphone-based system when used in three
different field locations in Peru (e.g., jungle, mountains, desert). We will examine the sensitivity and specificity
of smartphone photography relative to certified human graders, smartphone visual acuity relative to standard
ETDRS visual acuity, and autorefraction relative to human refraction, and hypothesize that these metrics will
be superior to pre-defined minimally acceptable criteria.
The UCSF Proctor Foundation and Cayetano University in Peru will collaborate to achieve these goals. We
will work in close cooperation with the WHO and Tropical Data, who will be actively engaged in this research
throughout development and testing. This research has great potential for wide dissemination and positive
impact on health."
11095299,"Integrating Chemical Genetic Approaches with Precision Genome Editing
 Chemical genetic approaches are powerfully enabling for biological discovery and therapeutics
development. The identification of mutant alleles that enhance or suppress the activity of chemical probes may
not only validate on-target mechanism but also drive deeper understanding of a small molecule’s binding
interactions, molecular mechanism of action, and downstream biological effects. Recent breakthroughs in
genome editing technologies enable the systematic mutation of endogenous proteins at scale and directly in
cells, opening new research paradigms for chemical genetic approaches. Exploiting these new technologies, our
prior work helped pioneer the development of in situ CRISPR-mutational scanning approaches to systematically
profile protein target(s) sequence-function relationships in their native cellular environment. When leveraged with
chemical biology, these mutations in the target can be exploited as discovery tools to study small molecule
mechanism of action and target biology, allowing us to uncover mechanisms of allosteric regulation, cell
signaling, and cancer vulnerabilities. This chemical genomics platform allows us to unlock the serendipitous
discoveries that both chemical probes and cutting-edge genetic screens can afford. To push the boundaries of
chemical genomics, these approaches and their associated tools will need to be innovated, expanded, and tested
in biologically meaningful systems and contexts that address key questions in the field. Hence, this proposal
aims to significantly broaden the scope and utility of in situ CRISPR-mutational scanning in the context of
highlighting its potential to transform many facets of chemical biology: to (1) interrogate drug-target structure-
function in primary cells, (2) integrate massively parallel single-cell multi-omic readouts of mutant phenotypes,
and (3) illuminate the function, mechanisms, and biology of protein disordered regions as well as (4) multi-subunit
protein complexes. We focus our future studies on (1) androgen receptor, a critical cancer gene, where
integrating high-throughput, direct readouts of transcription factor function will be transformative, and (2)
components involved in targeted protein degradation, where holistically interrogating the ubiquitin-proteasome
system at scale is essential for understanding the whole pathway. Across these aims, the biology and
mechanisms of various protein complexes will be deeply explored by leveraging mutant alleles with cell,
molecular, computational, and structural biology. Altogether, accomplishment of these objectives will advance
research paradigms for chemical genomics and will further illuminate fundamental mechanisms of small
molecule action and protein complex function."

 Organization and of Viral RNA Frameshifting
 Project Summary May 22, 2024
 As advances in both experimental and computational biology lead to exciting discoveries in many ﬁelds
of biology and biomedicine today, new avenues to diagnose and treat human disease are becoming a reality.
Molecular dynamics and other simulation approaches play a key role in these connections by helping deﬁne
the underlying biophysical mechanisms, at unprecedented resolution. The PI's computational biophysics lab
focuses on solving fundamental structural and functional challenges concerning nucleic acids and their complexes
(notably chromatin and RNA), in collaboration with experimentalists, by innovative molecular models and
simulation methods using ideas from mathematics, computer science, engineering, biology, and chemistry. This
MIRA project continues to advance our fundamental understanding of genome organization and RNA motifs
using multiscale models that bridge disparate spatial and temporal scales to generate biophysical insights into
genome folding and cancer genomics, and RNA conformational landscapes/ viral mechanisms. For chromatin and
chromosomes, modeled nucleosomes and their protein complexes at atomic resolution, and chromatin ﬁbers at the
mesoscale, will be linked to data from genome-wide and cancer epigenomics studies to determine the modulation
of chromatin higher-order structure in processes of aberrant gene expression. Speciﬁcally, we will focus on
the structural role and mechanisms of proteins (like CTCF and H1) in formation of gene loops, topologically
associated domains (TADs), and nuclear compartments in gene activation or repression in cancer cells. For RNA,
atomic-level biophysical modeling will be complemented by our topological coarse-grained graph approach for RNA
secondary structures (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs) to delineate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms in
RNA coronaviruses and other viruses, and advance the RNA motif atlas. Speciﬁcally, atomistic dynamics of
the RNA frameshifting element of SARS-CoV-2, along with evolutionary and biophysical analysis and chemical
reactivity experiments tailored to handle multiple RNA conformations will describe frameshifting transitions and
identify/test experimentally structure-altering mutations that hamper frameshifting. We will also build a virus
topology atlas and explore virus motifs from an RNA repertoire point of view, to help understand the RNA motif
universe and advance novel RNA design. The unraveled biophysical mechanisms in genome organization and RNA
frameshifting/conformational repertoire have translational ramiﬁcations for human cancers and viral infections by
coronaviruses or HIV. For cancer therapy, a targeted re-expression of silenced genes may be possible by chromatin
topological changes (e.g., loop dissolution) and RNA editing. For viral RNA infections, our structure-altering
and motion-suppressing mutants deﬁne new strategies for gene and anti-viral therapy, feasible by modern RNA
editing technologies. The resulting multidisciplinary computational paradigms are widely applicable to other
biomolecular processes and will be shared with the community at large."
11099023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application s being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified
as NOT-CA-24-041. There are more than 18 million cancer survivors living in the U.S., and
approximately 20% of these live in rural communities. Rural populations experience significant
barriers to healthcare access and there are persistent disparities in survivorship outcomes for
rural cancer survivors. Survivorship care is complex and requires coordination across multiple
domains and specialties. Though past research to improve survivorship outcomes has focused
on patient and provider-level interventions such as treatment summaries and survivorship care
plans, these approaches remain under-utilized and have had lower than expected impact. The
recently released National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care (NSCSC) guide health
systems in the design of policies, processes, and assessments to ensure high quality,
accessible care for all cancer survivors. The overall goal of this study is to assess facilitators
and barriers to NSCSC implementation in rural health systems in Washington state. To achieve
this goal, we will partner with four rural health systems in Washington state to conduct semi-
structured interviews with key informants, such as clinicians (e.g. primary care providers,
oncologists), leaders (e.g. medical directors, CEOs), clinical staff (e.g. nurses, behavioral health
providers), and non-clinical staff (e.g. health information technology staff, patient navigators).
Rural health system partners will be identified and engaged through relationships with the Fred
Hutch Cancer Center Office of Community Outreach and Engagement and the WWAMI region
Practice and Research Network. The study is guided by the Health Equity Implementation
Framework (HEIF), which is an implementation science framework that integrates internal and
external contextual factors with domains that influence health equity to ensure comprehensive
identification of facilitators and barriers. Our team, comprised of an experienced rural health
cancer control researcher and qualitative research scientist has demonstrated expertise in rural
health system engagement, qualitative research methods, and implementation science. The
findings will guide design of strategies to support NSCSC implementation in rural health
systems and will be critical in addressing rural cancer survivorship health disparities."
11099027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for cellular properties and behaviors including shape, migration, and division. It
is also critical for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix connections as well as cell-cell fusion. Because of these
numerous essential functions in cell physiology, actin dysfunction is also a common contributor to pathogenesis,
for example, in inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, and microbial infection. Despite many
years of study, however, understanding how actin assembly is regulated and harnessed in the cytoplasm and
nucleus for intracellular events, cellular behaviors, and cell-cell interactions remains a key outstanding problem
in cell biology. In our NIGMS-funded research, my lab has taken a distinctive approach to address this important
gap in knowledge, which is to examine the interactions between microbes that do not cause serious human
illness and the host cell actin cytoskeleton as a window into actin regulation and function. Our approach
leverages the fact that microbes colonize host cells through their ability to target actin, often eliciting amplified
cellular responses by mimicking or manipulating host molecules, making them powerful tools for revealing
molecular mechanisms of actin regulation and function. This scientific premise is supported by many examples
of how studying microbe-host interactions has enhanced our understanding of basic cell biological processes.
The research described in this MIRA application makes use of microbes as tools to address three fundamental
cell biological questions: (1) How is actin polymerization at membranes regulated and mobilized to drive
movement? (2) How and why is actin transported into and polymerized within the nucleus for gene expression,
nuclear organization, intranuclear movement, and nuclear envelope dynamics? (3) How is actin polymerization
in plasma membrane protrusions harnessed to induce cell-cell fusion? We will investigate these questions using
three model microbes that infect cells and mobilize actin in a manner that makes them powerful cell biological
tools: Mycobacterium marinum as a tool to understand the regulation of actin assembly at membranes to drive
intracellular movement; the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus as a tool to
understand the regulation and function of actin in the nucleus; and Burkholderia thailandensis as a tool to
understand the role of actin in cell-cell fusion. By leveraging our expertise in both cell biology and microbiology,
and deploying a synergistic combination of microbial and host genetic methods, advanced imaging approaches,
and biochemical methods, we are uniquely positioned to advance the field. Our results will enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms of actin regulation and may provide new insights into diagnosing, treating, and
preventing diseases associated with actin dysfunction."

The goal of the Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s (CAPRA) – a P30 Center on the
Demography and Economics of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) - is to stimulate new,
innovative, and high-quality population ADRD research. CAPRA’s main focus is on the application of
observational research methods using secondary data to inform public policy and health care delivery while the
NIA Data LINKAGE Program (LINKAGE) creates an opportunity for greater access for a broader spectrum of
investigators. We see this as a dual opportunity. First, CAPRA will engage in developing new data and insights
into use of existing LINKAGE datasets linked to claims for ADRD research. Secondly, the CAPRA team will
gain experience using the LINKAGE platform to be able to advise, mentor, and support others in platform use.
Therefore, the overarching goal of this supplement is pilot use of the LINKAGE data repository to support the
expansion of the Research Resource Core data capabilities that support secondary data research in ADRD.
We propose two projects under this supplement that address different problems in ADRD research, but both
leverage the LINKAGE resource: (1) we would partner with our State of Michigan long-term services & support
(LTSS) office to bring assessment data for people receiving home and community-based services into the
LINKAGE environment with linkage to Medicare, nursing home (MDS) and possibly Medicaid data; and (2) we
would develop the capability to test if the performance of a validated ADRD identification algorithm varies when
applied across to NIA-funded and other datasets with survey and linked claims data. This pilot work will serve
to inform the use of the claims algorithm in these datasets and also set a foundation for future applications
such as renewal of this Center’s grant and other new grant proposals."
11099166,"Project Summary
Argonautes are the only known family of proteins that can be programmed with any RNA or DNA sequence to
make sequence-specific regulators of transcription, mRNA stability, or translation. Our goal is to understand
the biology and mechanism of paradigmatic examples of Argonaute proteins and pathways, and, ultimately, to
use these insights to design and improve small RNA-guided therapies for human diseases. Indeed, studying
how Argonautes work and how their small RNA guides are made has led to the development and FDA
approval of small RNA drugs. Nevertheless, fundamental questions about the specificity and function of
Argonaute protein-mediated pathways remain unanswered.
 Despite >20 years of study, for example, we still cannot predict how Dicer enzymes will cleave a pre-
miRNA based only on its sequence. We will use biochemical and structural approaches to identify the features
that determine where Dicer cleaves a pre-miRNA and how Dicer partner proteins alter this process.
 In animals, the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute proteins uses 23–30-nt “piRNA” guides to silence
transposons or regulate gene expression in germ cells. piRNAs are made from specific long, single-stranded
precursor RNAs. Our research seeks to explain why some genomic regions and transcripts are destined to
make piRNAs, while others are excluded. By studying piRNAs in flies, moths, and mice, we hope to identify
both evolutionarily ancient and newly evolved strategies that animals use to designate piRNA precursors and
to convert them into functional complexes with PIWI proteins. While experimental and computational studies
have dramatically improved our ability to predict miRNA targets, similar advances have not yet been made for
piRNAs. In the spermatocytes of placental mammals, pachytene piRNAs are nearly as abundant as ribosomes,
but we still do not know what or how they regulate. Mutations in the proteins that make pachytene piRNAs
cause male infertility, suggesting that pachytene piRNAs promote sperm development. We will use
biochemistry and mouse genetics to study the function and specificity of pachytene piRNAs.
 Finally, 30% of bacterial genomes encode Argonautes, yet we do not know what they do. Surprisingly,
we find that in Thermus thermophilus, the DNA-guided, DNA-cleaving Argonaute (TtAgo) acts together with
gyrase A to ensure successful replication. Our hypothesis is that TtAgo has acquired a role in disentangling the
circular chromosomes at the end of DNA replication, perhaps to compensate for the absence of
Topoisomerase IV in this organism. We will use genetics and biochemistry to understand how TtAgo acquires
its guides, and how and what it regulates in vivo.
 Together these studies will reveal diverse strategies that organisms use to make small RNAs and how
they use Argonautes to control development, differentiation, and reproductive health."

 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical probes to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with
epigenetic-complexes and transcriptional regulation. Establishing detailed mechanisms for the dynamic
regulation of gene expression remains a significant challenge for the field of epigenetics. Our research
program is addressing these challenges by developing selective chemical probes, discovery of new protein-
protein interactions, and improving structural biology and biophysical approaches to quantify these dynamic
multivalent interactions. These approaches are helping to create a detailed picture of diverse molecular
assemblies of epigenetic complexes and facilitating development of new epigenetic therapies.
 Bromodomain-containing proteins are a subset of epigenetic reader protein, and are an emerging protein-
drug class for epigenome therapy. My research program is developing chemical biology approaches to study
two specific bromodomain-containing proteins, BPTF and BRD4. One innovation behind our approach uses a
19F NMR protein-based methodology for the discovery of isoform selective bromodomain inhibitors. Due to the
hyper-responsive nature of fluorine to ligand binding and simplified spectra, this structural biology tool is ideally
suited to rapidly screen small molecules, characterize the transient interactions associated with native
transcription factor-protein interactions, and to quantify the dynamics of the interactions from micro to
millisecond timescales. Over the next five years, we will further develop this approach for enabling small
molecule discovery, characterizing large (> 50 kDa) proteins, and quantifying the affinity and dynamics of
multidomain proteins associated with synthetic nucleosomes. With their discovery enabled by 19F NMR, our
new chemical probes for BPTF reader domains have potential for high impact as chemical tools for inhibiting
cancer progression and regulating autophagy, while more specific BRD4 chemical probes will help uncover
new biology in cancer and inflammation obscured by less specific tool compounds. We will use these tools to
dissect the functional roles of these bromodomains on transcription, including gene regulation, chromatin
engagement, and novel-protein-protein interactions. Next generation chemical probes will be further
developed including bifunctional molecules as inhibitors of multi-domain proteins, PROTACs with improved
selectivity profiles, and synthetic transcription factors through conjugation to DNA-targeting polyamides.
 This proposal has broad biomedical significance for early lead discovery and studies of epigenetic reader
domains important in human health and disease. Given that epigenetic proteins represent a major class of
potential drug targets, our new 19F NMR small molecule discovery method and cell-based approaches for
epigenetic reader domains described here could significantly increase the repertoire of targets and thereby
open up new avenues for drug discovery."
11095135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small, heteroatom-containing complex molecules are common motifs of biological relevance and are
highly desired in medicinal chemistry, but they are also often difficult to access. Selective transformations of
aromatic compounds could provide a more direct route to such desirable targets; however, the many challenges
associated with dearomative functionalization have left these types of reactions widely underdeveloped. The
proposed research strives to address this need by bridging the gap between dearomatization and alkene-type
chemistry. Fundamentally, the goal of this proposal is to access desirable structural motifs from simple aromatic
compounds by developing dearomative functionalizations using small molecules – arenophiles – that formally
enable olefin-like reactions on arene substrates. Specifically, in this proposal, we describe several dearomative
approaches on non-activated arenes based on catalytic 1,2- and 1,4-difunctionalizations as well as annulations.
These transformations will provide unique disconnections and open new horizons for the preparation of complex
small molecules. For example, we have made good progress in bottom-up chemical synthesis of 2-DOS
aminoglycoside antibiotics using enantioselective 1,2-hydroamination of simple benzene. This strategy will serve
the preparation and study of a library of aminoglycosides that are modified at the aminocyclitol core, and grant
access to other less-explored derivatives, such as 2-DOF-based antibiotics. Moreover, we propose an extension
of arenophile-based dearomatizations to heteroaromatic substrates. Compelling preliminary data demonstrate
that several well-established olefin reactions, such as dihydroxylation, reduction, and epoxidation, can now be
translated into dearomative functionalization of pyridines. Additionally, transition-metal-catalyzed processes
involving pyridine-arenophile adducts will enable a rapid synthesis of a diverse range of functionalized
heterocyclic compounds. While traditional approaches to directly functionalize (hetero)aromatic compounds
provide limited functionalization options and are hampered by overreaction or decomposition, the arenophile-
based strategy permits the selective and controlled introduction of a variety of functional complexity. Finally, this
approach provides products that are both challenging to synthesize via existing methods and are complementary
to those acquired through chemical or biological dearomative processes.
 Overall, the development of a general dearomative functionalization platform with arenophiles has the
potential to make a profound impact on the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and materials sciences by providing
expedient access to complex small molecules with tailored properties from simple and readily available arenes."
11098865,"2.5% of United States population is affected by alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which represents the
eighth most common cause of mortality. Despite significant progress in the field, the complex mechanisms
driving the onset and progression of ALD are still not fully understood. cAMP is a second messenger that plays
a critical role in regulating multiple cellular functions via its effectors (e.g. protein kinase A). Amplitude and
duration of cAMP signaling is fine-tuned by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) via cAMP hydrolysis and degradation.
Our work has shown that ethanol increases expression of hepatic PDE4 in experimental ALD as well as in
alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) patients’ livers. However, their role in ALD pathogenesis is not clear. We
started elucidating the role of PDE4s in ALD by demonstrating that Pde4b plays a critical role in ethanol-
mediated impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and steatosis. We also showed that inhibition of PDE4 activity
attenuates liver injury in in vivo and in vitro models of ALD. However, underlying mechanisms of ethanol
mediated induction of PDE4 enzymes have not been determined. Moreover, how PDE4 inhibition exerts its
beneficial effect on dysregulated lipid metabolism and hepatocytes survival is not fully understood. Our
preliminary studies using animal and cell models of ALD identified novel pathways of ethanol and PDE4-
mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and cell injury which have never been examined before. Based
on our previous work and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that ethanol via cytochrome p450
(CYP2E1) mediated increase in hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1α) induces hepatic PDE4 which
contributes to dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and injury.
The specific objectives of these mechanistic studies are to:
Aim 1: Determine the underlying mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation by ethanol in hepatocytes.
Aim 2: Determine mechanisms underlying ethanol/PDE4-mediated de novo lipogenesis and hepatic
steatosis.
Aim 3: Determine the role of MKP1 in ethanol/PDE4-mediated toxicity in hepatocytes.
The ultimate goal of this application is to identify not only the mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation, but also the
role of PDE4s in the development of ALD. Importantly, we predict that these preclinical studies will provide
strong rationale using PDE4 specific inhibitors in the treatment of ALD. Importantly, there are potent PDE4
inhibitors that are already FDA-approved for the treatment of other inflammatory disease processes, and these
inhibitors could potentially be repurposed for ALD."
11099176,"ABSTRACT
 A true enigma of modern medicine has persisted for over 150 years; the mechanism(s) by which volatile
anesthetics (VAs) produce reversible loss of consciousness remains an unsolved mystery. Using genetic
approaches, we demonstrated that mitochondrial complex I, an entry point of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain, specifically controls the sensitivity of multiple species, including worms and humans, to VAs. These broad
phylogenetic effects indicate that an ancient mechanism is at hand, linking mitochondrial function to synaptic
silencing in the presence of VAs.
 We began mechanistic studies in mice by exploiting Ndufs4(KO), a mouse defective in complex I function
and extremely hypersensitive to VAs. Testing cell-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice, we found that VA sensitivity was
fully controlled by glutamatergic KO, with no effect of loss of NDUFS4 from GABAergic or cholinergic neurons.
Our further work showed that exposure to isoflurane caused an acute decrease in ATP levels specifically at the
presynapse. This decrease in ATP led, in turn, to a complete failure in endocytosis, a failure to re-uptake calcium
into the endoplasmic reticulum following neuronal stimulation, and to significant hyperpolarization of the neuron
 One main question remains unanswered. 1. How do volatile anesthetics disrupt complex I activity.
We showed that excitatory neurotransmission and endocytosis in Ndufs4(KO) was hypersensitive to isoflurane
inhibition compared to WT. Our recent data show that isoflurane inhibits synaptic endocytosis in both WT and
KO animals and that this inhibition results from a decrease in ATP production. Our aim is to characterize the
mechanisms underlying inhibition of complex I by VAs. Our proposed studies are aimed to identify the basic,
molecular mechanisms of action of VAs."

11100486,"Title: Two-way Magnetic Resonance Tuning Nanoprobe Enhanced Subtraction Imaging for Precision
Diagnosis of Brain Metastasis
Project Summary/Abstract
Metastasis from systemic cancers to the brain is a leading cause of cancer mortality. The current diagnostic
method is sensitive only to larger tumors when therapeutic options are limited. Visualizing early brain metastases
by non-invasive imaging approaches with high sensitivity and spatial resolution followed by timely treatment is
crucially important to reduce their high mortality rate. While effective interventions (e.g., surgery, radiation,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy) strongly depend on our ability to detect brain metastases at an early
stage, imaging small brain metastases hidden in a large population of normal cells presents a unique challenge.
It is essential to design novel imaging approaches to detect small brain metastases with the highest possible
tumor-to-normal tissue ratios (TNRs). The goal of this application is to develop a new molecular nanoprobe with
activatable magnetic resonance contrast integrated with a new computational subtraction approach to improve
the TNR of imaging for small brain metastases. We recently developed a new two-way magnetic resonance
tuning (TMRET) nanoprobe with dually activatable T1&T2 magnetic resonance signals coupled with dual-contrast
enhanced subtraction imaging (DESI) to dramatically enhance contrast in targeted tissues and suppress the
background signal from normal tissue. This integrated platform could sensitively detect very small tumors in the
brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with a TNR >10. We also
developed a Sequential Targeting In CrosslinKing (STICK) nano-delivery strategy to “stick in” central nervous
system (CNS) tumors and metastases, which will be applied to our TMRET nanoplatform to enhance its specific
delivery to brain metastases. In this project, we will develop novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-traversing and deep
tumor-penetrating TMRET (bt-TMRET) nanoprobes with superior TNR for sensitive and specific detection of
brain metastases. The STICK strategy will be used to improve the CNS pharmacokinetics (PK) of TMRET
nanoprobes by pHe-cleavable crosslinkers to maximize the time window for transcytosis through the BBB. Our
STICK strategy will further enhance the efficiency of BBB traversal by manipulation of glucose transporter 1
(GLUT1) on the BBB by optimization of the polyvalent interaction of nanoprobes with GLUT1 via fine-tuning the
surface targeting moieties. The STICK strategy optimizes the pH-responsive size transformation for improved
tumor tissue penetration and sialic acid-targeting selectivity for enhanced tumor cell specificity. The MRI signal
can be turned ON specifically at the brain metastases after BBB traversal and tumor penetration via size
transformation in acidic tumor microenvironment. Our hypothesis is that the proposed nanoprobes can improve
the TNR for MRI detection of small brain metastases through a synergized strategy of background suppression,
signal amplification via deep penetration and specific targeting in brain metastases and activation at tumor sites,
and DESI technology will further enhance the TNR. This new imaging platform is expected to improve cancer
detection in the clinic and serve as a great tool for biomarker detection in preclinical research."
11100488,"We plan to add an electron diffraction component to a native protein mass spectrometer to create a new instrument that
can derive atomic structures of macromolecules such as proteins. The key innovation is the use of superfluid helium
droplets for sample cooling thereby effective field induced orientation and alignment. Mass and conformation selected
proteins from a native electrospray ionization mass spectrometer are embedded in superfluid helium droplets, and in a
pulsed electric field and elliptically polarized laser field, due to the permanent and induced dipoles of the protein, all three
Euler angles of the protein can be precisely defined. The large polarizability volume of macromolecules (not the
permanent dipole moment) and the low rotational temperature of the embedded macromolecules are the two elements of
the “molecular goniometer”: changing the polarization properties of the laser field changes the orientation of the
macromolecule. Electron diffraction patterns from macromolecule-doped droplets, one molecule per droplet, all oriented
in the same direction, are accumulated with each successive pulse, until a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio is achieved.
Ultimately from the diffraction patterns of all orientations of the chosen macromolecule, the electrostatic potential is
derived using the oversampling method for iterative phase retrieval and structure determination.
In the past few years, we have accumulated preliminary data on electron diffraction of small molecules and cationic
molecular clusters embedded in superfluid helium droplets, and on doping macromolecular ions into superfluid helium
droplets. The next phase of the project is to construct a complete instrument to demonstrate the principle of the concept.
We now can solve structures of nanocrystals embedded in superfluid helium droplets, both neutral and charged, without
sample alignment. Therefore the background issue of the enclosing helium and the particle density issue of charged
species are no longer major concerns. Our demonstrated resolution from pyrene dimer cations is 0.5 Å. Moreover, we
have succeeded in doping macromolecular ions into superfluid helium droplets using a standard electrospray ionization
source. Our accomplishments so far have laid the foundation for the next phase of progress, and we are now ready to
demonstrate the principle of the concept. With the acquisition of a new electron gun, a upgrade to a native protein ion
source, and a direct electron detector, we have a detailed plan to align all three pulsed beams, the laser beam, the ion
doped droplet beam, and the electron beam, to obtain diffraction patterns of field aligned macromolecules.
Our ultimate goal is to resolve atomic structures of mass and conformation selected macromolecules with 1 Å resolution
from mixtures of protein solutions, microfluidic reactors, or labeled cells for proteins and protein complexes. The final
instrument will reshape the landscape of structural biology, transform structure-based drug screening, and rapidly
determine effects of mutations and deletions on structure. It will also offer structural assessment of components in

The long-term goal of the application is to understand why and how bacterial lipoproteins in the medically
important Firmicutes phylum are structurally modified. Lipoproteins are ubiquitous membrane associated
proteins tethered to the bacterial surface through a conserved acylated cysteine residue located at the
N-terminus. However, lipoprotein acylation states can vary in chain number, length, and attachment
position depending on the bacterial source. Acylation states are also dynamically regulated in the same
strain by particular growth environments, including by excess copper which induces expression of select
N-terminal modifying genes. This project aims to utilize ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography (uHPLC) to
characterize reconstituted lipoprotein N-terminal modification systems in vitro. Assays will help
determine enzyme mechanisms, identify acyl chain donors, and to test important active site residues. The
second part of the project will utilize HPLC to isolate and purify various model lipopeptides representing
each of the known N-terminal chemotype classes (free a-amino, N-acyl, N-acetyl, and lyso-form). The
chemotype panel will then be analyzed for copper binding and susceptibility to oxidation. The project will thus
advance our understanding of acyl transfer biochemistry and provide insight on the physiological function of
lipoprotein modifications."

Supplemental funding is requested for a new Perkin Elmer diode array UV/Vis/Near-IR
spectrophotometer with multi-sampler and sample temperature control. Our laboratory
has relied on HP/Agilent 8453 UV-Vis diode array spectrophotometers for at least two
decades, for this project and others. Both of our old HP/Agilent 8453 UV-Vis diode array
spectrophotometers have now stopped functioning, and Agilent no longer services or
makes parts for these workhorse instruments. We currently have two UV/vis
spectrophotometers, but these are scanning instruments that are slow to obtain a whole
spectrum and they are set up with fiber optic cables to obtain optical spectra inside of
glove boxes. The rapid scanning of the diode array, the temperature control, and the multi-

We are requesting administrative equipment supplemental funds to acquire a preparative HPLC that allows for
automated purifications of materials that are difficult to separate by flash column chromatography. This
instrument will significantly increase productivity and workflow towards the parent goals of R35GM130387 by
enabling rapid purification of crude reactions containing non-volatile products from catalytic reactions on complex
molecules. Currently, our research group does not have access to preparative HPLC, let alone preparative
systems with the software that allows automated transfer of conditions from analytical to preparative HPLC. A
major current focus of researchers studying catalytic reactions, including those of the PI’s laboratory, is to create
systems that introduce new functional groups in complex molecules with high selectivity. Multiple projects
supported by the PI’s current NIH funding address this general goal and would benefit from this new capability
in our group. These include the regioselective borylation, silylation, and alkylation of (sp3)C-H bonds in natural
products and complex molecules from medicinal chemistry, the selective oxidation and subsequent derivatization
of complex terpenes, and reactions catalyzed by artificial metalloenzymes, including reactions in whole cells.
With a method to rapidly purify the products of these reactions, the isomers of the product formed can be
identified, and progress on these research goals will be greatly accelerated."
11096109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic, progressive hematopoietic disorders characterized by
aberrant proliferation of myeloid lineage constituents, pro-inflammatory sequelae, progressive bone marrow
fibrosis, and increased risk of leukemic transformation. Gain-of-function mutations of the JAK/STAT pathway,
including JAK2VF, are present in the majority of MPN patients and are amenable to targeted inhibition; however,
clinically-improved JAK2 inhibitors fail to reduce mutant allele burden, and response wanes over time. Somatic
alterations in high-risk chromatin modifiers ASXL1 and EZH2 co-occur frequently with JAK2VF in MPN and confer
adverse prognosis, myelofibrotic progression, and reduced response to JAK2 therapy. The mechanisms by
which chromatin dysregulation secondary to ASXL1/EZH2 alterations enhance clonal evolution and pro-fibrotic
inflammatory pathways to promote fibrosis progression and JAK2 inhibitor resistance have not been elucidated.
Recently, we demonstrate an absolute requirement for mutant Jak2VF in MPN maintenance using a dual-
recombinase knock-in/knock-out mouse model of Jak2VF. I hypothesize that Jak2VF cooperates with Asxl1 or
Ezh2 loss to alter dependency on JAK/STAT signaling for disease maintenance and promote pro-inflammatory
signaling pathways favoring fibrotic progression. In this proposal, I will investigate the requirement for oncogenic
Jak2VF signaling and reversibility of epigenetic dysregulation and pro-inflammatory mediated fibrosis/niche
remodeling in high-risk dual-mutant MPN using my dual-recombinase Jak2VF allele. I will complement this with
single-cell DNA sequencing + immunophenotyping/cytokine analysis of clinical MPN specimens evaluating
cytokine production, clonal evolution, and order of mutation acquisition in MF progression. Further understanding
of the cooperative effects of chromatin dysregulation in fibrotic progression and therapeutic resistance in MPNs
might lead to the identification of therapeutically tractable dependencies for this high-risk MPN patient subset.

11096351,"Filipino youth living in the United States (US) have significant behavioral health problems, including alarmingly
high rates of adolescent depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal behavior. Suboptimal parent-child
relationships and harsh discipline are critical risk factors for behavioral health problems among youth. Filipino
families also face acculturative challenges, parental separation due to immigration, family conflict, parental
mental health disorders, and maltreatment. Few, if any prevention programs are available to Filipinos despite
their rapid population growth in the US. The Incredible Years® School Age Parent Training Program (IY) is an
evidence-based preventive intervention designed to improve parenting skills and parent-child relationships
among families with school age youth. As a result of pilot studies funded through a K23 grant from NICHD, a
KL2 grant from NCATS, we have demonstrated IY efficacy in improving positive parenting practices and child
depression and anxiety symptoms in Filipino families. We have improved the intervention protocol for use
online with older children and secured agreements from community agencies to participate in the project.
Further research is needed on the effectiveness of online IY, and the impact of engagement (i.e., attendance)
on intervention outcomes as well as the barriers and facilitators to implementation by providers in community
agencies. Building upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Filipino
communities in California, we propose a Type 1 hybrid, individually group randomized treatment trial to
compare IY with a usual care control group who will receive IY after 3 months. Specifically, the study seeks to
recruit a sample of 250 Filipino parents and children ages 8-12 years through community organizations in
California. Participants in both groups will be followed for a minimum of 6 months with assessments that
include parent-report and child-report. Our primary objective is to test the effectiveness of online IY on our
primary outcomes: parent-reported parenting practices (positive verbal discipline), child-reported child
depression and anxiety symptoms, and secondary outcomes: parent-reported physical punishment, parent-
reported child internalizing behavior, parent-reported child depression & anxiety symptoms, and parent- and
child-reported youth resilience. Our specific aims are: 1) To test the effectiveness of the online Incredible
Years® model of parent training and its impact on primary and secondary outcomes; 2) To determine
the impact of engagement (i.e., IY attendance) on primary outcomes; and 3) To describe intervention
delivery and its online implementation in real-world community settings. We will utilize quantitative and
qualitative research methodologies to advance the scientific understanding of parenting interventions during
middle childhood. If the approach and intervention format succeed with Filipinos, comparable strategies could
be used effectively reach other immigrant or minority populations, many of whom are reluctant to seek
preventive parenting programs."
11101052,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The challenge addressed by our T-R01 project, the global human cell surface interactome, is to generate maps
of 1) the in vitro interactions among the extracellular domains (ECDs) of human cell-surface proteins (CSPs)
and “orphan” secreted proteins and 2) the functional effect of these proteins on primary cells from the human
immune and nervous systems. There are about 2000 CSP and orphan secreted proteins that are compatible
with our in vitro binding and primary cell screening platforms. Creating a map of pairwise interactions of 2200
proteins requires testing 4.8 million interactions. This is beyond the capacity of current in vitro binding methods.
To overcome this limitation, we have developed a method to multiplex the in vitro binding screen. The
multiplexing technology uses “dye-barcoded” bait beads and high-avidity prey nanoparticles. To assess the
functional effects of CSP and secreted proteins on primary human immune and nervous system cells, we will
use automated platforms for flow cytometry, imaging, multiplexed single-cell mRNA sequencing, and single-cell
spatial transcriptomics. We have developed a method to perform cost effective multiplexed single-cell mRNA
sequencing and are developing a cost effective multiplexed single-cell spatial transcriptomics method. To carry
out the in vitro binding and primary cell functional screens, we will utilize an in-house built robotic platform that
includes liquid handlers and a chain of auxiliary instruments that will carry out the various steps of these
methods. The robotic platform includes a robot arm on a rail that moves plates between the liquid handlers and
auxiliary devices. The robotic platform is enclosed in an in-house designed BSL2 enclosure. We have
developed fully automated methods for all steps of the in vitro binding screen including: 1) subcloning >2200
synthesized genes into a mammalian expression plasmid, 2) plasmid production, quantitation and
concentration normalization, 3) transfection of human Expi293 suspension cell cultures, 4) protein purification
and quantitation, 5) automated Western blot analysis (ProteinSimple Jess instrument), and 5) all steps of the
multiplexed in vitro binding assay. We are currently developing fully automated methods for the primary cell
functional screen. Expi293 cells used for protein production grow in deep-well 96-wel plates (96-DWPs) and
require specific shaking conditions (3 mm orbital shaking diameter at 1,200 rpm) in a cell culture incubator.
These cells provide the workhorse necessary to produce the library of >2200 proteins. As protein stability is
often compromised by prolonged storage at 4 C and/or the freeze-thaw process, a high capacity shaking
incubator is necessary for production of thousands of proteins over a reasonable timeframe (~2 months),
thereby allowing rapid screening following production. Rapid production will ensure maximum protein
integrity/function is retained at the time of screening, thereby maximizing the success of identifying binding
partners and proteins that mediate immune and nervous system cell responses. The total cost for the shaking
incubator and associated components that will allow it to be integrated into the robotic platform is $178,914."

The ability of recently activated T cells to express the cell surface molecule CD40L allows them to
communicate with other immune and non-immune populations. This molecule is of particular importance in the
gut to help control the parasitic infection caused by Cryptosporidium. Here we leverage a novel, natural mouse
model of Cryptosporidium to dissect the impact of the CD40-CD40L interaction in T cell-mediated resistance to
infection in the gut. In this model, WT mice (like humans) develop sterile immunity mediated by T cell
production of IFN-γ, but mice that lack CD40L mice (like humans) do not resolve infection. In addition,
treatment of chronically infected CD40L-deficient mice with soluble (s)CD40L results in rapid parasite
clearance. We will test if protective effect of CD40L may be explained by either I. its ability to promote T cell
responses essential for resistance and/or II. because CD40L directly activates EC to limit parasite growth. We
are uniquely equipped to utilize parasite transgenesis, combined with sophisticated genetic approaches to
define the key cellular interactions that allows CD40L to determine the outcome of an enteric infection."

The objective of my laboratory is to characterize how molecular communication between bacteria and their
animal hosts leads to specific and reproducible colonization. To accomplish this goal, the laboratory studies the
Vibrio fischeri-squid system, in which the animal’s “light organ” is colonized exclusively by one bacterial
species. This system is advantageous because bacteria colonize through the natural route of infection, all
animals are colonized within three hours of bacterial inoculation into the seawater, the bacteria can be subject
to detailed genetic manipulation, the precise site of infection can be imaged directly in the live animal host, and
chemical analysis of the animal host enables detailed molecular investigations. Focusing on how squid are
reproducibly colonized by the specific symbiont, to the exclusion of the millions of competing bacteria in
seawater, has revealed key roles for bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation in promoting specific host-
microbe interactions. Questions that our group is asking include: (1) How does a symbiont regulate a
beneficial biofilm? Biofilms provide microbes with a protected environment in which they can act collectively
and resist innate immune insults and antimicrobial compounds. V. fischeri elaboration of a symbiotic biofilm is
required for entry into the host, providing an opportunity to study this process in the context of a natural host
colonization model. Our past work identified BinK as a key negative regulator of biofilm formation and the
planktonic-to-biofilm transition in the host. In this study, we examine how BinK interprets signals from the host
and how that information is transmitted to V. fischeri. We examine mechanisms of signal transduction and seek
to identify and characterize a ligand that regulates BinK activity. (2) What novel bacterial factors play critical
functions in colonization processes? We have had success in applying global genetic approaches to
identify bacterial colonization factors in V. fischeri. With a focus on novel and understudied bacterial genes for
which the V. fischeri-squid system has the potential to elucidate protein functions, we identified a protein that
has a substantial impact on biofilm formation and squid colonization. The protein is annotated as a putative
RNA-binding protein, and we will characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this protein acts and
determine how it impacts symbiotic biofilm formation. (3) How do small molecules influence microbiome
specificity and colonization? We have begun to identify compounds that are present in the host and that are
co-regulated with symbiotic behaviors. We will integrate genetic approaches to elucidate signaling pathways in
the context of host colonization. A major strength of the V. fischeri-squid system is the ability to interrogate
bacterial behavior in the intact animal host, and completion of these projects will enable a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms underlying animal colonization by beneficial microbes."

Our population is aging. As our population ages, the incidence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), an
age-associated illness, grows, resulting in elevated health care costs. A second factor contributing
to the current rise in age-associated aliments is the American diet with its ever-increasing amount
of added sugar. The negative effects of added dietary sugar is in part due to advanced glycation
end products (AGEs) which form from the process of glycation where a sugar molecule attaches
to a protein or lipid without enzymatic regulation thereby altering its structure and/or function.
AGEs form in normal metabolism but when AGEs rise to high levels in tissues and circulation, as
in diabetes or high dietary sugar, they can become pathogenic since AGEs promote oxidative
stress and inflammation. A third contributor to the increases in AD is the microbiome; recent
studies have linked age-associated illness with changes in the microbiome. The central unifying
hypothesis of this proposal is that consumption of a sugar-loaded diet alters the microbiome and
contributes to the onset and severity of AD. We will address this hypothesis with two specific aims
using a Caenorhabditis elegans–Escherichia coli system.
 Our experimental C. elegans–E. coli paradigm is an excellent system for these studies
because: (1) C. elegans are bacterivores and have an obligatory symbiotic relationship with
microbes as their food source, which becomes the intestinal microbiota; (2) C. elegans possess
stress and immune signaling pathways that are evolutionarily conserved; (3) Genetic tools are
available including transgenic strains for AD whereby human β-Amyloid precursor protein (Aβ
peptide) is driven by a tissue specific promoter. (4) We can modify the environment (added sugar)
resulting in changes in the levels of dietary AGEs(dAGEs); and (5) Our preliminary data show
when C. elegans consume live (microbiota) or heat killed (no microbiota) sugar-loaded high-
dAGE E. coli, C. elegans have a shortened lifespan and reduced healthspan. Our results also
demonstrate the importance of the microbiota as a buffer for stress. In Specific Aim 1, we will
address the effects of a sugar-loaded high-dAGEs diet on AD transgenic animals with heat killed
or live bacteria. In Specific Aim 2, we use a series of genetic tools, (including mutants,
transgenics)to provide mechanistic insight. This proposal exploits a symbiotic relationship to
define how a sugar loaded/high dAGEs diet promotes Aβ accumulation. Our results in the two-
year period could be paradigm shifting in our understanding of the impact of added dietary glucose
on AD. The long-term goal is to modify diet to delay or even eliminate the onset of AD."

For replicated chromosomes to be segregated to two daughter cells accurately, the microtubule (MT)
cytoskeleton must be completely remodeled to form a bipolar spindle. A large, dynamic protein complex called
the kinetochore attaches replicated chromosomes to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles.
Proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment is vital for preservation of genomic integrity and prevention of
cancer and birth defects. Therefore, mitotic spindle assembly and kinetochore attachment must be well
coordinated. Challenging understanding of these processes and their coordination is the fact that mitotic
spindles and kinetochores are extremely complex molecular machines (kinetochores contain >60 proteins),
that they are targets of phosphoregulation by multiple protein kinases, and that they possess a striking range of
biochemical activities. Kinetochore activities include: (1) lateral MT binding, (2) translocation along the MT
lattice to the plus end, (3) conversion from lateral to end-binding, (4) association with dynamic MT ends while
tubulin subunits are exchanged, and (5) serving as force-coupling devices between chromosomes and MT plus
ends during anaphase A. Understanding how the kinetochore performs its various functions, the structural
underpinnings of these activities, and how these activities are regulated post-translationally, is far from
complete. A biochemical cell-lysate assay recently developed in the Barnes laboratory combines, for the first
time, two of the most powerful approaches for studies of microtubule dynamics: biochemical extract studies
and genetics. Dynamics of single microtubules and single kinetochores associated with these microtubules are
revealed and quantitatively analyzed by highly sensitive Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy.
Cell lysates synchronized to specific cell-cycle stages are made from budding yeast mutants of specific mitotic
proteins. Quantitative analysis of MT dynamics and kinetochore activities will establish how these parameters
are regulated in the cell cycle, and these studies will identify the specific proteins that carry out the specific
behaviors. Since mitosis is a highly conserved process, lessons learned from these studies are expected to
apply broadly. Unlike many other assays, this assay exclusively uses homologous sources of tubulin and
interacting proteins, avoiding artefacts that arise from species mismatch incompatibilities. Proposed studies
build upon recent unique observations of microtubule dynamics regulation and kinetochore dynamic activity in
this lysate system. The objectives are: (1) To investigate biochemical activities of intact kinetochores and their
regulation, and to relate kinetochore structure to function; and (2) To investigate how microtubule dynamics are
regulated through the cell cycle in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, focusing on Kar3 and Kip3 kinesins."

Important Problem. A critical event in human embryonic development is the elongation of the anterior-posterior
axis. How the embryo achieves stable and sustained axial elongation remains unknown. Progenitor cells in the
tailbud of the elongating embryo contribute to the future spinal cord and musculoskeletal system (1-4). How
underlying gene regulatory networks and morphogen signals drive the fate decisions of these cells between self-
renewal and differentiation in humans still needs to be determined. Addressing these questions will allow us to
understand human axial elongation and the etiology of related diseases (5-11). We address two questions: How
do morphogen signals break anterior-posterior symmetry and drive stable and self-sustained elongation along a
single axis? And, how do the progenitors in the tail bud of the elongating embryo maintain a self-renewing pool
even as they differentiate into neural and mesodermal fates?
Proposed Research: To address these questions, we bring together a robust and validated in vitro organoid
system, live imaging, validated pluripotent stem cell lines with multiple fluorescent reporters, and perturbation
experiments. In Aim 1, we will determine 1A. the cell types and the spatiotemporal expression profiles of
signaling ligands and receptors along the axially elongating organoids; 1B. the signaling pathways necessary for
A-P symmetry breaking, driving cellular rearrangements, growth, and elongation; 1C. the endogenous
spatiotemporal dynamics of these signaling pathways during axial elongation; 1D. the mechanisms for robustly
breaking symmetry and activating self-sustaining elongation only at the posterior pole without being driven by
noise to produce multiple tailbuds and branched axes. In Aim 2, we will determine 2A. The sequence of lineage
decisions that tailbud progenitors make; 2B. The transcription factors (TFs) that control the fate decisions of
these progenitors; 2C. the key signals are required to choose between the maintenance of progenitors and their
differentiation into neural or mesodermal fates; and 2D. Mechanisms by which the signals and TFs maintain a
pool of undifferentiated tailbud progenitors to allow continued elongation.
Impact: Our work will uncover the dynamical system that governs human axial elongation and the fate decisions
of tailbud progenitors. In doing so, it will find the feedback loops and concomitant bistable systems that lead to
self-sustaining elongation, noise suppression mechanisms to prevent axis branching, which otherwise would
lead to a multiple and branched axes, the mechanism that maintains a niche of tailbud progenitors that is
essential for continued elongation, even while allowing these progenitors to differentiate into the developing
tissues. We will thus achieve a quantitative understanding of human axial elongation and determine how the
niche of tailbud progenitors is maintained. The research will reveal fundamental principles governing human
development and open novel avenues to understanding the etiology of associated human developmental
disorders, such as spina bifida and scoliosis (5-11)."

The efficient and stereoselective preparation of chiral organic molecules is vitally important to the development
of new therapeutic agents. However, despite significant progress, many desirable complex 2D and 3D molecular
scaffolds remain difficult to access or are inefficiently prepared. Consequently, development of new
transformations that provide synthetic chemists with strategic bond disconnections that facilitate de novo
approaches to organic synthesis is of great importance. In addition, such methods should be robust, practical,
allow the preparation of useful amounts of material, and ideally employ readily available starting materials. The
aim of this MIRA grant is the conversion of an NIGMS funded project with a long-term goal that broadly seeks to
develop and exploit new, practical, and efficient stereoselective new technologies for organic synthesis of
molecular scaffolds of biological importance that are otherwise difficult to access, or inefficiently prepared via
current processes. To this end, we are interested in developing transformations that leverage the broad chemical
reactivity of boron-stabilized chemical synthons for complex molecule synthesis. This approach is attractive
because reactions of such intermediates permit novel bond constructions and simultaneous installation of a
synthetically desirable boron moiety. The proposed studies described in this program will further our expanding
studies of catalytic stereoselective C–C bond forming reactions with organoboron reagents. These readily
accessible reagents merge powerful bond forming reactivity with broad synthetic utility, to deliver versatile
organic compounds of notable significance for fragment-based drug discovery. Building off our previous work,
we are developing new catalytic C–C, C–N, and C–X bond forming methods for the synthesis of chiral amines,
alcohols, and aromatic structures, with a particular focus on examples that contain quaternary carbon
stereogenic centers. We envision that chiral metal nucleophiles can be accessed by enantioselective
transmetalation of readily accessible achiral organodiboron reagents. The resultant nucleophilic species can
engage in a number of enantioselective reactions with various C=O, C=N, C–X electrophiles. We also aim to
target the generation and utility of novel boron-functionalized synthons by metal-free Lewis base catalysis for
reactions with electrophiles that are difficult to achieve via transition metal catalysis. Importantly, enantioselective
variants of these unknown reactions will herein be explored. Furthermore, new nucleophilic aromatic substitution
reactions of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds with organoboron carbon nucleophiles will be developed
that operate under metal-free conditions. Overall, by exploring synthetic reactions of organoborons, these studies
in methods development will introduce new transformations and strategies that will streamline synthetic chemists’
approaches to complex molecules important to biomedical research."

11099290,"Changes that can persist for many generations without altering DNA sequence have been reported in many
organisms. The existence of such heritable epigenetic changes has also been claimed in humans in response
to some stressful experiences such as starvation and psychological trauma. However, there is poor
understanding of the mechanistic basis for the persistence of epigenetic changes across generations in any
organism. Although molecules mediating such changes have been identified in multiple systems (e.g., DNA
methylation, chromatin modifications, small RNAs, etc.), the mere presence of these molecules and chemical
modifications do not predict the persistence of any newly introduced epigenetic change. Recent conceptual
advances that provide a system-level understanding of heredity suggest that changes in regulatory architectures
drive and maintain heritable epigenetic changes. Therefore, focusing on the regulatory architectures can reveal
the important interactions required for explaining any change that can last for multiple generations regardless of
the particular molecules that mediate these interactions. In the nematode C. elegans, multiple phenomena have
been reported whereby RNA-mediated regulation is used to sustain the silencing of gene expression for
hundreds of generations. These phenomena thus provide opportunities for analyzing heritable epigenetic
changes at single-gene resolution to gain insights. In addition to the expected broad applicability of insights into
regulatory architectures, even some of the specific molecules used to regulate heritable epigenetic changes in
C. elegans such as piRNAs, phase-separated RNA granules, the double-stranded RNA importer SID-1, and
small RNA-bound Argonaute proteins are conserved in many organisms, including humans. Our preliminary
results have revealed insights into a regulatory architecture that promotes stable RNA silencing of a model
transgene encoding a fluorescent protein and endogenous genes that are similarly susceptible to heritable
epigenetic changes in gene expression. The aims of this proposal are: (1) to analyze model genes to discover
the regulatory sequences and perturbations that promote transgenerational gene silencing; and (2) to analyze
regulation of endogenous genes to elucidate the regulatory architectures that have evolved to control heritable
epigenetic changes in gene expression within the germline. Completion of these goals will provide both a general
view of heritable epigenetic changes at any gene and reveal the regulatory architecture of evolved mechanisms.
These results will provide a better understanding of hereditary diseases, particularly diseases that could have
an epigenetic origin in earlier generations."

individuals suffering from psychotic illness”. However, rates of Social Security Administration disability (SSI/DI)
enrollment remain high for young people in early psychosis treatment. Existing studies on SSI/DI have limited
information on the FEP population. Enrollment in SSI/DI may provide benefits (including cash assistance,
access to Medicaid/Medicare, and other social entitlements), but also detrimentally impact identity, vocational
aspirations, career development and employment; individuals rarely leave SSAD benefits for full-time work.
Racial disparities have also been identified, but remain poorly understood, with respect to the intersections
between race, structural racism and the poorer outcomes long-documented among ethnoracialized minorities,
particularly Black Americans. It is crucial to generate knowledge with the potential to inform decision-making
about the benefits and trade-offs inherent in SSI/DI participation and help optimize outcomes within the context
of SSI/DI participation among this population of young people (e.g. generally aged 16-30).
 The primary goal of this project is to investigate factors influencing decisions to apply for SSI/DI, the
impact of these decisions, and the longitudinal relationships between SSI/DI and career development. This
information will then be used to develop systematic strategies for improving services, supporting client decision
making and optimizing outcomes.
 The NIMH-funded Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET), spanning 105 coordinated specialty
care (CSC) programs across 16 states, affords an exceptional opportunity to better understand these issues.
Leveraging the EPINET initiative, this multi-phase, mixed methods study will provide important new knowledge
regarding predictors of application and the relationship between SSI/DI and vocational functioning, will facilitate
development and evaluation of a multi-level menu of actionable targets and associated implementation
strategies, for example, specific ways of improving programmatic supports and policy changes designed to
strengthen SSAD-related outcomes (translation of research to practice). The project is guided by the multi-level

application, SSAD enrollment and work/school functioning among clients enrolled in CSC programs,
systematically investigate the client experience of SSI/DI decision making (through quantitative and qualitative

Parental environmental influences such as diet affect energy metabolism in the next generation

function as signals mediating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, very little is known on the
mechanisms how these signals are regulated. This in part due to a lack of genetic model systems,
suitable for carrying out detailed investigations.
The X-linked gene Rlim encodes a RING finger E3 ligase that functions as a major epigenetic
regulator in female mice, as it is crucial for imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI), the
epigenetic silencing of the paternally transmitted X chromosome in female preimplantation
embryos to achieve X dosage compensation. Indeed, a maternally transmitted Rlim KO allele
results in early embryonic lethality in females, while males lacking Rlim grow into adulthood. We
recently showed that in testes of males Rlim is highly expressed both in Sertoli cells (SCs) and
in spermatogenic cells at the round spermatid stage. Despite being fertile, mice with systemic
ablation of Rlim produce less sperm which additionally is dysfunctional. Targeting a conditional
KO (cKO) to testicular cell types, our published results demonstrate that Rlim activity in
spermatogenic cells but not SCs is required for normal spermatogenesis.
We found that offspring sired by fathers systemically lacking Rlim is protected from high fat diet
(HFD)-induced obesity in a transgenerational epigenetic effect. Targeting the cKO of Rlim in
fathers, we demonstrate that lack of Rlim in SCs recapitulates this effect. As paternal signals
transmitting transgenerational effects are transmitted in sperm, our unpublished results provide
genetic evidence for a novel SCspermHFD-response in offspring pathway.
Our future research research will exploit our unique Rlim cKO mice to investigate this pathway
to A) elucidate molecular mechanisms of Rlim action in SCs, B) identify the epigenetic signal in
sperm and how it is generated, and C) uncover downstream effects in offspring ultimately
leading to changes in HFD-response.
The overarching goal of the future research is to establish the Rlim mouse model as a novel
paradigm for transgenerational epigenetic regulation. This research will define the SCsperm
offspring pathway in a larger biological context and, using cutting edge technologies, will identify
new and fundamental epigenetic mechanisms."

Research and training in organic synthesis impacts all fields of science that require the design and construction
of molecular architecture. This project will advance catalytic methods, including hydroacylation and
hydroamination, as attractive and powerful tools for chemical synthesis. The coupling methods proposed are
modern and innovative because they rely on common functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, amines) to generate
new carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds from unsaturated partners (e.g., styrenes, dienes,
cyclopropenes), with high selectivity and atom economy. Through experimental and theoretical studies, this
project will yield fundamental insights into the mechanism of various transition metal catalysts, including rhodium,
cobalt, and copper. Beyond catalysis and mechanistic studies, we plan to build chemical motifs of high
significance to the field of drug discovery. We target privileged motifs (e.g., chiral nitrogen-containing
heterocycles) and explore chemical space (e.g., tricyclic cages bearing high sp3 character). Through
partnerships with experts in other fields, we address exciting challenges in fluorescent microscopy, NMR
spectroscopy, and cancer immunotherapy by designing functional molecules. This project demonstrates
innovation in making molecules at the interface of catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and biology."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Lymphedema, which results from the failure of the lymphatic system to properly drain fluid, proteins, lipids, and
immune cells from the interstitium of the skin, leads to irreversible tissue remodeling including fibrosis, swelling,
and lipid accumulation. It occurs most commonly in the US as a result of cancer treatment. In breast cancer
almost 1 in 3 survivors develop lymphedema and the presence has persisted in spite of reductions to the
aggressiveness of cancer therapy achieved through sentinel lymph node biopsy. Being diagnosed with
lymphedema remains a life sentence as there is no cure. In this project, a new therapeutic paradigm for treating
lymphedema will be explored using pre-clinical models of surgically induced disease.
The objective of this program is to further develop and optimize a lymphatic-targeting sustained drug delivery
system for lymphedema therapy. Different types of lymphatic pump function modulators [L-type calcium channel
activator and potassium channel blocker] and two classes of immunomodulators that ameliorate lymphedema-
induced inflammation [inhibitors of calcineurin and transforming growth factor beta], and synergies in improving
the benefits of vascularized lymph node transfer will be tested. The single vessel ligation mouse model of
lymphedema will be used as, in contrast to genetic models, it is not plagued by transgene-associated immune
deficiencies and closely resembles the pathophysiology of human disease. Utilizing unique dual-wavelength
near infrared imaging capabilities, lymphatic function and drug biodistribution over disease progression and
therapy will be tracked. This will be achieved through three specific aims: Aim 1 will focus on lymphatic delivery
and effects of drugs restoring lymphatic pump function. Aim 2 will harness methods of sustained delivery into
locoregional tissues as well as lymphatic delivery to lymph nodes to determine the effects of immune modulatory
cargos on the immune cell populations within the draining lymph node, the resulting pathology in the
lymphedematous tissue, and the consequences to lymphatic function. Aim 3 will investigate the combined
delivery of lymphatic function bolstering or immune modulatory agents in a model of chronic lymphedema and
synergies in combination with vascular lymph node transplant, the only existing investigational surgical
intervention for lymphedema. The expected outcome of this project is a therapeutic regime for improving
lymphatic function in the treatment of lymphedema, replacing watch-and-wait philosophy with low-dose (but
focused) drugs that support lymphatic transport functions.

11095368,"Anti-Aging Molecule Sirt6 in Neuroprotection in Diabetic Retina
SUMMARY
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent cause of blindness in working age adults in the US today. It was
traditionally characterized as microvascular complications due to its clinical manifestation of a period of vascular
leakage and degeneration followed by neovascularization. However, recent studies in animal models and
patients have shown that retinal neuron injury, in particular retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and loss,
occurs at early stage of DR and contributes to vision loss. Moreover, though less studies, dysfunction and
degeneration of axons of RGC is also evident in diabetes. Current therapies for DR targets clinically significant
vascular leakage or neovascularization, which happens much later, and do not protect retinal neurons. This
project is to delineate the mechanisms of RGC injury and axonal degeneration during DR in order to identify
novel strategies to limit injury and preserve vision. Increasing evidence indicates that stress-induced premature
senescence (SIPS) plays a key role in many diseases. There are a few studies reporting SIPS in DR but they
are exclusively focused on endothelial cells and have not linked SIPS to DR pathology. There is a significant
knowledge gap on how Db induce SIPS in the retina and how to regulate such mechanisms for DR treatment.
Sirt6 is a key anti-aging molecule belonging to the sirtuin family that is evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases and shares homolog with yeast Sir2 protein, a
critical regulator of the lifespan of yeast. We now propose to test a hypothesis that Sirt6 suppresses chronic
activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)-ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) pathway to prevent
dysfunction/degeneration of RGCs and their axons in DR, partly by inhibiting RGC senescence and
mitochondrial dysfunction. We will use our newly developed Sirt6 global and conditional knockout
(KO)/overexpression mice, AAV2-mediated gene knockdown, clinic-relevant non-invasive imaging and
functional tests, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry and morphometric analyses to test this hypothesis. This
study will identify novel roles of Sirt6 and DDR-ATM pathway in RGC and axonal degeneration in DR and
establish a link between these them. It will also provide proof-of-concept that boosting anti-aging mechanisms
may be utilized to treat DR."
11095369,"Abstract
An exciting recent development for high spatial resolution deep tissue imaging is long wavelength three-
photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM). Since its first demonstration of imaging subcortical structures in the
mouse brain, 3PM has driven rapid progress in deep tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon
fluorescence microscopy (2PM). Long-wavelength 3PM is perhaps the most promising new technology for
deep imaging within scattering biological tissues, and has potential impacts in a large number of biomedical
fields such as neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology. On the other hand, there are a number of
challenges that must be overcome before 3PM can reach its full potential. Because it is a higher-order
nonlinear process, three- photon excitation (3PE) is inherently weaker than two-photon excitation (2PE). The
weak signal strength of 3PM is particularly problematic for fast imaging of dynamic cellular process.
Furthermore, the laser sources for 3PM are not yet optimized for deep tissue penetration, and the complexity
and cost of the excitation source is a major barrier for the applications of 3PM in a typical biomedical research
lab. Finally, nearly all 3PM applications today are in the brains. Reaching anatomical frontiers is equally
possible in other organs with 3PM, but explicit demonstrations of intravital imaging in novel locations are
needed to bring deep imaging capability to other biological systems. The research activity of this proposal will
directly address the above challenges for in vivo deep tissue 3PM. We will develop a new generation of 3PM
that will improve the performance of existing 3PM by two orders of magnitude and enable multi-color deep
tissue imaging with a single excitation wavelength. We will demonstrate the unprecedented imaging
capabilities with a low-cost, fiber-based laser system, removing a key barrier for the deployment of 3PM in
biology labs. Furthermore, by applying our techniques to a wide variety of biological systems, we will create a
valuable knowledge base for the applications of 3PM. Our development of the next generation 3PM parallels
the development of 2PM, where the concerted development effort in lasers, microscopes, and biological
applications in the 1990s made 2PM ubiquitous in biomedical research labs by the early 2000s. Our vision is to
make deep, fast 3PM a routine instrument for a wide variety of biomedical applications just as 2PM does in the
shallower regions of biological tissues and organs. The successful completion of this program will enable
visualization of dynamic process at the sub-cellular level in intact organs and animal models that are
completely beyond the reach of any existing imaging techniques."

New Methods for the Synthesis and Study of Bioactive Nitrogen-Containing Molecules
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ubiquitous presence of nitrogen atom in small-molecule probes and drugs highlights the significance of
nitrogen-containing molecules in biomedical research and drug discovery. Rapid and efficient synthesis of
structurally diverse nitrogen-containing skeletons is of the utmost importance, as is the ability to understand
their biology, pharmacology and potential as chemical probes and drug candidates. Thus, developing new
methods for the synthesis and study of novel nitrogen-containing molecules is significant and necessary to
advance our understanding of human disease and the discovery of new therapies. The broad availability of
drugs is directly dependent on the existence of cost-efficient methods that can reliably build such novel
molecular structures and uncover their biological activity and therapeutic promise. The long-term goal of our
research is to establish a chemical platform that expedite the synthesis and development of novel small-
molecule probes and tools toward advancing the understanding and treatment of human disease. The
objective of this project is to develop new catalytic selective alkene aminofunctionalization methods that enable
rapid and efficient access to structurally complex and richly functionalized novel nitrogen-containing molecules
from readily available alkene as starting materials. Toward this, this application will exploit the electrophilic
amination strategy based on the unique and diverse reactivity of heteroatom-nitrogen bonds––readily available
yet traditionally underutilized nitrogen precursors––to design new C–N bond formation reactions that are
different but complementary to existing methods. Successful implementation of these studies will greatly
facilitate the synthesis and study of a wide range of nitrogen-containing molecules that are difficult or
impossible to access with current technologies. Lessons learned in reaction engineering for efficacy and
selectivity will be applicable to the invention and development of useful chemical processes, beyond amination
chemistry. Overall, these new abilities are highly valuable and important in organic synthesis, medicinal
chemistry, biomedical research, and drug discovery, by greatly contributing to the expansion of novel chemical
space and diversity of N-containing molecules as well as the discovery of new lead compounds and small-
molecule probes."
11098867,"Development and Applications of Bioorthogonal Chemistry: Equipment Supplement
ABSTRACT
We have a long-standing interest in developing reactivity-based tools to address significant biological problems
that are difficult to solve using conventional techniques. In our MIRA application, we plan to continue our
studies of orthogonal chemical reactivity in the following three projects. In Project 1, we will design hydrazonyl
sultone (HS)-based fluorescence turn-on reagents for constructing FRET-based biosensors to probe class B
GPCR activation and signal dynamics in live cells. In Project 2, we will design β-lactam-encoded enzyme traps
for covalent capture and subsequent identification of protein lysine methyltransferase substrates in living cells.
In Project 3, we will develop covalent nanobody-based immunoPET radiotracers with enhanced performance.
The HS-mediated, binding-accelerated ligation reaction will be exploited to achieve greater PET imaging
sensitivity without undesired nephrotoxicity. We expect these studies will offer new capabilities of covalent
chemistry in biomedical research. This Equipment Supplement requests the acquisition of a Sartorius
OCTET-R2 Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) System. This equipment will enable us to rigorously characterize
covalent binding of protein substrates toward the designed enzyme traps described in Project 2, and optimize
the nanobody-based reaction partners for the HS-based immunoPET radiotracers described in Project 3."
11098883,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The major goal of our research program is to unravel mechanisms and detect errors during processing of
repetitive DNA or RNA sequences that could lead to genomic instability and cell dysfunction. A considerable
fraction of the genome in nearly all organisms consists of repetitive DNA sequences. It has been suggested
that these repetitive sequences play a role in several cellular processes. However, repetitive DNA sequences
can adopt non-conventional DNA and RNA structures, which can be a challenge for the DNA replication,
transcription and translation machinery to travel through and process correctly. Prolonged stalling of the
replication forks in human cells can have severe consequences, such as genome instability that include
chromosome fragility, genomic mutations and expansions of these repeat sequences. Also, repetitive
sequences located in the mRNA can interfere with translation and lead to aberrant protein expression. Several
neurological and muscular diseases are caused by repeat expansions. To avoid genomic instability at
repetitive sequences human cells employ several mechanisms to prevent genomic alterations, cell death and
diseases. BRCA1 is one of such proteins, which is involved in several molecular pathways including DNA
repair and DNA replication. However, it is not clear how much BRCA1 is needed to fulfill all BRCA1 functions
properly, and which back-up mechanisms are activated in cells with 50% of BRCA1 expression. In addition,
repetitive sequences in the mRNA can trigger repeat-associated non-UTG (RAN)-initiated translation leading to
the generation of abnormal polypeptides that form inclusions in human cells and cause several neurological,
ovarian and muscular disorders. However, the mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction, cell death and repeat
expansions induced by these abnormal inclusions are not clearly understood. In addition, it is not known which
trans factors and mechanisms promote repeat expansion in human cells. Aberrant inclusions could sequester
or dysregulate nuclear repair proteins causing DNA damage, cell dysfunction and apoptosis. In this MIRA
application we seek to determine these mechanisms and DNA repair pathways leading to genomic instability in
proliferating cells and large repeat expansion in non-proliferating human oocytes. The expected outcome of
this studies will be new knowledge how repetitive DNA and RNA sequences induce genomic instability and cell
dysfunction in so far rare studied human cells."

The Mechanisms of New-Onset Autoimmunity-Longitudinal Immune Systems Analysis (MONA-LISA) will use
clinical data and biospecimens obtained during performance of the clinical trial, Study of Anti-Malarials in
Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus (SMILE, NCT03030118) to investigate immunological mechanisms that
propel individuals who have asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic autoimmunity towards a definite diagnosis
of systemic lupus erythematosus. These data and specimens are a unique resource, representing longitudinal
clinical assessments, patient-reported outcomes, DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and urine obtained in a standardized manner before, during, and after the progression from Incomplete
Lupus Erythematosus to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) – an observation that occurred in twenty
percent of the SMILE participants available for study. The overall objective of the study is to learn the
underlying immunological, genomic, and metabolic differences present in individuals who progress to SLE
compared to those that do not progress with goals to both develop better diagnostic and prognostic tools for
health care providers as well as describe novel therapeutic targets so that individuals with early features of
autoimmunity can be prevented from progressing to a state of organ damage and disability.
The Specific Aims of MONA-LISA include: 1) Obtain a comprehensive, multiplex analysis of the peripheral
blood immunophenotype of progressors and non-progressors in the SMILE cohort using a novel 137-plex
CITE-seq analysis, sn-ATAC-seq, sc-RNA-seq and T and B cell repertoire determination to create a robust,
quantitative atlas of cell-specific mRNA and epigenomic profiling in PBMC of these individuals. 2) Perform
targeted genomic sequencing to categorize regulatory and structural variants of SLE risk loci to tie together the
transcriptomic and epigenomic data and create novel risk assessments based on gene regulation. 3) Explore
plasma and serum metabolic and lipid components that can serve as novel features that classify the risk of
SMILE participants who progress towards classification with lupus. 4) Lastly, because SMILE enrolled fewer
Black individuals than are represented in the epidemiology of prevalent lupus patients, we will perform a
focused recruitment of non-European individuals with ILE and compare their multi-omic characterization of
immunophenotypes described in Aims 1-3. This will allow more complete and generalizable conclusions to be
drawn across ethnic groups and identify any ancestry-specific variations in the risk of autoimmunity
progression that can explain the observed differences in lupus epidemiology. When completed, MONA-LISA
will provide researchers and health care providers with better tools to predict who will develop lupus and create
more effective interventional trials for disease prevention."
11099137,"The exponential surge in the prevalence of neurological diseases/disorders, partly due to the rapid growth in the
aged population, poses a significant challenge to the prevention and treatment of impairments in cognitive,
sensory, and motor functions. However, our insufficient understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of many neurological diseases delays the development of effective treatments to address this
challenge. Recent advances in optogenetics have provided novel tools to investigate complex neural circuits and
brain functions. Due to a limited penetration depth of photons, however, the invasiveness of light sources into
the brain tissue of live animals to control opto-sensitive ion channels has been one of the major challenges in
optogenetics. In this regard, our goal is to develop a modular mechanoluminescent (ML) material platform for
the non-invasive, acoustic activation of various optogenetic channels for neural modulation with a high
spatiotemporal resolution. This project builds upon our recent technological achievements, in which we
developed various synthesis methods to produce novel structures of inorganic nanomaterials and high
piezoelectric organic nanofiber fragments. Based on our preliminary computational modeling, we hypothesize
that such structures enable greater effective strains that maximize the ML performance of the inorganic-organic
hybrid nanomaterials. This project aims to develop two unique optogenetic modulation systems based on ML
nanomaterials. In Aim 1, we will synthesize zinc sulfide nanoparticles doped with various metal ions to control
emission wavelengths and investigate the effect of nanoparticle morphology and dimension on ML performance.
Furthermore, the interaction between those nanoparticles and encapsulating polymer will be optimized to
maximize the ML performance of nanocomposites. In Aim 2, we will characterize the piezoelectric properties of
electrospun fiber-derived nanofragments and investigate the incorporation of ML nanoparticles into the
piezoelectric nanofragments to boost ML performance. An in vitro model based on a neural stem cell line
transduced with Channelrhodopsin-2 will be utilized to determine the performance of these ML nanomaterials
for neuromodulation. Overall, we anticipate that these studies will provide material bases for ML nanoparticles
injectable into the circulatory system (Aim 1) and for ML nanofragments injectable into a site of interest (Aim 2).
The results of this exploratory project are expected to identify candidates for ML nanomaterial platforms for
further optimization and animal testing in subsequent studies."
11099142,"ABSTRACT
Our healthcare system does not treat patients equally: some receive poorer quality care based on their racial/
ethnic identity, social class, health literacy, age, gender or medical conditions such as obesity, sickle cell disease,
and substance use disorders. While there may be many factors that contribute to these disparities, implicit bias
among clinicians is one important factor that remains difficult to measure. Clinicians may convey and acquire
bias towards patients from each other when communicating orally or when writing/reading medical records.
Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, few studies have evaluated
patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another. Our own preliminary work has
found that language used in medical records has a direct influence on subsequent clinicians who read the notes,
both in terms of their attitudes towards the patient and their medication prescribing behavior; that there are racial
disparities in the use of stigmatizing language; and that this language reflects actual attitudes held by the
clinicians. This is an important and overlooked pathway by which bias can be passed from one clinician to
another, further impairing healthcare quality for the individual patient as well as exacerbating disparities overall
for those who are stigmatized. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality and equity of care for persons who
are disrespected and stigmatized in healthcare. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to define and develop
a taxonomy of stigmatizing language in medical records using qualitative analyses with input from clinicians and
patients across 5 different medical specialty areas, (2) to measure and test for bias in the use of stigmatizing
language in medical records using natural language processing (NLP) that can efficiently detect and quantify
stigmatizing language in electronic patient records, and then (3) to reduce stigmatizing language in medical
records using proven implementation science (IS) strategies (stakeholder engagement, education, audit and
feedback, and champions) to motivate and enable health system change. Every encounter with a patient is
documented in the medical record. Because language may have a powerful role in influencing subsequent
clinician attitudes and behavior, attention to the language used in medical records could have a large impact on
the promotion of respect and reduction of disparities for stigmatized groups."
11099145,"Project Summary/Abstract
Trauma and Surgical Sepsis are among the leading causes of morbidity and death worldwide. Both of these acute
insults can lead to immune dysfunction that then contributes to a state of persistent critical illness. This immune
dysfunction is manifested by an excessive systemic inflammatory response that can lead to organ dysfunction;
and a simultaneous suppression of immune defenses that renders patients susceptible to secondary infections.
However, we lack a comprehensive and integrated view of how humans respond to severe injury, and more
importantly, how these responses differ between patients that recover quickly vs. those that die and/or
development persistent critical illness. Advances in single cell multiomics and systemic multi-platform,
multiomics now makes it possible to characterize changes across a broad range of cell states and patterns with
the circulating biomolecule landscape to great depth. In the previous funding cycle, we were the first to apply
single cell genomics and large-scale multi-platform, multiomics of blood samples in severely injured patients.
This published work identified many novel findings, including the early massive release of cellular constituents
in trauma patients that follow a complicated course or die. In addition, open chromatin analysis of PBMC found
that patients who remain critically ill also have global epigenetic changes evident early across immune cell types,
representing de-repression of polycomb targets. In one line of research, we will reverse translate the these
and other dramatic findings from our initial human multiomic analyses into our mouse model of hemorrhagic
shock and trauma to pursue potential therapeutic targets. In another line of research, we will extend our
multiomic analysis to create a Blood Atlas of the human trauma response. This online resource will incorporate
data on the range of circulating immune cell states commonly seen after severe injury and integrate these with
the longitudinal changes in high dimensional datasets of circulating proteins, lipids and other metabolites. We
will apply state-of-the-art computational strategies to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets with patients
stratified by outcomes, treatments, age and sex. We will compare our results with similar published studies in
sepsis. In addition to the discoveries and mechanistic insights our analysis will yield, we hope that the resources
we provide will stimulate comparative studies and further analyses of our datasets.
Research Strategy
Scientific Justification
Hemorrhage due to trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a key driver of mortality in severely-
injured patients. Coagulation phenotypes are dynamic post-injury, rapidly transitioning from an
anti-coagulant to pro-coagulant state (1). These states are highly dependent on a variety of
extrinsic variables such as dilution of blood with resuscitation fluids, environmental temperature,
and acidosis (2). The complex nature of the coagulation phenotype post-injury may be better
elucidated in a well-controlled animal model and we believe the studies outlined below will
provide important data regarding the role of cell death mechanisms in driving coagulation
phenotypes. Our extensive matrix of animal modeling studies provide an excellent opportunity
to characterize the role of these processes in driving TIC.
The proposed equipment purchase of a ROTEM delta (Werfen. Bedford, MA) will be used to
generate coagulation profiles of mouse plasma obtained using our hemorrhagic shock model.
We have proposed to use this animal model extensively in the parent R35, as it is the central
research which comprises Strategy 3, summarized below. Acquisition of this additional data
from plasma already in hand will bolster our already-extensive multi-omic analyses and move
our research in a novel direction by filling key gaps in our characterization of trauma
phenotypes. Adding a coagulation “-omics” component to our existing multi-omic workflow will
allow for mechanistic and correlation analysis not previously performed in trauma.
Strategy 3. Use of multi-platform, multi-omics to characterize the systemic response to injury
We will subject mice to severe (3 hour) and mild, resolving (1 hour) hemorrhagic shock
according to our standard model. Blood will be withdrawn at the appropriate endpoint using
cardiac puncture and divided into a heparinized tube for proteomic/metabolomic analysis and a
citrated tube for ROTEM analysis. Of note, studies will be performed on both male and female
mice in order to define the key differences in traumatic phenotypes associated with sex. The
treatment groups currently in progress or undergoing breeding crosses are outlined in the chart
below.

11099146,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the subcellular site of secretory and membrane protein synthesis
and performs critical functions in secretory/membrane protein biogenesis and cellular proteostasis. In addition
its established role in secretory/membrane protein synthesis, recent studies examining the mRNA
transcriptomes of cytosolic and ER-bound ribosomes reveal that cytosolic protein transcripts are broadly
represented on the ER, with ribosome footprinting analyses demonstrating translation of cytosolic protein
mRNAs on ER-associated ribosomes. These findings identify an unexpected mRNA transcriptome-wide
function for the ER in proteome expression and reopen fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms
regulating mRNA localization and translation on the ER. Principally, where current models posit that mRNA
localization to the ER is co-translational and signal sequence-dependent, the abundant presence and
translation of cytosolic protein mRNAs on the ER indicates that either alternative and/or multiple pathways
mediate mRNA localization to the ER. As well, and although SRP pathway function in protein translocation is
well established, the question of SRP pathway function in mRNA localization to the ER remains largely
unexplored. Also of significance, the recent findings that a number of translocon-associated proteins, including
Sec61α,β, TRAPα, ribophorin I, and p180, are mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) suggest previously
unappreciated roles for ER resident RBPs in the biology of RNA localization and translation on the ER.
 This proposal merges three primary research themes of our laboratory; SRP pathway function in mRNA
and ribosome localization to the ER; ii) ER-localized translation initiation as a mechanism of localized protein
synthesis, and iii) RNA binding protein function in RNA localization and translational regulation, to address new
questions regarding cellular mechanisms of mRNA and ribosome localization to the ER. Building on the past
decade and a half of our research into RNA localization and translational regulation on the ER, including
founding evidence identifying an mRNA transcriptome-wide role for the ER in cellular proteome expression, the
proposed research will utilize mammalian tissue culture cell systems, gene editing and silencing approaches,
RNA-seq and Ribo-seq transcriptome analyses, HITS-CLiP and PAR-CLIP studies of ER RNA binding proteins
and their RNA interactomes, and biochemical analyses of the subcellular organization of the translation
machinery, to obtain new insights into the cellular organization and regulation of proteome expression. This
research is expected to advance understanding into the systems and pathways governing post-transcriptional
gene expression in the cell. In emphasizing in vivo analyses and native biosynthetic approaches to the study of
RNA and ribosome trafficking dynamics, this research is significant in its efforts to rigorously test existing
paradigms and advance understanding of cellular mechanisms of localized protein synthesis."
11099234,"Project Summary
This program is focused on the discovery, application, and mechanistic elucidation of catalytic reactions that are
stereoselective, environmentally friendly, and useful for the preparation of chiral, bioactive compounds. We seek
to develop novel concepts in catalytic reactivity and selectivity, and apply them to important problems in chemical
synthesis. The premise underlying our current and proposed work is that new classes of small-molecule, chiral
organic catalysts can promote challenging bond constructions, controlling the absolute and/or relative
stereochemistry of the reactions through networks of attractive non-covalent interactions. The overarching goal
is to identify simple organic catalysts that are readily accessible, inexpensive, and bear the minimal structural
features necessary for inducing high levels of stereocontrol in synthetically interesting transformations. We will
pursue several distinct catalytic concepts over the next five-year period, with each of the proposed reactivity
manifolds based on firm mechanistic hypotheses gleaned from extensive preliminary investigations. We will
apply precisely designed chiral ureas, thioureas, and squaramides to catalysis of enantioselective carbon-carbon
and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions. These dual hydrogen-bond donors can abstract or bind weakly
basic anions, such as halides, sulfonates, phosphate, and carboxylates, to promote concerted substitution
reactions or generate chiral ion pairs that remain tightly associated during subsequent enantioselectivity-
determining reactions of the prochiral cations. We discovered that the combination of hydrogen-bond donors
with achiral Lewis or BrØnsted acids generates highly reactive complexes that promote activation of weakly
electrophilic substrates to access highly reactive cationic species. This new principle will be directed to creative
applications involving atom-economical carbonyl addition reactions and additions to alkenes. The principle of
anion-binding catalysis will also be examined in pathways where the catalyst-bound anion acts as the nucleophile
in the enantiodetermining bond construction. Activation of polar reagents is applied in desymmetrizing ring-
opening reactions and generation of stereogenic-at-phosphorus compounds. We will also pursue a new strategy
aimed at applying anion binding by chiral H-bond donors to enhance the reactivity and control the stereochemical
outcome of transition-metal catalyzed reactions, and separately in the context of stereoselective and site-
selective glycosylation reactions. We have found that precisely tailored bisthiourea catalysts promote
stereospecific, invertive reactions of alcohol nucleophiles with glycosyl phosphates via cooperative activation of
both the nucleophile and the electrophile. This cooperative mechanism provides a new approach to achieving
control over the site of reaction in minimally protected sugars and other polyfunctional substrates. We also aim
to uncover completely new classes of chiral catalysts, such as a new class of alkali metal isothiourea-boronate
complexes we uncovered unexpectedly and that promote enantioselective, catalytic reactions with highly basic
reacting partners."

Ubiquitous and conserved molecular chaperones Hsp70s and Hsp110s form one of the most essential
chaperone machineries in maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However, the molecular mechanisms
and exact role of Hsp110s in this chaperone machinery remain largely unclear. As distant homologs of Hsp70s,
Hsp110s are both independent chaperones and co-chaperones for Hsp70s. As independent chaperones,
Hsp110s demonstrate a unique high chaperone activity in preventing aggregation of denatured proteins, the
“holdase” activity. As co-chaperones, Hsp110s function as the major nucleotide-exchange factors (NEFs) for
Hsp70s. Although the importance and mechanism of the NEF activity is well-characterized, the function and
involvement of the holdase activity is almost completely unknown primarily due to the lack of any available
approach to disrupt this holdase activity without affecting the NEF activity. Msi3 is the sole and essential Hsp110
in Candida albicans, the most prevalent cause of fungal infections in human. Our preliminary studies have
identified a novel inhibitor for Msi3, named 2H. Excitingly, 2H specifically abolishes the holdase activity while
leaving the NEF activity largely intact. Importantly, 2H was seen to reduce protein folding both in vitro and in
vivo, providing the first direct evidence to support the importance of the holdase activity of an Hsp110 in the
Hsp70/Hsp110 chaperone machinery. In addition, as the first inhibitor for fungal Hsp110s, 2H effectively
eliminates the growth of Candida albicans with limited toxicity in human cells, supporting that Hsp110s are an
important target for designing novel and potent therapeutics for fungal infections and 2H may represent a
promising lead compound for a new class of antifungals for future medicinal chemistry efforts.
 Taking advantage of the unique selectivity of 2H, the overall objective of this proposal is two-fold: 1)
to characterize the elusive molecular mechanism and biological function of the holdase activity of Hsp110s, and
2) to increase mechanistic understanding of Hsp110s as a new therapeutic target for fungal infections.
Accordingly, we propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1: Characterize the in vivo function of Hsp110’s holdase activity
in the proteostasis using 2H. Taking advantage of the powerful and facile genetics available to the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we aim to directly analyze the conserved functions of the Hsp110s’ holdase activity
in two essential in vivo processes in proteostasis: protein folding and import into endoplasmic reticulum. We
expect to identify and characterize endogenous substrates for Hsp110s for the first time. Aim 2: Elucidate the
inhibitory mechanism via structural characterization of 2H in complex with Msi3. We aim to solve the structures
of Msi3, both alone and complexed with 2H, which will reveal the specific binding interactions between 2H and
Msi3 and the mechanism of 2H’s inhibition of Msi3. We expect that our innovative proposal will make paradigm-
shifting discoveries on the function and mechanism of Hsp110s in the Hsp70/Hsp110 chaperone machinery and
pave a solid foundation for our future effort to develop novel and selective antifungals by targeting Hsp110s."

This is an application for the Administrative Supplement to the currently active R01 GM141546-
02 entitled “Role of retinoid oxidoreductase complex in controlling the embryonic development”.
 The major goal of the parent grant is to understand how retinoic acid (RA) is produced in a
quickly changing spatiotemporal pattern to control the expression of precise sets of genes at
different developmental stages. Critical RA-sensitive processes during development are RA-
concentration dependent, which underscores the importance of the precise control over RA
synthesis in a strictly defined and rapidly regulated manner. The central hypothesis of the project
is that retinoid oxidoreductase complex comprised of the two enzymes, RDH10 and DHRS3,
represents a previously unrecognized universally conserved mechanism that can both provide
the RA synthesis with robustness (Aim 1) and enable the dynamic changes in RA spatiotemporal
pattern by regulating the levels of RA precursor (Aim 2). The hypothesis will be tested using a
zebrafish embryogenesis model to take advantage of external fertilization and transparency of
zebrafish for intra-vital visualization of RA synthesis and formation of the complex. In ongoing
studies, we have established unique zebrafish knock-in lines expressing fluorescently-tagged
enzymes, which in combination with knockout lines and RA-reporter lines will be used to visualize
the expression of the complex components and changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of RA
synthesis. The imaging studies are essential component of both Aims.
 The Administrative Supplement will allow us to purchase BioTek Cytation C10 Confocal
Imaging Reader. Cytation C10 is an imaging system which combines a laser confocal
microscope, widefield fluorescence microscope and a multimode reader. The acquisition of this
imaging system will facilitate and streamline the workflow in the PI laboratory, because this
instrument can be operated in several imaging modes, widefield for imaging of whole zebrafish
embryos, widefield fluorescence for imaging of the fluorescently-tagged enzymes and their
colocalization, and laser confocal mode for imaging at the subcellular level. The advanced Gen5
software will enhance our analysis capabilities and facilitate preparation of publications thus
supporting success and continuation of the studies under the parent grant."

Chemoenzymatic construction of synthetic human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) glycome
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) constitute a major component of human milk which provides everything
that breast-fed infants need in the first several months of their lives. There is an increasing appreciation of the
multifaceted contribution of HMOs to the health of breast-fed infants. Exploring the applications of HMOs as
infant formula additives, nutraceuticals, and/or therapeutics has begun but has been slow due to the limited
access to structurally defined HMOs in sufficient amounts. The structures of more than 150 HMOs are known.
Despite efforts and advances in developing chemical, enzymatic, chemoenzymatic, and fermentation methods
for HMO synthesis, the access to a complete HMO glycome has not been achieved synthetically. HMOs can be
purified from human milk but the amount is limited. We plan to lower the technical barrier to access HMOs by
developing highly efficient user-friendly glycosyltransferase-based chemoenzymatic methods and construct a
comprehensive synthetic HMO glycome. Other than the enzymes, the chemoenzymatic synthetic strategies, and
the production processes that have been developed, additional innovation will be introduced for substrate and
process engineering. New enzymes will be identified, engineered, characterized, and used for the synthesis of
HMOs in a systematic target-oriented manner. Maps for chemoenzymatic synthetic routes will be developed. A
comprehensive library of HMOs including branched and long-chain linear structures with or without L-fucose
and/or sialic acid that have been identified from human milk and potential isomers that have not been identified
will be constructed. The synthetic HMO glycome will provide well characterized pure compound standards for
identifying and profiling of HMOs in the milk from different nursing mothers, at different lactation stages, and with
or without infections or other diseases. The chemoenzymatic synthetic process is programmable, can be adapted
for automation, and is readily scalable for large-scale production of HMOs in the future."

Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction across all
cell types and desired edits remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9,
rely on cellular DNA repair mechanisms, which are inefficient and do not function in post-mitotic cells. Thus,
genome editing still needs efficient, robust tools that can make a variety of specific DNA sequence alterations.
These tools could have broad applications across both basic biological discovery, allowing for new modalities of
screening, and therapeutics, including engineered cell therapies. The proposed work will address these needs
by combining computational discovery, biochemical characterization, and enzyme engineering to develop
integrase-based tools for programmable, multiplexed insertion of large genes in diverse cell types
independent of DNA repair. The discovery, characterization, and engineering of these new integrase proteins
will both build upon our deep history of CRISPR enzyme discovery, as well as draw from new, high-throughput
approaches to mine biological diversity. Complementary to the discovery of these new enzymes, we will combine
Cas9-based genome editing with integrase engineering to develop programmable, multiplexed genome
integration systems that do not depend on DNA repair mechanisms, allowing integration of large sequences in
any cell type. We will explore delivery mechanisms, including viruses, electroporation, and novel lipid
nanoparticle formulations to edit T cells and neurons. We will engineer aspects of the integrases, including
protein engineering and site mutagenesis, to boost activity of the system and screen many insertion sites to
develop design rules for the technology. Moreover, through studying orthogonal integrases sites we can develop
multiplexed versions of the insertion tool to edit up to three sites in a given cell with superior efficiency over other
tools. We will apply these multiplexed integrases to develop a new screening system, where tagging of multiple
genes can be used for determining protein interaction partners in high throughput. Our new integrase systems
will also be applied to the development of multiple-edited T-cells for improved immuno-oncology therapies. The
multiple technologies resulting from these discoveries and engineering efforts will overcome the limitations of
existing genome and epigenome engineering approaches and serve as a valuable resource for broader
biomedical research. Programmable gene integration with CRISPR-recruited integrases will allow for more
advanced genome engineering applications to be pursued in cells and in vivo, accelerating the pace of
biomedical research, enabling greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms, and
promoting novel therapeutic developments."
10989440,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) and related trypanosomatid parasites are responsible for vector-borne
diseases that cause great human suffering and economic burden in endemic countries. T. brucei is
transmitted between humans and other mammalian hosts by the tsetse fly, which is not merely a vessel for
moving parasites between hosts, but an integral part of the parasite's developmental life cycle necessary for
sustained transmission. In the absence of a vaccine to prevent infection in the mammalian host, targeting
parasite development within the insect vector is considered an option for reducing disease transmission,
though little is known of parasite interactions in the vector necessary for transmission. To survive, develop, and
be transmitted, T. brucei must sense and respond to changing environmental signals as it moves through
tissues within the insect vector. Little is known about parasite signaling pathways and vector-derived factors
that control parasite migration - this is a critical knowledge gap and potential target of new transmission-blocking
agents. Trypanosome cAMP signaling, originally shown to be critical for parasite chemotaxis in vitro,
has recently been connected to progression of parasites through the tsetse, in particular, migration from the
midgut (MG) to the proventriculus (PV). Initiation of cAMP signaling is controlled by an expanded protein family
of adenylate cyclases (ACs) that differ in their extracellular putative ligand-binding domains and exhibit tissue-specific
expression profiles during parasite migration through the tsetse. Trypanosome cAMP signaling is
therefore an attractive target for transmission-blocking agents, however, very little is known about regulation of
AC activity and downstream targets of cAMP signaling. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team
of investigators with collective expertise in trypanosome biology, cAMP signaling, transcriptomics, and genetic
manipulation of parasites, as well as tsetse biology, fly infections, and interactions between parasite, vector,
and microbiome. Our specific aims are to (1) identify endogenous, tsetse fly-derived modulators of T. brucei
chemotaxis; (2) define parasite cAMP effector genes responsible for parasite migration from the tsetse midgut
to proventriculus; and (3) define parasite receptors that perceive chemotactic signals in the fly. We will
leverage our established chemotaxis assay to test tsetse-derived factors for impacts on parasite chemotaxis
(Aim 1). To define genes required for MG ➔ PV migration in the tsetse, we will employ a MG ➔ PV defective
trypanosome mutant to identify MG-induced, cAMP-dependent transcriptome changes associated with
movement out of the MG (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement systems for genetic manipulation of fly-transmissible
T. brucei to allow functional assessment of trypanosome receptors and additional cAMP
signaling genes during tsetse infection (Aim 3). Completing these aims will increase understanding of parasite-vector
interactions, provide new avenues for targeting the pathogen within the arthropod vector, and identify
promising targets to consider for transmission-blocking vaccines or small molecule inhibition."

Bedaquiline is central to nearly all shorter, modernized all-oral regimens being evaluated and is revolutionizing
rifampin-resistant tuberculosis treatment. Yet, despite extensive research activity in this space, a poor
understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation (i.e., the association between specific mutations
(genotype) and the resulting spectrum of resistance) is the primary barrier to developing an accurate molecular
diagnostic for bedaquiline. We propose accelerating discovery in this area using an unbiased, comprehensive
mutational and screening strategy to determine the range and scope of all rv0678 mutations conferring
bedaquiline resistance. We will construct a library of M. tuberculosis clones carrying single-nucleotide
polymorphisms and specific indels, and we will screen this library in vitro and in a murine model. The success
of our proposed work will provide a template to accelerate the discovery of resistance-conferring variants for all
new and repurposed agents and help close the diagnostic gap, allowing for the development of tests to rapidly
inform treatment decisions, regardless of resource setting."

While syringe service programs remain a leading method of delivering harm reduction supplies in the United
States, they remain underutilized by the most vulnerable populations of people who use drugs (PWUD). To
reduce substance use related harms, we need to provide a suite of harm reduction service delivery
approaches that address the needs of a diverse and evolving population of PWUD. This proposed project will
examine an innovative approach to reducing infectious disease transmission and fatal overdose in an
understudied Western region. Used internationally for decades, harm reduction vending machines (HRVMs)
were implemented in Nevada in 2017 and contain supplies like syringe kits, naloxone, and fentanyl test strips.
It is unknown if HRVMs are an acceptable and feasible mode of service delivery and if they address the unmet
needs of underserved PWUD in the US. This study will explore how, why, and who uses (and doesn't use) this
novel method of service delivery. We propose a theory driven exploratory mixed-methods study to address the
following aims:
1. Determine who HRVMs are reaching by 1) estimating awareness, intention to use, and prevalence of
HRVM use, and 2) describing the associations with demographics, behavioral characteristics, social
and environmental factors, and perceived barriers and facilitators.
2. Identify what factors influence HRVM use through a Rapid Ethnographic Assessment consisting of field
site observations, ethnographic mapping, and qualitative interviews.
Findings from this proposed research will tell us who is using HRVMs, who is not using HRVMs, what
motivates and restricts their use, and areas for improvement to increase utilization. This information is vitally
important to policy makers, public health practitioners, funders, and community-based organizations where
resources are limited, and data-driven decisions produce better outcomes. This proposal addresses the NIDA
2022-2026 strategic plan goal to accelerate the science of harm reduction and will be directly and immediately
relevant to informing national drug control strategy."
10903681,"Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Among
the virulence factors produced by B. pertussis, the ABs toxin called pertussis toxin (PT) is
strongly linked to disease symptoms and severity. Like other AB5 toxins, the PT holotoxin has
five B subunits that recognize cell surface molecules and one A subunit that harbors an ADP-ribosylation
activity. The nonulosonic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeusAc) is commonly
described to be the receptor for PT but it is unknown how other glycan features affect PT
binding. Additionally, PT has been reported to bind to non-sialylated glycoconjugates. This
proposal aims to define the glycoconjugate features that mediate PT recognition and
intoxication of lymphocyte and respiratory epithelial cell surfaces, two cell types that are
proposed to be targets of PT action in vivo. In Aim 1, CRISPR/Casg genome-wide knockout (KO)
screening will be used to identify genes that impact PT binding to cell surfaces. Based on the
results of these screens, individual KO cell lines will be constructed and assayed for PT binding,
PT internalization, and PT intoxication. KO cell lines will also be evaluated for changes in
glycosylation, to reveal which glycan structures are associated with susceptibility to PT. In Aim
2, photocrosslinking sugar technology will be used to identify protein component of
glycoproteins that interact directly with PT. Based on the results of this analysis, KO cell lines
will be constructed and assayed for PT binding, PT internalization, and PT intoxication.
Together, the two aims will reveal the glycan and protein components of PT receptors. This
information will explain how PT targets specific cell types and may suggest strategies to
interfere with PT action therapeutically.

Ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) radiation delivery, termed FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT), has the potential to
reduce normal tissue damage, with significant clinical cancer treatment ramifications. Current evidence suggests
that FLASH-RT reduces functional damage to normal brain, colon, lung, and skin, at the same dose values.
Although controversial, some studies show this reduction in tissue damage as great as 40%, despite tissue type
alpha/beta ratio and total dose remain significant unknown factors. Most surprisingly tumor tissue appears
unaffected by FLASH radiation sparing, suggesting that the therapeutic ratio achieved through FLASH-RT is
higher than conventional RT. The potential to achieve higher therapeutic ratios make FLASH-RT very attractive
for future human use to address radioresistant tumors that would otherwise result in excessive radiotoxicity
during conventional treatment. Despite clinical translation of FLASH-RT to large animal and human studies being
urgently warranted, the majority of the preclinical work for FLASH-RT remains in small animals, where concerns
regarding dose and dose rate inhomogeneities cannot be adequately assessed. A major barrier towards
translational FLASH-RT is that optimization of treatment plans for large animals and humans with larger/deeper
tissues and complicated geometries remains challenging. In order to demonstrate the hypothesized superiority
of FLASH-RT, it is essential to conduct the studies FLASH-RT studies under controlled conditions and in clinically
realistic workflows. This begins with a treatment planning system {TPS) capable of generating and delivering
comparable plans for FLASH/CONV-RT within a minimally modified clinical setting. In the current proposal, we
are committed to developing such a TPS for the first time and making our software available to the scientific
community. We will achieve this by first generating beam models for FLASH-capable linacs. These beam models
will then be used to implement advanced planning and delivery technology utilizing passive intensity modulation.
Next, we will develop tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability models deployable on
the TPS. Lastly, our work will culminate in demonstrating successful deliveries of optimized plans with
comprehensive characterization of plan delivery using quality assurance systems uniquely available at
Dartmouth. Due to the urgency to transfer this paradigm-shifting therapy, high-risk of the first initiative, the
exploratory, and developmental nature of the proposal, the R21 grant mechanism is leveraged and justified. The
successful completion of the proposed work will advance the state-of-the-art in FLASH-RT by bridging the
extensive gap between the basic science of FLASH and the clinical needs of FLASH for translation to human
trials. The team has leading expertise in radiation physics, informatics, and radiation oncology, and are supported
by existing FLASH-capable linacs, TPS prototypes, unique UHDR dosimetry technologies invented at
Dartmouth, canine pilot trials, future human trials in planning and leading industrial partners. Taken together, the
team is ideally poised to conduct the proposed work of exploratory and developmental nature."

Day-to-day self-management by adults with type 2 diabetes is essential to avoid diabetes complications, yet
successful self-management behaviors remain difficult for many to achieve and sustain. Adults with diabetes
have rapidly evolving ways to track their behaviors, and the glucose levels their behaviors impact, but despite
having more information, people with diabetes still find it challenging to use their information to make healthy
behavior changes. The MPower Hub platform leverages evidence-based behavior change techniques,
including Self-Determination Theory-based personal data visualizations to increase autonomous motivation for
change, and Self-Regulation Theory-based goal setting and action planning, to empower adults with diabetes
with the information and support needed to achieve healthy diabetes self-management behaviors. MPower
Hub is a web-based platform that integrates rich real-time data from commercially-available continuous
glucose and activity monitors with patient-reported data about medication taking and other self-management
behaviors. MPower Hub prompts patients to choose behavioral goals based on their insights from interactive
visualizations of their information, then make action plans to reach their goals. This project is designed to
respond to the NI DDK PAS 23-086 call for ""Small R01"" pilot trials. The goal of this project is to optimize the
MPower Hub intervention protocol for adults with type 2 diabetes in preparation for a future multi-site efficacy
trial. First, the ability of the MPower Hub intervention protocol to support diabetes self-management will be
optimized via iterative enhancements, with 12 adults with diabetes who will use the platform for two months
each. Then, MPower Hub trial protocol feasibility will be assessed by randomizing 80 adults with type 2
diabetes and glycemic levels above clinical goals to MPower Hub, continuous glucose monitor alone, or activity
monitor alone for four months. Mixed quantitative and qualitative assessments will examine recruitment,
engagement, and retention metrics and feedback. Changes in self-management behaviors and glycemic levels
will be compared between arms. Successful completion of this project will produce a theoretically-grounded,
rigorously pilot-tested self-management intervention optimized for a fully-powered clinical efficacy trial. MPower
Hub is uniquely designed to produce new knowledge about how evidence-based behavior change techniques
can be integrated with data from increasingly available wearable monitors to empower healthy behavior
change. Results of this study will directly inform a future multi-site clinical efficacy trial, with the long-term goal
to produce inclusive and scalable tools to effectively improve diabetes self-management, increase the ability of
adults with diabetes to reach treatment goals, and reduce risks for diabetes complications."
11109576,"B. Abstract/Executive Summary: To create evidence and implement findings to support and guide the VA
in providing the best care in the right place at the right time. This is the vision for our Center of Innovation
(COIN), the Center of Innovation for Complex Chronic Healthcare (CINCCH). We define complex chronic
care to include Veterans with complex needs and life circumstances, and those who use multiple sources of
care (e.g., VA, Medicare, non-VA care). Our mission statement describes what we do each day: to conduct
research to improve coordination and contextualization of health care delivery, improve outcomes for
Veterans with high priority neurologic conditions, disseminate and implement evidence, and train future
researchers. We will advance care by using innovative methods including direct observation and engaging
Veterans and VA partners in research resulting in high quality, high value, Veteran-centric care.
CINCCH focus areas are aligned with two of VA Secretary David Shulkin's top five priorities; modernization
and efficiency. With respect to modernization, VA is committed to redefining the Veteran-centered model of
care and to reducing fragmentation and duplication of care. Our first research focus is to develop and
implement strategies to optimize contextualization and coordination of health care delivery for
Veterans. We address Veteran-centered care by emphasizing the need to tailor or contextualize care to
patient life circumstances, and reduce fragmentation and duplication through improved care coordination.
Our second area is to develop and implement best practices for Veterans with high priority
neurologic conditions. This aligns with the priority for efficiency including strengthening foundational
services in VA. VA provides world class care for 26% of persons with spinal cord injuries/disorders (SCI/D),
the largest integrated network for SCI/D in the U.S. CINCCH's research in SCI/D addresses respiratory
infections, pressure ulcers, bone health, weight management and increasing access with telehealth.
Frances Weaver, Ph.D., Research Career Scientist, has been the CINCCH Director for ten years and a
health services researcher for over 30 years. She has considerable experience in leadership, collaboration
partnership, and mentoring. Saul Weiner, M.D. is the Associate Director. He is an accomplished researcher
and clinician with strong partnerships with VA Operations.
CINCCH works with several Operations Partners including the SCI/D Program Office and the Veterans'
Integrated Service Network 12 (VISN12). Other Partners include the Office of Patient Centered Care &
Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT), Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R), the National Kidney
Disease and Dialysis Program Office, the National Center for Homelessness, the Office of Care
Coordination, and the Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (PBM). We are affiliated with three
academic institutions: Loyola University of Chicago (LUC), Northwestern University (NU), and the University
of Illinois at Chicago (UIC); CINCCH investigators have faculty appointments at these institutions.
Recent accomplishments include: an 80% increase in HSR&D-funded investigators (from five to nine) in the
last funding cycle; and two national awards: the Charles C. Shepard Award from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) for a paper on antibiotic overprescribing co-authored by Dr. Katie Suda, and
the PROSE award for excellence for Dr. Weiner's book on contextualizing care. Further, CINCCH has
created a Veteran Engagement Panel to provide input on proposals, data instruments, and dissemination."

Evolution is a core concept in understanding nearly all of the life sciences. Better public
understanding of evolution can also better contextualize and even prevent modern public health
crises such as the emergence of antifungal and antibiotic resistance, and evolution of new viral
pathogens, as just a few examples. Despite the importance of evolution, it can be difficult to teach
well in secondary education. Many treatments focus on historical evolution and fail to convey that
evolution is an active, ongoing process. These strategies also don't make it clear that the study of
evolution is itself an innovative, multidisciplinary field, which encompasses not just powerful
comparisons of historical fossils and inferences from modern day extant organisms and genomes, but
also experimental investigations, where hypotheses can be tested and evolution can be observed in
action in the lab and in the environment. We propose to develop yEvo, a teaching lab where students
in high school classes use experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing to study how
bakers yeast can become resistant to a low dose of an over-the-counter antifungal. The yEvo project
is a close collaboration with university researchers, involving students in an authentic research project
designed to generate publishable data. In the new project, we will build on a successful pilot
implementation to 1. professionalize our curriculum materials, 2. build tools that will allow high school
students to analyze and visualize their own sequencing data, and share it among classrooms, 3.
scale to more schools and scientists using a novel ""franchising"" model, and 4. build standalone kits
that capture the essence of the yEvo experience with lower resource and personnel requirements,
allowing us to reach even more schools. We will accompany these new projects with evaluations that

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) represent less than 1% of human cancers, but result in a greater loss of life per
patient compared to that of all cancers. There are more than 70 subtypes of STS, tumors are large (>5cm) at
diagnosis, and may involve critical structures (nerves, blood vessels), necessitating multi-modal treatment with
wide surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatments can be debilitating, with significant
negative impact on quality of life and functional outcome. Despite aggressive treatment, tumor recurrence occurs
in 40-50% of patients, and re-treatment with conventional strategies may be impossible. Non-invasive, non-
ionizing, non-thermal, image-guided tumor ablation strategies are direly needed. This proposal will focus on
histotripsy, a non-ionizing and non-thermal focused ultrasound ablation method that mechanically destroys
tissue and preserves critical structures through the precise control of acoustic cavitation with real-time imaging
feedback. Recently, our team completed proof-of-concept studies demonstrating that histotripsy can safely and
effectively partially ablate naturally-occurring STS in pet dogs. However, limitations in the current histotripsy
technology prevent rapid and precise treatment of entire tumors. Furthermore, lack of clinical outcomes of patient
safety and long-term tumor control hinders
clinical implementation of histotripsy as a treatment strategy for STS.
Clinically-useful advances require innovative device development and clinical evaluation in a relevant tumor
model. Our team proposes 1) the development of a novel ultra-high rate histotripsy system that overcomes
limitations in the current technology and, 2) evaluation of the application of this system as an entire-tumor, stand-
alone treatment of STS in pet dogs. STS affecting pet dogs have similar clinical presentation, tumor subtypes,
and clinical outcomes, resulting in data with high translatability to humans with STS. Our central hypothesis is
that ultra-high rate histotripsy systems and methods can be developed to safely, rapidly, and effectively achieve
entire-tumor ablation of STS as a viable alternative to surgical treatment. In Aim 1, our team will investigate and
validate ablation efficacy and the optimal histotripsy rate and dose needed for complete ablation. In Aim 2, we
will determine the maximum clinical histotripsy ablation volume and evaluate the clinical outcome measures of
entire-tumor ablation safety, safety of repeated histotripsy ablations, and long-term tumor response of entire-
tumor, stand-alone histotripsy treatment of STS in pet dogs. The results of this study will provide critical clinical
outcome data to directly inform human and veterinary clinical trials, accelerating the clinical translation of
histotripsy as a treatment strategy for STS, with high potential to extend to the treatment of other tumors."
11102726,"Abstract
Interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is one of the most debilitating chronic pelvic pain (CPP)
conditions that negatively impacts the quality of life and sexual activities in 2.7% to 6.5% of women in the US.
Pelvic floor hypertonicity (PFH) is prevalent among patients with CPP, and is present in up to 85% of women
with IC/BPS. PFH is a multifactorial problem that involves impaired relaxation of the pelvic musculature due
to the activation of nociceptors and release of inflammatory chemicals. Current clinical strategies employ
physical therapy interventions to relax the muscle to improve muscle coordination. Alternative therapies that
use oral or intra-vaginal muscle relaxants may be suggested when conservative methods fail. Specifically,
botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), has received growing interest in managing pelvic pain secondary to PFH. BoNT
inhibits the neuromuscular transmission at neuromuscular junctions, indicated by innervation zones (IZs), by
blocking the acetylcholine release, leading to transient muscle relaxation, and the relief of pain symptoms.
Despite its potency and safety, BoNT can cause dose-dependent adverse effects and is expensive. Studies
have demonstrated that increasing the injection distance by 1 cm from the IZs reduced the effect of BoNT by
46%. It is clinically important to localize in vivo the IZ distributions in the pelvic floor muscles to guide precision
BoNT injections for optimal treatment efficacy with reduced treatment cost.
Our team has successfully developed a novel high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) technique
to 1) reliably and quantitatively assess PFH and 2) accurately image the IZ distributions of hypertonic PFMs,
and has 3) successfully demonstrated the significant improvement in treatment outcome of BoNT injection
with HD-sEMG vs. without HD-sEMG guidance, in managing muscle spasticity. The goal of this proposal is
to develop a personalized, precision BoNT injection approach guided by intra-vaginal HD-sEMG to optimize
the treatment outcome in IC/BPS management. This research represents the first effort to quantitatively and
objectively study the feasibility of using intra-vaginal HD-sEMG for personalized, precision guided BoNT
injections to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. The proposed technique will serve as an in vivo
pelvic floor phenotyping tool that can be used to deliver personalized injection of BoNT to personalized
injection sites with personalized doses, which will lead to more effective BoNT treatment with reduced
treatment cost (by reducing injection dose). The study will also advance our understanding of the
pathophysiology of PFH, and mechanism of BoNT management, and help establishing an advanced standard
of objective assessment of PFH and BoNT injections."

10880519,"Project Summary
The hair cycle involves remarkable remodeling of growing hair follicles (HF) in repeated phases of progenitor
death and follicle regression, rest and new hair growth. It is therefore an excellent model for studying regression
and regeneration processes that are executed by epithelial stem cells (SC) and progenitors and regulated by the
niche microenvironment. Signals from the dermal papilla (DP) regulate progenitor proliferation and differentiation
in the bulb of growing HFs, and induce SCs in the hair germ during the rest-to-growth transition to regenerate
fully growing HFs. Recently, signals from the DP were implicated to induce also progenitor death during catagen
regression. During regression, the DP itself needs to relocate from the base of growing bulbs to the SC reservoir
in the upper HF. How this is accomplished has been unknown for decades. We previously identified the dermal
sheath (DS) as a functional smooth muscle that contracts to physically relocate the DP to reach its essential SC-
adjacent position. Here, we will test whether the DS is a potential signaling source that regulates progenitor
death, a process equally essential for propelling catagen regression. We have discovered that the DS
dynamically produces many signaling molecules including transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which was
previously implicated in progenitor death by TGFβ signals from the DP. With additional preliminary data we
found, however, that the DP is dispensable for pruning progenitor numbers and that the DS is the essential signal
source for regulating follicle regression. In our studies, we will rigorously test the hypothesis that the DS
constitutes a signaling niche that through TGFβ signaling controls regression in the hair cycle. We will selectively
and inducibly ablate the DS and DP during hair growth and unequivocally determine their requirement for catagen
initiation and progenitor death. We will explore expression of TGFβ pathway components in the DS and TGFβ
signaling in the progenitors, establish a key role of DS-derived TGFβ signaling in progenitor pruning by Tgfβ1
ablations and identify downstream transcriptional targets with combinatorial pSmad2 chromatin
immunoprecipitation and transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing analyses. Finally, we will determine the
molecular components of the TGFβ activation complex at the progenitor-DS interface by smFISH and IF, and
decipher how DS contraction-mediated forces activate TGFβ signaling in whole-follicle contraction assays.
Overall, this work will define key physiological functions of the follicle sheath for regulating progenitor fate, which
may be useful for developing HF regenerative approaches, including manipulating catagen pruning of
progenitors."

This proposal requests funds for an integrated mass spectrometry system consisting of SCIEX 7500 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer with QTRAP functionality (AB Sciex LLC, Framingham, MA USA) along with a
Nexera UPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), SCIEX gas generator, uninterruptible power supply, and workbenches.
The requested instrument will be located in and maintained by the Eicosanoid Core (EC) at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. This instrument will used to measure bioactive oxidized lipid mediators. Three major users and
four minor users from across three different divisions within the Department of Medicine, the Department of
Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, and the Vanderbilt University Department of Pharmacology will use mass
spectrometry to study the role of these important signaling molecules in cancer, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy,
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and more.
The ability to identify and differentiate between many structurally related oxidized lipid mediators at low
concentrations in biological samples is critical to understanding the role of these important signaling molecules
in human physiology and disease response. Due to the carboxylic acid functionality on all oxylipins, these
molecules ionize best in the negative ion mode, but negative ion electrospray MS has traditionally suffered from
low sensitivity. The source design of the SCIEX 7500 has been tailored to enhance ion detection, particularly for
negative ions. Oxidized lipid mediators show peak areas more than 50x higher using the SCIEX 7500 compared
to the previous generation instrument. Test samples sent to SCIEX from the EC detected 48 oxylipins, while only
29 oxylipins were detected using the LC/MS system that is currently leased by the EC. In addition to sensitivity
gains, the SCIEX 7500 is equipped with QTRAP functionality, which adds greater specificity. The QTRAP allows
the third quadrupole in this system to be configured as a Linear Ion Trap. While quantitative data is being
collected using the MRM mode, enhanced product ion scanning can be captured, obtaining structural information
of the detected analyte. This feature is particular useful for the detection and accurate assessment of oxylipins,
as many structurally distinct oxylipins and related metabolites have the same mass-to-charge ratios and similar
structures. The overall added sensitivity and specificity of the SCIEX 7500 will significantly enhance the
capabilities of the users to detect and quantify oxylipins in low-level biological samples.
This location of the EC is in close proximity to the laboratories of many of the users. Dr. Milne, Director of
the EC, is a world-renowned expert in the analysis of oxidized lipid mediators and has extensive training and
experience in mass spectrometry. Personnel in the ECL have combined more than 120 years of experience in
assisting more than 200 investigators worldwide with mass spectrometric analysis of lipid mediators. Institutional
matching funds will be used to support the maintenance and long-term operation of the instrument."
11101999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Facial disfigurement can have devastating effects on one’s quality of life. Approximately 0.26 million Americans
per annum have reconstructive procedures, such as the use of tissue flaps, to correct congenital and acquired
craniofacial defects. Management of large volumetric craniofacial muscle tissue defects remains a challenge.
Up to one quarter of patients have repeat procedures due to flap failure, tissue rejection and limited availability
of tissue; and there remains a subset of patients for whom treatment completely fails resulting in continued
facial disfigurement, financial burden and challenges with societal integration. The ability to generate
craniofacial muscle tissue containing the patient’s own cells would provide a more predictable, life-changing
treatment for a serious problem. Previous work has demonstrated the importance of craniofacial muscle-
derived cells and scaffolds for engineering the craniofacial skeletal muscles.
The project proposes to engineer craniofacial muscle tissue by seeding 3-D printed biomimetic scaffolds with
porcine craniofacial muscle-derived cells. The goals are to (1) generate new knowledge on the use of
craniofacial muscle-derived cell populations for the formation of muscle tissue; (2) produce 3-D biomimetic
scaffolds to support craniofacial muscle development; (3) bioengineer craniofacial muscle tissue for
implantation. The vision is that permanent restoration of craniofacial soft tissue defects can be achieved by
implantation of precision-engineered autologous craniofacial skeletal muscle tissue. The hypothesis is that
successful craniofacial muscle tissue engineering applications will incorporate autologous craniofacial skeletal
muscle-derived cells, 3-D printed biomimetic scaffolds, application of mechanical load and insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1), a growth factor important for muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. The approach is to
enrich porcine craniofacial muscle-derived cell populations with muscle stem cells (satellite cells) responsible
for regeneration. The cells will be seeded into 3-D printed biomimetic scaffolds and subjected to load and IGF-
1 to improve regeneration and promote muscle fiber hypertrophy leading to a tissue suitable for implantation
into the craniofacial region. Aim 1 is to produce 3-D printed biomimetic scaffolds and assess response of an
enriched porcine craniofacial muscle-derived cell population within the scaffolds. Aim 2 is to determine
response of engineered porcine craniofacial skeletal muscle tissue to mechanical stimulation and IGF-1
delivered within customized bioreactors. Aim 3 is to determine the regenerative capability of engineered
porcine craniofacial skeletal muscle tissue in vitro and in vivo. This project ultimately aims to produce a
functional craniofacial tissue for restoration of craniofacial soft tissue defects through the combination of three
innovative elements: (1) craniofacial muscle-derived cell populations; (2) 3-D printed biomimetic scaffolds; (3)
application of external factors (mechanical load and IGF-1). The outcomes of the proposed research will
broadly impact skeletal muscle engineering applications for the entire human body."

Programmed cell death (PCD) and has vital roles in organismal health and is essential to normal development.
Apoptosis is genetically programmed and mutations in regulatory genes contribute greatly to cancer therapy
resistance. Timely clearance of cellular debris following cell death is also critical as defects lead to inflammation
and are linked to autoimmune disease. Most cells in the body are highly differentiated and have intricate
morphologies. This presents challenges in the execution of cell death and clearance, as the subcellular
architecture and microenvironment of different compartments of the same cell may differ vastly. Complex cells
can die as a whole or in part. In the case of region-specific degeneration, cellular extensions are exclusively
dismantled leaving the rest of the cell intact. For neurons, such pruning is important in establishing appropriate
connectivity and thus for proper brain function. The central question addressed here is how morphologically
complex cells are eliminated. The C. elegans tail-spike cell is a valuable model to study complex cell
degeneration, dying through an elaborate, likely universal, compartment-specific program of cell death during
embryonic development. We have termed this remarkable program Compartmentalized Cell Elimination (CCE),
which also occurs in a set of sex-specific neurons, suggesting this may be a universal program of death. The
tail-spike cell also shows differential genetic regulation at the levels of both compartmental killing and clearance.
As such, a study of this single cell can provide insights on many facets of cell elimination. This proposal
leverages the fact that the tail-spike cell can be studied in its native context in the living animal as well as the
facile genetics of C. elegans to tackle three broadly related overarching questions: How does mitochondrial
trafficking influence cell process elimination? What novel genes govern CCE and hence cell death and removal
broadly? What novel genes regulate CCE in other complex cells, such as neurons? We will perform advanced
cell biological and genetic studies to address these questions. The proposed experiments, by illuminating
fundamental principles of basic cell biology, will advance the field of cell death in several ways. They will
identify novel regulators of PCD and clearance; they hold the potential to help devise targeted therapies against
cell-death-related disease, including cancer, neurodegeneration, immune and developmental disorders."

11109849,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defined as repeated failure to respond to treatment, is the most virulent
form of major depressive disorder (MDD), and claims a disproportionate fraction of morbidity and mortality. The
overwhelming costs of depression have motivated a decades-long search for meaningful biomarkers.
However, despite substantial effort, and the promise of functional brain imaging as a non-invasive tool for
whole-brain measurements, the identification of biomarkers of depression for ready clinical use has remained
elusive. The major impediments to progress include substantial phenotypic heterogeneity in typical MDD
cohorts and unreliable and imprecise imaging measures. During his graduate and residency years, the
principal investigator of this proposal developed novel methods for precise functional neuroimaging, known as
`precision functional mapping' (PFM), which have been previously applied to study brain organization in healthy
individuals. The present K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award proposal is designed to apply these new
methods to address these previous limitations and identify trait and state biomarkers of pathology in TRD. In
order to achieve these goals, a comprehensive career development agenda has been structured to train the PI
in the evaluation and management of this severely ill population. The PI will also learn how to implement
ecologically valid tools for precise behavioral and psychiatric assessments. These training aims will be pursued
with the guidance and mentorship of Drs. Charles Conway, Deanna Barch, Eric Lenze, Nico Dosenbach, and
Abraham Snyder, world experts in psychiatric assessment, dimensions of psychopathology, human subjects
study design, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), cognitive neuroscience, and functional neuroimaging
methods. During the training K phase, the PI will acquire a proof-of-principle dataset of extended and repeated
resting fMRI data on well-characterized TRD patients, treatment-responsive MDD patients, and healthy
controls, in order to optimize the quantitative reproducibility of single-subject functional network maps derived
from resting state functional connectivity (RSFC; Aim 1). In the R00 phase of the award, a large cohort (n=90)
of TRD, treatment-responsive MDD and healthy controls will be evaluated to identify brain imaging trait
biomarkers of treatment-resistant depression (Aim 2). To separate state from trait biomarkers, dense time
courses of imaging data, as well as EMA, will be acquired on TRD patients while they undergo
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment (Aim 3). Together, these studies are likely to reveal underlying
network features of disease and will determine whether RSFC can be reliably used as a biomarker for TRD.
The tools and approach laid out in this proposal will naturally extend to evaluations of other treatment
modalities and neuropsychiatric disorders. With the skills and expertise gained through this training and

This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the applicant’s long-term career plan to develop gene therapy
approaches for patients with neurological mitochondrial diseases, which currently have no approved treatment.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for inherited diseases
evident by numerous recent clinical trials. The applicant’s previous study developed an AAV-based gene
replacement therapy for SURF1-related Leigh syndrome, an early onset neurodegenerative disease, and
demonstrated its efficacy and safety in vivo. Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA-encoded ATPase 6 (MTATP6)
gene represents another group of common causes for neurological mitochondrial diseases. Unlike SURF1, a
nuclear DNA-encoded gene, gene replacement for MTATP6 poses more challenges. Firstly, no suitable vectors
deliver gene directly into mitochondria. A potential approach is the allotopic expression, in which a wildtype copy
of MTATP6 is expressed in the nucleus and the ATP6 protein is relocated to mitochondria using a mitochondrial
targeting sequence. Another hurdle is that there is no MTATP6 mouse model available, and the allotopic
expression of MTATP6 has only been tested in the cell cultures.
To address these issues, the applicant seeks to develop the first MTATP6 mouse model using a novel
mitochondria-targeting base editing technology, which creates a truncating mutation in the mouse MTATP6 gene.
She will then use this mouse model to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and safety of the allotopic expression of
MTATP6 via AAV delivery. In the K99 phase, the applicant will develop and optimize the base editor for mouse
MTATP6 gene, and generate a conditional truncated MTATP6 mouse model. She will also develop an AAV
vector to deliver the allotopic MTATP6 and test the vectors in patient-derived cell lines with both MTATP6
truncating mutations and m.8993T>G missense mutation, the most common disease variant in MTATP6. In the
R00 phase, the applicant will characterize the truncated MTATP6 mouse model, and evaluate the safety and
efficacy of the AAV gene therapy in vivo. This study will set a clear path for a translational study for MTATP6
patients with truncating mutations, and provide a foundation for the future development for other MTATP6
variants.
The applicant will acquire crucial knowledge and laboratory skills in mitochondrial biology, base editing, and
transgenic mouse modeling during her K99 phase to complement her previous training on AAV gene therapy
and neuropharmacology. Additionally, the applicant’s career development will be enhanced by the expertise of
an exceptional advisory/mentoring committee, as well as the unparalleled resources and ample educational and
training opportunities at UT Southwestern, a world class research institution. The outstanding mentoring,
unmatched resources, and strong commitment from her department will strengthen the applicant’s candidacy for,
and transition to, an independent tenure-track faculty position."

American children are exposed to violence at a shockingly high rate. Over one in eight have had
the maltreatment they experienced confirmed by the authorities, and at least one in four have
witnessed inter-parental violence. Although formal institutions such as social service providers,
child welfare, and law enforcement agencies are intended to protect families, these institutions
may be seen less as family protectors than as agents of surveillance, punishment, and family
separation—especially in vulnerable communities. The overall goal of this research is to
understand how contact with formal institutions shapes family violence experiences and
their consequences for children. It will also allow the principal investigator, Dr. Tasseli
McKay, the opportunity to build the measurement expertise, analytic skills, and methodological
tools needed to conduct impactful, long-term research on the implications of mass incarceration
for family violence. The project consists of five studies, combining primary qualitative
interviews and mobile surveys with youth and parents in contact with punitive
institutions (such as juvenile and criminal legal systems) and secondary analysis of
survey and administrative data. It will generate (1) Estimates of the bidirectional relationship
between institutional contact and childhood family violence exposure (Aim 1, K99 phase); (2)
New, validated measures of institutional contact that capture objective institutional contacts and
subjective experiences of institutional responsiveness (Aim 2, K99 phase); (3) A qualitative
assessment of how institutional contacts and institutional responsiveness inform family violence
disclosure decisions among affected family members (Aim 3, R00 phase); (4) Estimates of the

respective roles of institutional contact events and institutional responsiveness in shaping the
relationship between childhood exposure to family violence and involvement in violence during
the transition to adulthood (Aim 5, R00 phase). The project will produce advances in
conceptualization, measurement, and analytic methods that lay a foundation for new research
on institutional contact as a social determinant of child health and well-being and help
inform sound public policy and public health intervention for the most common and
impactful forms of violence: those within the family."
11103630,"Project Summary: Biological processes ranging from gene transcription to behavior oscillate and are
synchronized to the 24-hour day/night cycle. Mammalian circadian rhythms, orchestrated by the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) allow appropriately timed physiological and behavioral responses to daily
recurring external cues (i.e. sunrise or timed meal availability). The resulting synchrony of physiology to the
astronomical day maximizes metabolic efficiency and good health. However, many of the stresses of modern
society (i.e. artificial lighting and omnipresence of food) weaken and desynchronize circadian rhythms. This in
turn increases the prevalence of many pathologies including metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative
diseases. The aim of my laboratory is to determine how circadian rhythms are synchronized to external cues
(circadian entrainment) and how desynchronization impacts health. Although the neuronal pathways of light-
driven entrainment are well-established, how other external cues, such as food availability, social interactions or
exercise, influence the workings of the SCN remains unknown. In a recent breakthrough, we identified a neuronal
connection between midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are activated in response to salient events and SCN
neurons that express the dopamine receptor Drd1. We showed that this pathway accelerates photoentrainment
and drives palatable food consumption outside of mealtimes. In parallel, we identified a novel molecular player
that is necessary for anticipation-related activity to time-restricted food access. Here, we propose to leverage
our expertise in disentangling circadian entrainment neurocircuitry to delineate the mechanisms by which
rewarding cues modulate the SCN circadian clock. Furthermore, we will determine whether strengthening
circadian rhythmicity ameliorates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Our first objective is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how salient events impact SCN activity and circadian entrainment. We hypothesize
that activation of dopaminergic signaling decreases the amplitude of SCN oscillation and allows faster
photoentrainment. This novel insight will be useful to develop strategies to curb the negative impact of circadian
desynchrony. Our second goal is to identify the midbrain dopaminergic cell population that targets the SCN and
promotes palatable food consumption outside of meal times, leading to weight gain and metabolic disorder. We
predict that by mimicking dopaminergic signaling in the SCN, we will control food consumption. Delineating this
pathway will provide therapeutic targets against diet induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity. Our final
objective is to determine if high amplitude circadian rhythms, by daily consolidation of light and food access, is
sufficient to slow the progression of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). If successful, entrainment
strategies will become potential treatments for AD patients and people with high-risk of developing AD. We
expect our work will provide a better understanding of the relationship between entrainment cues, physiology
and behavior while providing tangible strategies against the adverse consequences of circadian misalignment."
11103650,"Abstract
Pneumonia is the leading cause of infection-related deaths worldwide, a fact that is set to rise exponentially
with the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Recovery from pneumonia requires both clearance of the pathogen and
resolution of infection, the latter of which is critical to resume normal lung function. While both processes are
important to host health, there is vastly less known about the mechanisms that regulate resistance to and
resolution of tissue injury during pneumonia, representing a large knowledge gap in our understanding of the
biology of the lung and its repair processes. Here, we propose that lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein
receptor-1 (LOX-1) modulates acute pulmonary inflammation in way that promotes resolution through
reprogramming of leukocyte response. LOX-1 is a class E scavenger receptor, primarily known for its role in
promoting vascular inflammation during atherosclerosis. In direct contrast, our data suggests that LOX-1 has a
unique function in the lung, where it prevents edematous lung injury and inflammation, independent of bacterial
clearance in murine models of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Moreover, LOX-1
and its major ligand oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) are elevated in patients with ARDS as a result of
a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia. Analysis of the cellular expression of LOX-1 in the lung revealed that
alveolar macrophages and recruited (airspace) neutrophils are uniquely enriched for LOX-1 expression.
Hematopoietic cells are also likely sources of LOX-1-dependent protection, as LOX-1-/- (WT recipient) chimeras
are significantly more protected from injury than WT (LOX-1-/- recipient) chimeras during pneumonia.
Assessment of the specific effects of LOX-1 inhibition on alveolar macrophages demonstrated that with
inhibition macrophages are skewed towards inflammation and exhibit metabolic changes associated with
increased glycolysis and lower fatty acid oxidation consistent with inflammatory macrophages. Moreover, we
discovered that recruited neutrophils differ in their expression of LOX-1, where about half of neutrophils are
positive during infection. Curiously, we also found phenotypic differences associated with LOX-1+ neutrophils
that suggest increased cholesterol metabolism, which may uniquely promote tissue resolution. Taken together,
leukocytes are an important source of LOX-1 and are likely responsible for LOX-1-dependent protection during
pneumonia. However, whether and how LOX-1 elicits its protective effects on leukocytes is not known. Thus,
we propose a central hypothesis that LOX-1 signaling evokes tissue-protective mechanisms in leukocytes
(K99), that are associated with metabolic changes consistent with reduced inflammation and increased tissue
recovery (R00). Results from our investigations will be the first to elucidate how LOX-1 is regulated at the
transcriptional and metabolic level in the unique microenvironment of the lung, where it likely facilitates
recovery from pneumonia and lung homeostasis."

During the K99 phase we will examine whether T2DM is associated with a pathological switch in the mechanism
of microvascular vasodilation to shear stress in isolated arterioles, and examine whether autophagic flux

Hughes will train under the mentorship of a transdisciplinary group of senior scientists with research expertise in
mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction, and examination of cutaneous microvascular function within the
context of T2DM. The current postdoctoral mentors, Drs. David Gutterman and Andreas Beyer, both of whom
have extensive experience mentoring trainees will continue to serve as mentors. They will be complemented by
mentoring expertise from Naomi Hamburg and Lacy Alexander. The primary goal is to become an expert in the
field of human microvascular physiology within the context of T2DM. This will be achieved through 1) expansion
of technical skills including molecular techniques, along with laser Doppler flowmetry coupled with microdialysis;
and 2) empirical training in lab and clinical trial management, along with team science and mentoring skills.
Achieving these goals will strengthen further scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire
critical data that will ensure a successful transition to independence. The training plan will be strengthened
through a sabbatical in the laboratory of Dr. Lacy Alexander, where Dr. Hughes will be trained in investigation of
microvascular function in the human cutaneous microvasculature. Obtaining an independent educational
experience in one of the world’s most successful laboratories that utilize this technique will strengthen the ability
to conduct translational studies. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will
fill critical gaps in knowledge and skill set relating to the mechanisms contributing to microvascular dysfunction
in T2DM. For the transition to independence phase, the mechanistic contribution of Transcription Factor EB
(TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, will be investigated utilizing the skills and techniques learned
and mastered during the K99 phase. The components of this application are consistent with the career goals of
becoming an independent investigator whose research intersects basic and clinical science."

To meet the needs of those with kidney, urology and hematology related medical
symptoms or conditions, the Cleveland Kidney, Urology and Hematology Research
Training Network has designed a one and a half daylong meeting to educate the next
generation of KUH professionals. This meeting will enable trainees and their senior
colleagues to both learn together and to network. In order for all trainees to have the
opportunity to join this meeting, the Cleveland Kidney, Urology and Hematology
Research Training Network is requesting a supplement to support the travel costs for
these trainees. At the meeting, trainees will benefit from current training which will enable
them to address outcomes important to people with kidney, benign urinary and benign
blood conditions and cure these diseases.
The agenda includes a plenary panel and discussion to include topics such as novel
imaging modalities for early detection of kidney disease, advances and challenges for
hemophilia gene therapy and computational pathology and its impact in urological
diseases. Resources such as the O’Brien Cooperative Research Centers, CAIRIBU
and Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology will be shared. As the meeting is
centered around trainees, required trainee poster sessions and trainee oral
presentations will be held.
In addition, several classes will be available regarding How Scientists Can Develop an
Entrepreneurial Identity, A Guide to Multi-Investigator Grants: What They are &
Development Considerations, How to Negotiate Your First Academic Position, How to
Publish High-Impact Science and The Path from Bench to Bedside: Considerations for
First-in-Human Studies.
The goal of this meeting is to educate leaders for the nation’s KUHR workforce, to
accelerate clinical research education, and to educate all members of the research
team. These trainees will be joining in discussions regarding kidney, urology and
hematology while networking, presenting their research, creating collaborations,
connecting with mentor’s and making new friends. Ultimately, this meeting will impact
the face of KUHR going forward and the more trainees in attendance, the greater
chance of meeting this goal."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-041.” There is an urgent need to provide high-quality survivorship care to the rapidly growing population of
adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Approximately 90,000 AYAs are diagnosed with cancer
each year. AYAs, defined as those diagnosed between 15-39 years of age, are at unique developmental life
stages regarding their emotional, cognitive, and social development. A cancer diagnosis is highly disruptive to
completing education, establishing families, and/or starting employment. AYA cancer survivors have enduring
complex health care needs requiring coordinated care, including surveillance for cancer recurrence,
management of long-term and late effects, and appropriate preventive care. However, serious gaps in care
have been identified for AYA survivors, including underuse of National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guideline-recommended cancer surveillance (e.g., mammography, colonoscopy) as well as underuse
of primary care services such as vaccinations and general disease screenings. AYA survivors also experience
significant disparities in care and outcomes associated with race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The new
National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care provide a robust framework for developing and assessing
survivorship care programs across and within U.S. healthcare systems. These standards have the potential to
improve cancer survivorship care, particularly for AYA survivors given the known gaps and inequities in receipt
of NCCN recommended services for cancer surveillance and preventive care. Thus, we propose to examine
the recommended Health System Processes and Evaluations/Assessments as described in the National
Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care in a large integrated healthcare system, Kaiser Permanente (KP). The
proposed work will be a supplement to our current program grant (P01CA233432) funded through the National
Cancer Institute, “Clinical Care Gaps and Unmet Needs in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancers.” The P01
provides a robust structure for the leadership, administrative, programming, and analytic needs to evaluate the
National Standards via this Administrative Supplement. We will leverage our existing large contemporary
cohort of AYA cancer survivors cared for within KP to: 1) Examine the availability of the new National
Standards within KP; 2) Assess referral to and utilization of recommended National Standards within our KP
AYA cancer survivor cohort. We will analyze receipt of referral and utilization stratified by patient demographic
and cancer characteristics. The proposed study will be one of the first to assess availability, referral to and use
of the National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care in a large integrated healthcare system, with a focus
on an existing diverse cohort of AYA cancer survivors. Primary findings will support future studies including
examination of the National Standards in other settings, assessment of health system survivorship policies and
related impacts, and development of targeted healthcare system interventions to address gaps in care."

FOA Title: Clinical Studies of Orphan Products Addressing Unmet Needs of Rare Diseases (R01) Clinical Trials
Required
Proposal Title: SELVA: A Multicenter, Phase 3 Baseline-Controlled Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of PTX-
022 in the Treatment of Microcystic Lymphatic Malformations
Institute: FDA Office of Orphan Products Development
Study Section: N/A
Summary
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PTX-022 (sirolimus) Topical Gel 3.9% w/w for
patients suffering from microcystic lymphatic malformations (microcystic LM). Microcystic LM is a serious, rare, and
chronic disease of the lymphatic system characterized by lymphorrhea, acute cellulitis and significant patient morbidity.
Microcystic LM is an orphan disease with no FDA approved therapies and there is an urgent need to develop the first
FDA approved therapy to treat this debilitating disease.
Microcystic LM is usually present at birth or shortly after, with the pathology often originating in the dermis and
protruding out through the epidermis and stratum corneum. Recent studies have identified that patients with microcystic
LM have postzygotic mutations in PI3K leading to abnormal and increased activation in mTOR signaling as well as its
downstream target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Oral sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor which is also known as
rapamycin, has demonstrated preliminary benefit in patients with microcystic LM but its use is limited by the adverse
event profile, requirement for frequent blood monitoring, and limited distribution to the skin. Therefore, Palvella
Therapeutics, Inc. (Palvella) is developing PTX-022, a 3.9% topical sirolimus gel designed to deliver high levels of
sirolimus directly to the site of disease, the epidermis and dermis, while avoiding the systemic side effects of oral
sirolimus. PTX-022 recently completed a Phase 2, 12 patient, open-label clinical study (NCT05050149). Efficacy data
from the Phase 2 study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements with patients treated
with PTX-022. All twelve patients who entered the study were either “much improved” (n=7, 58%) or “very much
improved” (n=5, 42%) on the clinician global impression of change (CGI-C) and all twelve patients improved on the
patient global impression of change (PGI-C).
Based on the Phase 2 data, FDA awarded PTX-022 Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of microcystic
LM. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of therapies for serious or
life-threatening conditions and whose preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial
improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Following a collaborative Type B
Meeting with FDA in April 2024, Palvella is advancing the development of PTX-022 into a registrational Phase 3 study in
patients with microcystic LM. Primary efficacy will be assessed using a fit for purpose microcystic LM Investigator
Global Assessment (mLM-IGA) scale. The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of once-daily treatment
with PTX-022 utilizing scores from the clinician microcystic LM multicomponent severity scale, the overall patient global
impression of change (PGI-C) scores, and the overall clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) scale. Importantly,
exit and entry qualitative interviews will be conducted for each patient to determine burden of disease and clinical
meaningfulness of any changes observed.
In addition to Breakthrough Designation, PTX-022 has been granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug
Designation by the FDA for microcystic LM. Grant funding, if awarded, will be used to directly support the initiation,
enrollment, and completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial and support NDA submission and FDA approval. This proposal
aims to fulfill the goal of the FDA’s Office of Orphan Product Development grant program to support the clinical
development of products for use in rare diseases where no therapy currently exists."
