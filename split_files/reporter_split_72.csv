The continuation of a series of hybrid virtual/in-person workshops focused on progress in understanding the
causes and mechanisms of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD),
and other prominent age-related diseases to be held in 2025 and 2026 at Duke University, Durham, North
Carolina are proposed. The aim of these high-intensity workshops is to disseminate new knowledge on how
existing and recently developed analytic methods can be used in concert for detailed, reliable, and reproducible
analysis. The long-term goal of the series is to be a resource providing: the diffusion of practical methodological
know-how; applied showcasing of novel methodologies being introduced in the field; promotion of rigor and
widening the range of application of well-established methods; promotion of the correct use of big health data—
alone and in conjunction with clinical, survey, and other data resources—from a methodological, and ethical
prospective; a forum for experts and newcomers interested in health disparities and age-related diseases to
discuss their ideas, showcase their research, and receive input from experienced peers. In the planning of the
2025-2026 workshops, we will build upon the accomplishments of this series including those funded by the
parent grant of this proposal (R13AG069381). As has become customary for this series the exact schedules of
the 2025/2026 workshops will be finalized after receiving input from 2024/2025 participants. We have had great
success in using this model as evidenced by active participation of representatives of AD research centers,
minority institutions, and other methodological focus groups as well as the increasing attendance of our
workshops. The proposed 2025/2026 theme is: “Theory and Practice for Explanation of AD/ADRD Health
Disparities in Terms of Predictors”. Each workshop will contain two substantive sessions and a perspective,
methodologic, and poster session spanning the following topics in AD/ADRD and health disparities: i) methods
of artificial intelligence, ii) causal methods in the effects of risk factors, iii) advantages of mixed research, iv)
interdisciplinary research and modern infrastructural designs, v) extensions of modern methods for analyses of
multimorbidity, vi) comparison of the effects of risk factors across datasets and subpopulations, vii) emerging
topics and new challenges, and viii) genetics and the analyses of health disparities. We plan to improve the
accessibility level of the methodologic presentations by combining methodological innovations with practical
hands-on demonstrations while addressing topics of the highest interest to the audience based on feedback
gathered using pool and post-event surveys administered over the course of past Workshops. The brief, high-
intensity format brings researchers together in a single inclusive environment, pooling the available expertise
rather than diffusing focus across multiple specialized sub-sections. Coupled with our focus on rigorous
application of data/method combinations, and low barriers to participation, the culture of open academic
discussion of the Workshops provides an environment highly beneficial for new and early career investigators."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 26 million new cases of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) in 2018, and nearly half were among youth ages 15-24. Additionally, while adolescent
pregnancies have declined over the past decade, rates remain higher in the U.S. than in other developed nations.
Compared to non-Hispanic White youth, Black and Latino youth (BLY) have higher rates of common STIs, of
HIV, and of unintended pregnancies. Among 13-24-year-olds diagnosed with HIV in 2021, 53% and 27% were
Black and Latino, compared to White (14%). Among 15-19-year-old Black and Latino youth in 2021, rates of
chlamydia were 5.5 and 1.2 times higher (3,929 and 846 per 100,000) than White youth (708), and rates of
gonorrhea were 11.9 and 1.4 times higher (1,610 and 188 per 100,000) than White youth (135). In 2018, births
rates among Black and Latina females (ages 15-19) were 26.3 and 26.7 per 1,000, compared to 12.1 among
White females. While prevention methods (e.g., condoms, non-barrier contraceptives, HIV PrEP, and STI/HIV
testing) are highly effective, BLY report addressable barriers (e.g., low awareness and risk perceptions, low self-
efficacy for condom negotiation, and confidentiality concerns). We propose developing a culturally-tailored, age-
appropriate, and engaging intervention that combines entertainment-education (EE) and mobile health (mHealth)
to increase STI/HIV testing and use of effective STI and unintended pregnancy prevention methods. This
intervention will include a 30-minute entertainment-education (EE) video with characters that model the healthy
behaviors as well as mHealth components that include additional skills-building videos; comprehensive
information about testing and prevention strategies; tools to help individuals and couples choose the right
prevention methods for them; and local resources to access sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The
entire program, including the video and technology elements, will be available in English and Spanish.
In Phase I, we will use human-centered design to develop EE and mHealth prototypes in English and Spanish
with high feasibility, acceptability, usability, and likely uptake among BLY and SRH service providers and staff at
organizations that would implement the intervention. Research activities will include: 1) conducting focus groups
(12 groups) with BLY and 12 interviews with SRH providers to develop initial EE storylines and mHealth
prototypes; 2) conducting multiple iterative rounds of rapid prototyping with BLY and SRH providers to develop
pre-final EE and mHealth prototypes; 3) testing pre-final prototypes in online surveys with BLY (n=200) and SRH
providers (n=25); and 4) making final refinements to the EE script using live table reads. In Phase II, we will fully
develop the intervention and conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate it. We will commercialize the
intervention by partnering with organizations, schools, universities, community clinics, and health departments
nationwide."

Youth living with HIV (YLH) have high rates of viral non-suppression and non-retention, particularly during the
period when they transition from adolescent to adult autonomous care. In partnership with the Kenya Ministry of
Health (MoH), we used a community engagement approach to develop the Adolescent Transition Package
(ATP), a healthcare worker (HCW) toolkit that includes structured educational materials and tracking tools to
facilitate the transition process. We recently tested the ATP in a cluster randomized clinical trial (cRCT) of >1000
YLH in 20 clinics and found the ATP effective at improving transition readiness. The ATP was acceptable and
feasible. The Kenya MoH is committed to supporting transition among YLH and scaling up the ATP. We propose
testing strategies to SCALE-UP the ATP in Kenya using a data driven youth led implementation strategy.
Aim 1: Using a hybrid III implementation-effectiveness design, compare two implementation strategies for scale-
up of ATP: Kenya MoH SoC implementation strategy (cascading training of trainers) to an enhanced scale-up
implementation strategy (ATP-YES) (SoC plus youth-led data- driven intervention adaptations). Approach:
Thirty-two HIV clinics (8 per county) will be randomized 1:1 to SoC or ATP-YES. In intervention sites, youth
leaders will lead routine ATP implementation assessments and targeted adaptations to optimize reach,
effectiveness, adoption, and implementation (fidelity) through data audits, cyclical small tests of change and
cross-facility learning. Aim 1a: Compare 3-year ATP reach, adoption and effectiveness between intervention
and control sites. Reach: proportion of YLH age 15-24 years exposed to the ATP intervention. Adoption:
proportion of HCWs using the ATP. Effectiveness: successful transfer to adult care, post-transition retention and
viral suppression and transition readiness scores. Aim 1b: Using the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR) framework, identify determinants of ATP adoption, implementation (fidelity to
the ATP) and maintenance of the ATP. Aim 1c: Summarize intervention adaptations using the Framework for
Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-based Implementation Strategies (FRAME-IS).
Aim 2: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the ATP-YES implementation strategy.
Approach: We will conduct micro costing, HCW interviews and time and motion observations to estimate the
incremental costs of implementing the ATP-YES strategy in routine HIV care. We will combine cost with
effectiveness data from Aim 1a into a Markov model to project the health impact (HIV deaths and morbidity
averted) and financial costs of the intervention compared to standard of care and estimate the cost-effectiveness
and budget impact of ATP-YES implementation.
This implementation science study focuses on sustainable implementation of an evidence-based intervention
through youth-led data-driven intervention adaptations. The project aligns with existing MoH infrastructure and
has potential to impact many YLH in Kenya and in similar settings."

 Adrenomedullin (ADM) and CGRP family peptides play pivotal roles in regulating angiogenesis,
vasculogenesis, and tissue regeneration. Although wild-type ADM and CGRP improve wound healing in a
variety of injury models, they are poor drug candidates for the chronic treatment of different disorders. Our
recent study of super-agonistic ADM analogs, which self-assemble to form liquid nanogels in situ, suggested
these analogs are ideal candidates for mitigating tissue damage and accelerating wound healing in patients
with bed sores or nonhealing pressure ulcers. Notably, the self-assembled analog gel has a 100% loading
capacity and allows localized treatment via its multi-faceted regenerative actions. Ideally, the proposed analog
gel therapy would be administered weekly or biweekly subcutaneously in the wound area to improve local
blood circulation and accelerate wound healing. The Specific Aims of this Phase I study include identifying an
ideal analog gel formulation and dose range that promotes vascular bed circulation but avoids an effect on
systemic hemodynamics in aging diabetic mice (Aim 1). Once the ideal analog gel is identified, we will evaluate
whether the analog gel treatment correlates with enhanced healing functions in aging mice with hindlimb
ischemia injury or pressure-induced skin ulcers. We will also compare the analog gel with PDGF, the only
FDA-approved growth factor for wound care, thereby completing the lead optimization process."

Macaca nemestrina serves as a critical animal model for the study and treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related
diseases. The MHC Genetic Typing Core ensures that MHC Class I alleles, lineages, and haplotypes are
determined for all animals in the SPF breeding colony, using RNA expressed allele analysis. This information is
provided to investigators to aid in animal selection and data analysis. In addition, parentage is confirmed for all
animals using a 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panel developed specifically for M. nemestrina during
the previous cycle of this cooperative agreement and fully implemented during the current cycle. We are initiating
a project to generate whole genome sequences from representative colony animals to provide a foundation for
identification of variations associated with specific phenotypes, both within the M. nemestrina population as well
as among different macaque species."

Long-term effects of universal health insurance in developing countries:
Evidence from Mexico
Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines of text)
The implementation of government programs to increase access to health insurance has rapidly increased in
developing countries in the last three decades. However, evidence on their long-term effects in a developing
country is limited and provides mixed conclusions. Understanding the persistent impact of universal health
insurance is particularly relevant as the hypothetical health improvements and reduced financial burden they
may offer have the potential to shrink intergenerational transmission of poverty and improve social mobility of
beneficiaries and their children. The efficacy of these programs remains unclear predominantly because of a
lack of random variation in their implementation and the fact that in randomized controlled trials, control
groups typically receive the benefits, at most, only a few years after the initial implementation. Long-term
evaluation of these programs is further complicated by the substantial challenges of consistently tracking
and following up baseline respondents, which can lead to bias-inducing, non-random attrition. This project
contributes to filling the gap in what is understood about the broad consequences of increased access to
health insurance in developing countries. Specifically, we provide new evidence from a population-
representative sample on the long-term effects of Seguro Popular, a universal public health insurance
program introduced in Mexico in 2002. Pairing the richness and innovative design of the Mexican Family Life
Survey (MxFLS), a nationally representative, longitudinal survey with cutting-edge and rigorous non-
experimental methods, represents a unique opportunity to make a substantial contribution to understanding
the persistent impact of programs that increase access to health insurance in developing countries. The
MxFLS collects comprehensive respondent data across time whereby every respondent surveyed in Mexico
at baseline in 2002, and any of their children born after 2002, are target respondents for follow-up survey
waves, including those who are domestic or international migrants. By integrating the MxFLS's ability to track
economic and health outcomes of respondents over multiple years with the temporal and spatial variation
created by Seguro Popular's rollout, as well as, the biological variation generated by the age individuals are
first exposed to the program, this project will: 1) identify the causal effects of Seguro Popular on child height,
which has been causally associated with indicators of well-being in later life, e.g., educational attainment,
earnings, adult health, and mortality; 2) explore the dynamic impact across time of this health insurance
policy to provide new insights into how supply and demand side constraints at the time of program
implementation can alter its effectiveness; and 3) provide evidence on the impact of Seguro Popular on
household expenditure, labor market, investment, risk, and migration behavior. In so doing, the project will
have provided scientific evidence on the extent to which the provision of health insurance in a developing
country setting improves the lifelong health and wellbeing of its population."
10987452,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and develop effective
new agents and treatment strategies for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and efficient
clinical and laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology,
pharmacology, imaging studies and patient reported outcomes to further the understanding of the disposition
and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will
enroll approximately 130 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel therapies at the 21
core-member sites and 21 non-core member sites throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. The network
institutions are selected through a peer review process and serve as a national and international model for new
agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP-CTN leverages the database infrastructure and resources
of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure
to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical
trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and
pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response
and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses.
The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer therapeutics
into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary
efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific
trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic and biologic analyses, including single
gene studies or gene panels, and target antigens to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of
targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic
analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic
endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into
early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors.
Development of innovative therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority that offers the prospect of more
efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

10986690,"Abstract: Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick campus requests funds to purchase and
outfit fourteen Individually ventilated racks (IVC) in the facility with Digital Ventilated Cage (DVC) retrofit kits and
Rack Environmental Monitoring (REM) system supplied by Tecniplast. The animal facility currently serves the
needs of federally funded multidisciplinary faculty associated with the various schools within the university. The
project will enable the conversion of the existing mouse caging system to an advanced caging system that uses
machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor the animals 24 x7. This advanced caging system
will provide us with multiple cage and room monitoring capabilities, all of which are not currently available in the
facility. The integrated DVC system includes sophisticated sensors along with a software analytics interface that
is easy to use for the animal care takers in the room as well as management personnel for decision making. The
individual sensor boards for each cage will detect the microenvironment within the cage (activity of animals,
presence of food, water, bedding condition) while the rack level REM device will monitor the macroenvironment
(temperature, humidity, lighting, noise, vibration, and human presence). Information captured from these
systems will help 1) streamline operations through the ability to identify each cage and track census at all times,
2) improve animal welfare through detection of sick animals early leading to timely veterinary intervention, 3)
identification of wet bedding or floods in a cage, 4) identify low food or lack of water bottle in cage, 5) timing of
humane end-points to assist with both welfare and tissue/sample collection, 6) identify variables that can affect
research reproducibility and help management correct the variable in a timely manner and 7) improve operational
efficiency. Digital capture of information and the ability to view the information remotely will help streamline
workflows and enable staff to spend less time on administrative tasks and devote more time to animal care."

The overarching goal of this University of Hawaii Pacific CGDS Program is to support educational activities that
encourage and promote diverse and underrepresented students to pursue studies and careers in computational
genomics and data science (CGDS) research in various fields of biomedical and behavioral sciences, hence
broadening the desperately needed educational opportunities in Hawaii and wider Pacific regions. To do that,
we will develop undergraduate and Master’s degree-level educational curricula and content in CGDS. With
longstanding experiences of training a body of underrepresented students from diverse backgrounds, our faculty
will develop and evaluate curriculum and method contents for essential and advanced CGDS research training.
We will leverage the resources of NIH cloud computing platforms to develop, implement, and evaluate classroom
educational content and cloud-based hands-on analytical exercises in CGDS. And we will make use of
educational support resources developed by the CGDS Educational Hub and partner Sites. We will facilitate
hands-on exposure to CGDS at the undergraduate and master’s degree levels among students enrolled at
University of Hawaii System and wider Pacific institutions with a mission to educate students from any
populations identified as underrepresented in biomedical research. In the Pacific CGDS Program, we will: 1)
Develop and test undergraduate and master’s levels CGDS curricula that make use of NHGRI’s AnVIL platform
and other NIH datasets and cloud-computing resources. Example contents cover the wide ranges of genomics,
transcriptomics, epigenomics, and medical and health data analyses. 2) Share these curricula for use by
biomedical and CGDS education communities, and interact with CGDS Hub and Sites for greater benefits of
research education training; 3) Develop and execute student research projects in CGDS that are orientated to
human health and diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and minority health, as these are
the leading causes of deaths and significant health disparities. We will disseminate all the developed CGDS
curricula and methods to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our expertise in online and scalable in-
person education. Thus, this program will dramatically expand the diverse CGDS workforce in the underserved
Hawaii Pacific regions and beyond. It broadens the opportunities for CGDS education and speeds up the
adoption and use of cloud-enhanced CGDS throughout the research enterprise to tackle critical health problems
among common public and underrepresented groups."

 The goal to effectively treat neurodegenerative disorders requires an understanding not only of neuronal
dysfunction, but also of dysfunction of non-neuronal cells that can initiate and contribute to neuronal pathology.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the
abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the Ataxin 1 (ATXN1) gene. SCA1 patients suffer from progressive
neuronal degeneration and reactive astrogliosis, especially in the cerebellum, leading to motor deficits. Despite
intense research focus on the disease mechanisms in cerebellar neurons, there are no effective therapies
available to cure, delay or ameliorate SCA1.
 Astrocytes are brain cells that play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of neuronal and brain
function. Recently, using single-nuclei RNA sequencing we demonstrated that cerebellar astrocytes express
Atxn1 at a level comparable to neurons (Borgenheimer et al., 2022). This raises a question of how mutant
ATXN1 in astrocytes impacts their function, contributes to neuronal pathology, and leads to SCA1-like disease
outcomes. To fill this knowledge gap, we aim to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms though
which mATXN1 affects cerebellar astrocytes, and how astrocyte dysfunctions contribute to the behavioral and
pathological changes that are observed in SCA1 disease onset and progression."
10987289,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to interrogate the dynamics of membrane voltage in the context of intact
brains with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optical methods to dissect neuronal activity promise to revolutionize
our understanding of the brain at the cellular and circuit level; however, our understanding remains incomplete
due, in part, to a lack of tools that can report directly on neuronal activity with sufficient speed and sensitivity.
We propose to use the power of molecular design and organic chemistry to develop and apply new optical tools
for monitoring membrane potential with unprecedented speed and sensitivity in intact brains and without
disruptive capacitive load associated with other classes of voltage indicators. We plan to exploit photoinduced
electron transfer (PeT) through molecular wires as a versatile platform for optical voltage sensing. We will build
a palette of colors for optical voltage sensing that extends into the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum; we will create new voltage sensors with exceptionally high two-photon absorption cross sections for
use in thick tissue and intact brains; and we will explore methods for genetically targeting and localizing ultra-
sensitive fluorescent voltage sensors to neurons of interest. Throughout, development of molecular tools will be
closely wed to applications in neurons and tissues, and we will apply these tools to understand how membrane
potential dynamics change in both healthy and neurological disease states."
10987882,"Abstract
The disruption of the homeostasis in neurons often results in degeneration, an irreversible mechanism that still
is not well understood. Neurodegeneration is often accompanied by lysosomal dysfunction, which is
characterized by increased luminal pH levels, alterations to the proteolytic capacity, and disruption of the activity
of lysosomal transmembrane proteins. Fibroblasts and induced neurons from the most severe variant (p.R126X)
of a rare pediatric-onset neurodevelopmental disease called TBCK syndrome show a strong phenotype
associated with lysosomal dysfunction; however, the mechanism by which the deficiency of the TBC1-containing
kinase (TBCK) protein alters the effective clearance of senescent or damage proteins and organelles remains
unclear. The p.R126X, also known as the “Boricua” mutation because it affects children from Puerto Rican
ancestry, is a frameshift variant that causes the truncation of the TBCK protein. Proteomic studies performed in
our lab showed that TBCK interacts with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 4 (JIP4), and the
deficiency of TBCK disrupts the protein levels of JIP4, which also correlate with more stationary lysosomes in
axons from TBCK-deficient induced neurons (TBCK-deficient iNeu). Therefore, I hypothesize that TBCK
deficiency impairs JIP4 stability leading to the disruption of the positioning, motility, and maturation of lysosomes.
The first aim of this project will test the maturation and motility of lysosomes and the role effect of JIP4 disruption
in lysosomal function. To test this, I will define the maturation state of lysosomes of TBCK-deficient iNeu using
a pH-sensitive-LAMP1 reporter and confocal microscopy. Also, I will perform time-lapse live imaging analysis to
assess the motility of lysosome in axons from TBCK-deficient iNeu, and I will disrupt the levels of JIP4 in control
iNeu to observe whether lysosomes reflect the same phenotype as TBCK-deficient iNeu. The second aim will
determine whether introducing a plasmid containing the TBCK sequence into TBCK-deficient iNeu restitutes
JIP4 protein levels and restores the functionality of lysosomes. Also, I will use HEK cells to evaluate which
domain of the TBCK protein, pseudo-kinase, TBC, and rhodanese, interacts with JIP4. This aim will reveal the
role of TBCK in the modulation of JIP4 protein levels and the domain involved on this novel interaction. Overall,
this project will define the relevance of the novel interaction between TBCK and JIP4 and how the disruption of
the levels of JIP4 is implicated in the maturation and motility of lysosomes."
10987908,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 Cancers rich in dense stromal tissue are more difficult to treat and carry a worse prognosis than cancers
without the stroma-rich phenotype. The fibrous stroma surrounding certain tumors effectively excludes many
current therapies, including antibody- or cell-based therapies and large (>30nm) nanoparticles. Duo Oncology
develops ultrasmall nanomedicines (10nm-30nm) that penetrate and accumulate in stroma-rich tumors but not
healthy organs. Specifically, our innovative ultrasmall nanomedicine, DUO-307, penetrates stroma rich tumors
and changes the tumor immune microenvironment through the combined actions of its gemcitabine prodrug
(PGEM) and co-encapsulated small molecule immunotherapy, chemokine receptor type 2 antagonist (CCR2a;
PF-04136309). It is a unique chemo-immunotherapy that is directly cytotoxic to the tumor and increases the
expression of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), which synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy.
 The proposal funded by the NCI and entitled, “A novel dual-carrier ultrasmall nanomedicine for the treatment
of stroma-rich pancreatic cancer”, aims to propel DUO-307 toward commercialization through the completion of
three specific aims:
• Aim 1, conducted in collaboration with Drs. Lance Munn and Gabriel Duda of Massachusetts General
 Hospital, will provide an optimized formulation of DUO-307. Our collaborators will grow and harvest human
 pancreatic cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) to be used in a vascularized tissue explant (VTE)
 culture system. Tumor tissue samples will be exposed to increasing concentrations of PGEM to determine
 the quantity of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) produced when maximal GEM-associated apoptosis is
 achieved. We will then use a human monocyte chemotaxis assay to determine the optimal amount of
 CCR2a to co-load into our DUO-307 nanomedicine. The optimized formulation will then be characterized
 for particle size, drug loading efficiency, and stability. Progress has already been made toward the
 completion of this aim. Qualified PGEM nanoparticles were manufactured and delivered to Dr. Munn’s
 laboratory. PDX pancreatic tumor samples have been implanted into mice and once they reach the
 appropriate size will be harvested for experimental use in the VTE cultures.
• Aim 2 will evaluate the safety of the optimized DUO-307 formulation. A dose escalation study in naïve mice
 will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose. A single cycle dosing schedule will be used
 and terminal clinical chemistry and blood cell counts will be the primary outcomes of interest.
• Aim 3 will test the efficacy of DUO-307 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in an orthotopic KrasG12D/+;
 LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model of pancreatic cancer. This aim will be conducted in
 collaboration with Dr. Song Li at the University of Pittsburgh and will evaluate DUO-307’s ability to inhibit
 tumor growth, reduce tumor associated macrophage populations, and ultimately increase anti-tumor
immunity.
Up to this point, we have not encountered administrative, technical, or commercial challenges. In the next two
weeks, we will submit a change order to our CDMO so they will be ready to manufacture the optimized DUO-
307 product for the studies outlined in Aims 2 and 3.
Duo Oncology’s iCorps team will be compromised of Drs. Sam Rothstein, Katherine Eichinger, and Victoria
Manax. Dr. Rothstein is Duo Oncology’s CEO and received a PhD in chemical engineering from the University
of Pittsburgh. He has 20 years of experience researching and developing nanoparticle products and founded
his first company, a particle CDMO, while in graduate school. Since co-founding Duo Oncology in 2020, Dr.
Rothstein has secured more than $4 million in private investment toward the commercialization of Duo
Oncology’s lead product. Dr. Rothstein is deeply committed to investigating DUO-307’s commercial landscape.
He believes this nanomedicine is uniquely poised to deliver a new, better treatment option for patients with
stroma-rich tumors, enhancing their response to anti-PD-1 therapy.
Dr. Katherine Eichinger will serve as the Technical Lead/Expert of the iCorps team. She is the PI of the STTR
grant and the Director of Operations for Duo Oncology. Dr. Eichinger has worked at three major healthcare
institutions as a clinical pharmacist and has earned her PhD in pharmaceutical sciences. Dr. Eichinger has
been laying the groundwork for production, preclinical toxicology, and clinical testing of Duo Oncology’s lead
product. She is eager to work with Drs. Rothstein and Manax to identify marketplace opportunities for DUO-
307 and efficiently advance it to commercialization.
The role of Industry Expert will be filled by Dr. Victoria Manax, an accomplished medical oncologist, who has
spent over two decades in the pharmaceutical/biotech industry. Dr. Manax has designed and overseen
numerous multimillion-dollar global clinical trial programs and has shaped the clinical trial landscapes through
the advocacy of adaptive platform designs. She is well-qualified to help Duo Oncology transition DUO-307 from
a novel academic nanomedicine to a global therapy that can transform the lives of oncology patients.
Each of the three members of Duo Oncology’s iCorps team are committed to the time requirements of this
program and are genuinely invested in refining the commercialization strategy for DUO-307."
10987309,"Randomized clinical trials for the treatment of psychiatric and substance use disorders can be difficult, time-
consuming, and expensive to conduct. Partially as a consequence, their sample sizes are typically underpow-
ered for: 1) detecting moderately sized average treatment effects (ATEs) that may nonetheless be important
for health at the population level, and 2) learning optimal individualized treatment rules (i.e., rules that match
treatments to individuals based on demographic and clinical characteristics to optimize outcomes of interest),
which are the cornerstone of personalized medicine. These are major barriers to 1) improving population
drug use disorder outcomes in terms of broad implementation of treatments with moderate effects and 2)
improving individual drug use disorder outcomes in terms of refining treatment strategies away from a “one-
size-fits-all” approach to one incorporating a patient’s clinical characteristics. Data fusion typically involves
combining individual patient data from similar studies to improve statistical power and answer questions that
cannot be addressed by a single study alone. However, the statistical theory underlying data fusion is rel-
atively new, and numerous open problems remain. One commonly occurring challenge is that studies will
often measure different outcomes at follow-up such that a given outcome of interest will only be observed in
a subset of studies. In practice, trials are typically combined when they have a common set of covariates,
treatment, and outcome. This means that statistical efficiency and power gains from incorporating data from
additional studies that do not share a common outcome, but do measure other related outcomes, are left
on the table. Consequently, there is a critical need for principled, flexible, and efficient estimators that can
be applied to multi-study, multi-outcome fused data sets to maximize statistical power and efficiency. Doing
so is a prerequisite for learning individualized treatment rules that optimize the health outcomes relevant to
each treatment and for detecting more moderately sized, yet meaningful treatment effects. The objectives of
this project are: 1) to develop both simple parameteric and semiparametric efficient estimators of the ATE,
conditional ATE (CATE) and optimal individualized treatment rules in multi-study, multi-outcome data-fusion
settings (Aims 1a and 2a); 2) to develop sensitivity analyses for ATE and CATE estimation if the untestable
transport identification assumption is not met (Aims 1b and 2b); 3) to apply these estimators to harmonized
medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) trials with multiple outcomes to increase power
to detect effects (Aims 1c and 2c); and 4) to develop and disseminate user-friendly software that implements
all the above methods (Aim 3:). This proposal is expected to make a significant contribution to increasing the
power and information gained from data fusion, and consequently, to improve the individualized treatment of
psychiatric and substance use disorders."

 The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare has resulted in a hugely promising source of
data for public health and medical research. Because EHR include rich data on large populations at relatively
low cost, many researchers have turned to observational studies using EHR as an alternative to conducting
randomized studies that are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. However, EHR data are not
collected with research questions in mind, meaning data necessary for statistical analysis are frequently missing.
 Two commonly utilized study designs in observational settings are the target trial emulation and matched
cohort designs. A critical component in each of these study designs is determining the population of patients
eligible for inclusion in the study. Missing data in variables that define eligibility criteria thus present a major
challenge for researchers. In practice, patients with incomplete eligibility data are frequently excluded from anal-
ysis, despite the possibility of selection bias, where subjects with observed eligibility data may be fundamentally
different than excluded subjects. Few works have acknowledged that missing eligibility data poses the risk of
selection bias. What little work exists doesn’t consider the problem in the above study designs, examine diverse
types of outcomes, or provide expansive guidelines on which clinical settings this bias arises.
 An inverse probability weighting (IPW) framework to address selection bias will be developed in a manner
tailored towards sequential target trial emulations examining time-to-event endpoints. Estimation and inferential
procedures under this framework will be established, and methods will be evaluated on a complex simulation
infrastructure that adequately captures the intricacies of EHR data. This will enable detailed characterization of
clinical settings where bias arises in practice. IPW fails to produce consistent estimates when weight models
are missspecified. Influce-function based estimators will be derived, which will be robust to forms of model
mispecification and allow for estimation via flexible machine learning methods. This class of estimators will be
developed for the matched cohort design when interest lies in continuous or longitudinal outcomes.
 The methods described in these aims will be applied to EHR-derived data that include long-term health
outcomes among 45,000 individuals who underwent bariatric surgery between 1997 and 2015, and over 1.6
million non-surgical patients eligible for bariatric surgery during that time frame. Specifically, this research will
answer open questions about the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery in the treatment of patients with obesity
and type 2 diabetes, and will consider how rates of micro- and macrovascular complications associated with
diabetes differ between patients undergoing bariatric surgery and those not. Robust software will be developed
that provides researchers valid, practical, and user-friendly tools for the the identification, characterization, and
control of selection bias in EHR-based research."

Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) are the most common malignant brain tumors of children. They are surgically
inaccessible and refractive to chemotherapy. The prevalent oncogenic driver--an H3K27M mutation of histone
H3--is undruggable. Radiotherapy is the standard of care for DMG, and the only treatment that prolongs patient
survival. However, H3K27M DMGs inevitably recur following radiotherapy and are uniformly fatal. Against this
backdrop, we propose this R01 response to PAR-22-198 from the NCI entitled “Precision Approaches in
Radiation Synthetic combinations (PAIRS).” Our broad goal is to improve survival of children with DMG.
 The point of departure for our study plan is a recently completed genome-wide CRISPR screen aimed at
identifying DMG-specific vulnerabilities. Our screen identified a conditional synthetic lethality at the junction of
replication stress (RS) and the consequent DNA damage response (DDR). This vulnerability is druggable and
has potential to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in DMG synergistically--a strategy specifically proposed
by PAIRS. Our testable hypothesis is that a sustainable balance between RS and DDR in DMGs can be
tipped to therapeutic advantage by combining radiation and ATR antagonists (which increase RS) or by
radiation plus inhibitors of DNA polymerase Q (which decrease DDR).
 In collaboration with a corporate partner, we have identified clinical-stage, brain-penetrant antagonists of
ATR and POLQ. For clinical trials we are an integral member of the international Pacific Pediatric Neuro-
Oncology Consortium (PNOC). Drawing upon these resources, our aims are to test three specific predictions of
our hypothesis. Aim 1 (target specificity) tests the prediction that synergistic killing of DMG cells by the
combination of radiation plus ATR or POLQ antagonist reflects “on target” responses to enhanced RS or
suppressed DDR (induced by ATR or POLQ antagonist, respectively). Aim 2 (chromatin structure) tests the
prediction that the H3K27M driven altered chromatin propels dependency on ATR and POLQ. Aim 3
(therapeutic potential) tests the predictions that (a) the variability in DMG patient responses to radiotherapy
reflects patient-specific differences in the pre-therapeutic burden of DDR and RS and (b) that markers of RS
and DDR will correlate with response to therapy in “avatar clinical trials” with patient-derived xenografts of
DMGs.
 The study plan is enabled by an interactive collaboration among three investigators whose skill sets exceed
the sum of their parts. Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. is a clinician-scientist with much practical experience in the
clinical care of children with DMG. As Chair of Radiation Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, DHK
interacts frequently with Dipanjan Chowdhury, Ph.D. - a DNA enzymologist with deep expertise in DNA
replication and repair. In clinical studies proposed for Aim 3, DHK and DC will work closely with Sabine
Mueller, M.D. - an expert on the design and conduct of clinical trials and leader of the PNOC consortium."
10996980,"Project Summary/Abstract
Developmental language disorder (DLD) is classically identified by a morphosyntactic impairment, but the deficit
profile incorporates other domains such as linguistic prosody and music. To date, the emphasis in the music
domain has been on perceptual processing of rhythmic timing and musical sequences. However, production
may also be implicated, since children with DLD have deficits in hierarchically organized prosody. In the proposed
work, the aim is to use constructs from linguistic prosody to assess whether hierarchical processing drives the
rhythmic deficits observed in the production of language and music. Importantly, language representations may
also differ from music representations, specifically in that language conveys word and sentence content. Another
gap that the present work will address is whether, because of its linguistic content, spoken prosody may be
malleable or learnable in different ways than music. The significance of the planned research is to determine if
a cross-domain rhythmic grouping deficit is present in school-aged children with DLD.
In this planned study, 7- to 8-year-old children (Aim 1) will engage in a series of drumming and spoken language
tasks involving rhythmic grouping abilities predicted to be shared across music and language (Aim 1). An
additional linguistic task will be administered to test the malleability of prosodically vulnerable and stable forms
in a referential as compared to a nonreferential condition (Aim 2). Key to the design of these studies is the
inclusion of multiple levels of grouping structure, allowing for the analysis of hierarchical rhythmic organization
in both music and language. Rhythmic performance will be assessed via both transcription (of beats and pauses
in music, speech sounds and syllables in language) and movement implementation (motion tracking of hands in
music, lips in prosody) metrics. Movement analyses allow for direct measurement of correlates of prosody,
including relative and absolute amplitude and duration of syllables and beats.
The goal of these studies is to determine if children with DLD show deficits in the implementation of rhythmically
grouped, as opposed to ungrouped, elements and to what extent that implementation is influenced by lexical
(referential) assignment. The findings from this project will have the long-term potential to provide new, domain
general avenues for identification and intervention in DLD."
10997031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of the infant brain is a dynamic, intricate process that, when disrupted, can lead to long-term
neurological disability. In humans, new inhibitory interneurons (INs) continue to be born and migrate
extensively into specific cortical destinations late in gestation and into postnatal life. One common injury that
occurs during late gestation and early infancy, is neonatal hypoxic injury (HI). HI is commonly associated with
white matter injury, which has led to prior studies focusing on the myelinating cells of the brain –
oligodendrocytes. Considering the growing awareness that INs migrate through the white matter and the
frequency and clinical outcomes of HI, it is critical to understand the impact of hypoxia on late migrating INs.
To overcome the limited access to neonatal human brain tissue, we have developed an innovative model
system using the piglet brain. Using the piglet model, we have identified two migratory streams from the Arc
targeting distinct cortical structures. Our preliminary data suggests that these streams differentially express
genes encoding migratory-related receptors, most notably CXCR4. During hypoxic injury, CXCR4 is directly
upregulated by hypoxia inducible factors. Therefore, I propose that HI results in aberrant migration of
migratory INs in the postnatal cortex, a misdirection that is mediated through CXCR4 upregulation.
First, I will use computational approaches to identify altered signaling pathways in human HI (Aim 1). Next, I
will quantify the effect of hypoxia on interneuron migration (Aim 2). Finally, I will test the hypothesis that
CXCR4 regulates Arc interneuron migration and mediates hypoxic induced misdirection (Aim 3). Completion of
these aims will expand our knowledge of a fundamental mechanism in neonatal brain development and the
effect of a common injury on this process.
My primary sponsor, Dr. Mercedes Paredes, is an academic neurologist who is an expert in human inhibitory
interneuron development and my co-sponsor, Dr. John Rubenstein, discovered the role of CXCR4 in inhibitory
interneuron migration and other fundamental transcription factors regulating brain development. Together, their
experience and commitment to my training will ensure that I learn to pursue a biomedically focused scientific
question, complete the proposed research, and gain relevant clinical experiences to advance my long-term
career goals. An F31 NRSA fellowship would allow me to deepen my expertise in developmental neuroscience
and computational genomics. This training will provide a foundation to take the next steps towards becoming
an academic pediatric neurologist who studies the intersection of genetics and neurodevelopment to advance
neuroprotective and regenerative therapies for brain disorders."
10998199,"Word production deficits are a cardinal feature of aphasia, a communication disorder affecting 2.4 million
Americans (Simmons-Mackie & Cherney, 2018). Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA; Boyle & Coelho, 1995) is
one of the most used treatments for word production deficits in aphasia (Tierney-Hendricks et al., 2021). The
goal of SFA is to improve spoken word production by guiding persons with aphasia to produce semantic
features related to treatment target (traditionally, a concrete noun). The efficacy of SFA is well supported by
meta-analyses including over 50 participants (Efstratiadou et al., 2018; Quique et al., 2019). Feature
generation is a key active ingredient of SFA (Boyle, 2010; Evans et al., 2021, Cavanaugh, Swiderski et al.,
2022) and the treatment’s mechanism of action is hypothesized to be spreading activation between semantic
concepts (Boyle et al., 2022). However, the nature of the information encoded during spreading activation
remains unknown and characterization of the brain networks supporting this activity is incomplete.
 One way to address this knowledge gap is to test whether competing semantic models (taxonomic,
distributional, or experiential) models better fit neural data elicited by semantic feature generation.
Taxonomic, distributional, and experiential models represent concepts by category membership, patterns of
co-occurrence, and sensory, motor, and affective experiences, respectively. Using representational similarity
analysis, Fernandino and colleagues (2022) found that experiential feature-vectors correlated more strongly
with neural data elicited by a concept-familiarity task than did taxonomic and distributional feature-vectors.
Distributional feature-vectors have also been used to match BOLD signal elicited by an SFA-analogous covert
semantic feature generation task to individual concept labels with over 80% accuracy (Anderson et al., 2016).
 We propose to extend these findings to people with aphasia and age-matched healthy adults. Aim 1 will
identify the semantic model that most strongly correlates with BOLD signal elicited by semantic feature
generation. We hypothesize that experiential and distributional models will show the highest agreement with
the neural data for both participant groups. In Aim 2 we will decode the BOLD signal elicited by this task
associated with single object concepts; we hypothesize that decoder accuracy will exceed 80% for healthy adults
and be well above chance for participants with aphasia. In aim 3 we will identify relationships between decoder
accuracy and theoretically and clinically relevant psycholinguistic abilities along with critical patient
characteristics in persons with aphasia. We hypothesize that decoder accuracy will correlate more strongly with
semantic than phonological language tasks and negatively correlate with patient characteristics such as lesion
volume. This study will improve our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying SFA and
support future developments, including the creation of in silico models enabling the study of normal and
impaired lexical semantic processing and its downstream effects on other language systems."
10998688,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biological females develop psychotic disorders later than males. One leading theory that explains this
phenomenon is the estrogen hypothesis, which proposes that rising estrogen during the pubertal period may
impact mechanisms of psychosis onset until estrogens normatively decline (8-10 years later) and the risk for
psychosis is unmasked. The premorbid psychosis period, during the transition from childhood to adolescence,
is of high significance with regard to early mechanisms of psychosis as it marks a time where liability for
psychosis interacts with hormonal and brain development while subtle psychosis symptoms, i.e., psychotic-like
experiences (PLEs), emerge. This developmental period is also marked by the initiation and rising estrogen
levels in biological females which has a powerful impact on the hippocampus- increasing volumes,
connectivity, and improving hippocampal-related cognitive function- a region critically implicated in psychosis
vulnerability and course. However, the estrogen hypothesis has never been examined longitudinally in the
developmental context of the premorbid period. Instead, prior literature has often focused on late decreases in
estrogen or retrospective accounts of puberty in individuals along the psychosis spectrum. As a result, many
questions remain regarding the mechanisms of the estrogen hypothesis in adolescence. Individual variability in
late childhood and early adolescent development provides a natural experiment for testing the mechanisms
through which estrogen interacts with vulnerability to psychosis. This variability allows for the modeling of
changes in estrogen (in terms of rising levels and menarche), brain structure and function, cognition, and
course of symptoms both across and between biological females within their developmental context. This
approach has significant potential to provide an entirely new perspective on our mechanistic understanding of
psychosis. The proposed analyses will leverage the strengths of the ABCD study, capturing this rich variability
in estrogen in late childhood and early coupled with critical neural, cognitive, and symptom longitudinally within
biological females. This rich dataset will allow us to examine estrogen comprehensively within biological
females and whether there is sex specificity to the impact of estrogen levels on PLEs by examining biological
males for whom estrogen levels are available. Although not everyone with PLEs will transition to psychosis,
these symptoms do reflect underlying psychosis vulnerability in the premorbid period, and tracking changes in
PLE levels in the premorbid period may be informative in the early mechanism that may modulate vulnerability
related to formal psychotic disorders as a function of adolescent development. Understanding the mechanisms
of these estrogen effects within their developmental context will provide insights into how (structural, functional,
cognitive, direct clinical impact), when (timing/developmental context), where (hippocampal subvolume), and
for whom (sex-specificity) to target intervention to reduce or delay the transition to psychosis."

The International Society for Vaccines (ISV) is a not-for-profit membership organization founded in
1992 with members and delegates from 47 countries, holding annual congresses since 2007. The ISV
Annual Congress is the world’s largest non-commercial scientific conference for researchers
interested in vaccines and immunotherapeutics and the underlying sciences. The topics include
prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines of infectious and chronic diseases and cancer, and human and
animal vaccines, including the intersection of One Health. Presentations cover basic research
through manufacturing and clinical trials.
ISV intentionally rotates the sites of the meetings between Asia, North America, and Europe, in
accessible locations for strong regional and international representation. ISV attracts renowned
leaders in vaccine fields while simultaneously providing opportunities for scientists from low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) to attend both virtually and in person, and for students and early
career researchers (ECRs) to present and gain personalized feedback and mentoring by senior
scientists. ISV is particularly committed to ensuring participation of female, underrepresented, and
junior investigators.
The 2024 ISV Annual Congress, to be held in Seoul, South Korea, aims to highlight the very latest
ground-breaking developments in vaccine research, manufacturing, clinical development and
implementation, and safety. Plenary and parallel sessions are devoted to current hot topics spanning
diverse areas of vaccinology. Poster sessions will allow more free and diverse scientific exchange of
early research findings. Funding from NIAID R13 conference grant mechanism will provide critical
support to LMIC delegates and students in vaccinology."

Through this proposal, we request funding to organize a symposium entitled ""Engineered Vision Conference
(EVC).” The main objective is to convene recognized global experts in basic and clinical vision research, cell
and gene therapy, biomedical engineering, industry, as well as junior investigators, to discuss and advance the
area of Engineered Vision (EV). This conference will specifically focus on three areas (1) bioelectronic devices,
(2) cell-based therapies and (3) gene therapies. While these areas are distinct, they share some common
engineering challenges such as in manufacturing as well as defining meaningful clinical endpoints. During the
EVC, we aim to identify the challenges impeding the advancement of each of these three areas and formulate
a strategic action plan to address these obstacles. We will specifically pinpoint areas of overlap that are
relevant to two if not all three areas and try to develop a strategic plan to address these common challenges
and opportunities. For instance, a technology like microelectromechanical systems might be applicable in all
three areas, and the conference will explore how to effectively utilize such commonalities.
Organizing a symposium aimed at advancing these three areas is highly relevant and timely. For example, the
implementation of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in the field of ophthalmology is highly
significant, especially with the current emphasis on precision and personalized medicine, as well as the
transformative power of deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Given the interdisciplinary nature of this
conference, we have assembled researchers and clinicians with diverse expertise across these three domains
to contribute to the overarching goal of Engineered Vision. Additionally, we will focus on diversity, equity and
inclusion through a broad outreach plan. We will prioritize the training of junior faculty as well as students
(trainees) through a robust poster and presentation program and an interactive conference format, which
includes travel and best poster awards. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions, we will be able
to explore the foundational aspects of EV while also identifying innovative approaches and state-of-the-art
methodologies, accelerating significant breakthroughs and the development of groundbreaking therapeutics."

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a prevalent virus that establishes a lifelong persistent
infection in humans and is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphomas (PELs).
Despite the reduction in complications associated with HIV infection due to combination antiretroviral
therapy, KS still occurs in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection, in older men without HIV infection
(classic KS), in sub-Saharan Africa (endemic KS), and in transplant recipients (iatrogenic KS). Despite
being a pressing human health problem, very little research has been conducted to date on potential
vaccine development against KSHV infection and its associated diseases. This is primarily due to the lack
of significant interest as well as the absence of an effective animal model that supports in vivo studies on
KSHV infection. For this reason, recombinant Murine Herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) has been used as the
murine counterpart of KSHV in a small, manageable mouse model. The goal of this U01 application is
twofold: firstly, to test three different novel vaccine platforms against KSHV infection, and secondly, to
develop chimeric MHV68 carrying the replacement of KSHV glycoprotein (MHV68-K-G) as a surrogate
challenge virus for testing the efficacy of KSHV vaccines in an in vivo mouse model."

The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most commonly used nonhuman primate model in biomedical
research. Nonhuman primate models are of growing importance for HIV/AIDS-related research to develop
vaccines, therapeutic interventions a potential cure and other approaches. However, it is well-known that the
demand by the research community of rhesus macaques, remains greater than their availability. The CPRC have
been critical for maintaining the momentum of NIH-supported. Over the last three years (2020-2023), 700

This SBIR Fast-Track proposal is designed to address the urgent problems of vaping and
prescription drug misuse (PDM) among youth in the U.S. There is a dearth of primary prevention
programs for vaping and PDM that have demonstrated changes in behavior as part of a rigorously
designed evaluation. Research shows that the age of onset for these behaviors is decreasing and
rates are increasing among the youngest cohorts. While there are a number of substance use
prevention programs, there are no evidence-based programs that focus on these problems
among upper elementary school students from a positive youth development perspective.
Furthermore, due to growing constraints on classroom time, new evidence-based hybrid
prevention programs are needed that flexibly incorporate the use of online digital technology and
classroom components. In the proposed project, we will develop and test a hybrid adaptation of
the evidence-based Life Skills Training (LST) substance abuse prevention program for upper
elementary school students. The LST program has been extensively tested and found to
effectively prevent substance abuse in a series of randomized controlled trials with behavioral
effects reported in over 30 peer-reviewed publications. The proposed hybrid preventive
intervention will: 1) utilize both online e-learning modules and traditional classroom sessions to
reduce risk of vaping and PDM as part of a broader positive youth development substance use
prevention model; 2) teach students about the harms of vaping and the importance of safe and
appropriate prescription medication use; 3) enhance protective factors by building social and self-
regulation skills through interactive learning and behavioral rehearsal scenarios; and 4)
incorporate online booster sessions. In Phase I, we will develop prototypes of e-learning modules
and classroom materials and focus group test them with upper elementary school students,
teachers, and parents to demonstrate feasibility, relevance, usability, and appeal. Materials will
be revised based on focus group feedback and fully developed, and then we will conduct a
rigorous national randomized trial of the prevention program in Phase II. Elementary schools
(N=30) will be randomized into either an intervention group that will receive the new hybrid
intervention or a treatment-as-usual control group that will receive existing health education
programming. At the end of the intervention period, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up
assessments, we will compare both groups on changes in behaviors, norms, attitudes, and
knowledge regarding vaping and appropriate prescription medication use. This research offers
the potential to identify an innovative, effective, interactive, and engaging hybrid preventive
intervention program that reduces the time burden for classroom prevention by incorporating e-
learning modules as part of an evidence-based prevention model. The intervention materials may
help to reduce risk for emergent substance use behaviors among upper elementary school youth.
The program can be widely disseminated throughout the country and ultimately decrease the
harms of substance misuse among youth."
11006022,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most infectious and deadly diseases in human history, accounting for about 1.5
million deaths annually. Worldwide, about one out of every three people is infected with the bacteria that
causes TB, i.e., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a massive reservoir for future outbreaks. Moreover, the
overuse and misuse of antibiotics have accelerated the rise of drug-resistant forms of the bacterium that are
increasingly making treatment difficult even in areas with readily accessible healthcare. Bacteriophages or
phages are viruses that have evolved to target specific bacterial species. Unlike antibiotics, phages offer a
more targeted approach to selectively eliminate pathogenic bacteria, leaving the other microbiota largely
unharmed. Moreover, when phages infect and lyse their preferred bacterial host, they replicate and increase in
number, which could result in a reduction in dosing frequency and duration of treatments. In contrast, the
current standard antibiotic-based regimen for TB demands prolonged and rigorous treatment schedules, often
leading to patient non-compliance and greater risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Despite the promising
potential of phage therapy for TB, there are challenges in developing a stable phage product to deliver viable
phages to deep lung to kill extracellular and intracellular Mtb. We propose to use our thin-film freeze-drying
(TFFD) technology to create an aerosolizable dry powder of D29 mycobacteriophages capable of reaching and
eliminating Mtb after pulmonary delivery. TFFD produces brittle, porous matrix powders that are readily
sheared into respirable particles using a passive dry powder inhaler for efficient deposition in deep lung. This
process also ensures that the phages remain viable and active throughout processing and administration. We
have already developed a prototype stable, aerosolizable dry powder of D29 phages. Our goal in this Phase 1
application is to develop a new, improved powder with D29 phages encapsulated in a biocompatible polymer to
enable the phages to access and destroy both extracellular and intracellular Mtb. Our specific aims are: (1) to
develop a stable, aerosolizable dry powder comprised of D29 phages encapsulated in polymeric
microparticles, which will be uniquely achieved during oral inhalation wherein the brittle matrix phage powder is
sheared into respirable microparticles using a dry powder inhaler; (2) to identify the degree to which the
encapsulated D29 phages in a thin-film freeze-dried powder will kill mycobacteria in bronchoalveolar fluid and
in macrophages; and (3) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the D29 phages after they are administered into
the lung as a dry powder in a mouse model. In summary, we will utilize TFFD and its unique mechanism of
generating respirable particles to develop a phage product for the treatment of TB. The new product will ensure
the stability and viability of the phages, enhance their targeted delivery to the lung, and increase the likelihood
of successful treatment of pulmonary Mtb infections. The same technology could also be adapted to develop
inhaled phage dry powder products for the treatment of other pulmonary bacterial infections."
11005551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) is the greatest public health crisis the United States has faced in a
generation. Yet essentially the same three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for OUD
(MOUD), in various formulations, have been available since the crisis began decades ago: opioid agonist
methadone, partial agonist buprenorphine and antagonist naltrexone. These few legacy defenses against the
staggering tide of addiction have proven feeble, primarily due to short treatment retention and lack of access.
These MOUD are poorly accepted, offered to <20% of indicated patients. In the significant sub-population of
OUD patients seeking opioid abstinence, only one MOUD, monthly injectable extended-release naltrexone
(XR-NTX) is indicated. However, the median treatment duration on XR-NTX is just ~30 days (i.e., a single
initial injection). Further, given its highly variable pharmacokinetics (PK), XR-NTX appears to lose efficacy in a
substantial group of patients in the fourth week prior to repeat dosing, with abrupt loss of all opioid blockade in
most patients within a week after a missed dose, leaving opioid intolerant patients completely unprotected. XR-
NTX’s refrigeration, time-consuming 30-minute thawing, and cumbersome reconstitution requirements create
workflow friction and storage challenges in many addiction practice settings, hindering availability. As a result,
even after successful medical withdrawal (i.e., opioid detoxification), an estimated ~95% of abstinence-seeking
patients are discharged un-initiated onto XR-NTX, resulting in relapse rates of up to 90% within a year. NRS-
033 is a patented novel chemical composition ultra long-acting opioid antagonist with successful preliminary
Phase 1 clinical data. These data suggest NRS-033 will be longer duration, stronger acting, more consistently
efficacious, and more forgivingly dosed than XR-NTX. NRS-033’s human Phase 1 PK data suggests >400%
longer duration of action than XR-NTX, corresponding to dramatically improved treatment retention. Given its
gradual decline and high trough levels of plasma nalmefene, NRS-033 should provide stronger and more
consistent opioid blockade, as well as a more forgiving dosing schedule than XR-NTX. Such upgrades are
critical for socially complex patients in today’s illicit market dominated by potent synthetic opioids, different from
that decades ago. Also, NRS-033 is a room temperature stable ready-to-use prefilled syringe, much easier to
use and clinically accessible than XR-NTX. Our proposed Aims seek to expedite NRS-033 into Phase 3 trials
and FDA registration, hence include: late stage (registration batch) chemistry, manufacturing, and controls
(CMC) for API and drug product, registration enabling non-clinical studies, quality systems, and regulatory
engagement with FDA. Despite significantly de-risked development, the timely advance of NRS-033 will have a
profound public health impact once available, reducing relapse and overdose risk for abstinence-seeking OUD
patients, helping defeat the prevailing stigma that opioid dependence is inescapable."
11006788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Since its emergence, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has infected 84 million people worldwide
and led to the deaths of 40 million people1. Despite the development of over 20 different treatment options, there
is still no cure available. As a result, many individuals infected with HIV experience long-term side effects from
antiretroviral therapy and have more comorbidities earlier in their lives than those who are not infected2,3.
Therefore, there is a need to further research alternative ways to reduce or prevent HIV infection. The two
coreceptors for HIV infection, CCR5 and CXCR4, which play an essential role in HIV infecting CD4 cells, are
promising opportunities to limit HIV. While elimination of CCR5 in hematopoietic cells is being pursued, it is clear
that CCR5-null hematopoietic cells can still be infected by CXCR4-tropic forms of HIV. Therefore, I seek to
develop HIV resistant hematopoietic stem cells by targeting both of the CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors
with base editing to prevent HIV entry while not impairing central functions of these proteins in
hematopoiesis.
 My first AIM will use a base editor screen to identify CCR5 mutants that knock out CCR5 expression but
also decrease the cell surface expression of CXCR4, which has been seen with other CCR5 mutants. The
results of the screen will be analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and single cell DNA
sequencing. My second AIM will also use a base editor screen to identify CXCR4 mutants that prevent the
binding of the HIV surface proteins, but allow for the binding of the natural ligand. These CXCR4 mutants will
be tested with HIV pseudoviruses to identify mutations that prevent viral infection of the cells and a transwell
migration assay to identify mutants that maintain CXCR4 responsiveness. Single cell DNA sequencing will be
run on the cells that pass both of these tests to identify mutation candidates that meet the goals of this AIM.
 The Sankaran lab has extensive expertise in base editor screens and hematopoiesis. To complement
this skill set I have contacted other faculty in the area, such as Dr. Alajandro Balazs, to assist with any HIV related
questions I have and assist with the production of HIV pseudoviruses to test the hits from my base editor screens.
My training plan focuses on gaining further expertise in hematopoiesis, HIV biology, DNA sequencing, processing
of sequencing data, written and oral scientific communication, and scientific mentoring. With access to the Broad
Institute of MIT and Harvard, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Harvard University I have all the tools, resources,
and access to expertise necessary to excel in my research."

Learning about and using environmental cues for safety is critical for survival and mental wellbeing. Current
research on safety signals identiﬁes the basolateral amygdala, insular cortex and infralimbic prefrontal cortex as
important components of the neural circuits needed to process safety signals. These structures are anatomically
interconnected and the proposed studies will be the ﬁrst to test whether they work together in response to safety
signals to mediate safety learning and fear inhibition. Prior mechanistic and descriptive electrophysiology
experiments point to the amygdala and insula as key sites for safety learning but not necessarily for recall. Aim 1
will test the hypothesis that basolateral amygdala neurons that project to the insular cortex convey information
about the safety signal and are necessary for safety learning. In contrast, the infralimbic cortex is responsive to
already learned safety signals and is thought to be critical for behavioral inhibition during threat. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that infralimbic neurons which receive input from the insular cortex are critical for fear inhibition by
safety signals. The results will help complete our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying safety
learning and provide a basis for understanding abnormal safety related behavior in psychopathology."

The overarching goal of this NGC Center is to leverage expertise in small molecule drug discovery,
target identification, and protein and IDR biochemistry to identify and advance small molecules that
target transcriptional fusion oncoproteins by 1) targeting the transcriptional machinery that is co-opted
by fusion proteins to drive the oncogenic transcriptional programs, and 2) Directly impair IDR function
with small molecules.
 Transcriptional fusion proteins induce oncogenic gene expression programs that drive cancer
development and progression. These proteins act as neomorphic transcription factors by recruiting
and re-wiring transcriptional regulatory complexes. Rational drug design to directly target transcriptional
fusion proteins remains a major challenge because these proteins lack enzymatic activity and do not
have obvious pockets amenable for small molecule binding. In addition, the mechanisms by which
fusion oncoproteins co-opt transcriptional regulatory complexes are incompletely understood. As such,
the development of new therapies to target transcriptional fusion proteins has lagged efforts to develop
targeted therapies for mutant oncoproteins involved in cellular signaling.
 Our team has discovered that the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex is co-opted to
control the oncogenic gene expression programs induced by transcriptional fusion proteins. We have
further identified the CDK8 kinase module as a druggable entry point by which to impair Mediator
function through a novel trapping mechanism. Our team will probe the biochemical and transcriptional
mechanisms through which CDK8/19 inhibitors alter Mediator function and develop CDK8/19 inhibitors
that maximize Mediator impairment and study these small molecules in advanced preclinical models of
Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. We further identified that vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1)
is a kinase that becomes synthetically lethal following CDK8/19 impairment, and our team will develop
novel specific VRK1 inhibitors and evaluate their efficacy in single agent and combination strategies.
 A central theme has recently emerged that many fusion proteins consist of a DNA binding
domain linked to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). The IDR mediates self-association or phase
separation that has been shown to be essential for the oncogenic nature of these fusion proteins. Our
team has developed an innovative biochemical method of identifying the key protein regions within
IDRs that mediate self-association. We will map the key self-association residues in three fusion protein
IDRs and identify small molecules that impair the ability of these regions to drive phase separation."

Ependymoma (EPN) is an aggressive and chemo-resistant pediatric brain tumor, with treatment remaining
surgery and radiation. There are no targeted therapies available to EPN patients at diagnosis or relapse. Over
95% of EPN that arise in the cortex are driven by gene fusions of ZFTA, with ZFTA-RELA fusions (denoted
ZRFUS) being the most common. We and others have developed mouse models of ZRFUS EPN and found that
ZRFUS binds novel genomic loci to activate oncogenic gene expression and drive tumor formation. Despite these
advances, key knowledge gaps regarding ZRFUS biology remain, including: 1) The precise mechanisms of
oncogenic gene expression, including recruitment of co-regulatory factors, following ZRFUS DNA binding, 2) How
the structured domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the ZRFUS protein synergistically
contribute to oncogene activation, and 3) How ZRFUS interaction partners contribute to oncogenesis and whether
they represent therapeutic vulnerabilities. Emerging evidence from us and others across multiple pediatric
cancers has linked fusion oncoprotein (FO) expression to biomolecular condensate formation, possibly through
a phase separation (PS) mechanism, as a possible unifying model of oncogenic gene expression. We
demonstrate that ZRFUS forms dynamic, nuclear condensates, and that key ZRFUS IDRs are necessary for
condensate formation, oncogenic gene expression and tumorigenesis. In addition to identifying several long
IDRs within ZRFUS, we have discovered that the ZFTA zinc finger (ZF) domains in ZRFUS dominantly influence
DNA binding, condensate formation, and oncogenic gene expression. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that: ZRFUS forms chromatin-associated, liquid-like condensates that are necessary for oncogenic
gene expression and tumor development. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following three
objectives/aims, to (1) Understand how ZRFUS condensates regulate oncogenic expression and tumor
development, (2) Discover the structural basis of ZFTA zinc finger DNA binding and its role in tumorigenesis,
and (3) Interrogate ZRFUS interacting proteins as cancer dependency proteins and therapeutic targets. Overall,
we anticipate that deciphering the mechanisms underlying oncogenesis by ZRFUS, including the biophysics of
condensate formation and functional roles of its condensate interaction partners, may yield novel therapeutic
targets for this aggressive disease."

Since we discovered repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) RAN translation in 2011, we and
others have shown that RAN proteins accumulate in nine different expansion disorders. These
proteins, which can be expressed from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts,
accumulate in disease-relevant human tissues including spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8)
and Huntington disease (HD). We now have evidence that polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins
accumulate in a group of spinocebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7) in which the CAG·CTG
expansion mutations are located in polyGln open reading frames. Additionally, we have
developed AAV and small molecule approaches to inhibit RAN translation. We will use these
tools and genetic approaches to test our central hypotheses that RAN protein pathology is a
common feature shared across polyglutamine encoding CAG·CTG expansion disorders and
that inhibiting the PKR pathway will reduce RAN protein levels and mitigate disease.
We will address our central hypothesis in three specific aims (1) To test the hypothesis that
RAN proteins contribute to spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) caused by polyglutamine encoding
CAG·CTG repeat expansion mutations. (2) To test the hypothesis that SCA and HD RAN
proteins are toxic and PKR inhibition will decrease RAN protein levels and improve cellular
phenotypes in HD and SCA3 iPSC derived cells (3) : To test the hypothesis that RAN proteins
contribute to HD and SCA3 phenotypes in mice independent of polyGln effects using genetic
and pharmacological approaches. Taken together these specific aims will determine the
contribution of RAN proteins to HD,SCA3 and CAG·CTG repeat expansion disorders and
characterize PKR inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for this large class of
devastating repeat expansion diseases."

Deforestation is a critical global issue that leads to extensive macro-level changes in our environment. While
past literature has linked sudden or expansive environmental changes to substance use, a knowledge gap exists
on how deforestation may influence tobacco and alcohol consumption. The objective of this K99/R00 is to
establish clearer linkages and quantify effects and associations between deforestation and tobacco and alcohol
use, using Indonesia as the geographic focal area. The K99 phase is designed to achieve this objective and
augment the candidate’s prior research experience by providing training in: (a) the determinants and
epidemiology of substance use and mental health, (b) satellite remote sensing and image classification, (c)
advanced methods for environmental epidemiology, and (d) causal designs and software for reproducibility and
accessibility. This training is critical to the candidate’s long-term goal of becoming a leading epidemiologist who
builds and uses rigorous statistical approaches to examine environmental exposures and social and behavioral
health outcomes in the United States and in low- and middle-income countries. The proposed research will draw
upon satellite imagery to detect changes in forest cover and composition and 10 years of data (2012-2022) from
a nationally and sub-nationally representative, repeat cross-sectional survey. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will examine
associations between forms of deforestation (wildfire and logging) and tobacco and alcohol use in the general
population and among potentially vulnerable subgroups. It will subsequently estimate tobacco and alcohol use
under different forest loss scenarios to estimate what would be the population-weighted burden of use
attributable to incremental increases in deforestation, compared to the counterfactual of stably forested areas.
Aim 2 (R00 phase) will develop a new causal inference method for estimating the “pure” effect of deforestation
on tobacco and alcohol use. Economic incentives from palm oil production introduce unmeasured confounding
and lead to differential exposure probability when illegal wildfires are set to clear land. A longitudinal extension
of differential comparison design, also known as “negative or secondary controls,” will be created in a simulation
study to contrast three groups (wildfire zones with and without palm oil plantations and stably forested zones)
and parse the “pure” effect of deforestation. The new method will then be applied to the real data for estimation.
A software package and tutorial will be developed to facilitate use and accessibility. Aim 3 (R00 phase) will
examine which combination of factors clustered within regencies are most important in tobacco and alcohol use
and model joint effects in probit Bayesian kernel machine regression. The proposed research aligns with NIEHS’
Mission, Vision, and Strategic Plan and cross-cuts all themes, specifically priority areas of: Co-exposures,
Creating Knowledge from Data, Environmental Health Disparities and Environmental Justice, Emerging
Environmental Health Issues, Partnerships for Action, and Promotion of Collaborative Science."
10984355,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In a disease like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that primarily affects women of childbearing age, social
determinants of health (SDOH) and clinical factors significantly impact adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs).
While race has been recognized as a pivotal SDOH in APOs in SLE, there is a dearth of data regarding the
influence of other SDOH. The objective of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award
is to determine the contribution of SDOH to the risk of APOs in SLE. The central hypothesis is that multiple
discrete SDOH contribute to risk of APOs in SLE patients. The primary outcome is a combination of fetal
morbidity and CDC-defined maternal morbidity, and the secondary outcome is a combination of in-hospital
maternal and fetal mortality. With the Candidate’s experience in health disparities research and her mentoring
team’s expertise in SLE, qualitative research and machine learning, the Candidate will test the hypotheses with
the following aims: 1) To quantify the associations and interactions of race and income with APOs in patients
with SLE; 2) To identify important neighborhood-level SDOH associated with APOs in patients with SLE; and
3) To determine the ability of individual-level SDOH in predicting APOs in patients with SLE. The Candidate will
use US nationwide data (~51,000 SLE pregnancies) and machine learning in data from five distinct and
geographically diverse US states to determine the association between race and neighborhood-level income,
as well as understand the impact of other neighborhood-level SDOH on APOs in patients with SLE. Further,
she will collect both prospective individual-level SDOH data at two New York centers and perform qualitative
interviews with stakeholders (recently pregnant patients with SLE, rheumatologists, high-risk obstetricians, and
social workers) to contextualize the results and to elicit unmeasured SDOH. Through the strategic utilization of
multi-dimensional data, at the end of this project, Dr. Bella Mehta (awardee) will have identified the most
meaningful SDOH that contribute to APO risk in SLE both at an individual- and community-level. Over the
course of this mentored research career development award, Dr. Mehta will obtain advanced training in the
application of established and innovative methods for machine learning, acquire a broad understanding of the
concepts and methods of qualitative research, and develop proficiency in assessment of reproductive health
policies and programs. Data and skills from this study will provide the foundation for an R01 to disentangle the
role of different SDOH in SLE pregnancy outcomes and develop a robust risk prediction tool in large SLE
cohorts and other rheumatic conditions. Thus, patients who need intervention can be identified early, and
future strategies and policies can be developed and implemented to reduce health disparities and improve
outcomes in individual patients."

This proposal seeks funding for 25 early career scientists to attend the FASEB Protein Folding in the
Cell meeting in Southbridge, MA July 7-11, 2024. This conference focuses on the latest developments
regarding how the native conformations of cellular and secreted proteins are achieved and maintained,
and what happens in the cell and in multicellular organisms when aberrant protein conformations arise,
such as in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias of aging. The meeting’s focus is on the basic
science defining protein homeostasis, enabled by ~2500 genes encoding the proteostasis network,
comprising molecular chaperones and co- chaperones that make folding versus degradation decisions.
A decline in proteostasis capacity is especially prominent during aging-associated disease settings,
particularly age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we will dedicate at least 40% of the
talks to this topic, paying particular focus on recent advances in therapeutic strategies. Studies in
experimental models have revealed that small molecule proteostasis regulators may be useful for
ameliorating some of these neurodegenerative diseases. Special emphasis for the transmission of
information will be placed both on the formal presentations as well as on informal interactions through
discussion sessions, which will catalyze the generation of new hypotheses and the initiation of
collaborations. An important goal of the meeting is to enable early career scientists (ECSs) and
underrepresented minority to speak in the main oral presentation venue. For this reason, a 4-member
diversity and inclusion training committee (DITC) was created, who will organize a ½ day pre-meeting
entitled “Future Thought Leaders in Cellular Proteostasis, Aging and Neurodegeneration”. Fifteen
underrepresented graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be invited to speak at this
premeeting, which will be attended by a significant proportion of main meeting speakers. Three of the
best pre-meeting talks will be awarded ECS speaking slots in the main meeting. In addition, we have
already confirmed an additional seven Assistant Professors (six female and/or URM) to speak at the
main venue. Moreover, we outline a strategy to ultimately achieve a 50:50 ratio in female and male
speakers, including at least 20% URM and 40% early career scientists. Funding is sought to provide
registration and travel awards for the 15 pre-meeting speakers, the four members of the DITC and 6
ECSs speaking at the meeting. At least 30 poster presenters will be selected to showcase their work
on the main stage in form of 2-min lightning talks. Thus over 65% of attendees will have the
opportunity to present their research in front of the entire audience. Round table discussions and panel
sessions over lunch will enable early career scientists to discuss topics like careers, inclusion of
underrepresented scientists, effective grant writing, etc. with experts in the field."

This project aims to understand in molecular detail how fluid shear stress acting on endothelial
cells triggers mechanical activation of signaling pathways at cell-cell junctions. Published data
show that shear stress activates a PECAM1-dependent signaling pathway, Notch signaling and
Alk1-Endoglin-Smad1/5 signaling, all of which occur at and depend on cell-cell contacts. These
pathways play major roles in vascular embryonic development, postnatal physiology and adult
disease. However, much remains to be learned about molecular mechanisms. The proposed
work is based on two recent advances in our labs. First, we have recently identified latrophilins
(LPHNs, also known as ADGRLs), members of the adhesion G protein coupled receptors
family, as key upstream mediators of shear activation of all three of these pathways. Second,
we have developed a new nanodevice that utilizes DNA origami to apply defined mechanical
tension to proteins. Aim 1 will investigate (1) the molecular mechanisms by which LPHNs
mediate the effects of shear stress on junctional signaling and (2) determine the role of LPHN2
in vascular development and function in vivo by doing endothelial-specific knockout in mice.
Aim 2 will use the DNA origami device to apply defined tension to PECAM1 and visualize
protein conformation change via cryoEM. These experiments will allow us to determine the
effect of applied force on PECAM’s structural transitions. Together, the project will provide new
understanding at unprecedented depth concerning how endothelial cell-cell junctional proteins
respond to mechanical force generated by shear stress.

11003420,"Identifying molecules with similar shape and characteristics to known ligands has proven useful in several
areas of drug discovery and development, from ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) to scaffold-hopping. The
underlying assumption is that compounds that occupy a similar volume with similar chemical groups will have
similar activity at the target protein, due to formation of similar protein-ligand interactions. However, in the
aqueous in vivo environment, protein-water-ligand interactions are equally important with water bridges, water
networks, and water displacement playing a critical role in the binding of many compounds. To our knowledge,
no 3D ligand matching methods explicitly account for these important waters as potential ligand space, which
leads to false negatives during shape matching, as molecules that appear dissimilar in vacuo may in fact
behave similarly in the binding pocket once water is accounted for. We aim to change that by creating the first
program that considers these water molecules when comparing ligands in 3D, factoring them in when scoring
similarity. To do so, we will adapt our previously developed algorithm (WATGEN) for the prediction of water
positions in the unbound (“empty”) protein and the protein ligand complex, as well as a calculation of ligand-
driven water displacement in protein−ligand complexes. To extend this work, waters relevant to shape
matching will be identified using a combination of machine learning (ML) and empirical algorithms, which are
based on the 9,000+ solvated structures in our previous study, each with corresponding displacement
calculations. This step will calculate the “replaceability” and “displaceability” of WATGEN predicted waters,
indicating how they should be represented for shape matching physically and chemically. We will then write
code to automatically create “hybrid” ligands through addition (or removal) of atoms based on solvation
representation determined above. Finally, we will validate our new solvation 3D shape matching methodology
by comparing the new methodology to current waterless methodology in two settings that rely on ligand-based
similarity scoring: 1) Evolution of a first-generation sulfonylurea (tolbutamide) to more advanced drugs like
glyburide using our AI-driven Drug Design platform, and 2) LBVS using unmodified and solvation-informed
tolbutamide as reference structures for screening the WuXi GalaXi “off-the-shelf” virtual library. The most
similar compounds to each reference will be purchased and assayed for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
activity. We predict that for each of these experiments, the new methodology will outperform our current
waterless methodology. These features will be integrated into our existing shape matching algorithm within the
ADMET Predictor platform, which is freely available to academic researchers, leading to improvements in drug
discovery and optimization."

Mental health conditions are highly prevalent in the autism population but, due in part to the complexity of
assessment, often go undetected and therefore unaddressed. Available tools are insufficient, as many were
developed for use with the general population, do not include both youth and caregiver report versions, or are
limited to the assessment of a single construct. Given the absence of an effective assessment measure,
evaluating mental health conditions in autism is time-intensive and often requires a high level of training and
expertise. The proposed study aims to remedy this deficiency by: (1) evaluating the psychometric properties of
the K-CAT® with youth on the autism spectrum; and (2) identifying and addressing areas in need of
modification to develop a reliable, valid, and acceptable K-CAT® Autism Version. The proposed study consists
of two phases. In the first phase, we will examine the differential item functioning, convergent validity, and
acceptability of the existing K-CAT® for use with autistic children and adolescents. In the second phase, we will
modify the existing K-CAT® to develop and validate the K-CAT® Autism Version. To accomplish this, in Phase
I, we will recruit 150 youth/caregiver dyads to complete the existing K-CAT® as well as three additional
measures for psychometric evaluation. We will use mixed methods to examine acceptability and identify areas
in need of modification with a subsample of youth, caregivers, and autism clinicians. In Phase II, we will modify
the K-CAT® with input from youth, caregivers, and clinicians and recruit 350 youth/caregiver dyads from clinical
sites across the US (see letters confirming participation) to complete the K-CAT® Autism Version and an
accompanying assessment battery for validation. Eligible youth must be 7-17 years old, English speaking,
have a documented diagnosis of autism and an IQ over 70. The assessment battery will include the parent and
child K-CAT® Autism Version and the parent and child KSADS-COMP as well as several additional measures
included in previous psychometric analyses of the existing K-CAT®. Results of the validation assessment
battery will be reviewed, and diagnoses confirmed by licensed clinicians with expertise in autism blind to
K-CAT® Autism Version scores. These assessments will be used to examine the psychometric properties of
the K-CAT® Autism Version in evaluating underlying co-occurring diagnoses assessed (i.e., major depressive
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,
conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder). The newly developed, reliable, valid, feasible and
acceptable K-CAT® Autism Version will significantly improve the identification of mental health symptoms in
autistic youth, facilitating earlier receipt of evidence-based services and potentially preventing the adverse
outcomes associated with untreated mental health needs in this population."

There have been numerous outbreaks of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among people who use drugs (PWUD)
since the well-publicized outbreak in Scott County, Indiana in 2015. In addition to HIV infections, hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infections, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and infective endocarditis
(IE) commonly occur among PWUD, along with fatal and non-fatal overdoses (ODs). Furthermore, for the past decade
rates of syphilis have risen dramatically among PWUD, both among injectors and non-injectors, creating additional risk
for HIV transmission through sexual contact. This has created a “converging public health crisis” that threatens the
success of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in the United States (US). No single prevention or containment
approach is going to end the HIV epidemic among PWUD. We require an integrated set of strategies that address
outbreaks at different stages of their life cycle. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a portfolio of novel methods
that will permit decision makers to predict and detect new outbreaks and get patients diagnosed with greater speed,
accuracy, and efficiency. In short, we aim to intervene at three critical stages in outbreak emergence: 1) Prediction: we
will build on our prior work to develop and evaluate modeling and pattern-recognition frameworks that permit the earliest
and most reliable forecasts possible of jurisdictions at high risk of incipient outbreaks; 2) Detection: we will develop
novel algorithms to minimize the time it takes to detect new outbreaks once they have begun; and finally; 3) Diagnosis:
we will expand upon our previous work to optimize sampling and search algorithms to diagnose previously undiagnosed
cases through community-based active case finding. The proposed studies will provide a novel framework for addressing
outbreaks of infectious diseases, from potential threat, to emerging outbreak, to endemic persistence, offering
methodological innovations alongside the development of practical decision support tools for health departments around
the country in addressing the most serious infectious complications of substance use. These tools will be designed to make
it easier to pinpoint locales at risk of outbreaks among PWUD, more quickly identify them when they do occur, and find
patients in need of care more efficiently as public health officials seek to manage these outbreaks. However, while these
tools will be designed for HIV infection, particularly in the context of drug use, they are pathogen- and population-
agnostic and can be used in the context of active surveillance for other infectious diseases and among other demographic
groups."
11006223,"The goal of this work is to develop a catheter end cap with an antimicrobial luminal insert to reduce risk of blood
stream infections (BSI) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The Gatekeeper™ antimicrobial barrier cap (GCAP) acts
as a barrier and delivery device to kill infection-causing microorganisms inside hemodialysis (HD) catheter hubs.
Infections are the second leading cause of hospitalization and death in HD patients with 70% of all BSI due to
catheter use.1,2 Catheter related BSI necessitate catheter locking with high dose antibiotics, removal and
replacement of the catheter at a new site, or exchange of the catheter for a new one which preserves the venous
site but with increased risk of infection recurrence.3 Replacement of long-term catheters is a major problem with
high morbidity, high costs and risk for vein damage in patients where it is critical to preserve insertion sites.
GCAP can reduce infections, excessive antibiotic use, and the need for catheter replacement.
The proposed cap is a short (5 cm) guidewire that extends from the end cap and is inserted in the catheter
extension line upon cap placement on the hub. This guidewire is loaded with a novel antimicrobial peptide called
ASP-2 that has broad spectrum efficacy against infection causing microbes and their associated biofilms. When
screwed into place, the peptide is released into the lock solution eliminating microbes and preventing catheter
biofilms from accumulating. Standard practice dictates replacement of caps with each hemodialysis session,
typically once every three days. The caps replenish ASP-2 with each access event to provide protection over
the catheter lifetime, overcoming the limited activity duration of antimicrobial coated catheters.4
This Phase I project builds on strong existing data establishing the safety and broad-spectrum activity of ASP-2,
including its capacity to eradicate biofilms on device surfaces and under conditions relevant to vascular access.
The objectives are to (1) develop the coating composition and process to apply ASP-2 to end caps, (2)
manufacture and characterize prototypes, including ASP-2 delivery and stability to sterilization, (3) demonstrate
efficacy in a challenging ex vivo hemodialysis model, and (4) verify end caps meet minimal safety requirements
by measuring particulate development, metal ion leaching, and the strength of the wire to cap bond.
The proposed caps are expected to provide a safe and simple solution that does not require additional steps or
nursing time to reduce infection risks. There is a large and growing market for infection control consumables in
the setting of dialysis and vascular access. GCAP has substantial commercial potential and will benefit multiple
stakeholders including patients, hemodialysis centers, hospitals, and insurers."

The goal of this Phase I project is to demonstrate feasibility of an equitable, rapid antibiotic susceptibility test
(AST) for urinary tract infections (UTIs) to be used in resource-limited and outpatient settings. UTIs impact over
13 million patients in the U.S. and 400 million worldwide each year. Women as well as individuals from low
socioeconomic backgrounds are disproportionately impacted by UTIs. Using currently available tools, healthcare
providers either delay prescription by up to 3 days while they wait for laboratory results to guide treatment or
prescribe antibiotics prior to obtaining laboratory results. Either approach delays customized therapy, often
prolonging pain, increasing the risk of serious complications and life-threatening urosepsis, and driving up
healthcare costs. To minimize the risk of resistance to uninformed treatment, providers can prescribe overly
aggressive treatment. However, this can lead to long-term side effects and exacerbates the antimicrobial
resistance crisis. Condensing the days-long diagnostic turnaround time has the potential to improve patient
outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and promote antimicrobial stewardship. Although rapid AST technologies
exist, such instruments are rarely used for UTI diagnostics and are not widely available in outpatient or resource-
limited clinical settings. There is an unmet need for a rapid test that can guide antibiotic treatment in all settings
where UTIs are treated. Latde Diagnostics, a women-owned small business, is developing the Metabolic Amino
Acid Phenotyping (MAAP) test kit to provide susceptibility profiles for UTIs in <2 hours and make rapid ASTs
accessible to resource-limited and outpatient clinical settings in the U.S. and low and middle income countries
(LMICs). The MAAP assay couples metabolic labeling of bacterial cell wall with immunodetection and is based
on user needs identified through >220 customer interviews. MAAP’s bacterial cell wall building block analog
mimics a molecule conserved across UTI-causing bacteria, and is incorporated into the surface of actively-
growing bacteria in minutes, yielding a rapid phenotypic tool. Immunodetection allows seamless integration into
clinical workflows without the need for costly, specialized instrumentation through the use of lateral flow assay
(LFA). Latde has shown that the MAAP assay detects growth in leading UTI causative agent, Escherichia coli,
including clinical isolates from UTI samples. To validate the clinical utility and technical feasibility of the MAAP
assay, using a breadth of E. coli strains implicated in UTIs, Latde will 1) demonstrate feasibility of LFA readout
within clinically-relevant turnaround time and bacterial titer; and 2) eliminate repeated wash steps from the assay.
In future Phase II, Latde will assemble components generated in Phase I into a single prototype, which will then
be optimized and modified to meet Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Ultimately,
Latde aims to develop the MAAP kit for rapid, drug susceptibility profiling to direct effective, judicious antibiotic
treatment for UTIs across socioeconomic strata."

 Vasculonics is developing a disease modifying compound, VN-1032, to reduce progressive
vasculopathy of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a debilitating disease with a 2.8-year average
survival and an average 5-year survival rate in 60% of patients receiving therapy. The current vasodilator
therapies only reduce symptoms of the disease and do not impact disease progression. Preclinical research at
Vasculonics has identified a novel drug-able molecule that selectively reduced Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor
(AhR) activation and the vascular toxin asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Both AhR and ADMA play
important role in the pathogenesis of PAH. Persistent activation of AhR and increased ADMA occur in PAH
patients and preclinical models. Drugs such as Qing-Dai and dexfenfluramine which cause PAH in humans are
activators of AhR pathway. These drugs recapitulated human like disease in animal models of PAH whereas
the AhR gene deficient (AhR-/-) animals are protected from Qing Dai or dexfenfluramine. Based on multiple
clinical and preclinical studies, AhR and ADMA have been recognized as important targets of therapy.
However, drugs targeted to the mechanisms of AhR and ADMA in PAH are not available.
 Vasculonics has developed a novel chemical series that modulated AhR and ADMA. Innovative
medicinal chemistry and lead optimization studies have produced VN-1032 as a lead molecule. In feasibility
studies, VN-1032 inhibited the mechanisms involved in PAH including, inhibition of pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cell proliferation, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. In vivo studies, VN-1032 produced robust
efficacy in the Sugen-Hypoxia model of PAH progression. Thus, VN-1032 is a highly promising orally active
disease modifying drug candidate for PAH. Our overarching goal now is to advance VN-1032 to IND
enabling safety studies and IND filing. The goal of the SBIR phase 2 is to obtain critical preclinical safety
and efficacy data to move VN-1032 to IND-enabling studies. In Aim 1, we will complete non-GLP safety
assessment of VN-1032 by first testing it in dose escalation toxicology in rats and dogs followed by one week
repeat dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs. In Aim 2, we will characterize a second compound to de-risk
the technical strategy in Aim 1. Toxicity is the highest cause of drug failure in development. A readily available
backup compound is critical for technical and commercial success of the program. In Aim 3, a dose-dependent
efficacy study in a server disease model of PAH will be conducted. The dose response efficacy study will
provide the “minimum efficacious dose, margin of safety and dose estimation” for the clinical studies. The 12-
week duration efficacy study will demonstrate the efficacy in severe disease. The results of the safety and
efficacy studies will advance VN-1032 to late stage GLP safety and GMP manufacturing for IND filing.
Vasculonics has assembled a highly experienced drug development team to achieve the aims of this proposal
and the subsequent IND-enabling and clinical studies. Our disease modifying novel therapy is expected to
have a major impact on the survival and quality of life of PAH patients."

There is an urgent need to address pediatric sleep health disparities in early childhood, as sleep deficiencies
disproportionately affect racially/ethnically minoritized children and negatively impact crucial neurobehavioral
and social-emotional development. Two common early childhood sleep deficiencies linked to adverse
outcomes are (1) sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which ranges from snoring to severe obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA), and (2) insufficient sleep, or sleeping less than age-based 24-hour sleep guidelines. Compared
to non-Latinx White (hereafter ‘White’) youth, non-Latinx Black/African American (‘Black’) youth are 4-6 times
more likely to experience SDB and are also more likely to experience short sleep duration. SDB and
insufficient sleep also often co-occur in young children. The mechanisms of racial disparities in co-occurring
SDB and insufficient sleep and their developmental impacts are poorly understood, which impedes effective
intervention. The long-term goal of this research is to develop multi-level interventions that leverage modifiable
socio-ecological factors to reduce the incidence and developmental consequences of common, co-occurring
racial sleep health disparities in preschoolers. To achieve this goal, there is a critical need to identify the
factors that contribute to or buffer against these disparities and their developmental impacts. Although
socioeconomic disparities in SDB and insufficient sleep are well documented, family factors including caregiver
stress, health literacy, and work schedules are rarely considered. Few studies have examined other modifiable
family factors, such as bedtime routines, bedtime electronics, and parenting practices, which may contribute to
or buffer against disparities in these sleep deficiencies and related outcomes. Furthermore, ongoing personally
mediated and structural racism faced by Black families, teachers’ racial bias, childcare quality, and
neighborhood characteristics are likely, but understudied, contributors to these disparities. To address these
gaps and inform effective interventions, the objectives of this work are to (1) examine racial disparities in the
neurobehavioral and social-emotional impacts of early childhood SDB and/or insufficient sleep and (2) identify
proximal and distal socio-ecological factors linked to these racial disparities in sleep-related outcomes. Black
and White 3-5-year-olds will be recruited with (A) SDB only, (B) insufficient sleep only, (C) SDB and insufficient
sleep, and (D) matched healthy controls to examine the following aims, using a multi-method, multi-informant
approach with caregiver and teacher reporters, observational tasks, and qualitative methods. Aim 1 will
compare neurobehavioral (executive functioning, attention, vigilance) and social-emotional functioning (social
skills, emotion regulation) in groups A, B, C, and D. Aim 2 will identify modifiable family factors that contribute

11009712,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Smoking cessation is difficult, despite the demonstrated efficacy of several pharmacotherapeutic agents and
cognitive behavioral therapies. This may be due to imbalanced neuronal circuits, including elevated functional
connectivity in the drive-reward circuit (medial orbital frontal cortex [mOFC] to nucleus accumbens [NAc]) and
decreased functional connectivity in the executive control circuit (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex[ DLPFC] to
NAc). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new class of therapeutics that has already
displayed remarkable potential for producing novel, non-pharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric
disorders. Previous studies have reported that rTMS decreased cue craving, reduced cigarette consumption,
and increased smoking quit rate in tobacco use disorders(TUDs). However, the treatment parameters and
exact mechanism for rTMS increasing smoking quit rate need further refinement. The goal of this UG3/UH3
application is to develop a circuit-based precision rTMS therapy for smoking cessation further. In the 2-year
UG3 phase, we will recruit 45 TUDs. Participants will undergo a baseline cue-exposure fMRI and a resisting-to
smoke fMRI session. Participants will be randomized into three groups: 1) Sham rTMS over the left mOFC or
the left DLPFC. 2) Active, inhibitory low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) over the left mOFC (1 Hz, 900 pulses, E-
field modeling, 15 minutes, smoking cue exposure fMRI-guided target). Or 3) Active, high-frequency rTMS (HF-
rTMS) over the left DLPFC (10 Hz, 3000 pulses, E-field modeling,15 minutes, resisting-to-smoke fMRI guided
target). Fifteen sessions of rTMS will be completed over three weeks, after which we will acquire fMRI scans.
Go/No-Go: To move on the UH3 phase, the UG3 must demonstrate (1) daily 1-Hz TMS over the left mOFC
shows a different clinical effect in the reduction of cigarette consumption by 3 or more cigarette per day,
compared to daily 10-Hz over the left DLPFC (2) compared to sham, one of the active site/frequency
combinations shows relative clinical improvement (reduces cigarette consumption by 5 cigarettes per day) and
significant brain connectivity changes (p < 0.05) (decreases the connection between NAc and mOFC, and
increases the connection between DLPFC and NAc). In the 3-year UH3 phase, we will test the therapeutic
effects of 4 weeks of active rTMS (1 Hz rTMS over the left mOFC or 10 Hz over the left DLPFC by the UG3
phase) vs sham rTMS in 64 TUDs and follow participant outcomes for 4 months post-treatment. We will also
test the imbalanced function of drive-reward and executive control before and after 4 weeks of treatments to
compare the imbalanced function between groups."

This supplement application is for the purchase of a 3-color Optos ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning
laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). The Optos SLO is the current state of the art for wide angle retinal
imaging and is widely used. Numerous studies have shown the advantages of UWF imaging for
diagnosis of retinal diseases. The previous generation Optos only used a red and green laser to
image the retina causing poor color representation and introducing unique artifacts. These limitations
have been overcome by the introduction of the red, green, blue (RGB) 3-color laser UWF Optos. We
have evaluated this instrument in the Jacobs Retina Center and in our department. The new RGB 3-
SLO color instrument provides images closer to the true color of the retina. In our comparative study
we imaged 75 eyes of 45 patients with four different instruments (Topcon fundus camera, RGB 3-
color Optos, RG 2-color Optos and the multicolor Spectralis OCT). We cropped the images to
identical field-of-view to avoid any image shape bias and in a masked study compared each of the
three SLO devices to the gold standard color fundus camera in the ability to make a clinical diagnosis.
We found that the RGB 3-color Optos is superior to the conventional RG 2-color Optos and the
multicolor Spectralis. We wish to purchase the RGB 3-color UWF Optos to permit our AI retina
research to continue with the state-of-the-art instrument. Note that our studies are already covered by
the IRB as we have a retina registry which permits use of de-identified images and in addition all
patients sign consent for ophthalmic examination and imaging when checking in to UCSD
Ophthalmology."

Chronic pain is a prognostic marker of illness and imposes a substantial burden on the healthcare system,
affecting approximately 20-30% of US adults. Sleep problems commonly co-occur with chronic pain, yet little is
known of how sleep impacts chronic pain. Social engagement and inflammation have relationships with both
sleep and chronic pain, but no study has examined these behavioral and biological mechanisms underlying the
impact of sleep on chronic pain. This R01 initiates a multi-cohort study to examine the extent to which the impact
of sleep on chronic pain is mediated by social lifestyles and inflammation. In this study, we take a sleep health
perspective to capture multiple sleep characteristics critical to chronic pain (regularity, satisfaction, alertness,
timing, efficiency, and duration). Based on multiple sleep variables captured by self-report, actigraphy, and/or
polysomnography, we will identify “sleep health profiles” (the composite number of sleep problems or latent
groups with similar sleep characteristics across multiple dimensions) and link them to chronic pain outcomes.
Our sleep profile approach has advantages because it can consider multiple sleep problems that may co-occur
within individuals, and may differentially impact pain outcomes. Leveraging three NIH-funded projects (Midlife
in the United States Study-MIDUS, Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men-MrOS, and Multicenter
Osteoarthritis Study-MOST), we examine multiple common chronic pain conditions prevalent in adult populations
(any chronic pain, back pain, and knee pain) and their multiple manifestations (frequency, severity, and
sensitization). This can help determine whether the associations between sleep health profiles and chronic pain
emerge across different pain conditions. Aim 1 will examine the longitudinal impact of sleep health profiles on
subsequent changes in pain for three separate pain outcomes. We hypothesize that poor sleep health profiles
are associated with: [MIDUS] new onset of any chronic pain and/or an increase in pain interference among
midlife and older adults; [MrOS] new onset of back pain and/or increases in the frequency and severity of back
pain among older men; [MOST] increases in knee pain severity and clinical sensitization among older
men/women with the risk of osteoarthritis over time. Aim 2 will examine behavioral and biological mechanisms
underlying the impact of sleep health profiles on changes in pain. We hypothesize that poor sleep health profiles
are associated with more chronic pain over time mediated by lower diversity in social activities (i.e., a less active
social life) or by a higher risk of systemic inflammation. Aim 3 will examine independent and joint effects of
behavioral and biological mechanisms underlying the impact of sleep health profiles on changes in pain. Our
multi-cohort approach also allows us to detect potential social disparities in sleep and chronic pain by aggregating
relevant racial and sex sub-groups across cohorts. This project will inform future behavioral interventions (e.g.,
sleep health intervention) to improve chronic pain in adults by identifying specific sleep characteristics, and key
behavioral and biological mechanisms linking sleep health and chronic pain."
10986182,"Current understanding of how and why race influences the transition from acute to chronic pain following
traumatic injury remains limited. Traumatic injuries result in over 30 million emergency department visits and 2.5
million hospitalizations each year in the U.S. Risk for developing post-injury chronic pain is significantly greater
for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients with similar injuries.
Although NHB patients experience higher levels of acute post-injury pain and are more likely to transition to
chronic pain than NHW patients, the biobehavioral and social factors that influence this transition are not well
understood. The overall aim of this proposal is to improve understanding of the factors that influence racial
disparities in the transition to post-injury pain. In order to address our aims, will recruit 150 NHB and 150 NHW
adult traumatic injury patients from a level 1 trauma center and assess pain outcomes during hospitalization
(acute pain intensity) and across monthly follow-ups (pain intensity, pain-related interference, chronic pain
status). First, we will evaluate the extent to which NHBs exhibit worse post-injury pain outcomes as compared
to NHWs. We hypothesize that NHBs will exhibit higher in-hospital pain intensity, higher rates of chronic pain
conditions over 6-month follow-up, and greater pain intensity/interference across monthly assessments. Next,
we will determine the extent to which biobehavioral factors explain racial differences in post-injury pain. We
hypothesize that higher odds of chronic pain and greater pain intensity/interference over time in NHB relative to
NHW patients will be accounted for by the indirect effects of greater pain sensitivity (assessed in hospital via
quantitative sensory testing), higher inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, TNFα, IL1β, IL-6), more negative
cognitions (pain catastrophizing, expectations regarding pain/treatment), and higher depressive/posttraumatic
stress symptoms in NHB patients. Finally, we will determine the extent to which racial differences in post-injury
pain depend on social factors. We hypothesize that greater life and neighborhood stress and lower
socioeconomic status and social support will be associated with higher odds of chronic pain and greater pain
intensity/interference over time in NHB relative to NHW patients. Together, these aims will test key elements of
an innovative integration of the diathesis-stress model of chronic pain and minority stress theory. The
investigators assembled for this multidisciplinary team possess complementary skill sets in traumatic injury,
chronic pain, quantitative sensory testing, inflammation, pain-relevant biobehavioral and social factors, and racial
disparities in chronic pain. The comprehensive assessment of mediators and moderators across multiple levels
of the biopsychosocial model will advance our understanding of the pathways that contribute to racial differences
in post-injury pain. This knowledge could spur the development of cost-effective, scalable screens for hospital
settings to redress racial disparities in pain. In addition, understanding how place impacts pain could inform
policy-based initiatives to improve post-discharge health for underserved and at-risk communities."
10986599,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant advances in cancer care, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the third leading
cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year survival rate of ~10%. Obesity and high fat diet (HFD)
consumption increase PDAC risk in human cohorts and accelerate PDAC progression in mice, but the
mechanistic basis for these relationships is not well understood. Given the rapid rise in both the worldwide
prevalence of obesity and consumption of dietary fat, deciphering mechanisms of obesity-driven PDAC could
broadly impact human health. The translational relevance of prior diet research, however, has been limited by
uncontrolled variations in fat source and intake across human populations and mouse experiments. Therefore,
whether and how specific dietary fats promote pancreatic tumorigenesis remain critical unanswered questions
of great societal importance. Leveraging a unique isocaloric panel of HFDs differing only in fat source, we
identified a correlation between consumption of diets high in oleic acid – a monounsaturated fatty acid typically
associated with good health – and enhanced tumor development in a genetic model of PDAC that faithfully
mimics the genetic and histologic progression of the human disease. We further observed that tumorigenesis
correlated with increased incorporation of oleic acid into specific phospholipids in tissues, including the pancreas.
In the parent R01 proposal, we aim to test the hypothesis that excess dietary oleic acid directly incorporates into
cellular lipids in the pancreas to drive PDAC development. Specifically, we seek to: 1) to establish whether
excess oleic acid is necessary and sufficient to promote pancreatic tumorigenesis; 2) to clarify the relationship
between dietary fatty acids and pancreatic lipid composition; and 3) to decipher the mechanisms by which dietary
oleic acid is directly taken up by the pancreas. Based on preliminary studies from the parent R01, we focus this
supplement on determining the downstream mechanisms by which dietary fatty acids alter cellular metabolism
to promote tumor formation in the pancreas. We aim: 1) to investigate how dietary modulation of pancreatic
phospholipid species perturbs lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis sensitivity in early pancreatic tumorigenesis; and
2) to determine whether excess dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress pancreatic tumor progression. The
supplement will support a promising associate research scientist, enabling him to pursue these aims, acquire
additional mentorship and training in cancer biology, mouse models, lipidomics, data analysis (including
computational methods), and manuscript and grant writing. These experiences will allow him to acquire the skills
and knowledge he needs to develop an independent research career. Together, these studies will link fatty acid
consumption to specific changes in pancreatic cell metabolism as driving forces in PDAC progression. Results
from this work have transformative potential to identify novel targeted dietary and pharmacologic strategies for
the prevention of a largely incurable cancer."

10984771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stimulant use disorder (STUD) and overdose fatalities are devastating public health problems, straining
healthcare and criminal justice systems, and societal productivity. Annually, approximately 55% of stimulant
prescriptions have been prescribed to adults, with nearly one-third of them reporting stimulant misuse or
stimulant-related harm. Despite growing concern that stimulant medications may increase the risk of STUD
and overdose in some adults, risk factors for stimulant-related harm have not been well understood, and no
screening tool is available for assessing the risk/benefit of stimulant therapy at the point of care. This project
hypothesizes that machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to large clinical (Aim 1) and linked census (Aim 2)
datasets, can help identify personalized risk factors for STUD and overdose among adults treated with
stimulants, and assist with the development of clinical decision support system (CDSS) tool (Aim 3), which, in
turn, can help guide clinical decision making when considering stimulant therapy and decrease stimulant-
related risk of harm. To evaluate potential demographic and clinical risk factors for STUD and overdose,
retrospective longitudinal ML-based analysis of electronic health records (EHR) from the TriNetX research
network will be conducted (Aim 1). Because EHRs do not include characteristics of neighborhoods where
patients reside, and social determinants of health (SDOH) can contribute to STUD and overdose risk, the
predictive model from Aim 1 will be further enhanced by geocoding and linking the local health system’s EHR
to the census block group level neighborhood data for each patient to account for the potential impact of SDOH
and enhance the accuracy of the STUD and overdose risk modeling (Aim 2). Risk factors identified through
Aim 1 and Aim 2 analysis, along with prescribing-clinician input, will enable the development of a CDSS tool to
aid clinicians with risk/benefit assessment of stimulant therapy at the point-of-care, based on unique
demographic, clinical and neighborhood characteristics of each patient (Aim 3). The CDSS has been
increasingly utilized in digitally-driven healthcare to improve treatment safety and outcomes, but their
applications toward improving care for adults treated with stimulants or to mitigate addiction and overdose risks
have been lagging. The proposed research leveraging big data and ML has enormous potential for
understanding and predicting health risks of stimulant therapy in a personalized way, and will lay foundation for
future clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of CDSS-based intervention on reducing the risk, and, ultimately,
improving health of adults considered for stimulant treatment. This mentored research scientist development
award (K01) will also enable the PI to pursue additional advanced training in relevant clinical knowledge,
analytical skills, grantsmanship, leadership, and diversity, equity, and inclusiveness to support his long-term
goal of becoming an independent scientist contributing to the mission of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse to reduce the burden of substance use and addiction, particularly when it involves stimulants."
10986820,"Project Summary. Skeletal muscle mass and function are key determinants of an individual’s healthspan and
are tightly correlated with both physical and metabolic health. In cancer survivors, the loss of muscle mass that
occurs following cancer, termed cancer cachexia, is a major contributor to mortality, as well as reduced quality
of life during and after the disease. Unfortunately, one of the most extensively used treatments for cancer
patients, chemotherapy, is almost as bad as the cancer itself due the negative effects that chemotherapy has
on healthy cells. Chemotherapy treatments such as cisplatin, induce DNA damage, thereby compounding an
already deleterious process in healthy tissues and cells. Severe or unrepaired DNA-damage causes cell death
and tissue atrophy, in addition to being a major inducer of cellular senescence. Recent work by our lab has
linked an accumulation of senescent cells as a novel contributing factor to cisplatin-mediated loss of muscle
mass and function. In response to cisplatin, there is an accumulation of senescent cells in muscle, which is
correlated to a reduction in muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Considering senescent cells have been linked to
sarcopenia, removal of these senescent cells using senescent cell killing compounds, senolytics, could help
slow muscle loss during cisplatin treatment. Exercise training is the most effective way to increase skeletal
muscle mass, in addition to improving physical function and whole-body metabolism. Following chemotherapy
treatment, the response to exercise is attenuated (termed anabolic resistance), and individuals treated with
chemotherapy following surgery have a blunted response to exercise compared with surgery alone. Given that
elimination of senescent cells augments muscle growth and regeneration in old mice, senolytics could serve as
a novel therapeutic intervention to not only delay cisplatin-induced atrophy but also improve the response to
exercise training. Our central hypothesis is that cisplatin-treated mice receiving senolytics will experience less
atrophy and an augmented response to exercise when compared to controls. We will utilize the plant-based
flavonoids, fisetin and quercetin (F+Q), as our senolytic cocktail. In addition to their excellent senolytics
properties, F+Q exert many other beneficial effects, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and promoting
mitochondrial biogenesis. To address our hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) delete senescent
cells in mice treated with F+Q to determine if cellular senescence mediates cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy,
2) examine senescent cells as contributors to anabolic resistance following progressive weighted wheel
running, and 3) characterize the cellular landscape and identify the molecular signature of muscle senescent
cells. We will utilize an age-appropriate mouse model to identify the therapeutic potential of senescent cells to
slow both the physical and metabolic aspects of chemotherapy-induced cachexia and anabolic resistance. If
our hypothesis is correct, the results from our proposed studies could influence the treatment of cachexia and
associated metabolic derangement, thereby creating new interventions and therapeutic strategies."

The Center for Gene Therapy at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute of Nationwide Children’s
Hospital (NCH) hosts a robust and active research community in the muscular dystrophies, with
extensive expertise in unraveling disease pathogenesis and developing new treatment paradigms
that can be translated from the bench to the bedside. We propose an MDSRC with Cores
designed to share this expertise with the Wellstone and broader muscular dystrophy research
communities, with Projects intended to address questions raised or left unanswered by current
therapies, such as microdystrophin gene therapy. Project 1 (PI, Paul Martin, PhD) seeks to utilize
a novel bicistronic AAV vector to both prevent muscle disease and simultaneously build new
muscle function in muscular dystrophy patients with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I).
Project 2 (PI, Kevin Flanigan, MD) will develop vectors containing U7 small nuclear RNAs
(U7snRNAs) reprogrammed with antisense sequences directed toward splice site or splice
enhance elements to restores highly functional dystrophin expression. Project 3 (PI, Nizar Saad,
PhD) seeks to identify novel circulating biomarkers through the investigation of circulating
extracellular vesicles (EVs) and to develop a new generations of gene therapy that increase
transduction efficiency, dystrophin expression, and reduce the development of humoral immunity
against AAV gene therapies. All three projects make use of the critical resource core, the
Muscular Dystrophy Cell and Serum Banking Core (Director, Nicolas Wein, PhD) by establishing
primary fibroblasts from patients with muscular dystrophies, a critical resource for early therapy
development, while collaborating with Penny Gilbert, PhD, at the University of Toronto, to develop
improved protocols leading to superior reagents for Center Projects. We have a longstanding
dedication to serving as a national training resource, as demonstrated by our Myology Course,
held annually since 2012, and our Training Core (Director, Scott Harper) will expand the number
of attendees and the range of topics covered in the Course, offer individualized career
development guidance to Wellstone Fellowship trainees, and develop new curricula of benefit to
the community. Our Administrative Core will implement a meaningful community outreach
program and develop a highly functional MDSRC website to provide access to the muscular
dystrophy community. Altogether, our longstanding efforts and the highly collaborative
multidisciplinary environment of our two institutions will be synergized by a MDSRC that leverages
existing structures and collaborations, and develops outward-facing resources of benefit to the
broader Wellstone and muscular dystrophy research communities."
10997026,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Central chemoreception is the mechanism by which the brain regulates breathing in response to changes in
blood CO2/H+. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is an important site for central respiratory chemoreception, and
there is evidence suggesting RTN chemoreception is hyper-active in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs)
and this contributes to unstable periodic breathing. This is significant because breathing abnormalities can lead
to enhanced sympathetic outflow, which further exacerbates the progression of hypertension. Despite this
significance, the cellular and molecular basis for disordered breathing in hypertension is unclear. My central
hypothesis is that over-activation of RTN chemoreception contributes to disordered breathing in hypertension,
and treatments that limit RTN chemoreception will improve cardiorespiratory function in SHRs. To test this, I will:
use a combination of electrophysiology and imaging approaches to characterize the CO2/H+ response of RTN
neurons, astrocytes, and arterioles in slices from SHRs and control rats (Aim 1) and determine whether key
elements of RTN chemoreception can be targeted to improve breathing and blood pressure in SHRs (Aim 2).
Important outcomes of this work include 1) determining the cellular and molecular basis of RTN dysfunction in
SHRs, 2) identifying candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of unstable breathing in hypertension, and
3) providing valuable training in the molecular, cellular, and whole-animal approaches which will poise me to
achieve my goal of becoming an independent investigator."
10997204,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM), which is diabetes that is first diagnosed and recognized during pregnancy, is a strong risk factor for
future development of type 2 diabetes. In the US, a two-step diagnostic process is used to diagnose GDM: a
screening test (step 1), followed by a diagnostic test (step 2), which is offered to the subset of women that fail
the screening test. Only those that fail the diagnostic test are diagnosed with GDM. According to recent
evidence, women that fail the screening test and have normal diagnostic test results have an intermediate level
of gestational glucose intolerance (GGI), which is also a risk factor for diabetes. There are vast racial/ethnic
disparities in diabetes, GDM, and GGI. It is unknown if future diabetes risk after GDM and GGI differs
according to racial/ethnic groups and disaggregated subgroups (among Asian and Hispanic subgroups). Social
determinants of health, which are environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, and age, are
key to addressing these disparities. Neighborhoods are considered a key social determinant. Economic
disadvantages tend to cluster at the neighborhood level to cause inequitable opportunities for health
improvement, adversely affecting communities of color. It is unknown if neighborhood deprivation affects risk of
future diabetes after GDM or GGI. There are interventions that exist to lower future diabetes risk after GDM
including screening, lifestyle, nutritional, and pharmaceutical interventions. However, there are barriers to
women accessing these interventions including lack of social support and lack of frequent interactions with
clinicians. Community midwifery, with its unique comprehensive perinatal care model, including up to six post-
partum visits, presents an opportunity to address these barriers among individuals with GDM. Currently, there
is no research assessing how community midwives support women with GDM to prevent future diabetes.
Thus, the main goal of my study is to identify opportunities to address racial/ethnic disparities in
diabetes after GDM and GGI. The specific aims are to: Aim 1) Ascertain risk of future diabetes after GDM and
GGI overall, and by racial/ethnic groups and disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups; Aim 2) Investigate
if risk of future diabetes after GDM and GGI is modified by levels of neighborhood level deprivation, overall,
and by racial/ethnic groups and disaggregated subgroups; and Aim 3) Assess how community midwifery care
supports individuals with GDM during the perinatal period to lower their future diabetes risk, especially among
historically minoritized racial/ethnic subgroups. Findings from this research may identify racial/ethnic groups
and subgroups at high risk for developing diabetes after GDM and GGI and inform culturally tailored, targeted,
neighborhood and clinical perinatal interventions to lower future diabetes risk."
11002127,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
 Human membrane cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 11B1 and 11B2 catalyze the final steps in cortisol
and aldosterone synthesis, respectively. Excess cortisol causes Cushing’s disease, leading to weight gain and
immune suppression (2), whereas excess aldosterone causes primary aldosteronism, leading to hypertension
(3). Treatment options for both disease states have been limited by poor drug selectivity, resulting from the high
sequence homology between CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, especially in their active sites. This proposal aims to
identify structural and functional differences between these enzymes that could be used to inform development
of selective drugs for Cushing’s disease and primary aldosteronism. One difference between the CYP11B
enzymes lies in their interaction with their shared redox partner, adrenodoxin. My preliminary data with CYP11B1
and previous Scott lab studies on CYP11B2 demonstrate that adrenodoxin allosterically modulates both CYP11B
enzymes, but with different impacts on each enzyme (9). This suggests potential differences in how adrenodoxin
binds the two CYP11B enzymes--differences that could be targeted to develop drugs that selectively block only
one enzyme. However, the basis for adrenodoxin’s allosteric effect has not been well-characterized. This
proposal seeks to fill this gap by structurally and functionally characterizing the adrenodoxin allosteric effect on
each CYP11B enzyme. First, an X-ray structure will define the residues forming the CYP11B1/adrenodoxin
interface for comparison with an existing structure of the CYP11B2/adrenodoxin complex. Second, pre steady--
state kinetics using stopped flow will determine whether adrenodoxin binding on the P450 surface changes the
P450 interactions with ligands in the distant buried active site by primarily altering ligand binding or release.
Finally, mutagenesis studies will investigate the effect of a specific loop hypothesized to be responsible for the
differences in the allosteric effect among human P450 enzymes. Overall, this study will provide a broad structural
and functional characterization of the adrenodoxin allosteric effect on CYP11B1 and CYP11B2. This detailed
characterization advances our understanding of the biochemical system but also has the potential to reveal
differences between the two enzymes useful in developing selective drug treatments for both Cushing’s disease
and primary aldosteronism."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), is still a public health concern. The main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is person to person
through respiratory droplets/aerosols. Recent studies, however, indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA can be
detected in the feces of infected individuals, even after respiratory symptoms have subsided. Wastewater based
Epidemiology (WBE) is a powerful and promising tool for community surveillance, but little information is
available on how to utilize this inexpensive early warning system for public health action and addressing
environmental health disparities. In addition, two vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are approved and are being
distributed now in the US. In light of this, the overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness of
vaccination among minority populations and develop and validate predictive models for forecasting COVID-19
using WBE. We will use our expertise in laboratory experiments, mathematical and artificial intelligence (AI)
modeling, molecular detection, and field surveys to address these specific aims.
Aim 1. To determine if SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens concentration in wastewater correlates with
COVID-19 community transmission in high-risk areas.
Aim 2. To develop and validate predictive models for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence based on detection in
wastewater.
Aim 2. To foster community engagement in COVID-19 research and dissemination of research findings through
WBE."

Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are a health burden for approximately seven percent of the
population of Western nations. Our preliminary data suggest variations in ethnic identity and/or geography
influence discrimination experiences and inflammatory response trends. This study investigates how
geography, ethnicity, and a laboratory manipulation of discrimination experiences affect immune cell
function and genomic regulation. Flow cytometry and immune cell challenges will test monocytes from
peripheral blood, and next-generation transcriptomics will assess genomic and epigenetic mechanisms.
We will test the hypothesis that geography, self-identified race, and ethnicity, interacting with
discrimination conditions, significantly affect immune cell function through genomic and
epigenetic mechanisms, with perceived discrimination as a moderating factor in immune cell
outcomes. The transdisciplinary nature of the proposed study will incorporate cutting edge behavioral,
epigenetic, and genomic techniques that can serve as a guide for other researchers interested uncovering
biopsychosocial mechanisms leading to poor health across diverse populations. The valuable insights on
differential susceptibility to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases that will be uncovered in this project
can inform feasible interventions for these diseases in different population groups."

More than half of patients treated with commonly used platinum- and taxane-based anti-cancer agents suffer
painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients have a greater
risk (risk ratio=1.6-2.4) of experiencing clinically relevant CIPN and consequent chemotherapy dose reductions
compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Despite the greater risk of painful CIPN in NHB cancer patients,
clinical trials in patients suffering with CIPN have historically included homogeneous patient populations of
NHWs. Only duloxetine is approved to treat painful CIPN and is not effective for or tolerated by all patients.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the motor cortex is emerging as a promising, safe, and effective
intervention for the pain of neuropathy. An additional benefit of tDCS is that it can be administered at home and
supervised remotely, minimizing stressful visits to a hospital venue for treatment. A recent randomized
experimental study in healthy individuals completed by the PI showed that one 20-minute session of motor cortex
tDCS reduced capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. To understand the mechanism of pain ameliorating effects of
motor cortex tDCS, the PI found enhanced neurophysiological responses of the descending pain modulatory
network (DPMN), a group of brain structures activated in response to painful stimuli, after active compared to
sham stimulation. Previous investigations have observed differences in opioid receptor binding and pain
responses in the DPMN (notably the cingulate cortex and ventral striatum) between healthy NHBs and NHWs
as well as differences in pain sensitivity. Likely relevant to the mechanism of CIPN, PET scanning of
chemotherapy patients reveals neuroinflammation throughout the brain. The facts that 1) NHB individuals
experience a greater rate of CIPN, but have not been represented in relevant clinical studies, 2) non-invasive
tDCS is emerging as a safe and effective treatment for neuropathic pain and can be implemented in the home
3) the DPMN is implicated in central pain responses and is activity is enhanced after tDCS and 4)
neuroinflammation likely plays a role in CIPN have led us to the present research plan. The overarching goal of
this proposal to conduct an exploratory double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) addressing 3 specific
aims: 1) determine the feasibility and efficacy of active tDCS targeting motor cortex as an analgesic and anti-
hyperalgesic intervention in patients with painful CIPN, 2) determine structural and functional brain correlates of
painful CIPN in the DPMN in NHBs and NHWs, and 3) determine inflammatory mediators in patients with painful
CIPN and their relationship to the severity of painful CIPN and DPMN structure and function. We expect NHB
subjects will experience greater therapeutic effects of tDCS compared to NHW subjects, since NHBs have a
dysregulated DPMN potentially affected by neuroinflammation. The goals of this project align with the mission of
RCMI@Morgan to understand and combat urban health disparity issues in the City of Baltimore and elsewhere."
11005911,"FemtoVox is building an image-guided automated ultrafast laser technology for voice box (larynx) surgery.
Current solutions using scalpels or traditional lasers aren’t automated (take longer), cause more damage (more
complications, longer wound healing), are imprecise (require repeat surgeries) and can set patients’ airways on
fire (higher liability). Our system provides real-time cross-sectional imaging using optical coherence
tomography (OCT). This allows surgeons to select the exact excision depth and automate laser scanning to
remove the defined tissue volume with higher precision. In contrast to existing solutions, ultrafast lasers
produce no collateral damage (due to their extremely short picosecond or femtosecond pulse durations).
Overall, our solution will be better: improved clinical outcomes, higher efficiencies and increased throughput.
With industry-leading experience commercializing automated ultrafast laser ophthalmic surgical devices
(Intralase, LenSx, Vialase), we have the expertise, vendor relationships and professional network to
commercialize this device. We aim to target the $1.8B spent annually (US) on laryngeal surgery. Our
technology is the superior solution for the ~120,000 larynx surgeries performed annually in the US. In addition
to these existing cases, there’s a large and compelling opportunity for the ~400,000 annual larynx benign
lesion diagnoses, which are rarely operated on (~5% of diagnoses) due to collateral damage concerns, which
leaves many patients (and surgeons) with no solutions. In the long term, we envision a platform technology for
broader ENT deployment (rhinology, oral cavity, throat).
With the potential to greatly improve laryngeal surgical outcomes, this technology aligns closely with the NIH’s
mission of improving health-related outcomes. We see the larynx as a well-suited beachhead for the first non-
ophthalmic ultrafast laser application for several reasons. Firstly, laryngologists or comprehensive ENTs
operating on the larynx are very familiar with lasers; however, current lasers cause too much collateral
damage, 25% of existing laser surgeries require re-treatment and conservative speech therapy has high failure
rates. Secondly, the larynx has very sensitive tissue for which automation and higher precision can preserve
more tissue. Lastly, larynx tissue is quite thin and optically transmissible, ideal for OCT imaging.
The project has three specific aims in its Phase I stage. The first aim is to demonstrate the superiority of
ultrafast lasers in minimizing collateral damage in laryngeal tissue. The second aim focuses on characterizing
ultrafast laser-based coagulation using the Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) as a preclinical in vivo
model. The third and final aim is to demonstrate sub-surface excisions in cadaveric laryngeal tissue, a
groundbreaking capability that could revolutionize laryngeal surgery as many benign lesions are sub-epithelial.
Completion of all these aims will define the optimal instrument design and operating parameters to advance
into Phase II in vivo animal studies."

 Chemsex, the use of psychoactive drugs before or during sexual activity, is a growing public health concern
due to its association with increased HIV transmission and other harms, particularly among men who have sex
with men (MSM). Current estimates suggest that 9-26% of Malaysian MSM participate in chemsex, contributing
to recent increases in HIV prevalence. In the absence of evidence-based interventions for chemsex, harm
reduction strategies remain the most impactful approach to mitigating chemsex-associated
harms. However, getting harm reduction interventions to MSM who engage in chemsex is a major challenge
due to the spontaneous and dynamic nature of chemsex risk. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)
delivered via smartphones represent a powerful strategy to deliver support by deploying tailored intervention
when needed. Specifically, apps that incorporate JITAI can be more effective than traditional app-based
interventions by addressing the dynamic nature of chemsex risk and capitalizing on users' changing states of
vulnerability (heightened chemsex risk behaviors) and receptivity (willingness to engage in intervention), while
also minimizing user burden, disruption, and habituation. Although JITAIs are increasingly being used in
domains such as addiction, mental health disorders, physical inactivity, and obesity, research on JITAIs to
address chemsex harm reduction is non-existent. In response, we developed JomCare, a smartphone app-based
chemsex harm reduction JITAI, that uses a machine learning algorithm to determine risk and deliver tailored
support as needed. JomCare includes several `pull' and `push' intervention components based on the
information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, and has demonstrated high feasibility and utility
in our recent pilot work. However, little is known to guide which intervention components should be
delivered in specific contexts to achieve maximum benefit, thus indicating the need to optimize JomCare. Framed
by the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) and building on our formative work, we will optimize
JomCare using a micro-randomized trial (MRT) to evaluate: i) which theory-driven intervention
components are efficacious in reducing chemsex risk behaviors; and ii) which contexts influence the efficacy of
JomCare. Specifically, we will conduct a 90-day MRT of the JomCare JITAI among 482 chemsex-involved
Malaysian MSM. Participants will be randomized twice daily via the app to receive: i) no prompt; ii) a generic
engagement prompt; or iii) one of three IMB model-based engagement prompts. The specific aims of this
application include: i) Evaluate the effects of any intervention (i.e., theory-driven or generic engagement
prompts) versus no intervention on chemsex risk behaviors (proximal outcomes) at subsequent EMAs following
randomization; ii) Compare the effects of theory-driven and generic engagement prompts on proximal outcomes;
and iii) Examine contextual moderators of intervention on proximal outcomes."

 Limited access to and insufficient uptake of screening remain persistent barriers to cervical cancer
elimination as a public health threat. The Teal Health self-collect device (Teal Wand) is designed to help
women collect their own vaginal sample for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing on FDA approved assays for
primary HPV. The technical innovation of the Teal device is the textured sponge which collects abundant
cellular/viral material and shows promise for storing HPV samples dry and eluted into FDA-approved
preservative, thus enabling rapid integration with current FDA-approved workflows on HPV assays. Self-collect
HPV, the causative virus of most cervical cancers, allows a woman to collect her own vaginal sample, thereby
doubling (or more) participation in screening. Participation among groups with access barriers is critically
important for Teal Health, and a primary reason to pursue FDA approval for the Teal self-collect device for at-
home screening. No FDA approved at-home self-collect devices are available for cervical cancer screening in
the US. Teal Health is seeking FDA approval for the Teal Wand for an at-home self-collection indication to
enable Teal telehealth well woman visits, our main source of revenue, thus expanding access to preventive
screenings for millions of women who experience barriers or are accessing preventive care. Our clinical study
design and analytical testing plans have been informed by feedback resulting from four FDA pre submissions.
 In this direct to Phase II submission, we propose a clinical study to evaluate the Teal self-collect device
compared to a clinician collected sample for submission to FDA for a De Novo classification (Phase II) for
primary HPV screening for cervical cancer. As part of this effort, we propose the following Aim: Conduct a
clinical study, with the subject serving as their own control, to confirm the usability of the Teal Wand and
agreement for detection of HPV of self-collected sample collected using the Teal Wand compared to a clinician
collected sample, both collected during the same visit in an outpatient setting and stored dry up to 7 days to
mimic at-home collection, storage, and shipping. This will be broken into two tasks: (1.1) Confirm the usability
of the Teal Wand for self-collection; and (1.2) Evaluate the percent agreement of the Teal self-collect device for
detection of HR-HPV from samples stored dry for 7-10 days as compared to standard of care clinician
collected samples. This data will support our De Novo FDA classification request. Self-collect screening at
home combined with the Teal Telehealth platform has the potential to access and engage more women in
cervical cancer screening than any available method on the market and unlock access to additional preventive
care visits."
11008417,"The early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an unmet challenge in the
field with significant direct impact on effectiveness of treatments and survival rate of
affected patients. The emergence of neoadjuvant therapies and the challenges
associated with detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in NSCLC patients
necessitates the development of new diagnostic tests that can help physicians tailor
appropriate therapeutic regimens to the individual patient and detect MRD early to
improve patient outcomes. Previously, Exai Bio has discovered a new class of small
RNAs that are mainly expressed in the tumor tissues, denoted as orphan noncoding
RNAs (oncRNAs). Moreover, Exai Bio has shown that oncRNAs are promising
biomarkers for early cancer detection, using blood as part of a novel liquid biopsy
technique. We have recently developed a novel assay and an artificial intelligence (AI)
model for early detection of lung cancer and predicting the subtypes using oncRNA
profiles. We have shown in a small, retrospective cohort that this new assay has a
higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art approaches available or published. As part of this
project we will work closely with outside collaborators to gather samples and test the
performance of this new assay for detection of MRD in NSCLC patients and to identify
its subtypes."

 Rett Syndrome is a devastating neurodevelopmental disease caused by loss of function mutations of the
MeCP2 gene, located on the X chromosome. Affecting nearly 20,000 girls in the US and EU, disease manifestation
is due to neuronal mosaicism caused by random X inactivation: half Rett patient neurons express the wild type
(WT) gene on the active X chromosome (Xa), while the other half express the mutated (MT) MeCP2 gene, with the
WT MeCP2 silenced on the inactive X chromosome (Xi).
 Epigenome editing using CRISPR systems is a potential targeted therapy allowing reactivation of the
silenced but functional MeCP2 gene on Xi. The epigenetic editor is comprised of a catalytically dead Cas (dCas)
fused with effector proteins, such as the DNA demethylase Ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein to demethylate
and thereby activate target genes. Epitor Therapeutics is developing novel epigenome editing tools to treat Rett
Syndrome. Our editor combines CasNano, an ultracompact CRISPR protein retaining robust DNA targeting, fused
to TETmini, a miniature yet potent TET demethylase domain. Compact enough to package into a single adeno-
associated virus (AAV), this epigenetic editor enables targeted delivery of epigenome editing machinery to the
brain.
 Our proposed strategy includes optimizing the epigenetic editor components for DNA targeting ability and
specificity (Aim 1); assessing in vitro target validation in Rett patient iPSC-derived neurons and off-target analysis
in human embryonic stem cells (Aim 2); and assessing pharmacology and phenotypic efficacy of the AAV9
encapsulating dCasNano-TETmini epigenetic editors in a Rett syndrome, female MeCP2-humanized mouse model
(Aim 3). If successful, this would represent the first epigenetic editing treatment for disorders of the CNS,
overcoming key delivery barriers that have blocked development of targeted epigenetic therapies."
11008538,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Synapses are intricate structures smaller than 1 micron, encompassing thousands of subtypes, each
defined by a unique composition of functional proteins. The ability to map the 3D organization of these
proteins is key for comprehending the molecular anatomy and mechanisms underlying brain functions and
diseases. Conventional optical microscopy, limited by a resolution of ~250 nm, falls short of resolving the
complex spatial organization of synaptic proteins. Meanwhile, electron microscopy (EM) and various super-
resolution optical imaging techniques like STED and SMLM are hindered by a lack of molecular specificity,
challenges in 3D imaging, and the labor-intensive, slow, and costly nature of the operation. This gap in
technology has left synapse typing unaddressed until the recent development of the next-generation
Expansion Microscopy technique, Magnify. Magnify offers an ~11-fold linear expansion of biological
specimens in a single round, ensuring efficient retention of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. It is
compatible with various tissue types and fixation methods while preserving epitopes for high-plex imaging.
By reaching ~15 nm resolution, Magnify can discern ultrastructural details such as cilia, mitochondria
cristae, and synaptic densities. We seek to build the prototype of the Multiplex Magnify sample preparation
kits as a universal tool for synapse typing and brain imaging. Our goal is to equip neuroscientists with the
ability to perform EM-quality 3D ultrastructural analysis, mapping an extensive array of biomolecular
markers within the intricate synaptic structures in brain tissue at a fraction of the cost and time using only a
light microscope. In our project, we will enhance the capabilities of our Magnify technology in neuroscience
research through the following Aims: (1) validate Magnify-compatible antibodies and a novel direct
immunostaining strategy for key synaptic markers to generate a library of labels for neuroscience
researchers; (2) develop a mounting strategy for multiplex immunofluorescence imaging of synapses to
ensure high-fidelity images through at least 10 rounds of imaging; and (3) develop a multiplex Magnify kit
prototype for easy adoption for neuroscience research. Upon successful completion, Magnify Biosciences
will produce Multiplex Magnify sample preparation kits for neuroscientists conducting simultaneous 3D
ultrastructural analysis, neuronal tracing, synapse typing, etc., in brain tissue. Our work will prepare for a
Phase II grant to increase multiplexing with barcoded oligo-conjugated Flexible binders and a larger
antibody panel and to advance the prototype with an automated Auto-Magnify device for autonomous,
multiplexed nanoscale imaging, enhancing super-resolution imaging accessibility for advanced brain
research."

 Lyme disease (LD), the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, is caused by a spirochete,
Borrelia burgdorferi. An estimated 500,000 people are diagnosed and treated each year. Antibiotic therapy is mostly
successful in cases diagnosed in the early stage of the infection. However, in some patients, early B. burgdorferi
infection is asymptomatic and Lyme arthritis (LA) is the primary manifestation of long-term LD, which usually occurs
months after the tick bite. LA is the leading cause of Lyme disease-associated morbidity, affecting around one third of
B. burgdorferi-infected individuals. Symptoms of LA include intermittent or persistent attacks of joint swelling and
pain that can lead to permanent joint dysfunction and debilitation. Most patient respond to a 30-day course of oral or
IV antibiotic therapy. However, in a small percentage of LA patients, arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy and can
last for months or several years. Distinct from LA, research has shown that up to 34% of Lyme patients have Post
Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). Symptoms include fatigue, pain, joint and muscle aches, and cognitive
decline, with an onset ranging from months to years. Long-term antibiotic therapy has not been proven to be beneficial
for PTLDS. Therefore, better therapeutic agents are urgently needed to resolve both LA and PTLDS.
 A human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was identified as binding to B. burgdorferi from the
BASEHIT yeast display library of 3,336 human exoproteins. SLPI is an evolutionarily conserved, multi-functional
protein. SLPI expression inhibits neutrophil activity and the NF-κB pathway in macrophages, leading to an overall
anti-inflammatory effect. A high percentage of neutrophils and macrophages have been observed in the synovial fluid
of LA patients during active LA and post-treatment LA respectively. SLPI also has broad-spectrum antibacterial,
antifungal, and antiviral activities. Using a SLPI knockout mice, our preliminary data showed a significantly higher B.
burgdorferi infection load and severe swelling and synovitis in the tibiotarsal joints of SLPI knockout mice in
comparison to the WT mice. The data indicate that SLPI expression suppresses the B. burgdorferi infection load and
inhibits the development of murine Lyme arthritis.
 The prior knowledge of SLPI and our preliminary data form the foundation of our hypothesis that therapeutic
dosing of SLPI will significantly mitigate human LA. This proposal aims to show the feasibility of that in the murine
LA model. Our long-term product goal is a novel secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) based therapeutic
indicated for advanced Lyme disease, including both LA and PTLS."

People living with HIV (PLWH) are at heightened risk for chronic lung diseases. The mechanisms underlying this
risk are poorly understood. Viral infections are major causes of acute respiratory events including pneumonia as
well as asthma and COPD exacerbations, all of which can increase the risk of chronic lung impairments. The
nasal mucosal “secretome”, composed of cytokines/chemokines and other soluble mediators, limits the initial
spread of viral infections through controlling viral entry, releasing cytokines/chemokines, as well as numerous
immune modulating mediators. The nasal microbiome, including bacterial microbiome and fungal mycobiome, is
a critical component of the respiratory immune system, acting as a barrier against harmful pathogens Our
research group has established approaches to rigorously characterize and quantify the nasal mucosal secretome
and microbiome. Our overall objective is to determine nasal mucosal immune and microbiome alterations and
clinical implications associated with these changes among PLWH compared to seronegative individuals. We
hypothesize that alteration of the nasal mucosal milieu among PLWH is associated with adverse pulmonary
outcomes. We will characterize the nasal immune environment (Aim 1) and microbiome (Aim 2) of PLWH
compared to seronegative individuals. Through longitudinal assessments embedded in these Aims we will define
the variability in these measures. We will then define nasal mucosal endotypes associated with pulmonary
consequences among PLWH compared with seronegative MWCCS participants (Aim 3). Successful completion
of these aims will lead to a rigorous characterization of the nasal mucosal and microbiome changes among
PLWH, identifying potential endotypes associated with adverse pulmonary outcomes in this population. These
results will provide valuable insights to guide therapeutic strategies and interventions to modify nasal mucosal
inflammation and nasal microbiome and its associated complications in this vulnerable population."

 Victims of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) commonly experience chronic pain, including headaches, spine
and limb pain, and are at high risk of developing long-term disability and opioid misuse. Despite this recognized
link between mTBI and chronic pain, the neurocircuitry underlying how mTBI increases pain is not known.
Emerging preclinical data suggest that the function of a major brainstem pain-modulating circuit, rostral
ventromedial medullar (RVM), is disrupted after mTBI - although the precise mechanism is still elusive.
 The RVM can either enhance or suppress pain. Its pain-facilitating function is mediated by a distinct cell
class, ON-cells, which can increase noxious signal transmission through their projections to the spinal dorsal
horns. The central hypothesis of this project is that mTBI contributes to chronic pain by sensitizing RVM ON-cell
activity, which increases the body’s sensitivity to both noxious and normally innocuous stimuli. In a mouse model
of mTBI, my preliminary results suggest that 1) mTBI leads to increased sensitivity in periorbital allodynia (a
model for headache) and hindpaw allodynia (a model for distal pain), and 2) an intact ON-cell circuit is required
for the development of persistent post-mTBI pain. In two Specific Aims, this study will test the hypothesis by
characterizing the functional and electrophysiological changes in descending ON-cells (e.g., spinal/trigeminal
dorsal horn-projecting) following mTBI. First, the functional role of descending ON-cells in mTBI-induced
hypersensitivity to postsurgical pain (Aim 1a) and headache (Aim 1b) will be explored through the use of
chemogenetics. Second, the progressive changes in ON-cell activity in animals with mTBI, and subsequent
postsurgical pain (Aim 2a) and headache (Aim 2b) will be studied using in vivo calcium fiber photometry. Finally,
the synaptic characteristics of these descending ON-cells in post-mTBI animals with persistent postsurgical pain
and headache will be investigated using ex vivo patch clamp recording in RVM brain slices (Aim 2c). This project
will provide foundational information to establish the relationship between brainstem pain modulation and brain
injury. By defining the longitudinal changes in a highly important pain-facilitating circuit underlying TBI-related
pain, the proposed studies address a critical knowledge gap in how TBI leads to chronic pain. Successful
completion of this work could also more broadly facilitate our understanding of other centralized pain conditions.
 Dr. Chen is a physician-scientist with a diverse training background in anesthesiology, pain medicine, and
basic neuroscience research. In addition to its scientific significance, this project will enhance his expertise in
animal genetics, neural circuit manipulation, in vivo photometry and ex vivo neurophysiological recording, as well
as lay the foundation for his future work in pain research and inform clinical practice. The detailed career
development presented in this application will provide the required resources and mentorship for Dr. Chen to
become an independent R01-funded investigator studying the pathophysiology of brainstem pain modulation
neural networks affected by brain injuries."

Dr. Yan received his Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on developing privacy-preserving technologies to
defend information systems against data breaches. His growing enthusiasm for maximizing the potential of AI/ML
to deepen the understanding of patient data has oriented him toward a career in biomedical informatics.
Throughout this transition, Dr. Yan has been dedicated to devising new methodologies to optimize the utility of
patient data and encourage its ethical use. Specifically, Dr. Yan has developed and evaluated multiple generative
AI algorithms to produce high-fidelity and privacy-respecting synthetic health data for critical downstream tasks.
Over the past several years, synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data generation powered by generative AI
technologies has gained substantial attention in the health domain due to its ability to protect privacy, promote
data sharing, and improve the performance of medical AI by providing datasets with greater size, diversity, and
population representativeness. Despite its great potential, there are significant gaps between the current state
of this technology and its maximal worth: the evaluation of synthetic EHR data is subpar, its development cannot
leverage data sources privately owned by multiple institutions and integrate established medical knowledge
(which largely limits the quality of synthetically generated EHR data), and it is unknown how to use synthetic
data to produce fair and reliable medical AI. This proposal aims to innovate computational methods, realized in
open-source software, to enable the assessment, development, and utilization of synthetic health data. Aim 1
focuses on the development of a multi-dimensional, customizable evaluation framework that appraises synthetic
health data in terms of its utility (i.e., value as an analytical resource), privacy, and fairness (i.e., ability to preserve
subgroup representativeness in real data). This framework will further inform synthetic data creators of the
appropriateness of a data generation model for a particular use case. Aim 2 will develop an ML architecture that
allows multiple institutions to collaboratively train knowledge-integrated synthetic health data generation models
using privately held datasets without data sharing. Aim 3 focuses on the development of a fairness-aware
pipeline that 1) utilizes synthetic data to balance the representativeness of subpopulation, 2) embeds fairness
constraints into the model training process, and 3) is agnostic of the AI/ML models relied upon. With the
assistance of a multidisciplinary mentoring team from VUMC, Penn Medicine, and Weill Cornell Medicine, Dr.
Yan will leverage EHR data from these institutions, as well as the All of Us and MIMIC EHR data, to develop and
evaluate the proposed computational methods. Dr. Yan will expand his expertise through training in fairness
design, federated learning algorithms, biomedical informatics and statistical methods. This training will help Dr.
Yan become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics to develop computational methods to
maximize the potential of biomedical data in supporting reliable and equitable health research and applications."

Aging and AD are associated with a decline in sex hormones. Approximately 40% of men over 45 years old
suffer from low androgen levels. Endocrine aging in men, termed andropause, is characterized by age-related
declines in androgens (such as testosterone). These declines in androgens are associated with increased AD
risk and cognitive decline. Despite advances in menopause models, models of endocrine aging in males
(andropause) have been stalled for over a century and are limited to gonadectomy. Gonadectomy causes almost
a complete loss of androgens, and thus does not accurately mimic reduced androgen levels observed in
andropause in men. Lack of more accurate models of andropause that more closely mimic the human hormonal
profile is a critical technical gap that is severely limiting the fields of aging and dementia. Our long-term goal is
to develop mouse models of dementia that more accurately reflect the hormonal environment in humans and
thus increase the translational potential of therapies that are tested in these models. The objective of this
proposal is to develop two new mouse models of andropause. First, we will determine the time course of natural
endocrine aging in WT mice and several mouse models of ADRD (Aim 1). Next, we will model endocrine aging
in males via gonadectomy and hormone replacement with gradual decreasing of androgen replacement over
time (Aim 2). For a non-surgical model of andropause, we will determine if a reproductive toxin can be used to
induce gradual androgen loss in male mice (Aim 3). For each model, we will assess aging phenotype (decreased
strength, reduced activity, increased anxiety, and impaired memory) and AD neuropathology. We predict that
mice with low androgen levels will exhibit a more accelerated aging phenotype and increased AD
neuropathology. This would represent the first ever models of andropause with carefully controlled, gradual
hormone loss. Without these new, improved models of andropause, the field will continue to test therapeutics for
AD in male mice with an endocrine status does not match that of aging men. This hinders the translational
potential of these therapies. Our new models have the potential to transform the aging field."

Diabetic wound infections are a major public health burden, with approximately 25% of diabetic individuals
developing a wound in their lifetime, 25% of these wounds not healing and 28% requiring surgical amputation.
The diabetic wound environment is complex, with hyperglycemia driving immune dysfunction and bacterial
pathogenesis leading to poor infection outcomes. One of the most frequently isolated bacterial species from
diabetic wound infections is Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Interestingly, GBS is notoriously absent from non-
diabetic wounds, suggesting that components of the diabetic environment specifically influence GBS success in
this niche. Previously, I have developed two murine models of GBS diabetic wound infection and determined
that GBS promotes hyper-inflammation in vivo. Dual RNA-sequencing of the murine and GBS transcriptome has
identified multiple host and bacterial targets with altered transcription during diabetic infection that have informed
the hypothesis herein. This proposal therefore seeks to elucidate the environmental factors that promote GBS
infection of diabetic wounds. I hypothesize that multiple facets of the diabetic wound environment including
neutrophil function, hyperglycemia and polymicrobial interactions contribute to GBS success. This hypothesis
will be addressed via the following specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the consequences of altered neutrophil function
to GBS pathogenesis during diabetic wound infection. Aim 2: Determine how hyperglycemia contributes to GBS
pathogenesis in the diabetic wound. Aim 3: Examine the contribution of Staphylococcus aureus to GBS diabetic
wound persistence during polymicrobial infection. These studies will increase our understanding of how the
diabetic wound differs from the non-diabetic wound environment, and the consequences of that altered
environment on pathogen success."

Thrive Digital Health (“TDH”) is developing a novel Peer Recovery Support Services (“PRSS”)
training platform (the “TDPP”) to standardize and scale the training of Peer Recovery Supporters.
TDH was founded by the principals of two successful existing companies at the forefront of
advancing PRSS, and benefits from the expertise of its CEO, who in addition to serving on the
board of the Peer Recovery Center of Excellence, is a nationally recognized thought leader on
PRSS training and implementation. The overarching goal of this Fasttrack project is to develop
and test an evidence-based platform that will extend standards-based and empirically-supported
Peer Recovery Support Services training and implementation across the country. Success in this
endeavor will expand access to support services for recovery from alcohol and other substance
use disorders, and help to address critical care gaps stemming from the treatment provider
shortage currently impacting the nation. We hypothesize that this scalable platform, used by
PRSS Trainers and Trainees, will be acceptable, feasible and usable, and will deliver a positive
effect in terms of knowledge gain, adherence and skill in Phase I. In Phase II of this Fasttrack
effort, we hypothesize that this platform will deliver superior training results among PRSS
trainees in terms of adherence and skill versus training-as-usual. Our priority commercial goal is
to bring this solution to market with organizations around the country seeking to build PRSS
capacity, and we will accomplish this through the following Phase II specific aims: (1) Assess the
effect on PRSS providers of the fully asynchronous TDPP and the TDPP with live zoom sessions
on skill and adherence compared with training-as-usual; (2) Assess the effect of adding three live,
interactive group teleconferencing sessions to the TDPP asynchronous content; (3) Conduct a
pre-post study with a pilot population of PRSS provider trainees from another state to assess
fidelity of implementation when content is localized for another state. The expected impact of
this project is to substantially enhance TDH’s ability to deliver effective PRSS training at scale,
expanding access to recovery support services across the country. This capability holds promise
to reduce negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total
cost of providing treatment services."

This project will include the development and evaluation of IMAAP, an Interactive Mobile Asthma Action Plan
to support asthma self-management and adherence to ‘as needed’ rescue medications, which are a critical
component of preventing exacerbations. The burden of asthma continues to fall disproportionately on
historically marginalized populations (i.e., individuals experiencing social determinant of health [SDOH]-related
challenges such as racism and discrimination, difficulties accessing healthcare, financial instability, and limited
social support). An innovative tool that presents a patients’ physician-prescribed Asthma Action Plan
recommendations in a way that all youth can understand is needed to improve access to care and the quality
of asthma care, decrease disparities, and promote health equity. IMAAP will be an innovative, easy-to-use
technology that leverages objective assessment of lung function (mobile spirometry), quantitative symptom
report, and an individualized AAP to provide personalized, real-time treatment recommendation decision
support to empower adolescents to improve their health. With this project, IMAAP will first be iteratively
developed through discovery interviews and feedback from adolescents from marginalized populations, their
caregivers, and health care providers. Discovery interviews with health care providers, specifically, will be used
to develop an innovative algorithm that will map asthma symptom and lung function presentations to patients’
individualized Asthma Action Plans. Prototype testing will be completed to ensure the safety of patients using
IMAAP and to expeditiously obtain user feedback from patients and caregivers in a variety of situations prior to
going live. Finally, a Phase IIb pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a sample of 20
adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma (ages 12-18) using IMAAP to 20 adolescents in a
treatment as usual group. All adolescents in the development and RCT phases will have ≥1 SDOH-related
challenge. The primary outcome for this trial will be feasibility of IMAAP. Feasibility will be assessed by comparing
rates of participation, engagement, enrollment, retention, and reach to a priori criteria. User acceptability and
usability will also be assessed as secondary outcomes, as well as electronic monitored rescue medication
adherence and health outcomes. As an exploratory aim, we will examine social determinants of health as predictors
of feasibility and health outcomes. Results will lead to further refinements and an adapted version of IMAAP ready
for full-scale efficacy testing in a future trial."

Dental caries is a preventable disease, however, it still affects large numbers of people globally and in the US.
The Global Burden of Disease 2017 study showed an estimated 2.3 billion people had dental caries of
permanent teeth, and of all evaluated conditions, oral disorders ranked first in age-standardized prevalence in
males and females. Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2016 cycle
found that 1 in 4 adults ages 20 to 64 years have untreated tooth decay. Approximately equal numbers of
males (28.0%) and females (24.3%) had untreated caries. Variation was observed according to race and
ethnicity and higher rates were observed for non-Hispanic blacks (40.2%) and Mexican American (37.1%)
compared to non-Hispanic whites (22.2%). Additional variation was noted according to poverty status, with
45.3% of adults with income less than 100% federal poverty level having untreated tooth decay, compared to
only 17.7% of individuals with greater than 200% federal poverty level status. Furthermore, according to a
survey conducted by the American Dental Association in 2015, 59% of adults indicated that they forgo dental
care due to cost, 22% because they are afraid of the dentist and 19% because they cannot find a convenient
location or appointment time. Taken together, these statistics underscore the importance of dental caries
treatment that is easy to access, affordable and effective. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has been used in many
parts of the world to arrest dental caries, however, multiple systematic reviews using data from randomized
controlled trials have concluded there is evidence to support carious lesion arrest in primary teeth in children,
but there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusion for effectiveness on permanent teeth in children or on
coronal surfaces of teeth in adults. Given that large-scale prospective studies on adult caries outcomes are
costly and lengthy, and that dental caries is a multi-factorial disease process, it is important for studies to
collect data on key factors such as medical comorbidities, medication use, and access to preventive dental
services. Our proposed use of existing data thus represents a highly efficient approach to conducting robust
analyses on the effectiveness of SDF to arrest carious lesions in adults and prevent the need for more invasive
treatment. Thus, our primary aim is to determine whether teeth treated with SDF to arrest a carious lesion
required subsequent caries-related extraction, root canal therapy or direct/indirect restoration during the 1-5
year follow-up period. Our secondary aim is to determine whether 2 or more applications of SDF are more
effective than 1 application at preventing subsequent caries-related extraction, root canal therapy or
direct/indirect restorations during the 1-5 year follow-up period."

Large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects have highlighted the frequency of mutation in chromatin
modifiers in cancer. Mutations in genes encoding the members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
have been identified in close to 25% of all cancers. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF
modulates gene expression is of critical importance. In normal cells, the activity of SWI/SNF in transcriptional
activation is balanced by the repressive Polycomb complex, and in situations where SWI/SNF is mutated,
Polycomb gains influence. Within the Roberts lab, we make use of a genomically simple but highly lethal pediatric
cancer, rhabdoid tumor, that lacks both copies of SMARCB1, a core component of 2 out of the 3 SWI/SNF
remodeling complexes. These rhabdoid cells depend on the activity of a third SWI/SNF remodeling complex,
which lacks SMARCB1. To gain mechanistic insight into the interplay between SWI/SNF and Polycomb, in
conjunction with the Pediatric Dependency Project which my mentor initiated with colleagues in Boston, we
searched for genetic vulnerabilities specific to rhabdoid tumor cells. We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screening of
16 rhabdoid tumor (RT) cell lines compared with over 800 other cancer cell lines and identified a gene whose
loss preferentially causes loss of viability of RT cells. We have independently validated the importance of this
gene for RT cell viability, and our preliminary studies show that the encoded protein represses Polycomb
function. We therefore hypothesize that loss of this protein further disrupts the SWI/SNF-Polycomb balance
leading to repression of genes whose transcription is required for RT cell growth. Additionally, this protein is
known to regulate important signaling pathways, and its loss may further dysregulate transcription through their
disruption. Elucidation of the function of this protein will provide novel insights into chromatin-mediated control
of transcription, the interplay between SWI/SNF and Polycomb which is disrupted in cancer, and importantly may
link these important signal transduction pathways with SWI/SNF and Polycomb-regulated transcription.
Additionally, through the study of this vulnerability, we will gain mechanistic insights that will contribute to the
development of new therapies. Through this training award, I will extend my expertise in the study of signaling
pathways to delve into the nucleus and will use molecular and genome-wide approaches to assess the regulation
of chromatin. I will be guided in this journey by my outstanding mentor Dr. Charles Roberts, who has a fantastic
record of accomplishment of mentoring trainees, and who has far exceeded my expectations. Through his
leadership and the commitment of the Academic Programs Office to postdoc development, and with my access
to the outstanding resources at St. Jude, I am confident that my postdoctoral training will equip me with all the
tools I need to launch a successful independent research career running my own lab."

Bone fractures occur in more than 25 million Americans per year, and 5-10% of those fractures fail to heal.
Fractures that show delayed or failed progression to healing account for the majority of patient disability and
costs. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the biology of bone healing, and to use that
knowledge to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. We are seeking support for the 18th Biennial
conference of the International Section of Fracture Repair (ISFR), a two-day meeting in Montreal. In 2017,
the ISFR was incorporated as a section within the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS), thereby leveraging
the outreach of the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to orthopaedic research. The ISFR is
dedicated to the advancement and exchange of the most current scientific ideas and research findings on
fracture repair and its application to the improvement of patient care. Our mission is be the premier forum to
integrate and present cutting-edge ideas related to clinical, translational, and basic-science research of
fracture healing. With an organizational theme of “The Future of Fracture Repair”, the main sessions of the
meeting will present forward-looking research and issues, in addition to challenges facing the trauma surgeon
now: Day 1) cross-talk of bone with other tissues, the future of post-fracture rehabilitation, and next-generation
outcomes assessment in fracture healing; Day 2) nonunion, geriatric fractures and polytrauma. In a new
partnership intended to promote clinical participation and clinician-scientist interaction, the ISFR Meeting will
be held in conjunction with the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA). The first day
of the ISFR conference has been planned to provide basic and translational content of interest to researchers,
clinicians and industry professionals. The second day has been jointly organized by the ISFR and the OTA, with a
focus on the latest research on clinically relevant topics. In total, we will have an invited keynote speaker, 27
invited session speakers, and slots for 24 abstract-selected podium presentations. We anticipate an additional
30-40 abstracts selected as posters. The Program Committee is highly focused on fostering an inclusive
environment, and has strived for a diverse roster of invited speakers, in terms of gender, career stage and
URiM representation. Surgeons, biologists, engineers, and policy makers will attend the meeting and be
drawn from academia, health-care, government, and industry. A variety of activities will be focused on career
development and networking for trainees in the bone healing field."

RISE UP (Revolutionizing Investigations to Link Screening to Experimental Therapeutics to Upend
Prognosis for Breast Cancer) will bring an interdisciplinary, prevention-focused approach to the challenge
of eliminating breast cancer mortality. We aim to leverage what we know about targeted breast cancer
treatments to develop novel ways to approach breast cancer prevention.
The conference will bring together an international group of experts from many backgrounds and
disciplines, including (but not limited to!) physicians across women’s health specialties (oncologists,
gynecologists, radiologists, primary care providers), basic scientists, advocates, entrepreneurs, policy
makers, regulators, and investment leaders. We will apply this varied expertise to three main focus areas:
1) combining growing knowledge about new breast cancer subtypes and treatments that successfully
eliminate tumors in the early-stage setting with strategies for subtype specific prevention; 2) exploring
how best to apply trial designs using early endpoints to accelerate learning, funding, and FDA approvals
for screening and prevention; 3) integrating knowledge of breast cancer treatment and prevention with the
approaches to hormonal cycle control. Ultimately, we hope to use our knowledge about breast cancer to
reformulate the hormonal control products millions of women take to reduce breast cancer incidence.
The event will consist of talks and poster sessions to foster cross disciplinary learning, highlight research,
and spark ideas and action. General sessions will be designed to educate attendees about opportunities to
improve the health and well-being of women from prevention to treatment of breast cancer as well as
management of cycle control, contraception, menopause, and sexual health. Our goal is to bridge the
critical gap in knowledge of breast specialists and gynecologists to make breast cancer management
better, engage the gynecologic and primary care community in improvements in breast cancer screening
and prevention, and to rethink hormonal control across the continuum of a woman’s life with an eye
toward breast cancer prevention. The conference is designed to foster questions, collaborations, and
overall generation of new ideas and ways of thinking about breast cancer. There will be no overlapping
sessions so that all attendees will come out with a common set of knowledge and the ability to improve
their practice and upend the way we think about breast cancer prevention.
The conference will be held from November 1-3, 2024, at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco. We hope
that the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley will energize attendees to challenge the status quo and act.
This notion of idea to implementation is built into the conference: we will hold a competition to
incorporate breast cancer prevention into the hormone-based care women already receive-- and a prize of
working with Bay Area biotech leaders to make that idea a reality."

As an academic radiation oncologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neck cancer and hematologic
malignancies and additional research interests in cancer control, symptom management, and quality of life, I am
committed to advancing the mission of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) through leadership and excellence in
clinical cancer research efforts within multiple NCI-sponsored institutions. I am a member of the Atrium Health
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (AHWFBCCC) and an Assistant Professor in the
Department of Radiation Oncology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. I am actively involved in clinical
research through AHWFBCCC investigator-initiated trials (IITs), national cooperative group trials, and multi-
institutional industry studies; however, I wish to advance my career to the next level of leadership in institutional
and national NCI-supported clinical research. With the support of this NCI Early Career Cancer Clinical
Investigator Award (ECIA), I aim to rapidly complete current institutional clinical trial work, expand current pilot
studies into larger NCI-supported clinical trials, complete dedicated training experiences (including coursework
and workshops) and grow my network, responsibilities, and leadership roles within AHWFBCCC and NCI-
supported clinical trial networks such as the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program
(NCORP) Research Base and NRG Oncology. To achieve these goals, I will collaborate with mentors within my
institution and within other NCI-funded clinical research organizations to complete two ongoing IITs and develop
an AHWFBCCC pilot study. I plan to report the results and use study findings to inform the design of prospective
studies that can enroll patients within AHWFBCCC-Levine Cancer enterprise and beyond; the WF NCORP
Research Base or NRG Oncology, for example. I will meet with mentors and institutional study staff routinely to
ensure successful and timely completion of my ongoing IITs and the planned study. I will also meet regularly with
mentors and collaborators within the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base and NRG Oncology Head and Neck
Committee and affiliated patient-reported outcome and recurrent/metastatic working groups. I will complete
seminars, workshops, and educational activities to expand my expertise in clinical trial conduct, biostatistical
principles, and patient-reported outcomes research. I will obtain a Certificate in Leadership from the Wake Forest
University School of Professional Studies. These activities would not be feasible without the support and
protected time provided by the ECIA. After successful completion of the proposed activities, I will have
significantly advanced my goal of becoming an independent clinical cancer researcher focused on maximizing

survivorship after successful treatment of their cancer. Moreover, I will have demonstrated my progress towards
advancing NCI-supported clinical trial activities that will help our patients live longer, healthier lives."
11002222,"INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE – Project Summary
The SDSU HealthLINK Center (Center) was established in 2018 to augment investigator, partner, and
institutional capacity for minority health and health disparities (MHHD) research. The goal of the Investigator
Development Core (IDC) is to enhance the career development of junior investigators, especially those under-
represented in the sciences, to conduct innovative minority health and health disparities research at SDSU,
SDSUIV, and with community partner organizations. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following four
specific aims that build on our successful Pilot Project (PP) program: 1) support the career advancement of
junior investigators through PP funding and training; 2) foster knowledge and skills transfer between Core
Leaders and PP by supporting cross core collaboration activities; 3) support the career advancement of a
broader audience of MHHD researchers through workshops; and 4) contribute to the Center’s measures of
implementation, engagement, satisfaction, and impact. To accomplish Aim 1, IDC will fund 10 PPs following
implementation of a Grant Writing Workshop to PP applicants designed to assist them in preparing a
competitive PP application. A Research Management Training Program will be delivered to PP Leaders and is
designed to foster successful project initiation and completion. Outreach and recruitment strategies will
leverage institutional resources and connections to maximize the recruitment of junior (i.e., post-doctoral
fellows, early-stage) investigators and those under-represented in the sciences. In this process, IDC strives to
create a diverse community of basic biomedical, behavioral/population, and clinical/health services researchers
working toward the common goal of optimizing health outcomes for all people. To accomplish Aim 2, IDC will
work closely with AC, RCC, CEC and newly hired RC faculty member to optimize the transfer of knowledge
and skills by and between Cores and Project Leaders. Our innovative career enhancement model allows junior
investigators to leverage the expertise of Center investigators, research staff, and senior mentors to generate
new knowledge that further enhances shared resources. To accomplish Aim 3, IDC will support the expansion
and reach of career enhancement workshops for a broader audience by working with previous PP Leaders in
preparing workshops and sharing research tools and resources through the Center’s Health Science Research
Portal. To accomplish Aim 4, IDC Co-Leaders and Coordinators will engage in implementation and
engagement tracking, and work with AC Evaluation team to obtain measures of satisfaction with IDC-
sponsored activities. They will also provide feedback to AC Evaluation team on measures of Center impact,
including methods for deriving evidence for impact on the investigator and impact on the field. Through these
efforts, IDC will strongly enhance junior investigator’s career development at SDSU or SDSUIV, which, in turn,
will greatly improve institutional capacity for MHHD research."
11002223,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE – Project Summary
Established in 2018, the SDSU HealthLINK Center strives to enhance investigator, partner, and institutional
capacity to conduct community engaged minority health and health disparities (MHHD) research. Health
disparities in the US are significantly more persistent and pronounced among individuals from historically
marginalized groups, including Latinos, LGBTQ+, individuals of low socio-economic status, individuals living in
rural communities, youth, immigrants, and refugees. Many of these groups are represented in our California-
Mexico border communities in San Diego and Imperial Counties. Community-academic partnerships are well
suited for conducting research focused on understanding and mitigating such disparities, as the resulting
collaborations often lead to real-world changes that are significantly greater in magnitude and reach. Thus, the
objective of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to cultivate trusting, meaningful, impactful, and
sustainable community-academic research partnerships by expanding the capacity and readiness of
community partner organizations and SDSU and SDSUIV investigators to conduct community engaged MHHD
research. We propose the following three specific aims that align with goals of the RCMI specialized centers:
1) build and expand the capacity and readiness of community partner organizations and SDSU and SDSUIV
investigators to conduct community engaged MHHD research; 2) promote cross-collaborations with Center
Cores and community partner organizations to leverage expertise and promote knowledge transfer; and 3)
support dissemination efforts to inform policies and evidence-based practices to address the knowledge-to-
practice gap. To accomplish Aim 1, CEC will partner with four organizations, three located in urban San Diego
County (Family Health Centers of San Diego, County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, Casa
Familiar) and one located in rural Imperial County (Innercare). CEC and Center will be supported by the
Center’s Community Coalition, an established 2-county, 6-sector, 12-member community partner organization
network that engages key organizational leaders. The Community Coalition facilitates direct linkages between
Center members and partners and informs our research priorities and innovative approaches. To accomplish
Aim 2, we will promote cross-collaborations with Center Cores and community partner organizations by
supporting capacity building of Pilot Project Leaders through the Grant Writing Workshops and Research
Management Training Program, and of community partner organizations through planned career enhancement
workshops and co-development of research trainings. To accomplish Aim 3, CEC will lead dissemination
efforts to support the translation of findings and lessons learned into evidence-based practices and
organizational policies through multiple channels and to a broad range of audiences. CEC proposes a
responsive approach for building the capacity of community partner organizations, and SDSU and SDSUIV
investigators, to conduct innovative and impactful transdisciplinary and community engaged MHHD research."
11002225,"RESEARCH PROJECT-RIESTRA/SUSSMAN - Project Summary
The public health threat posed by infection with the sexually transmitted parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, its
disproportionate affliction of racial and ethnic minorities, and its vastly understudied status have led to
classification of trichomoniasis as one of our country’s most neglected parasitic infection. The first part of this
research project will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which T. vaginalis kills Lactobacillus crispatus
and Lactobacillus iners-cervicovaginal bacteria that generally have a protective role in the female reproductive
tract. Specifically, we will observe the parasite-lactobacilli interactions using live/dead staining and assess the
dynamics of bacterial killing. Using pharmacological inhibitors and by generation of clathrin light chain knockout
parasites, we will determine the contribution of phagocytosis towards T. vaginalis antibacterial activity. A
second part of our project will assess if T. vaginalis infection-mediated activation of the inflammatory cell death
called pyroptosis leads to indirect antibacterial effects against lactobacilli. Specifically, we will test whether a
recombinant form of the gasdermin D N-terminal cleavage fragment has antibacterial effects against lactobacilli
that constitute the different cervicovaginal microbial communities present in women. Additionally, using
ectocervical gasdermin D knockout cells we will further delineate how induction of pyroptotic cell death during
T. vaginalis infection contributes to killing of cervicovaginal lactobacilli, and whether killing of these protective
bacteria results in increased inflammation. Lastly, we will investigate the interaction of T. vaginalis with L.
crispatus, L. iners, and human vaginal cells using a vagina-on-a-chip model. Indirect immunofluorescence
assays of these chips will reveal the spatial organization of these microbes on stratified vaginal epithelium. We
will also quantify the differential viability of each microbe upon triad interaction compared to colonization with
each single microbe. Lastly, we will profile differences in secretion of inflammasome-mediated cytokines and
processed gasdermin D release. Together, our work will elucidate how T. vaginalis exerts antibacterial effects
during infection and how it mechanistically promotes inflammation, processes that are associated with
increased predisposition of women to adverse health effects and which are currently untreated with standard
trichomoniasis treatment. Our research efforts could thus help guide the development of future targeted
therapeutics to ameliorate the impact of T. vaginalis infection, particularly those from lower socioeconomic and
underrepresented backgrounds disproportionately affected by T. vaginalis infection."
11002226,"RESEARCH PROJECT - SANT/QUINTANA - Project Summary
This project investigates exposures and potential health effects in communities disproportionately burdened by
environmental exposures near the US-Mexico border, and the potential to mitigate these risks on children’s
health through a home-based intervention. The Tijuana River is a binational watershed flowing from Tijuana,
Baja California, Mexico north into the US near the communities of San Ysidro and Imperial Beach, CA. This
watershed is highly impaired, due to high volumes of sewage, industrial waste and runoff that enter the river
and estuary. In our Center-funded Pilot Project, a 2-year spatiotemporal field survey of water within the Tijuana
River and Estuary, we applied state-of-the-art non-targeted chemical analysis and metagenomics to
characterize a broad suite of contaminants. We discovered that microbes with antibiotic-resistant genes, a
public health concern, were highly elevated in the Tijuana River in sites near the waste flows relative to more
distant sites. Persistent and toxic chemicals associated with untreated sewage and industrial waste were highly
concentrated in the near-border sites. This impaired water also poses a potential threat to air quality in the
community. Unlike water, air can diffuse across the community and enter homes, childcare centers, and
schools, and expose community members who are not contacting the water source. In addition, while long-
range transport of persistent chemicals transferring from water to air is a well-known cause of global chemical
contamination, transfer to air in communities near impaired water bodies has not been explored from an
environmental justice lens. In Aim 1, we will use cutting-edge non-targeted methods to assess microbial and
chemical constituents of community air samples in relation to proximity to the Tijuana River, especially
antibiotic resistance genes. In Aim 2, we will examine chemical and microbial signatures of Tijuana River
source pollution identified in Aim 1 in community air and inside of homes, including detection of antibiotic
resistance genes within household dust, in relation to child microbiome, assessed via hand, oral, and fecal
swabs. In Aim 3, we will inform the development of a home-based intervention with Casa Familiar, a
community-based organization with a long-history of environmental justice work. Together, we will use well-
established and innovative formative research methods and Intervention Mapping to identify determinants and
change strategies important for mitigating environmental risks, with a specific emphasis on reducing barriers to
implementation of prevention and control measures. Overall, we aim to apply these high-throughput, state-of-
the-art environmental science laboratory methods to a border health framework and using an environmental
justice lens. The methodologies developed and used in this Research Project can be broadly applied to
environmental justice communities experiencing unequal burdens from air pollution."

11005472,"ABSTRACT
Endograft infection, neointimal proliferation, and thrombosis are the three main clinical complications with ePTFE
stent grafts affecting patients following endovascular arterial repair. These complicating factors often lead to
restenosis, elevated risk for cardiac events, and device failure. Clinically available covered stent grafts are
composed of porous hydrophobic polymeric (i.e., ePTFE) or bare metal surfaces that facilitate protein and cell-
surface interactions leading to downstream cell accumulation, biofilm growth, and clinical complications. Current
clinical standards include anticoagulation therapy before and after interventional procedures, while heparin-
bonded stent grafts have shown moderate success at attenuating thrombosis. However, heparin-bonded stent
grafts do not address infection and neointimal proliferation. There are no FDA-approved coated ePTFE products
that can rigorously address all three complications – infection, neointimal proliferation, and thrombosis, in a single
platform. We have recently demonstrated how nitric oxide (NO)-releasing polymer technologies can be
integrated into medical devices to create highly biocompatible interfaces with the potential to prevent infection,
proliferation, and thrombosis. NO is a multifaceted, endogenous gasotransmitter used by both the immune and
cardiovascular systems to eradicate pathogens, disperse biofilms, maintain platelet quiescence, and regulate
cell proliferation. By covalently attaching a synthetic NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP) onto
silicone rubber (PDMS), we can achieve NO-releasing materials (SNAP-PDMS) that exhibit >4 months of NO
release at the blood-material interface to regulate these cellular processes. This enables a broad strategy against
endograft infection, neointimal proliferation, and thrombosis, improving device patency and clinical outcomes.
Therefore, the main objective of this STTR proposal is two develop endograft devices that integrate the SNAP-
PDMS polymer technology to achieve long-term (> 30-d) release of NO at the device interface to reduce the
incidence of infection, neointimal proliferation, and thrombosis all of which contribute to prosthetic graft failure."
11006100,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Rates of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are rising globally, demanding innovative
interventions beyond the scope of current efforts to prevent STIs. While HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
effectively reduces HIV acquisition risk, it does not address the surge in bacterial STIs. The DoxyPEP Study
has demonstrated the efficacy of Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) among men who have sex with
men (MSM) and transgender women. However, puzzlingly, doxycycline PEP was found ineffective in cisgender
women in the dPEP study, despite doxycycline achieving similar concentrations in the vagina and rectum.
Preliminary data from dPEP show low detection of doxycycline among participants, suggesting that low
medication adherence may explain the null result. To fully interpret the dPEP study and others, in-depth
adherence measurement techniques for doxycycline will need to be developed.
 As was needed for HIV PrEP to establish the relationship between patterns of pill-taking and drug
concentrations, a directly observed therapy (DOT) study, the gold-standard approach to determine the
pharmacology of doxy and establish pill-taking cut-offs, is needed (Aim 1). We will enroll 36 participants (12
cisgender men, 12 cisgender women, and 12 transgender women) for a randomized cross-over DOT study,
with in-depth pharmacokinetic measurement while dosing and during washout. When combined with sexual
behavior data in the trials conducted in MSM/TGW and cisgender women, doxycycline PEP coverage of sexual
acts and pharmacodynamic relationships can be established. These data can be used to understand patterns
of adherence over time among women in dPEP to interpret the null study, and to understand the relationship
between cumulative adherence and STI incidence reduction (Aim 2). We will then examine adherence patterns
in the recently completed DoxyPEP study to understand the potential clinical role of a urine or plasma metric
amenable to point-of-care test development to identify doxy-PEP adherence challenges (Aim 3). Finally, this
work will establish thresholds of doxy levels in hair, urine, and plasma to interpret doxy adherence in roll-out
studies in the future.
 By study end, we will have determined dosing cut-offs for doxy in hair, plasma, and urine, and will use these
cut-offs to examine the relationship between adherence patterns and STI reduction in the dPEP study, and
adherence predictors and metrics within the DoxyPEP trial. These benchmarks and pharmacodynamic

Vitiligo is characterized by the patchy loss of skin pigmentation that can adversely affect a person’s quality of life
and sense of well-being. Despite the prevalence of vitiligo [over 2 million U.S. citizens are affected by vitiligo and
the global cases range from 0.5% to 2% of the population], there is only one FDA-approved therapeutic for
vitiligo; a topical formulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor sold under the trade name Opzelura. Significant
shortcomings of Opzelura include: the limited response rate and the high cost. Thus, there is a critical need for
the development of novel therapeutics for vitiligo. The long-term research goal of this project is to discover and
develop safe and cost effective small organic compounds that can be used as therapeutics for vitiligo.
Investigations into the autoimmune mechanisms of vitiligo have revealed: (i) high levels of expression of the
cytokine CXCL10 at active sites of vitiligo in murine and human tissue; (ii) that inhibition of interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ) signaling, which induces CXCL10 expression, is protective from vitiligo in a murine model; and (iii) that
neutralization of CXCL10 can induce reversal of the disease in a murine model. These observations have led to
the conjecture that reagents which inhibit IFN-γ induced CXCL10 expression by keratinocytes, the main source
of CXCL10, could be developed into therapeutics for vitiligo.
The research team has identified a family of highly potent and specific inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3
(GSK-3). The team recently discovered that COB-187, the lead compound within this family, inhibits IFN-γ
induced CXCL10 expression by human keratinocytes. These observations have led us to the following central
hypothesis: COB-187 is efficacious in vitiligo. To investigate this hypothesis, the following aims will be completed:
(i) to determine the ability of COB-187 to attenuate IFN-γ induced cytokine expression by human keratinocytes;
and (ii) to determine the mechanism by which COB-187 inhibits IFN-γ induced CXCL10 expression by
keratinocytes.
The family of compounds exemplified by COB-187 have the potential to become therapeutics for vitiligo. The
proposed work will provide a strong scientific foundation for the development of such therapeutics. Thus,
successful completion of these studies will have a positive impact on the large number of people who suffer from
vitiligo."
11006748,"Innovative Point-of-Use Water Purification System: Portable, Scalable, Efficient, Easy-Use
 Fresh water in lakes and rivers have supported societies for centuries, unfortunately most water in
nature is not drinkable due to the presence of various disease-causing pathogens.1 Modern cities have
extensive infrastructures to supply purified natural water for a functional society. When major climate
disastrous occur, their access to drinkable water is disrupted, diminishing their resilience. In 2023 so far,
25 catastrophic natural disasters have occurred, each costing the US well over a billion dollars. This is
highest number of consecutive events recorded since 1980 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). The 2021 Texas winter storm resulted in ~14.9 million people experiencing water
disruptions. More frequent large magnitude nature disasters is expected with climate change. It is critical
to develop innovative technologies to provide easy access to drinkable water for individual citizens.
 Reverse osmosis (RO) and chemical oxidant disinfection are the main approaches for point-of-use
(POU) water treatment in the commercial domain. However, the former requires pressurized water and is
susceptible to membrane fouling, and the latter employs oxidants, such as ozone, chlorine, and chlorine
dioxide, which could generate carcinogenic byproducts affecting people’s health. Recently, solar steaming
(SS) has become promising for POU renewable water purification; nevertheless, such devices depend on
weather and geographic locations and have limited accountability during extreme weather.
 The overall project aims to develop a novel electric powered POU water treatment system that can
directly fish out live bacteria and remove toxic metal ions, such as Lead and Mercury, in natural water to
reach the drinkable level. The device will utilize the enhanced interactions between bacterial cells and a
designed high-frequency electric (E) field applied via highly-branched graphite foams to remove bacteria.
In a low-frequency E-field, the foam electrodes will generate electroomosis flows in water to readily augment
their absorption of toxic metal ions. As a step towards this goal, in this phase-I project, we will exploit an
economic, rational approach to fabricate an innovative highly branched graphite foam, and validate and
optimize its dual functions towards bacterial disinfection and metal-ion removal in designed AC electric
fields. The fabrication of the branched graphite foams will be carried out in a robust manner via leveraging
our patent-awarded technique (#11,858,816, 2023) to endow the foams with (a) densely branched
structures for bacterial alignment, propulsion, and capture, as well as (b) enhanced ionic absorption
capability for the removal of toxic ions.
 Once successful, this project will deliver a portable, scalable, all-weather, easy-use water purification
solution for individual citizens, effectively enhancing society’s resilience in response to natural disasters.

11007344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 recommended dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) as the
preferred treatment regimen for all persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
including children, adolescents, and young adults. Since then, most countries, including Ghana, have transitioned patients
from non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase-based antiretrovirals to DTG-based regimens. Despite the wide acceptability and
effectiveness of DTG, important side effects such as neural tube defects, hyperglycemia, obesity, and mood disorders are now
coming to the fore in several reports from SSA. In young people living with HIV (YPLWH) in Africa, the DTG switch was
done without a lot of studies. After the switch, the effectiveness (viral suppression) and adverse events have not been studied
in this population. According to the WHO, young people, defined as aged 10-24 years, are in a transition that poses risks to
their health and well-being. This population, even when fully adherent to medications, may be prone to suboptimal or
supratherapeutic drug concentrations, resulting in off-target effects, virologic failure, adverse drug events, drug-drug
interactions, and poor adherence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study how this population metabolizes new drugs like
DTG that have been introduced into the ART regimen on a large scale.
We hypothesize that reduced or non-response to DTG-based ART is due to pharmacokinetic differences emanating from
pharmacogenetic variations, which cause adverse events without the benefits of viral control. We will test this hypothesis
with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine rates of DTG-based ART resistance in young people living with HIV. We will determine which drug(s)
are responsible for virologic failure in YPLWH on DTG-based regimens. We will compare participants who are ART
experienced and naïve focusing on those with virologic failure on a DTG-based regimen and sequence protease, reverse
transcriptase and INSTI regions and identify mutations associated with drug resistance.
Aim 2: Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomics variability of DTG-based ART and its influence on off-target
effects. First, we will use blood samples collected from ART-experienced and naïve young people at specific but different
time points following DTG-based ART administration to establish pharmacokinetic characteristics of patients using LC-
MS/MS to capture inter- and intra-individual variability. Second, we will use high throughput genotyping techniques, iPLEX,
PCR-RFLP, and TaqMan assays to analyze pharmacogenetic variations associated with phase I and II drug metabolism
(cytochrome P450 enzymes, UGTs), transporters, and target interactions.
Our study may help understand why some YPLWH develop resistance while on DTG or have off target effects on the
drug spurring further larger studies which may eventually help revise the one size fits all approach adopted for DTG-
based regimens in sub-Saharan Africa."
11007681,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV is declining in many parts of the world, but rising in Latin America, including Brazil. From 2010 to 2019, the
number of new HIV infections in Latin America increased 21%, compared to a global reduction of 23%. The
number of reported HIV cases in Brazil increased from 13,719 in 2011 to 40,880 in 2021, with increases driven
by sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years (SGM youth). Among men aged 15-24 years, HIV
incidence per 100,000 increased from 37.8 in 2000 to 66.5 in 2018 – a 75% increase. HIV pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) was approved in Brazil in 2021 for adolescents aged 15-17 years, but PrEP uptake has been
<1% among SGM youth. Our team conducted the first and largest PrEP demonstration study among adolescents
in Latin America (PrEP1519), in which we implemented peer navigation strategies that linked 1174 SGM youth
(20% of 5870 recruited) to PrEP services at SGM-affirming health facilities. In qualitative interviews, SGM youth
articulated positive relationships with peer navigators but reluctance to engage with facility-based services due
to past experiences with stigma and logistical and structural challenges accessing care. These data suggest that
programs featuring peers were welcomed, but alternatives to facility-based services are urgently needed to scale
up PrEP among SGM youth. We hypothesize that equipping peer lay workers – trained SGM youth who are part
of SGM-affirming health care teams – to deliver PrEP to SGM youth in community venues will increase PrEP
uptake among SGM youth. The goal of this project is to conduct a series of studies to refine, test, and understand
experiences with a peer-led community-based intervention (CommunityPrEP, “COMPrEP”). In Aim 1, we will
conduct qualitative interviews guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to identify
key modifications for the PrEP1519 peer navigator intervention to adapt it for community delivery by peer lay
workers. In Aim 2, we will randomize 1400 SGM youth to access PrEP through peer lay workers at community
venues (COMPrEP intervention) or health providers at SGM-affirming health facilities (standard care). We will
conduct intent-to-treat analyses with modified Poisson regression to compare PrEP uptake (primary outcome)
across randomized arms. We will follow the subset that initiates PrEP (expected to be N~385) for 12 months to
compare secondary outcomes (1-month adherence, 3-month and 12-month persistence). Throughout the trial,
we will monitor participant safety through our study team and an external monitoring board. In Aim 3, we will use
the RE-AIM framework to explore experiences with the COMPrEP intervention through qualitative interviews with
SGM youth, peer lay workers and health providers, and local and national policymakers to develop next steps.
The proposed work will provide robust evidence about whether PrEP delivery facilitated by peer lay workers in
community settings increases PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence among SGM youth in Brazil. With
members of the National HIV Program in Brazil as our collaborators, we will be well-positioned to provide results
to guide programming for this population and scale up the intervention if effective."
11007740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developing Interventions for The Protection of HIV-Exposed Uninfected Infants against Severe Infections
HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEU) have increased risk of severe infections, hospitalizations, and death in
the first 1-2 years of life than HIV-unexposed infants (HU). This is likely due to decreased immune responses.
The development of the infant immune system is guided by the gut microbiota, which use metabolites and other
products as mediators. The immune system also affects the microbiome in this bidirectional relationship. We will
compare the interactions of microbiome and immune responses in HEU and HU with the goal of identifying gut
bacterial taxa and their metabolites responsible for the HEU immune defects that may be modulated with diet.
In Aim 1, we will define immunogenomic and metabolomic profiles that explain the immune dysfunctions of HEU
in the 1st year life. In 50 HEU and 50 HU at 6, 24 and 48 weeks of life, equally distributed between males and
females, we will measure functional, phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic profiles and identify the genomic
networks underlying the loss of NK and T cell effector function. We will integrate the immunogenomic with plasma
metabolomic profiles to identify the metabolites associated with HEU immune dysfunction. We will then confirm
the relationship between immunologic and metabolomic characteristics in vitro.
In Aim 2, we will compare the gut microbiome composition and function in HEU and HU and identify bacterial
taxa associated with the immunologic and metabolomic abnormalities of HEU. We will further confirm the
relationship between microbiota and metabolome in vitro. We will also compare the composition of the respiratory
microbiomes of HEU and HU. The respiratory microbiome may play an important role in the differential severity
of respiratory tract infections of HEU and HU. Moreover, the respiratory microbiome is modulated by local and
systemic immune responses resulting in a well-established correlation between gut and respiratory microbiota.
In Aim 3, we will perform proof-of-concept studies of maternal and infant dietary interventions to modulate the
infant gut microbiome. In the 1st study, we will randomize 24 pregnant people with HIV 1:1 to pasteurized
fermented milk (PFM) supplementation during the last month of pregnancy or control. We will assess
acceptability and compliance with the intervention and its effect on the neonatal gut microbiome and metabolome
at 2-4 weeks of life. In the 2nd study, we will randomize 24 6-month-old HEU 1:1 to 4-week PFM supplementation
or control and evaluate the same outcome measures as above at the end of the intervention.
This highly impactful and innovative study will define the relationship of the infant gut microbiomes with
immunogenomic, metabolomic, and respiratory microbiome profiles; will identify bacterial taxa that may increase
the vulnerability of HEU to infections through decreased immune functions; and will test the ability to alter the
HEU gut microbiome and metabolome through dietary interventions. Our findings will forge a path to design
interventions to improve the HEU immune protection and decrease their risk of severe infections,
hospitalizations, and death."
10983574,"PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals
with opioid use disorder (OUD) to evidence-based treatments. Telemedicine for opioid use disorder (“tele-
OUD”) may be part of the solution. Use of tele-OUD grew rapidly during the pandemic and, in the first four
years of this R01, we have made substantial progress in understanding its role in OUD treatment. To date, we
have published 24 studies that examine a range of issues related to tele-OUD. These studies describe the
growth of tele-OUD, examine the impact of the policy environment on tele-OUD use, assess the quality of tele-
OUD, document disparities in tele-OUD use, and describe how clinicians are trying to address those
disparities.
However, key gaps in knowledge on the use of tele-OUD remain. We are proposing a renewal of our grant that
uses data from Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance, plus national pharmacy claims. Our Aims are
to: 1) characterize clinicians who are using a fully-virtual model to treat OUD and compare clinical outcomes
between virtual-only clinicians and other clinicians; 2) assess the role and quality impact of audio-only
telemedicine for OUD treatment; and 3) identify trends in the number of pharmacies that dispense
buprenorphine and assess the impact of pharmacy dispensing decisions on patient outcomes.
The results from this project will inform provider use of tele-OUD as well as ongoing policy debates at the
federal and state levels and among private health plans on payment and regulation of tele-OUD and its role in
improving access and quality of care for individuals with OUD."
10986005,"PROJECT SUMMARY [Original Proposal]
The proposed study will investigate midlife women's relationships and support exchanges with their late-
adolescent and adult children, as well as with other relatives and non-relatives, and the implications of these
relationships and exchanges for women's psychosocial well-being in a rural sub-Saharan setting. The study
will leverage and expand upon a unique panel database consisting of five rounds of survey and qualitative data
collected from rural women between 2006 and 2018 as part of the project Men's Migrations and Women's
Lives in Mozambique. We propose to extend this existing panel by conducting two new waves of survey and
qualitative data collection three years apart. The new data will focus on material, instrumental, and socio-
emotional support exchanges between panel participants and their children, relatives, in-laws, and non-
relatives and on panel participants' life satisfaction, happiness, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and related
psychosocial outcomes. The analyses of the dynamics of social interactions and exchanges and of their
consequences for women's psychosocial well-being between the two proposed waves will integrate the
existing panel data on participants' marital and reproductive trajectories, experience of husband's labor
migration, history of co-residence with children and investment in their health and education, as well as
changes in women's physical health and economic conditions, to elicit longer-term processes that shape the
outcomes of interest. The project will be carried out by an experienced bi-national multidisciplinary team with
complementary expertise and a long record of successful research collaboration. The results of the study will
contribute to greater understanding of midlife rural women's health and well-being in rapidly changing
resource-limited patriarchal settings and will inform policies aimed at improving the welfare of this large and
vulnerable population segment."
10986010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-
exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5
billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed
infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions2. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS,
and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There
is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment.
Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and
biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity
produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant
sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and
assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering
from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and
duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by
reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the
optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may
go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations,
dehydration).
This proposal seeks to develop, assess, and commercialize interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensorsystems
capable of automated digital scoring, continuously monitoring the biochemical, psychological and environmental to
biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates while providing suggestive treatment for NAS. Our team and
partners have outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation to develop a commercial grade
wearable wristband monitoring kit that includes: (1) infant wearable wristband, (2) imaging camera (3) recharging
station, (4) tablet app, and (5) patient portal tailored for professional healthcare providers. Our business unit has
extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in
opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad
experience in novel biosensor development."

 Immunogenetics is the study of the genetic basis of the immune response and has significant potential
to provide insight into health and disease. Initial insights have come from studying circulating peripheral
immune cell populations and correlating these cells with clinical outcomes, however immune cells vary across
tissues and some cell types including macrophages can only be found in tissues and not in the circulation.
 Regulation of the tissue specific immune response is complex and involves multiple molecular
mechanisms. Tissue specific immunity is significantly influenced by the secretion of cytokines and growth
factors by tissue specific cells. Utilizing the inbred mouse model has allowed scientists to evaluate these
regulators of tissue specific immunity, as mice and humans share 99% of genes. One significant advantage of
the inbred mouse model is availability of numerous immunological tools including gene knock-out and gene
knock-in that can be employed to identify the role of a specific protein in immune pathways. However, the
genetic variation found in humans results in a variety of individualized immune responses to infectious and
autoimmune diseases, and this cannot not be captured in the traditional inbred laboratory mouse model. In
contrast, the genetically diverse collaborative cross mice have permitted the application of genetic approaches
to study the diversity of tissue specific immunity in the lung and have identified genes associated with infection
resistance, susceptibility, and severity. However, this approach as not been applied in the field of urology,
bladder immunity and to urinary tract infections (UTI), one of the most common bacterial infections.
 UTI are predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli which infect a healthy population with
incidence in women much higher than in men and nearly half of all women have reoccurring UTIs. Currently,
mechanisms for the high rates of reoccurrence and severity are unknown, albeit genetics and immunity must
play an important role in controlling UTI. There have been some focused studies that have identified a few
genes that lead to either increased resistance or susceptibility to UTI. However, the immunogenetics of the
bladder and kidney in the steady state and during a UTI is less well studied at the genome wide scale.
 This project will use the collaborative cross mice in order to evaluate the heterogenicity of UTI and the
subsequent immune responses, more accurately mimicking observations made in the human population. We
will evaluate the immune response in the bladder and remote tissues (including the kidney, spleen, and brain)
that may give insight into UTI complications and comorbidities. Using the publicly available whole genome
sequencing data we will identify quantitative trait loci and genes associated with the severity, susceptibility, or
resistance to UTIs and bladder macrophage immunoregulation. Our work will define novel subsets of
macrophages, differentially activated in the diverse collaborative cross mice. Furthermore, these results will
inform the selection of additional strains of mice to be used in further investigation of UTI pathogenesis."
10983450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower-income Americans increasingly rely on a range of unsecured debt sources (e.g., credit
cards, payday loans) to help manage expenses, likely contributing to frequent fluctuations in
debt levels throughout the year. Frequent fluctuations in debt amounts, use of certain debt
sources, or for particular reasons (e.g., managing unexpected expenses) may be adaptive,
helping individuals to reduce stress and anxiety related to financial management. Yet, in some
cases, these fluctuations may be harmful, increasing experiences of stress, anxiety, and
depression. Due to existing survey limitations, we know little about experiences of within-year
changes in debt and their potential role as health stressors or stress-reducers for lower-income
individuals. The R21 project will systematically capture short-term changes in debt amounts and
composition and evaluate associations with generalized stress, anxiety, and depression. The
project has three specific aims: 1) Field a novel smartphone survey that collects biweekly self-
reported health, income, and debt data from 410 lower-income adults for one year. The
development of a biweekly survey on debt is supported by prior research that underscores the
importance of capturing short-term fluctuations in income to understand economic insecurity of
lower-income individuals and families. The proposed survey addresses the lack of short-term
data on debt holdings across a range of unsecured and understudied sources. 2) Develop
standard measures of within-year fluctuations in debt burdens across debt sources using data
collected from the survey. In doing so, we introduce the concept and measurement of within-
year debt fluctuations to the multidisciplinary literature on debt and health. 3) Analyze the data
to provide the first insights on the scope of lower-income individuals’ experiences with short-
term debt fluctuations and consequences for health, with attention to variation by race. The
study is the first to collect high-frequency data on debt and health via mobile surveys, with
implications for advancing data collection efforts in this area. Findings will inform economic and
family policy, with insights on how addressing debt fluctuations in addition to overall debt
burdens in policy design may have positive public health impacts. Data created through this
project will be made publicly available to advance research across disciplines concerning family
functioning, poverty, and health."

10984311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the tremendous public health burden of OA, trials have largely been negative to date and there are no
effective approved treatments that can prevent structural progression. There is increasing interest in refining the
phenotype of people enrolled into OA trials to better match the known mechanisms of the interventions to relevant
patients to increase likelihood of successfully detecting treatment effects. Vitamin K is a promising therapeutic
option in knee OA given its association with structural outcomes, and the high prevalence of inadequate dietary
vitamin K intake among older adults. Prior work has demonstrated associations between lower vitamin K levels
and cartilage loss on knee MRI. Whether the vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP), which functions to
inhibit bone and cartilage mineralization when activated, may provide insights into how vitamin K affects OA
structure is not known. Further, whether MGP could be used as a biomarker of vitamin K’s effects on structural
outcomes to potentially reduce trial durations merits investigation. Beyond the impact of lower vitamin K levels
on structural OA outcomes, an improved understanding of its impact on clinical outcomes, including pain and
physical function, is needed as vitamin K supplementation may be an effective intervention targeting both
symptoms and structure. Finally, although there is increasing interest in testing vitamin K supplementation in OA
trials, the appropriate form and dosing have not been determined, nor what therapeutic threshold needs to be
targeted to obtain anticipated beneficial effects. I will leverage data collected in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis
Study, including previously collected knee radiographs and MRIs and stored blood biospecimens to evaluate the
following: 1) blood thresholds of vitamin K associated with increased risk of structural OA outcomes (cartilage
damage, bone marrow lesions, and synovitis), and the role of MGP as an intermediate in this pathway to assess
its potential as a serum biomarker; 2) association of vitamin K levels and MGP on knee pain and physical function
in knee OA; and blood thresholds of vitamin K associated with increased risk of poor clinical outcomes. As a
third aim, I will perform a pilot trial testing different forms and dosing of vitamin K supplementation on plasma
levels of vitamin K and inactive MGP in older adults with knee OA. These proposed studies are innovative as
they will provide novel insights into the relationships between vitamin K levels and both structural and
symptomatic outcomes. The proposed research is significant as these insights would lay the foundation for
identifying an important phenotype (those with lower vitamin K levels) for testing a potential intervention (vitamin
K supplementation) for OA structure and/or symptom modification. This project will importantly provide the
necessary protected time, essential training, and mentorship to support my transition to becoming an
independent investigator focused on improving outcomes for patients with OA."

Candidate and Goals: Dr. Ifrah Zawar is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Virginia (UVA)
with clinical expertise in neurology and epilepsy and a research focus on epilepsy in older adults and people with
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Her long-term career goal is to become a leading,
independent clinician investigator in ADRD and co-morbid epilepsy. Her current research, research funding, and
history of dissemination demonstrate her ability to execute innovative, impactful research in this field.
Career Development: Dr. Zawar proposes a plan of research, mentorship, and coursework, including ADRD
training via Virginia Alzheimer’s Disease Center Scholars Program, workshops, several data science courses
and clinical study design and statistical modeling culminating with a Master’s Degree in Clinical Research.
Research: Epilepsy is a common co-morbidity of ADRD. People with ADRD and co-morbid epilepsy appear to
have faster cognitive decline. Dr. Zawar’s preliminary data suggest that ADRD with co-morbid epilepsy have
worse cognitive and mortality outcomes. Unfortunately, seizures are often under-recognized in the setting of
dementia, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. However, no algorithms are available to identify people
with ADRD at high risk for epilepsy. The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele is the most common independent
genetic risk factor for late-onset epilepsy. Yet, it has not been studied as a risk factor for epileptiform activity on
prolonged electroencephalogram (EEG). Dr. Zawar hypothesizes that people with ADRD at high risk for epilepsy
can be identified using clinical and genetic risk factors. Dr. Zawar proposes to 1) Develop and test a risk
stratification algorithm for epilepsy prediction in ADRD and 2) determine the feasibility of identifying the
differences in EEG in people with AD with and without the APOE4 allele. Successful completion of this
research will develop a risk stratification algorithm to identify those at risk for developing epilepsy among ADRD
and test the feasibility of assessing APOE4 as a predictor for epileptiform activity in AD. This tool could change
clinical practice by identifying high-risk people with ADRD who can be monitored closely or considered for an
EEG for early identification and treatment of epilepsy with a goal of improving patient care and clinical outcomes.
Mentors: Dr. Zawar’s primary mentor, Dr. Jaideep Kapur, MD, Ph.D., is an international leader in epilepsy. Her
mentoring team brings in diverse, qualified, and recognized expertise in ADRD, neuropsychology, biostatistics,
predictive analytics, EEG, clinical trial design, data science, gerontology, and epilepsy in older adults.
Environment: UVA has a strong, well-established record of research and an excellent research environment for
the proposed research and training. The Virginia Alzheimer's Disease Center, FE Dreifus Epilepsy Program,
the Brain Institute, UVA School of Data Science, School of Public Health Sciences, the NIH-NCATS-funded
CTSA, and the Center of Advanced Medical Analytics will provide the resources and the diverse and
stimulating environment for Dr. Zawar to flourish as an independent investigator in this cutting-edge field."

A key component in the development of linguistic proficiency is the capacity to learn the statistical regularities
present in the ambient language environment, largely by mere exposure. This basic cognitive process enables
the discovery of the words and grammatical relations present in speech, and also enables the identification of
these structures in written text. Although groundbreaking strides have been made in linking the independent
contributions of auditory and visual statistical learning—the ability to learn from distributional patterns—to
literacy, recent meta-analyses reveal that nearly none have analyzed how statistical learning facilitates the cross-
modal transfer between auditory and written linguistic information, a skill that is critical to literacy development.
Moreover, while prior research has established connections between statistical learning and language skills in
literate children, fewer studies have explored its contribution to language outcomes in speaking, pre-literate
children, and how this connection changes over the course of reading development. Furthermore, measures
such as phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming, while reliable correlates of reading, recruit a
host of skills, making it difficult to pinpoint the precise mechanisms that support proficient reading.
 My goal is to better understand how individual differences in statistical learning impact the cross-modal
transfer from auditory materials in spoken language to written text during the initial stages of reading
development, and how phonological skills are in turn influenced by learning how to read. My Specific Aims are:
1) to establish implicit neural-entrainment markers of auditory and visual statistical learning in literate
children (8-10-year-olds) to measure phonology-to-orthography and orthography-to-phonology transfer,
and 2) to determine how the implicit neural-entrainment markers of statistical learning across modalities
predict readiness to read in pre-literate children (4-5-year-olds) and their future reading performance.
The use of EEG will allow me to uncover indices of learning and processing that behavioral measures may be
insensitive to in young children, affording clearer insights into early literacy development.
 In the K99-phase, I will be trained by world-experts in neurocognitive-linguistic development to conduct EEG
studies designed to identify neural indices of how statistical learning drives phonology-to-orthography and
orthography-to-phonology transfer, my first foray into neuroimaging. In the R00-phase, I will apply the skills and
measures developed during the K99-phase to determine how neural processing predicts individual differences
in key reading precursors in pre-literate children and shapes future reading aptitude longitudinally. Combining
neuroimaging with the behavioral methodologies of statistical learning and language that I pioneered during my
doctoral and postdoctoral work will kickstart my scientific career and facilitate my transition to an independent,
tenure-track position by equipping me with the techniques needed to conduct rigorous, interdisciplinary cognitive
neuroscience research with the potential to benefit public health and education."
10984678,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The leading cause of health inequities and premature death in the United States (US) is smoking. Creating
equitable access to smoking cessation aids and supporting quit attempts by smokers from diverse racial and
ethnic groups are top health priorities. Advancements to personalizing smoking cessation treatment based on
the genetic profiles of individuals is promising but requires further scientific knowledge and research, especially
in historically marginalized groups such as American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) peoples. Important
conversations with AIAN community stakeholders about genomics and innovative community-based
participatory research (CBPR) approaches have set the stage for more Indigenous-centered approaches to
science. Merging these advancements to develop an Indigenous pharmacogenomics approach to smoking
cessation is lacking in the field and holds promise to support innovative smoking cessation efforts through
personalized treatment and culturally appropriate interventions. This project aims to leverage the promise of
genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies, which have successfully mapped thousands of loci
associated with complex traits, as methods to reveal altered mechanism in nicotine metabolism and will result in
a better understanding of the relationship between nicotine metabolism, smoking cessation, and corresponding
tobacco-related disease and death in AI communities. Working closely with the Strong Heart Study (SHS) cohort,
the longest running study of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and its risk factors among AI communities, we will
evaluate associations between genomic and epigenomic variation with nicotine metabolism, predict risk factors
for smoking behavior and health outcomes, and use a CBPR approach to have conversations and develop a
culturally appropriate intervention for smoking and tobacco use in AI communities. The SHS prioritizes research
from American Indian investigators and the topic of nicotine metabolism and its relation to genomic/epigenomic
variation and smoking cessation research is a significant area of interest. A three phased approach will be used
to promote health equity and smoking cessation efficacy. The phases of this proposal are 1) to identify genetic
and epigenetic influences on nicotine metabolism in AI smokers using a genome-wide and candidate
resequencing approach, 2) develop genetic risk scores to examine associations with behavioral traits and
comorbidities, and 3) develop a personalized approach to incorporating precision medicine as well as traditional
and cultural knowledge to improve smoking cessation efficacy. Importantly, phase 3 community engagement will
be continuous throughout the research proposal, with the diverse AI communities involved in the SHS
contributing to study outcomes and future directions guided by these interactions. This study will provide a
framework for tailoring precision medicine with cultural considerations in diverse AI communities and across
other racial and ethnic minority groups to advance health equity and reduce substance use."

136 people die each day from opioid overdose in the US. Naloxone has significantly decreased
opioid mortality as a first line life-saving measure, and often it is being administered by
untrained medical personnel under situations of extreme stress—which studies show leads to
accidents, missed doses and tragic consequences. Pirouette has designed a novel, low-cost,
and intuitive auto-injector called REZQGO that anyone could use to deliver lifesaving Naloxone
safely and quickly during an opioid overdose; this Phase I project supplement will assist
Pirouette in market research, regulatory planning, pricing / reimbursement strategy, usability,

10984588,"ABSTRACT. This K22 proposal aims to enhance the applicant’s prior quantitative training with a combination
of formal coursework and informal guidance to transition to independence as a molecular cancer
epidemiologist investigating the biological basis of health disparities in female cancers. Racial and ethnic
disparities are well documented for ovarian cancer, the deadliest gynecological cancer. Black women,
compared to White women, have higher odds of late stage diagnosis, and disproportionately worse survival
rates despite lower incidence. Moreover, Black and Hispanic women have experienced slower decline rates in
ovarian cancer mortality compared to White women. Social determinants of health only partially account for
these disparities, suggesting that biological factors like the vaginal microbiome may play a non-trivial role. The
vaginal microbiome can shape the tumor microenvironment through production of pro-carcinogenic metabolites
and reduction of antineoplastic metabolites. However, its composition varies by host factors including race and
ethnicity and correlates of social disadvantage such as poverty. While racially and ethnically distinct vaginal
microbiomes may have unique metabolic profiles associated with differential ovarian cancer outcomes, no
studies have evaluated this possibility. Therefore, applying the framework of Krieger’s ecosocial theory, we
hypothesize that through embodiment of social disadvantage, racial and ethnic differences in the functional
effects of the vaginal microbiome contribute to ovarian cancer disparities. We propose a study that will use an
untargeted metabolomics approach to compare metabolite profiles of cervicovaginal fluid from 120 patients (40
Black, 40 Hispanic, and 40 White), by race and ethnicity and by social disadvantage. To test our central
hypothesis, we have set three specific aims, namely to, i) characterize racial and ethnic differences in vaginal
fluid metabolite profiles, and metabolic signatures among OC patients , ii) assess differences by social
disadvantage in vaginal fluid metabolite profiles, and metabolic signatures among OC patients, at the individual
and neighborhood levels, and iii) evaluate the relative importance of vaginal fluid metabolites and social
disadvantage on OC aggressiveness, and OC recurrence. Completion of the proposed K22 will enhance
scientific knowledge on the role of vaginal microbiome-induced inflammation in ovarian cancer progression.
This study will identify biological pathways that contribute to racial and ethnic differences in ovarian cancer
progression. This scientific knowledge will be useful for identifying metabolites that can serve as prognostic
biomarkers for ovarian cancer, and designing future mechanistic studies. Moreover, at the clinical level, our
study will provide evidence on how therapeutic interventions that involve modulating the vaginal microbiome
may be beneficial for specific races and ethnicities, and indicate the potential value of applying vaginal
microbiome metabolite profiling in clinical settings. The proposed K22 study will provide the applicant with the
necessary training, skills and resources to transition to independence as a molecular cancer epidemiologist."
10984647,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Smoking is the most dangerous way to use nicotine but fewer than 8% of cigarette smokers successfully quit
each year. While quitting all tobacco and nicotine use is best, completely switching to a noncombustible
nicotine product, like e-cigarettes, can reduce exposure to harmful chemicals and risks for those who cannot
quit. However, many people inaccurately believe that e-cigarettes are as harmful as combustible cigarettes,
which may suppress switching. Limited research exists on underlying reasons for these beliefs, and few
studies have identified educational messages that may be used for adults who smoke to address these beliefs.
More research is needed on comprehensive messages that can target beliefs and effectively communicate the
relative risks of e-cigarettes versus cigarettes, and to assess their potential effects on beliefs, intentions, and e-
cig use. Research is also needed on methodological tools that can be used to identify communication that can
effectively increase message-consistent beliefs and behaviors. Extant research suggests that tobacco
message testing may be enhanced by using neurocognitive measures of message effectiveness, which have
been shown to explain additional variance in intention and behavioral outcomes compared to self-reported
measures alone. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is one method for measuring neurocognitive
response that provides unobtrusive, subconscious, objective measures of cognitive processing predictive of
behavior change. The overall aims of the proposed research are to: 1. Identify latent classes of beliefs about
cigarette and e-cigarette harms to inform message development; 2. Develop, pilot test, and refine e-cigarette
educational messages that target prevalent belief classes using neurocognitive and interview responses, and
3. Test finalized messages to assess effects of belief class messages on neurocognitive response, belief and
intention change, and actual e-cigarette use. This study will examine the effectiveness of comprehensive e-
cigarette educational messages tailored to prevalent belief patterns, and whether neurocognitive message
responses can predict message-consistent beliefs, intentions, and behaviors. A comprehensive training plan is
proposed to ensure the implementation of these aims, with objectives focused on 1) refining skills in
neuroimaging techniques, experimental design, and analysis, 2) obtaining experience in designing and testing
relative risk communications, and 3) expansion of skills in advanced quantitative and qualitative methods. The
research and training plans will help me to establish an independent line of research applying communication
neuroscience methodology to tobacco regulatory science research, and to support my pathway to
independence."
10984650,"Project Summary/Abstract: An estimated 698,000 children in the U.S. live with serious illness and significant
care needs. A complex system of hospital and community providers and agencies supports these children and
their families living at home, but families are still challenged by significant gaps in this system. Compounding
these challenges are the social determinants of health (SDOH) that excerbate the negative impact of serious
illness on children and families. Families, particularly those from historically marginalized communities, may
also experience increased financial difficulties, greater household material hardships, and lower social support.
Taken together, these health system and SDOH challenges have deleterious impacts on children’s and
families’ wellbeing. In response to these challenges, timely and tailored clinical actions are urgently needed to
support children and families living at home. Pediatric palliative care (PPC) programs are uniquely poised to
support children and families, but these programs are typically based in pediatric hospitals and few offer home
services. Care is thus often provided from afar, without information about families’ day-to-day care experiences
and if care is aligned with families’ needs over time. Routinely collecting and rapidly feeding back digitally-
captured data about families’ home-based PPC experiences to PPC teams may a) enable tailored clinical
actions to increase concordance between families’ needs and home-based PPC, b) support teams to address
the health system and SDOH challenges faced by children and families, and c) improve outcomes for children
and families. The proposed Home-based PPC Experiences for Children with Serious Illness and Families
Feedback Study (EXPERIENCE-Feedback), informed by the Chronic Care Model, the clinical decision
support framework, NINR research lenses, and community-engaged research principles, will evaluate a rapid
digital information feedback loop between families at home and PPC providers over time, explore longitudinal
associations between home-based PPC experiences and child/family outcomes, and build a foundation for
future community-engaged interventions by evaluating the feasibility and actionability of rapidly (i.e.,
simultaneous with family reporting) feeding back digitally-captured, family-reported experiences with home-
based PPC to PPC teams over time (Aim 1), and exploring the longitudinal associations between home-based
PPC experiences and child (Aim 2) and family (Aim 3) physical, mental, and social health outcomes. This
award, with mentorship by an interdisciplinary research team at the University of Pennsylvania and the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, will support advanced training in health equity-focused, longitudinal,
community-engaged, and intervention research methods. The proposed project aligns closely with the NINR’s
strategic plan to study health equity, SDOH, and care systems; builds a foundation for future R01 health
equity-focused intervention studies; and supports the applicant’s career goal to advance equitable, high-quality
care and care outcomes for all children living with serious illness and their families in homes and communities."

Emerging evidence suggests hearing loss may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
related dementias (ADRD). Midlife (ages 45-65) could be a critical period when screening and intervention to
prevent AD/ADRD may be most effective. Indeed, increasing evidence suggests there are detectable changes
in midlife cognition and brain health associated with risk factors, such as vascular disease, which may presage
an increased risk for dementia in late life. Age-related hearing loss also often begins in midlife. As such, the
recent Lancet commission on dementia prevention highlighted hearing loss in midlife as a target for dementia
prevention. However, prior investigations have focused on hearing loss and cognition in older adults. There is a
critical gap of knowledge as to whether hearing loss is associated with cognition or markers of brain health in
middle-aged adults. There is also a critical gap in studies on hearing loss and cognition in underrepresented
populations, subgroups at higher risk for AD/ADRD, and the intersection with social determinants of health.
Addressing these gaps would inform intervention strategies targeting hearing loss, AD/ADRD risk, and health
inequities. We have an exciting and unique opportunity to study the relationship between hearing loss and
midlife cognition and brain health in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.
CARDIA is a biracial study of Black and White men and women with a spectrum of educational attainment with
measures of audiometric hearing loss, a standardized cognitive battery, and structural brain MRI from the most
recent exam, when participants had a mean age of 60. The goal of this study is to clarify the associations of
hearing loss with cognitive and brain aging in middle-aged adults. In Aim 1, we will test whether pure tone
audiometric hearing loss is associated with cognitive test scores, including methods to account for potential
cognitive testing error due to hearing loss. In Aim 2 we will examine the association of hearing loss with
cognition among subpopulations with differing background risk of AD/ADRD. Primary subgroups will be defined
by race, sex, and APOE genotype; we will also explore subgroups by education, income, and social isolation.
In Aim 3, we will investigate whether hearing loss is associated with brain volumes linked to higher AD/ADRD
risk (e.g., hippocampus and white matter hyperintensities). We propose a cost-efficient study that will link
newly collected objective hearing tests with cognitive and brain MRI assessments in a well-characterized and
diverse midlife cohort. Identifying associations between midlife hearing loss and cognition and brain MRI would
offer an important avenue for prevention and risk stratification. Importantly, this project will help lay the
groundwork for future studies evaluating the role of midlife risk factors for AD/ADRD and identifying
intervention targets to prevent cognitive decline."

 Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are widely prevalent globally and associated with high morbidity and mortality.
A hallmark of liver fibrosis is hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation. While there are many transcriptional and
translational changes associated with HSC activation, how these changes are initiated and regulated is still not
well understood. We recently demonstrated that BMP-SMAD1/5/8 signaling in hepatocytes is not only the central
pathway that maintains iron homeostasis by regulating the iron hormone hepcidin, but also plays a protective
role in liver fibrosis, as mice with hepatocyte SMAD1/5/8 signaling deficiency display spontaneous liver fibrosis.
However, the mechanisms of hepatocyte SMAD1/5/8-mediated protection in liver fibrosis is not known. In
addition, the function of SMAD1/5/8 signaling in HSC is completely missing. The overall objective of this proposal
is to understand the role of SMAD1/5/8 signaling in hepatocytes and HSCs in liver fibrosis. My preliminary data
suggest a role for hepatocyte SMAD1/5/8 signaling in regulating the production of wntless to control secretion of
Wnt ligands, which have paracrine actions to activate HSCs. My data also suggest that intrinsic SMAD1/5/8
signaling within HSCs may also be protective against HSC activation and liver fibrosis. In Specific Aim I, I will
use in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine the role of hepatocyte wntless in HSC activation and liver fibrosis
in hemochromatosis and NASH models. I will also perform secretomics to identify the hepatocytes secreted
paracrine modulators that activate HSCs. In Specific Aim II, I will used primary HSCs and HSC specific
conditional knockout mice to investigate the intrinsic role of SMAD1/5/8 in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. This
proposal will not only fill in the gaps in understanding the pathology of liver fibrosis in hemochromatosis but will
also advance the liver fibrosis field more broadly by providing new insights into hepatocyte-HSCs intercellular
communication and HSCs biology, more importantly, will pave the way for new clinical treatments for liver fibrosis
and cirrhosis. My long-term career goal is to successfully establish a research group and obtain a tenure-track
faculty position in a leading academic or hospital-based research institute. My future research goals are to bridge
the gaps between iron disorders and chronic liver diseases through investigating the direct biological
mechanisms by combining my expertise in iron homeostasis with the new training opportunities in liver
histopathology, gene editing and proteomics techniques described in this proposal."

Maternal obesity is a major public health problem affecting 20 million women in the United States and accounting
for 22 to 42% of the prevalence of childhood obesity. Currently, 1 in 8 children aged 2-5 years old have obesity,
increasing their risk for obesity and chronic disease during the lifecourse. Rodent and non-human primate
models demonstrate that in utero exposure to maternal obesity and high-fat diet can alter fetal development of
mesocorticolimbic circuitries that regulate inhibitory control and reward sensivity, leading to obesogenic
behaviors. However, a critical knowledge gap is the neurobiology underlying intergenerational obesity in humans.
The extend to which maternal obesity programs central regulation of food intake and related behaviors is
unknown. The first 1,000 days, the period from conception to age two, is critical for the prevention of childhood
obesity. Therefore, an understanding of neurobiological and behavioral underpinnings during this window of
developmental plasticity will inform an innovative approach to childhood obesity prevention. This proposal will
address current knowledge gaps through two complimentary studies: In study 1, a secondary analysis of a
deeply-phenotyped pre-birth cohort (5R01MH113883), we will (1) determine the impact of pre-pregnancy obesity
on newborn regulatory behaviors and brain connectivity in networks supporting reward sensitivity and inhibitory
control and (2) determine whether variation in newborn self-regulation and brain connectivity is associated with
body mass index z-score trajectories from birth to two years. We will also design an innovative pilot study (study
2) to evaluate the extent to which neonatal brain connectivity measures and maternal obesity are associated
with longitudinal changes in eating behaviors and self-regulation from birth to two years. In both studies, analysis
of gestational neurotrophic adipokines and dietary inflammation will provide further insight into potential
metabolic targets. This will be the first study in humans to use prenatal dietary assessments, advanced
multimodal imaging, infant neurobehavior assessments, and longitudinal growth modelling, while leveraging the
biology of adipocytes, to comprehensively characterize a neurobiobehavioral model of intergenerational obesity.
Through a rigorous career development plan, the candidate will build on her strong research foundation and
achieve five training goals: (1) gain in-depth knowledge of the neurobiology of eating behaviors and develop
skills in neuroimaging acquisition/analysis; (2) acquire knowledge and skills in inflammatory/adipokine biomarker
assessment methodologies; (3) broaden knowledge in dietary assessment tools and analysis; (4) strengthen
skills in causal mediation analyses; (5) master assessments of early markers of self-regulation and executive
function. By the end of the training period, the candidate will position herself uniquely to achieve her goal of
becoming an R01-funded independent investigator leading an innovative multidisciplinary research program
investigating the neurocognitive basis of intergenerational obesity and potential metabolic targets during
pregnancy."
10991637,"Chronic pediatric liver disease is a devastating group of conditions that have a profound effect on children, their families, and our society. Biliary atresia and the other cholestatic liver diseases studied by the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) account for approximately half of liver transplants performed in children in the United States. A better understanding of the diseases studied by this network will help provide better care of patients with chronic liver disease. The gaps in our current knowledge regarding these diseases provide compelling scientific justification for the continuation of this multi-center network.
The primary goal of this proposal is to continue longitudinal cohort studies and collect biosamples for potential ancillary studies in rare pediatric liver diseases that include: biliary atresia; Alagille syndrome; alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency; progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis syndromes; bile acid synthesis defects; mitochondrial hepatopathies; idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The SDCC for the ChiLDReN study is charged with providing coordination, communications and logistical support, clinical study design, centralized data management, biosample management, quality assurance, and analytical support to the research sites and the NIDDK Project Scientist for all ChiLDReN studies."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) typically results from mutations in the DMD gene that
disrupt the open reading frame, resulting in no dystrophin protein, whereas the milder Becker
muscular dystrophy (BMD) typically results from mutations that allow expression of a partially
functional dystrophin protein. Current therapeutic approaches in trials are directed toward
expression of micro-dystrophin proteins. However, their success will likely ameliorate DMD into
a BMD-like phenotype. We seek to develop a personalized medicine approach. Our long-term
goal is to develop vectors that maximize RNA splice alteration efficiency to provide the best
potential outcome for individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that this vectorized exon
skipping will provide a universally robust exon skipping response, leading to therapies with
significant efficacy. For particularly rare mutations, such as single exon duplications within the
rod domain of dystrophin, these may be considered personalized or bespoke therapies intended
to alter the use of the existing exons within the DMD locus to express full-length dystrophin—the
best potential therapeutic outcome. For other more common mutations, such as certain out-of-
frame rod domain deletions, these will be applicable to broader patient populations; based upon
both our published studies in mice and our publicly presented data in the infant Dup2 patient, we
can expect more robust exon skipping and protein expression than that seen with PMO therapies.
We also propose to fully characterize two new mouse models of utility to the muscular dystrophy
community. Our rationale for this project is that a systematic approach to vector design, efficacy
assessment, and evaluation of toxicity, along with early engagement with the FDA, will lead to a
streamlined path toward vector development. The immediate impact of our work will be data to
support our ongoing engagement with the FDA in developing rapid approaches to personalized
gene therapies based upon programmatic (U7snRNA) vector development in cell-line models,
obviating the need for large animal studies."
10992579,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (From Parent Grant Application)
The bone marrow niche houses hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cells that self-renew and differentiate into vital
blood components like white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. HSCs are supported by other marrow
resident cells, like vascular endothelial cells and stromal cells, that nourish the marrow with essential signals.
Unfortunately, radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat cancer patients injure the bone marrow niche.
Damaged bone marrow function places patients at potentially fatal risks from low blood counts. Because blood
cancers are exquisitely sensitive to radiation, targeted radiation delivery via radioimmunotherapy, or target-
specific antibodies stably linked to radioactive isotopes, has been developed to treat hematologic malignancies,
though some have with slow bone marrow recovery. Despite increasing clinical trials evaluating
radioimmunotherapies, how these delivered radionuclides impact the cellular, molecular, and systemic
mechanisms that regulate the bone marrow niche has yet to be identified. The impact of radioimmunotherapy
on the bone marrow niche must be addressed if radioimmunotherapies are to gain traction, and specifics on
these mechanisms can be leveraged to minimize radiation-induced marrow toxicity. Further complicating the
utility of radioimmunotherapy, radionuclides have distinct payload characteristics with unknown consequences
on the bone marrow niche. This proposal will uncover the differential effects of an alpha-emitter (astatine-211)
and a beta-emitter (yttrium-90) compared to non-targeted X-ray radiation to procure essential knowledge to
advance these technologies clinically. We will report how these radiation types differentially regulate the
abundance and function of HSCs, endothelial and stromal cells, essential regulators of hematologic function. We
will also compare how radiation targeting impacts bone marrow components by comparing how
radioimmunotherapy using a broad hematologic marker (CD45) and more restricted surface marker (CD33)
impacts bone marrow components. Experimentally, we will use in vivo competitive transplantation assays in mice
to assess long-term and short-term HSC potential as a function of radioimmunotherapy. These studies will be
coupled with flow cytometry to quantify how radiation type regulates hematopoietic, vascular, and stromal cell
frequency, death, and proliferation. We will leverage cutting-edge confocal imaging with thick femur sections to
understand how radioimmunotherapy differentially regulates the three-dimensional bone marrow architecture,
critical for vascular niche function and hematologic recovery from irradiation. More importantly, differential gene
expression in the HSC, endothelial and stromal cell compartments, as a response to differential radionuclide
delivery, will also be quantified using RNA sequence analyses. The results from these experiments stand to
identify mechanisms responsible for radiation injury in HSCs, and the endothelial and stromal cell response
systems that can be manipulated to derive a desired clinical outcome, and give providers the tools to accelerate
bone marrow recovery, or inhibit residual hematopoiesis as desired in bone marrow stem cell transplantation."

Suicide risk is increasing in preteens, 8-12 years old. Although research is limited, it is estimated that 15% of
preteens in community samples and 43% in clinical samples have thought about suicide, and 3% in community
and 18% in clinical samples of preteens have attempted suicide. Further, the suicide death rate among
preteens has more than tripled over the past 15 years, disproportionally affecting youth of color (who make up
~1/3rd of the youth in our current work). Alarmingly, other than prevalence rates, we know very little about
suicide risk in preteens. Specifically, we have limited understanding of key risk factors related to suicidal
thoughts and behaviors in this age group. Our knowledge of suicide risk has been limited by the paucity of
developmentally appropriate tools to assess suicidal thoughts, and relevant risk factors, in preteens. Critically,
we know that suicide risk fluctuates over time (i.e., day-to-day) in both adults and adolescents. As such, it is
critical not only to develop assessments of lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors appropriate for preteens,
but also to develop tools to examine how risk fluctuates over time, particularly during high-risk periods.
The overall objective of this proposal is to address these critical gaps in knowledge by adapting and validating
a time-varying measure of suicide risk for preteens, based on our established measure of suicide risk used
with teens in our current multi-site R01. Aim 1 adapts our team’s existing measure of suicide risk used with 12-
18 year-olds into a developmentally and culturally appropriate measure of suicide risk for preteens. This aim
will be achieved by a two-stage approach consisting of expert input (stage 1), and interviews with 15 preteen
and caregiver dyads (stage 2), recruited from three diverse sites (Rutgers, Old Dominion University,
Massachusetts General Hospital). Feedback will be obtained about the assessment of suicidal thoughts,
suicidal behaviors, and candidate risk factors for preteens. For the current application, we strategically targeted
time-varying and potentially modifiable risk factors to optimize translational potential. Aim 2 uses the measure
from Aim 1 to establish phenotypes of suicide risk among preteens consisting of self-reported risk, as well as
objectively measured factors like sleep disturbance, acquired from a wrist worn biosensor. We will address this
aim by conducting a 28-day intensive longitudinal monitoring study with multiple informants—preteens, who
have just been discharged from acute psychiatric care settings, and one caregiver (n=150 dyads). Aim 3
examines, in the same preteen sample as Aim 2, how these phenotypes predict risk for suicidal thoughts,
suicidal behaviors, and other suicide-related events (e.g., rehospitalizations) across a 6-month follow-up."
10996477,"Project Summary
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic food allergen- and immune-mediated disease that exerts a significant
clinical and financial burden worldwide. Interleukin (IL)-13 is an essential mediator of EoE due to its pleotropic
effects on esophageal inflammation and tissue remodeling. We have identified IL-13 as a critical mediator of
increased mitochondrial mass in esophageal epithelial cells. We further demonstrate that IL-13-mediated
alterations in mitochondrial mass are dependent upon JAK/STAT signaling and contribute to EoE-associated
epithelial remodeling. These findings support our overarching hypothesis that IL-13 in the EoE inflammatory
milieu activates STAT signaling in esophageal epithelium to drive alterations in mitochondrial biology that
promote EoE pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will define the direct molecular mechanisms through
which IL-13 signaling regulates mitochondrial biology (Aim 1) and the functional significance of these findings
with regard to EoE-associated tissue remodeling (Aim 2). The proposed studies will illuminate the IL-
13/STAT/mitochondria axis as a novel player in EoE pathobiology. The research proposal, coupled with the
tailored training plan, will provide outstanding career and professional development opportunities for the
applicant under the guidance of the co-mentors who have relevant expertise in esophageal biology (Whelan)

10997007,"Adverse social drivers/determinants of health (SDOH) such as food, housing, and income insecurity (hereby
referred to as social risk factors) can have significant impact on an infant’s health and may exacerbate health
inequities. To reduce health burdens and improve clinical decision-making, it is necessary to understand how
social risk factors are associated with hospital readmissions among infants in the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU). However, measuring social risk factors is challenging, as SDOH are not well documented in the
electronic health record (EHR), and current EHR platforms lack screening tools to identify social risk factors in
NICU clinical settings. Patient clinical notes contain a wealth of SDOH information, but researchers face the
challenge of manually reviewing and extracting this information, which is time-consuming. The objective of
this proposal is to: 1) leverage natural language processing to identify and extract social risk factors
from unstructured clinical note EHR data of NICU patients and 2) understand how unmet social risk
factors predict hospital readmissions among infants discharged from the NICU using both structured
and unstructured EHR data. To achieve this objective, this study will fine-tune developed Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on NICU clinical notes to improve their ability to
recognize and extract social risk factors (Aim 1). Investigators will be able to better identify and classify infants
with food, housing, and income insecurity, and understand how social risk factors are characterized in NICU
clinical notes. The performance, validation, and generalizability of these models will be evaluated with standard
metrics. Additionally, this study will assess how social risk factors are associated with 30-day hospital
readmission among infants discharged from the NICU (Aim 2). Our central hypothesis is we will be able to
uncover additional information related to a patient’s experience with social risk factors, and these risk factors
will be associated with higher rates of 30-day hospital readmission. We will explore how associational effect
estimates change using solely structured data (diagnosis codes) compared to using both structured and
unstructured data. This project will advance steps to streamline and automate the extraction of valuable SDOH
data from clinical notes and guide clinical decision-making in NICU care. The long-term goal of this project is
to harness the power of advanced data science methods to optimize patientcare and management for unmet
social needs and to improve health equity thus reducing health utilization outcomes. This research aligns well
with NIMHD’s Division of Clinical and Health Service Research. The proposed training, guided by an expert
mentorship team, will enrich the applicant’s knowledge of and skills in clinical informatics for health disparities,
data science for social epidemiology, and natural language processing for classification tasks. The content
expertise, research competency, and training in quantitative methods the applicant will receive will prepare her
well to improve scientific knowledge and clinical practice in her career as an independent researcher."

Within the small intestinal epithelium, tuft cells are a rare chemosensory cell type (less than 1% of cells), defined
by their unique morphology consisting of large apical protrusions that extend over 2 μm into the lumen. Tuft cells
have been implicated in sensing intestinal parasites and activating an immune response and are therefore
recognized for their importance in maintaining the health of the intestinal epithelium. Tuft cell morphology is
defined by a unique cytoskeletal structure consisting of giant bundles of actin filaments, which support an array
of large apical membrane protrusions (a “tuft”) while extending over 6 μm down into the cell’s perinuclear region.
Despite their role in activating an immune response against intestinal parasites, tuft cells remain understudied
due to their rarity in the intestinal epithelium. As a result, there is a gap in our understanding of how the unique
cytoskeletal architecture found in tuft cells contributes to the physiological function of this cell type. My preliminary
research identified LIM domain and actin binding 1 (LIMA1) as a tuft cell enriched factor that localizes specifically
to the basal ends of core actin bundles that extend deep into the sub-apical cytoplasm. Previous studies indicate
that LIMA1 can cross-link actin, inhibit actin depolymerization, and inhibit actin branching in vitro, which are all
molecular activates that tuft cells could use to promote the formation of giant actin bundles. Based on my
preliminary data and previous studies in the literature, I hypothesize that LIMA1 drives the formation of the
giant actin bundles found in tuft cells. Under Aim 1, I will test this hypothesis by establishing how LIMA1
expression impacts the formation of actin bundles in an intestinal cell culture model. In addition, I will use live
cell imaging and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize LIMA1 dynamics on actin
bundles and determine if LIMA1 expression impacts the dynamics of actin turnover in decorated bundles. In Aim
2, I will determine whether LIMA1 expression is required for tuft cell actin bundle formation. Because tuft cells
are not represented in intestinal epithelial cell culture models, I will instead use a LIMA1 knockout mouse model
and visualize de novo tuft cell development in the context of intestinal organoids derived from these animals.
This research seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular machinery underpinning the
unique morphology of tuft cell. The insights derived from this project will additionally help us understand how tuft
cells contribute to gastrointestinal physiology, immune sensing, and human health issues caused by intestinal
parasites and for inflammatory illnesses such as Crohn’s Disease."

Drug overdose resulted in 106,699 deaths in the U.S. in 2021, an age- adjusted rate of 32.4 per 100,000
population, a 14% increase over 2020, and the highest rate ever recorded.1 Beyond overdose, injection opioid
and methamphetamine use are driving up rates of HIV infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and
endovascular and soft tissue bacterial infections.2 The overdose crisis has also affected Canada and Mexico,
leading to a call for a North American approach to addressing the overdose crisis. Simulation models provide a
structured environment for decision makers to compare the predicted effects of proposed policy alternatives
over an extended time horizon on population-level outcomes such as overdose, HIV, and HCV. Several public
agencies are currently funding overdose simulation modeling efforts in North America, including NIDA, CDC,

Since the last North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) eosinophilic
gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) single-topic symposium over 16 years ago, EGIDs have emerged as a
leading cause of GI inflammatory disorders with an increasing prevalence of over 200,000 children and adults
in the United States. There have been over 40 clinical trials published during that time, including the first FDA
approved eosinophilic esophagitis biologic therapy, innovations such as unsedated endoscopy and esophageal
function testing, and a more advanced understanding of EGID pathophysiology. These advances have
resulted in an urgent unmet need for an updated targeted scientific review conference on pediatric
EGIDs.
The EXCEL Single Topic Symposium: EGID Xcelerating Care, Research and Innovation in an Evolving
Landscape one-day symposium will be held the day prior to the NASPGHAN Annual Meeting at the Diplomat
Hotel in Hollywood, FL on November 6, 2024. Our objective is to bring together a multidisciplinary audience of
physicians, researchers, advanced practice providers, dietitians, allergists, pathologists, and patients and
patient advocacy groups to share their unique perspectives and expertise with a broad anticipated audience of
500-800 participants. Topics will include cutting edge information on basic, translational, and clinical trial
research, as well as innovations in EGID diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment options in the pediatric
population.
This symposium will place particular emphasis on the recruitment and inclusion of young investigators to
connect the next generation of talent with mentorship and collaborations and give voice to their top priorities for
future research in the field of pediatric EGIDs. To this end, small group mentoring and career planning
sessions, as well as multiple events in our SPARK! initiative (a Supportive Platform for Advancing Research
and Knowledge) are specifically targeted to bring together participants across the career spectrum. Junior
investigator abstracts will be solicited and highlighted in oral and poster presentation settings with emphasis on
discussion, mentorship, and collaboration. Early Career Travel Awards will be provided to qualified trainees
(graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) and junior faculty (<5 years from start of first faculty position) to help
defer the cost of travel, lodging and registration. NASPGHAN, the NASPGHAN Diversity Committee, and the
EXCEL STS planning committee have collaborated to create a program that promotes diversity throughout our
organizing committee, proposed speakers, moderators, and panel discussants. We will communicate all
EXCEL STS findings to the wider EGID community with published abstracts and conference proceedings."

This Research Project (RP) aims to develop an adaptation of the Collaborative Life Skills Program (CLS) that
will be supported by mHealth technology. CLS is an evidence-based intervention for 2nd-5th grade children with
ADHD that is delivered in schools through coordinated efforts among school mental health providers, teachers,
and parents. School mental health providers are trained to coordinate evidence-based teacher- (i.e., Daily
Behavioral Report Card) and parent-mediated (i.e., Behavioral Parent Training) behavioral interventions, and
lead child social and organizational skills training groups. The adapted intervention, which integrates mHealth
technology (CLS-M), will improve the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of CLS in schools with limited
resources serving children from low-socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic/racial minority (ERM) backgrounds,
reducing disparities in access to evidence-based ADHD interventions in these populations. Barriers to service
use in schools where low-SES and ERM families are most likely to receive services include logistical constraints
(e.g., time, transportation, childcare, work schedules), perceptual barriers (e.g., cultural mistrust, stigma,
perceived efficacy), and insufficient resources (e.g., staff, time, consultation support). Building on our prior
research, we will develop and test a fully functional web-based mHealth application to support CLS-M that
includes an integrated user portal for school mental health providers, teachers, and parents. It will also include
separate interfaces that support key features to facilitate each person’s role in CLS implementation at school or
at home, such as access to shared information about child assessments, goals, and automatically generated
graphs of child Daily Behavioral Report Card performance. Messaging features will facilitate communication
among school mental health providers, parents, and teachers, and calendar features that integrate with third-
party calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar) will facilitate scheduling, meeting tracking, and sharing links
to third-party videoconferencing applications (e.g., Zoom). Based on stakeholder feedback from school
administrators, school mental health providers, teachers, and parents, we will work with mobile application
developers to design a fully functional web-based mHealth application prototype to support the CLS-M protocol.
We will then test and refine the prototype through a series of individual usability tests and an open feasibility trial.
We will also collect formative data from stakeholders in rural schools in Imperial County to inform future research
on adapting CLS-M for low-SES and ERM families served in this setting. Finally, we will conduct a Hybrid Type
I cluster randomized trial in 24 schools in a large urban school district, to evaluate whether CLS-M results in
acceptable implementation outcomes and improved child outcomes in comparison to usual school services. The
specific aims are to 1) Develop CLS-M and test its usability, feasibility, and acceptability among key stakeholders;
2) Collect formative data to inform future CLS-M adaptations for families living in rural settings; and 3) Evaluate
CLS-M implementation and impact on child outcomes relative to typical school services."
11002157,"RESEARCH CAPACITY CORE – ABSTRACT
The NYC-MEHSJ Research Capacity Core (RCC) will strengthen the productivity of the research projects, the
quality of pilot projects, and the overall research capabilities of faculty scholars and researchers at the City
College of New York (CCNY). Recurring emphasis will be on research that can potentially eliminate or reduce
health disparities (HD). Conceptual prowess and practical familiarity with relevant research and analytical
techniques are critical to research excellence and productivity; therefore, this core will focus on equipping and
supporting our investigators with technical resources and cognitive skills through technology workshops, hands-
on training, team-building initiatives to encourage collaborative efforts, and optimized access to research
equipment and resources currently scattered across the campus. Led by a team of senior researchers from
diverse disciplines, the capacity-building resources and services administered through this core will be organized
under four interwoven themes. The Research Technology Resource will mobilize critical research cores and
instrumentation operations across campus to create a coordinated research infrastructure network accessible to
Center investigators and campus researchers at large. Hands-on training in the concepts and applications of
cutting-edge equipment and techniques will be provided to strengthen researcher capabilities in conceiving,
designing, conducting, and analyzing innovative and HD-related research at the cutting edge of their fields. The
Research Design and Analytics Resource will deploy a full-time doctoral-level professional as well as
biostatisticians and bioinformaticists to provide CCNY with expert consultations in rigorous research design and
hands-on data analytics across scientific disciplines. We will establish a service that includes hardware and staff
support in data structures, data warehousing, data analytics, and communications tools consistent with NIH’s
ongoing emphasis on research rigor and reproducibility. The Research Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resource
will build on the reality that AI tools and concepts are defining the next frontiers of research and innovation across
disciplines, whereas significant challenges related to HD persist. We will develop and deploy data tools, learning
algorithms, and devices for detecting and debiasing AI systems, particularly those used in biomedical,
behavioral, and clinical HD-related research. Core tools developed or acquired, from EHR to diagnostic and
language tools, will be available to our researchers, along with training to deploy them in their research. The
Community Participation Resource will work intimately with the Community Engagement Core and with
investigators to implement proven strategies for engaging served communities in research co-ideation,
community participation in ongoing research, strategizing to improve access to healthcare-related technologies,
and provide communication support for our investigators whose research involves access to clinical or
community-drawn participants. We expect these resources and services to strengthen the proposed research
projects and the anticipated pilot projects and raise the overall HD research quality and productivity at CCNY."
11006004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People living with HIV demonstrate increased incidence of lung inflammation and HIV is an independent risk
factor development of COPD. In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with markedly improved life expectancy,
lung related chronic conditions like COPD and bacterial pneumonia are primarily responsible for increased
morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV patients die of non-AIDS comorbidities almost a
decade earlier that their non-HIV counterparts. Identifying the pathophysiological mechanism and treatment of
HIV-associated comorbidities is very complex in chronic lung diseases, even with ART. TGF-β signaling
upregulated by HIV Tat, and Tat itself alters the microRNAome of the airway epithelium. MicroRNAs play
important roles in lung health and diseases and their dysregulation can serve as pathological hallmarks of several
lung diseases. TGF-β signaling, plays a vital role in the progression of chronic airway diseases like COPD and
lung infections. This is important since we have shown that TGF-β can increase the viral burden in the airway
thereby establishing a positive feedback loop mechanism. HIV Tat and TGF-β1 upregulates miR-126-3p, a
microRNA known to suppress IRS-1 which leads to upregulation of ADAM17 in airway epithelial cells which
leads to impaired mitophagy, senescence and lung inflammation in vitro and in vivo.
The current proposal focuses on determining the pathophysiological mechanism and rescue by which HIV-
associated COPD through TGF-β alter the microRNAome to mediate suppression of critical genes in mitophagy
leading to defective mitophagy, senescence and inflammation. Aim 1 will identify a novel crosstalk between the
defective microRNAome, IRS-1 and ADAM17 with downstream effects on mitochondrial homeostasis,
senescence, and inflammation in the context of HIV and CS. We will validate this pathway using miRNA mimics
and antagomiRs in vitro and in vivo on lung inflammation in air and CS-exposed SP-C Tat transgenic. Aim 2 will
test therapeutic approaches given that miRNA target sites differ among different genes regulated by the same
miRNA, editing the miR-126-3p target site on IRS-1 3’ UTR will preserve IRS-1 levels in the context of HIV and
CS thereby restoring baseline mitophagy, senescence and mitigating inflammation in EcoHIV mouse models of
HIV infection."
11008791,"Project Summary:
Disease often stems from cellular dysfunction, and single-cell transcriptomics has been instrumental in unveiling
the incredible diversity of cell types and advancing our understanding of their roles in health and disease. Yet,
cells do not operate in isolation. Recognizing the spatial relationships between cells, in addition to their individual
molecular profiles, offers crucial insights into cellular organization and communication, revealing the intricate
networks that underlie both normal development and disease pathways. These intercellular dialogues serve as
the foundation for most disease progressions and can be targeted to gain insights and potentially reverse the
disease course.
At Survey Genomics, we have developed Cytope-drop, an innovative approach for spatial barcoding of individual
cells that enables high-throughput spatially-resolved multiomics (transcriptome, cell surface proteins, etc.).
Cytope-drop integrates with existing droplet-based single-cell sequencing workflows, delivers gold-standard
single-cell multiomic data, and does not require additional capital equipment. In this resubmission, we propose
to further increase the spatial resolution of Cytope-drop to 50-um, scale manufacturing capabilities, and achieve
FFPE sample compatibility. Through these activities, Survey Genomics aims to bring to the market a product
that enables researchers to perform single cell analysis while obtaining spatial context simultaneously.
Cytope-drop compares favorably to a number of approaches that have emerged for spatial transcriptomics.
Current sequencing and imaging based spatial transcriptomic approaches focus on localizing transcripts,
whereas Cytope-drop focuses on localizing cells and obtains mRNA abundances, protein abundances, and cell
locations for the same cells in a single assay. Compared to existing commercially available spatial
transcriptomics methods, our approach stands out in several key ways: 1) no capital equipment costs, 2) delivers
true single-cell molecular profiles, 3) multimodal data (including RNA expression, protein expression, chromatin
accessibility, etc.), 4) high-throughput capacity, and 5) compatibility with current single-cell processing
techniques.
In summary, our proposal aims to develop and commercialize the only platform to-date that delivers mRNA
abundances, protein abundances, and cell locations for the same cells in a single assay. Survey
Genomics is uniquely poised to deliver on the proposed aims with our world-class team extensively
experienced in single-cell and spatial genomics, established manufacturing and financing partners, and
strong IP position. True single-cell data with spatial context, low cost, and high throughput position Cytope-

11008589,"Within living cells, proteins are the primary cellular machinery, performing most biological functions. Aberrant protein
expression or modification often leads to cellular dysfunction that causes illness and disease. Thus, an improved
understanding of how proteins change within cells in response to disease progression is needed. These quantitative
measurements of changes in proteins and their modifications are necessary for improved biological models of cellular
function. More accurate and detailed mechanisms of disease transformation will improve diagnostics and allow rational
design of new treatments. To gain as complete a picture as possible of cellular state, proteomics aims to identify and
characterize all the proteins and their proteoforms in a biological sample. Such proteomic analyses are challenging due to
the large number of proteins expressed, the large dynamic range of protein relative abundance, the dynamic nature of
protein expression, the numerous biologically essential modifications, and the loss of proteins by surface adsorption. The
diverse structures and complexity of cells complicates the initial purification and preparation of proteomic samples.
Currently, there is a movement within the field of proteomics to improve single cell analyses to better understand cellular
heterogeneity, which is critical to understanding the mechanisms of disease and response to treatment. To help overcome
these challenges, a new microfluidic/nanofluidic sample preparation platform is proposed to provide efficient extraction
of proteins from the cellular milieu, removal of contaminants, and protein denaturation. This platform will be integrated
into both top-down and bottom-up workflows and is expected to overcome the longstanding challenge of reliably
providing solubilized proteins with negligible contaminants and ion-suppressing agents for top-down proteomics. For
bottom-up proteomics, an additional advantage of improved protein denaturation is anticipated. Additionally, the
proposed microfluidic/nanofluidic systems are well-suited for the preparation of samples down to the single-cell level.
The Aims include fundamental studies of the protein purification process and measurement of the anticipated
improvement in both top-down and bottom-up proteome analyses. If successful, this application will provide a widely
accessible system for low input and single-cell proteomics sample preparation that will significantly improve the depth of
proteome coverage and speed of single-cell proteomics."
11007805,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the brain may lead to HIV-Associated Neurocognitive
Disorder (HAND). HAND is characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments and the disorder
remains prevalent even in the combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) era. In HAND, one way that HIV is
able to exert its neurotoxic effects in the central nervous system (CNS) is through the actions of viral proteins,
such as the envelope glycoprotein gp120 (gp120). Studies have linked HIV infection in the CNS to increased
intracellular accumulation of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, and Aβ aggregation may promote neurotoxicity and
neuroinflammation. Notably, it is unclear what the mechanisms underlying Aβ accumulation in HAND are.
Studies have shown that gp120 may be internalized into neurons and lead to neuronal degeneration, and
preliminary data shows that gp120 may induce Aβ. In this project, I will investigate gp120 induced endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress as a mechanism for increased Aβ accumulation in HAND. I will show that the HIV
envelope protein gp120 leads to increased buildup of Aβ, as well as ER stress and ER calcium depletion. I will
also show that blocking gp120 from binding to microtubules prevents gp120 from traveling towards ER,
disrupting ER function, and inducing Aβ aggregation. Finally, I will investigate whether markers of ER stress
may be used as biomarkers in HAND. To do this, I will use a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods,
protein quantification methods, and calcium imaging. In addition, I will utilize samples of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from people living with HIV and employ mass spectrometry to investigate the correlation between levels
of Aβ and gp120, as well as levels of ER stress proteins and gp120. Together, this set of experiments may
suggest that gp120 induced disruption of ER homeostasis is associated with Aβ accumulation in the CNS. This
research at Georgetown University is important for our current understanding of HAND mechanisms and will
provide me with the training necessary to help me achieve my long-term goals as a molecular researcher."
11007922,"Project Summary Abstract Evimero NCATS P1 OPE Project
In the proposed work, we examine the feasibility of using target-specific polyclonal antibodies to intercept and
neutralize bioactive molecules in the gut microbiome milieu of humans with microbiome-driven inflammation
and loss of gut barrier function. Such molecules are the “bridge” between a taxonomically-disordered, or
dysbiotic microbiome, and the deleterious effects such microbiomes can have on human tissue. Upregulated
inflammatory signaling and loss of barrier integrity are two general, systems biology-level changes common to
multiple microbiome-associated disorders (MADS); by demonstrating our ability to neutralize these core
mediators of pathology, we will establish the feasibility, and prove the concept, of our approach.
The present project is enabled by work done by our collaborators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who
identified six protein classes as overabundant in metaproteomic surveys of fecal microbiomes of those with
inflammatory disorders of the gut (the “ORNL Protein Examples,” or “OPEs.”) Each of these proteins has
known impacts on colonic inflammation, loss of barrier function, or both, from prior studies. Here, we explore
neutralization of their impacts by polyclonal antibodies extracted from the eggs of laying hens immunized with
the target proteins of interest. Known as IgY (immunoglobulin Y), these antibodies have cost and performance
advantages superior to either monoclonal antibodies or mammalian polyclonals. In this study’s Specific Aims
we 1) Determine the impact of each OPE in a sophisticated human stem-cell-derived in vitro model of human
colonic epithelia and discover optimal exposure levels generating inflammatory or barrier-loss signals, and then
2) Determine the ability of each IgY antibody to neutralize those physiological impacts in the same model.
Information gleaned from this project will support our broad, long-term objectives, modulating microbiome
milieus to restore those protective pathways by mitigating damaging ones. Once the principle of selective,
polyclonal antibody-mediated functional modulation has been demonstrated here, we will be well-positioned to
obtain support for more ambitious – and costly – primary studies in multi-omics (metagenomics, metabolomics,
metaproteomics). These studies, assisted by artificial intelligence/machine learning, will generate detailed
microbiome molecular “maps,” revealing critical microbiome pathways (CMPs) that mediate final impact of
dysbiosis on the host. Those pathways will identify specific “nodes” at which a pathway can take a health-
promoting or health-impairing direction. Those nodes will represent specific proteins whose inhibition will tip
the prevailing balance in a favorable direction – and become the final, precise targets for our antibody-mediated
neutralization. We expect to combine multiple individually-targeted IgY antibodies into a new family of drugs
called critical microbiome pathway inhibitors (CMPIs), rationally designed to block multiple critical pathways
in a coordinated fashion that will ultimately be preventive or curative of many different MADs."
11007679,"Rates of syphilis in the U.S. have increased each year for the past 20 years and are elevated in people living
with HIV (PWH). PWH are at higher risk of syphilis complications including neurosyphilis. For decades, the
mainstay of syphilis treatment monitoring has been the serum nontreponemal antibody (NTr) titer (usually
RPR). Guidelines suggest NTr titers should decline by ≥4-fold at 12 months in adequately treated patients with
primary or secondary and 24 months in PWH or those with latent syphilis. Yet, a significant percentage (~12%)
of patients with syphilis will exhibit “serological non-response” (i.e. although asymptomatic, they have a <4-fold
decline in NTr titer). Others (1.2-24%) will exhibit “serologic failure” (i.e. asymptomatic but exhibit a sustained
>=4-fold increase in NTr titers in the absence of reinfection). Guidelines recommend those with serologic
failure should undergo lumbar puncture (LP), while serologic non-responders should be retreated with 3 doses
of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) and considered for LP, at least if follow up is uncertain or an initial high NTr
titer (>1:32) in latent syphilis does not decline. The concern in these individuals is for undiagnosed central
nervous system (CNS) infection, which could lead over time to relapse or progression to symptomatic
neurosyphilis (SNS). However, LPs come with risks and logistical challenges, additional antibiotics may not be
benign, and healthcare-related costs can be high. Currently, the best management approach (and whether LPs
and additional antibiotics are necessary) for PWH who exhibit serological non-response and serological failure
is uncertain, mainly because, in the antibiotic era, data on long term SNS outcomes in these patients are
lacking. Longitudinal data on incident SNS in PWH comparing those with appropriate serologic response,
serologic failure and serologic non-response following initial treatment are needed to inform often confusing
treatment guidelines. Prospective trials would be ideal but are impractical given the decades of follow-up and
large number of participants needed to identify this relatively uncommon outcome. We therefore propose to
leverage the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort-a dynamic and well characterized group followed from 1990-
2024 to 1. Determine SNS incidence over time in PWH with treated syphilis and compare the incidence in
three groups: a. those who exhibit serologic non-response (i.e. <4 fold decline in NTr) b. serologic failure (i.e.
sustained ≥4 fold increase in NTr after treatment) and c. those with appropriate serological response, and 2.
Determine whether additional interventions (e.g. CSF examination and/or type and duration of antibiotic
treatment) among persons with serologic non-response or failure, are associated with improved serological
and clinical (i.e. development of SNS) outcomes. The results of this study have the potential to change national
policy, reducing unnecessary lumbar punctures and potentially antibiotic treatment in PWH with serologic non-
response or even serologic failure after initial syphilis treatment."

The overwhelming majority of older adults, age 65 and over, want to age in place at home, but many reach a
point in their lives where they can no longer live in their own home simply because they are unable to complete
their activities of daily living (ADLs) and move around their home safely and effectively. The facts are that only
10% of homes in the US have the accommodations needed for mobility (only 5.8% of the homes in
Pennsylvania and New York are considered “aging-ready”), yet an estimated 35% of older adults and most
people over age 85 have mobility limitations. These limitations are most often the result of the onset of multiple
chronic conditions including arthritis, heart disease and chronic lung disease. Mobility limitations can have life-
changing impacts even when the older adult is living with a companion because mobility limitations often result
in higher rates of disease, disability, and hospitalization due to falls. One in three older adults fall annually, and
one out of five falls in older adults result in serious injury. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death
among adults ages 65 and older[1].
Home modifications and accommodations that make homes safer and more accessible include stair lifts, grab
bars, and bath/shower adaptations and renovations. However, the current fall-prevention products available in
the market are not meeting older adults' needs for mobility aids. Product innovation has stagnated, and too
often, tight spaces and placement restrictions make installation of grab bars and other devices difficult or
impossible. There is a significant need and consumer demand for an easily installable, reliable system that
allows end users to adapt mobility aids such as grab bars, railings, and other assistive devices in their homes.
The current situation for many people with mobility impairments is that even when an outdated product is
available, installation of these essential mobility assistance devices requires expensive contractors. And, once
installed, these devices are not able to be adapted by the end user as their needs evolve and change.
Our objective is to further develop and commercialize a novel system and attachments to improve the
accessibility of living spaces and serve as a foundation for mobility aids to support successful aging-in-place.
Once the product is installed, our modular, expandable rail system can be easily adapted with interchangeable
accessories that solve a range of mobility problems in the home. When not configured for a particular mobility
need, the rail can be hidden by a decorative cover to mimic architectural trim work. We have successfully
demonstrated feasibility of a system in the completed first phase of this project and now seek SBIR Phase II
funding to (1) perform a comprehensive design review and establish priority for developing attachments using
a focus group research approach; (2) redesign components, taking into account all feedback from the design
review, and manufacture production parts; and (3) perform studies to evaluate the usability of the product from
the perspectives of various stakeholders, and test its performance in the University of Pittsburgh Healthy Home
Laboratory and in the homes of volunteers. Upon completion of the grant, we will manufacture and distribute
the product through our own company, other home modification specialists, commercial and residential
contractors, direct-to-consumers online and in big box retail stores."

MECHANISMS OF AGING
September 24 – 28, 2024 / fall 2026 / fall 2028
The first meeting in the proposed series on the Mechanisms of Aging is to be held in fall 2024 at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory. Since its inception 22 years ago, this conference has arguably become the leading venue for
presentation of the latest progress in aging research, which is a rapidly expanding and fast-moving research
field. This conference has experienced a 27% growth of total participants since 2012, with attendees surpassing
300 in 2018, while the virtual format attracted almost 600 in 2020 and the post-pandemic hybrid format attracted
over 325 in-person and over 200 virtual attendees in 2022. National and international interest continues to
increase, such that over the next three iterations of the meeting, the expectation is that each meeting will bring
together 400-500 scientists from around the world working on different aspects of the molecular genetics of
aging, with an anticipated additional virtual audience of several hundred.
The meeting will provide an in-depth forum for presentation of new findings in different areas of aging research.
The 2024 meeting will include the following 8 platform sessions: Stress Response, Metabolism, Autophagy,
Inflammaging, Quantitative Biomarkers of Aging, Reproductive Aging, Cell Non-Autonomous Regulation of
Aging, and Stem Cells/Reprogramming. Two poster sessions will also be included.
The oral sessions will be chaired by two leading scientists in the field and will feature eight short talks selected
from openly submitted abstracts, which will be evaluated three months before the meeting. This is exceptional
in that it promotes the development of new ideas by facilitating the presentation of late-breaking findings.
Moreover, the meeting routinely accommodates a large percentage of presentations by students and postdocs,
thereby fostering the next generation of young scientists and helping them promote their careers in aging
research. These young researchers will also benefit from organized mentoring and career development activities,
such as small-group lunches with session chairs and career dinners with senior leaders."
10987605,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gastric ulcer is increasing in the United States due to increasing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori infection. It has been a major cause of gastrointestinal surgery with high
morbidity and mortality. While molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with gastric ulcer repair have been
heavily investigated, information on the cell of origin for regenerated epithelium is limited. Microscopically, gastric
ulcer is characterized by mucosal injuries involving the muscularis mucosae and a cavity surrounded by acute
and chronic inflammation. Numbers of acid secreting parietal cells are decreased in the ulcer edges. Parietal
cells are also decreased in preneoplastic lesions such as atrophic gastritis and Ménétrier’s disease. We have
previously demonstrated that parietal cells undergo apoptosis in an atrophic gastritis mouse model. Ménétrier’s
disease is a rare, acquired, premalignant protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy induced by EGF receptor
(EGFR) signaling activation. Ménétrier’s disease also shows decreased number of parietal cells, however,
apoptosis is not changed. This raises the possibility that parietal cells transdifferentiate into other cell types rather
than dying in Ménétrier’s disease.
As a part of my K08 project, we examined the fate of parietal cells in a Ménétrier’s disease mouse model and
observed that parietal cells can give rise to other epithelial cell types. Our preliminary data shows that parietal
cells can transdifferentiate into various other epithelial cell types in another EGFR activated condition gastric
ulcer. Preliminary analysis on single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) comparing normal stomach and gastric
ulcer at day 3 showed upregulated Sox4 expression and activated FoxO signaling pathway in parietal cells from
gastric ulcer. Sox4 and FoxO signaling have been associated with stem cell maintenance, transdifferentiation,
and cancer progression. It has been reported that spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM)
develops at the ulcer edges and plays an important role in gastric ulcer healing. We will investigate if parietal
cells can transdifferentiate into SPEM in gastric ulcer and give rise to other epithelial cell types during gastric
ulcer healing by lineage tracing followed by immunofluorescence microscopy and single cell RNA sequencing.
The role of Sox4 in parietal cell plasticity will also be investigated by knocking out or overexpressing Sox4 in
parietal cells.
Successful completion of the studies proposed in this application will not only provide us with better
understanding of the underlying mechanism of gastric epithelial plasticity but also with a foundation for effective
treatment of gastric ulcer. Also, comparing results from this project with my K08 project will contribute to my long-
term research goal of preventing gastric tumorigenesis and facilitating gastric mucosal regeneration."
10987794,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CD1d-restricted, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) cells play a critical role in regulating the commensal micro-
biota and resistance to mucosal pathogens. Conversely, iNKT cell levels are suppressed by microbiota in early
(pre-weaned), but not later (post-weaned), life. If critical microbial signals are not provided during early-life, co-
lonic iNKT cell levels remain elevated leading to increased susceptibility to colitis in later-life. Recently, we dis-
covered that colon iNKT cells are resident cells that establish themselves in early-life in a pathway controlled
locally by macrophages of fetal origin and a novel stromal cell population that is marked by Wnt4 which are in
turn regulated by the commensal microbiota. The current research proposal addresses the unanswered question
about how this newly identified stromal cell population regulates intestinal iNKT cells in early-life. Our long-term
goals are to parse out the mechanisms that microbes and the host use to establish an iNKT cell niche that
influences mucosal disease such as infection and colitis in later-life. The objective of this research is to better
understand the pathways that regulate iNKT cells in early-life as a paradigm for imprinting cellular residency
during a critical period of development. Our central hypothesis is that a unique early-life colonic stromal cell
population is part of a local tissue niche that directly imprints iNKT cells through bone morphogenic protein (BMP)
signals and determines the host’s susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and enteropathogens in
later-life. Specifically, it is proposed that embryonic macrophages and microbes regulate a unique colonic stromal
cell population that is marked by Wnt4 and determines the tissue receptivity to early-life engraftment of thymic
iNKT cell emigrants through stromal cell-derived cognate (CD1d) and non-cognate (BMP2) signals. The rationale
for our proposed research is that there is very little known about early-life colonic stromal cells and their interac-
tions with immune cells. Our central hypothesis will be tested with four specific aims: 1) determine whether
colonic Wnt4+ stromal cells are an early-life specific population that forms a tissue niche with embryonic macro-
phages to support local iNKT cells; 2) Identify the specific molecules generated from colonic Wnt4+ stromal cells
that could directly support colonic iNKT proliferation during early-life and specifically the role of BMP2; 3) deter-
mine whether Wnt4+ stromal cells specifically imprint colonic iNKT cells during early-life which results in durable
effects that influence later-life disease, and; 4) determine how microbial signals regulate the cell abundance and
transcriptome of colonic Wnt4+ stromal cells during early-life. Specifically, we expect we will show that this dis-
tinctive type of stromal cell forms a tissue niche that supports iNKT cells in early-life (Aim 1) and operates through
BMP2 and CD1d expression (Aim 2) causing durable changes in iNKT cell number and function that impacts
later-life susceptibility to colitis (Aim 3) in pathways that are modulated by commensal microbes during the “win-
dow of opportunity” in early-life (Aim 4). Overall, this proposal is significant because it will define a new population
of early-life stromal cells that are potentially of fetal origin which regulate later-life susceptibility to IBD."

Title: Developing an Innovative Genomic Data Science Curriculum: Interdisciplinary Modules for
Undergraduate Education
Project Abstract
Computational Genomic Data Science (CGDS) combines aspects of genetics, statistics, and
informatics and is becoming increasingly important in biological research. However, CGDS
instruction is rarely integrated into life science curricula at the undergraduate level and is
essentially non-existent at the community college level, predominantly due to lack of faculty
training. An additional barrier at the community college level is lack of access to data sets
suitable for CGDS curriculum development. Leveraging cloud computing resources, like those in
available through the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN) and the All of Us
Research Workbench, we propose an interdisciplinary study integrating CGDS and social
determinants of health that would provide a sustainable educational pathway to a mentored
student research project for community college students. We propose a two-course sequence of
community college biology courses with embedded CGDS curricula that prepares students for
CDGS research or future CGDS studies. Contextualizing the curriculum to genetic studies of
social determinants of health adds a real-life context to the work while giving students the
opportunity to contribute to broader scientific knowledge. Using a peer-led team learning model
supports engagement, retention and success for both students and peer leaders, while
providing CDGS leadership experience for peer leaders. The program supports research and
innovation by: 1) engaging community college students in innovative CDGS research curricular
undergraduate research experiences using AnViL with the opportunity to earn CGDS
microcredentials , 2) cultivating interdisciplinary mentored student research projects among
community college and four-year college that can serve as a bridge to bachelor’s degree
research, and 3) increasing the participation in CGDS research by students underrepresented in
STEM, resulting in participants being co-authors on publications and presenters at scientific
conferences."
10983626,"Project Summary
 The advent of high-throughput genomics and associated data science technologies has enabled
genome-based decisions to improve human personal and public health. The advance of genomic medicine relies
on developing a diverse workforce in computational genomics and data science (CGDS). Critical gaps, however,
hamper the expansion of the genomics workforce: (1) a lack of diversity continues despite decades of effort.
Large sectors of the US population remain underrepresented in CGDS; (2) a lack of access to resources and
training opportunities limits student populations at the undergraduate and master’s levels to obtain the knowledge
and skills needed for a career in CGDS.
 The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is uniquely positioned to address these gaps. Being a
primarily minority-serving institution, with 67% of enrollment from under-represented minority (URM) groups,
UTSA is committed to promoting an inclusive community of learners and narrowing the nationwide gender and
racial gaps in the STEM field. In addition, UTSA has identified biomedical science and data science as
fundamental building blocks for developing its research base. CGDS, a discipline at the interface of biomedical
and data science, is a priority area receiving significant institutional support.
 This proposed UE5 program aims to develop, implement, and evaluate classroom educational content
and cloud-based hands-on analytical exercises in CGDS to serve students from diverse backgrounds, including
those underrepresented in the genomics workforce.
Aim 1. To develop cloud-based instruction materials utilizing existing NIH cloud resources for teaching CGDS
at undergraduate and master’s levels. These materials include lecture slides, video presentations,
demonstrations, hands-on practice problems, assignments, and project ideas, organized into flexible modules
suiting the needs of diverse student backgrounds and learning paths.
Aim 2. To iteratively refine the developed content and modules by teaching them in a hybrid mode across
different departments and collecting feedback from students and faculty.
Aim 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of these materials by conducting formal evaluation and analysis and sharing
with the broader CGDS community at large."
10983491,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating condition characterized by chronic inflammation, leading to
the erosion of essential intestinal functions. The risk of developing IBD, including related diseases like Crohn's
and ulcerative colitis, involves a complex interplay of over 250 genetic and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of
the gut microbiome and pathogen proliferation often worsen the disease pathophysiology. While some
common genetic risk factors, especially those related to the immune system, are well understood, the
functional contributions of most risk alleles remain unclear. Moreover, the majority of known genetic risk factors
have been identified in European ancestry populations, which may not translate to more diverse populations.
Our long-term goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic risk factors contributing to IBD
development. We hypothesize that genetic alterations in intestinal gene function create conditions for
persistent dysbiosis and inflammation, driving IBD. To achieve this, we have established a robust cross-
organismal platform for high-throughput functional profiling of IBD candidate genes, advancing our
understanding of the disease's mechanisms.
We aim to address our hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) conducting high-throughput screening and
phenotypic characterization of IBD risk genes in C. elegans, a nematode microbiome model; and 2) validating
IBD risk alleles in human intestinal organoids (HIOs). Importantly, our research will encompass and integrate
risk alleles from diverse populations, providing a more comprehensive assessment of IBD risk. This study is
significant because it delves into the functional profiling of IBD risk genes at the organismal level, a less-
explored area. Further, it extends its focus to diverse multi-ancestry cohorts, filling a critical gap in
understanding of the disease. The platform developed also has the potential to be used in studying other
microbiome-mediated diseases. Ultimately, this work can enhance our understanding of the genetic
landscapes of IBD, offering both broad functional testing and specific mechanistic insights, which are vital for
the diagnosis and treatment of this prevalent digestive disease."
10983397,"ABSTRACT
Crohn’s disease (CD) pathogenesis includes gene-environment interactions. GWAS have identified >100 CD
susceptibility genes. Among the CD susceptibility genes, LRRK2 is of particular interest. It is associated with
autophagy regulation and is also a Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility gene. The same LRRK2 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that increase susceptibility to PD and CD (G2019S, N2081D) result in
LRRK2 kinase hyperactivity. This is of clinical relevance, as LRRK2-targeted therapies are being developed for
PD. Understanding how LRRK2 hyperactivity contribute to CD pathogenesis will broaden therapeutic options
for CD. We find that in the gut, LRRK2 is expressed predominantly in phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) instead
of epithelial cells. We also find that in hosts without LRRK2 risk SNPs, LRRK2 kinase can be activated by
gene-environment interactions involving autophagy gene SNP (ATG16L1 T300A) and cigarette smoking. We
previously showed that such T300A-smoking interaction results in functional defects of small intestinal Paneth
cells, an epithelial cell type with innate immune function. We find that CD patients harboring LRRK2 risk SNPs,
Lrrk2 G2019S mice, and T300A-smoked mice are all prone to develop Paneth cell defects, and this is driven
by macrophage LRRK2 hyperactivity. Our data suggests a key role of macrophage LRRK2 kinase activity in
gut inflammation. The critical questions that need to be addressed before translating these findings to clinic
include how LRRK2 kinase is activated in hosts without LRRK2 SNPs, and whether additional CD susceptibility
genes contribute to macrophage LRRK2 kinase hyperactivity. Our long-term goal is to provide mechanistic
insight and therapeutic strategies for CD patients. The central hypothesis is that macrophage LRRK2 kinase
activity is critical in epithelial homeostasis. Our rationale is that identification of the mechanism(s) to restore
proper macrophage LRRK2 levels will offer new therapeutic opportunities for CD. Our specific aims will test the
following hypotheses: (1) autophagy deficiency sensitizes macrophages to increased reactive oxygen species
production upon cigarette smoking, which then activates LRRK2 kinase; (2) additional CD susceptibility genes
also contribute to LRRK2 kinase activation. This contribution is significant since it will establish LRRK2 kinase
as a CD therapeutic target. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate how LRRK2 kinase
activity is central to maintaining gut homeostasis, a heretofore-unexamined process. We also use state-of-the-
art air-liquid interface culture and spatial transcriptomics to identify molecular and cellular targets that affect
macrophage LRRK2 kinase activities. Identifying the mechanisms of how LRRK2 regulates a key disease-
relevant phenotype will provide insight into other inflammatory disorders."
10986368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Salivary gland function is chronically impaired in Sjӧgren’s syndrome, an autoimmune exocrine gland disease
with no cure or effective treatment available. Aberrantly activated innate immune cells, autoreactive T- and B
cells, and proinflammatory cytokines collectively cause Sjogren’s-characteristic salivary gland inflammation and
dysfunction. There is an urgent need for novel, effective therapies that protect/improve salivary gland function
and ameliorate salivary gland inflammation. The importance of host gut microbiome in health and disease is
increasingly recognized, yet very little is known about the impact of gut microbiome on salivary glands, especially
the protective bacteria and their actions. Hence, the main objective of this project is to address this knowledge
gap, with a particular focus on identifying the potentially salivary gland-protective gut bacteria and revealing their
precise actions using both murine models and cells and samples from Sjӧgren’s disease patients. Our
preliminary studies showed that transplant of fecal bacteria from healthy C57BL/6 mice to the non-obese diabetic
mice, a spontaneous model of Sjӧgren’s syndrome, exerted a protective effect on salivary glands. The protection
was accompanied by reduced inflammatory responses and diminished expression of bromodomain containing
2, an epigenetic reader/modulator, in salivary gland epithelial cells. We also identified multiple specific bacterial
species with salivary gland-protective potentials based on our preliminary microbiome analyses and the pertinent
evidence from human studies in the literature. We formed the central hypothesis that healthy gut microbiota
contains bacterial species that, acting through their metabolites, protect salivary gland function by mitigating
inflammatory responses and dysfunction of salivary gland epithelial cells through mechanisms including
downregulating the expression of epigenetic reader of bromodomain containing 2. Aim 1 of this project will
define and discover the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of healthy C57BL/6 fecal microbiota
transplant on salivary glands in the non-obese diabetic mice and a second, induced model of Sjӧgren’s
syndrome. Aim 2 will explore the protective impact of specific gut bacterial species on salivary gland function
in the two mouse models. Aim 3 will identify and test microbial metabolites that may mediate the salivary gland-
protective impact of gut microbiota using both mouse SS models and cells/samples from human Sjӧgren’s
disease patients. The project will employ a combination of sophisticated immunological, microbiological and
systemic biological methodologies, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of microbiome, RNA-
sequencing analysis of host cells, and metabolomic assays. Knowledge generated will have direct relevance to
and impact on human health, and will advance the development of novel, gut microbe/microbial metabolite-
based therapies to combat autoimmune Sjӧgren’s disease as well as other salivary gland inflammatory disorders."
10986370,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key effector cytokine in causing allergic inflammation and in immunity against certain
parasitic infections. The Il13 gene, like many cytokine and chemokine genes, is transcribed at low levels in
resting effector cells and is dramatically upregulated in response to external stimulations. However,
mechanisms by which innate effector cells rapidly and robustly transcribe the Il13 gene are still poorly
understood. Our long-term goal is to understand transcriptional mechanisms that regulate cytokine and
chemokine gene transcription in health and diseases. Our immediate goal is to investigate how Il13 enhancers
can rapidly and robustly assemble transcriptional complexes to promote Il13 gene transcription in mast cells in
response to antigenic stimulation. In our published and preliminary studies, we have identified enhancer
candidates using a genomic approach. Enhancers can contribute to gene transcription additively or
cooperatively. Additive enhancers contribute to less than 50% of gene transcription, while cooperative
enhancers contribute to more than 50% of gene transcription. Using our improved CRISPR method, we identify
several Il13 cooperative enhancers that contribute to more than 50% of Il13 gene transcription in response to
antigenic stimulation. In addition, we found that signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs) bound to two of
the Il13 cooperative enhancers. Deleting SDTFs EGR1 or EGR2 resulted in a profound reduction in Il13 gene
transcription in response to IgECL. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the Il13 cooperative enhancers
detect signals triggered by antigenic stimulation and cooperate to form an enhancer hub, looping in the Il13
promoter to transcribe the Il13 gene in a SWITCH-LIKE fashion robustly. Aim 1 will decipher the
transcriptional codes in the Il13 cooperative enhancers in MCs. We will (1) identify Il13 cooperative
enhancers unbiasedly and in a locus-wide manner using our improved CRISPR deletion method; (2) validate
the function of the Il13 cooperative enhancers in MCs in mouse models of parasitic infections; and 3) decipher
the transcriptional codes in the Il13 cooperative enhancers by experimentally determining the sum of the
numbers of TF binding sites, types of TF binding sites and the proximity of TF binding sites. Aim 2 will
investigate mechanisms by which TFs read the transcriptional codes in the Il13 cooperative enhancers
to rapidly assemble functional Il13 transcriptional complex. We will use a novel proximity biotin-labeling
method that can detect Il13 cooperative enhancer-specific DNA/TFs interactions to elucidate how SDTFs
EGR1 and EGR2 assemble a functional Il13 transcriptional complex to drive rapid and robust Il13 gene
transcription in response to antigenic stimulation, revealing a novel mechanistic insight into how enhancers
cooperate to transcribe the Il13 gene rapidly and robustly. Our proposed work should also help us understand
how other cytokine genes can be rapidly switched on in response to external stimulations and identify targets
for CRISPR-based therapies to disrupt cytokine and chemokine-mediated inflammatory pathways."
10986804,"Project Summary/Abstract-Partnership and Engagement Core
 States across the U.S. have important data that could be used to improve care coordination, transitions,
and health equity in dementia care; however, they often do not have the resources to plan and conduct the
required research. Time, funds, and expertise are needed to create and strengthen collaborations between
disparate stakeholders. Moreover, guidance is needed to help states identify the most pressing system-based
issues when designing impactful, innovative, and feasible studies to address them. In close collaboration with
the other Cores, the Partnership and Engagement Core (PE Core) of the State Alzheimer’s Research Support
Center (StARS) will assist states with these activities by completing the following three aims. First, over a two-
year, two-phase process per state (N=8 “State Partners”; two per year for Years 1-4), we will strengthen and
support new, within-state partnerships and guide the development and completion of one or more state-based
research pilot projects. In the Partnership Phase (Year 1), we will conduct information gathering with each
state through surveys, interviews, and a desk analysis, all of which will inform an in-person Partnership
Building Roundtable with SWOT analysis to be held in that state. This activity will be followed by ongoing
virtual support check-in meetings until that State Partner’s pilot proposal has been submitted to the Center. In
the Pilot Phase (Year 2), we will support the efforts of the Research/Pilot Core in leading a second, in-person
Pilot Roundtable and take part in ongoing research support. Second, we will create Lived Experience Panels in
each state, composed of persons living with dementia (PLWD) and caregivers of PLWD that will provide
feedback on all Aim 1 activities. Third, we will offer national expertise to State Partners and pilot awardees
from three National Advisory Boards, namely: researchers with expertise in dementia services, public and
private long-term care providers, and state dementia service coordinators. A detailed evaluation plan with clear
benchmarks has been developed, and we will publish a minimum of three manuscripts highlighting the
processes and tools used as well as our learnings from working with State Partners and the state LEPs.
Through these activities, the PE Core will help build a Center where research-activated, forward-thinking states
from all U.S. regions will serve as “seeds” to encourage the involvement of additional states in creating a
national data source that can inform policy making around effective practices in integrated/coordinated
dementia care services."
10986805,"Project Summary/Abstract-Research/Pilot Core
 Multiple and interacting state-level policy and contextual factors influence the structure, processes,
implementation, and outcomes of integrated/coordinated dementia care. Consequently, research to better
understand and improve systems of care can be equally complex, involving challenges related to data access,
reconciling divergent and multiple stakeholder perspectives, and applying advanced analytic approaches. In
line with the State Alzheimer's Research Support Center’s (StARS’) goals to better understand and improve
care within states for persons with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD)
and their caregivers, the Research/Pilot Core will solicit, select, support, rigorous pilot research. One-year pilot
projects of up to $100,000 in direct costs each will be awarded via two pathways: from state partnerships
identified and guided by the Partnership and Engagement Core (Pathway 1), and direct application by other
state investigative teams seeking to evaluate integrated/coordinated dementia care services within their states
(Pathway 2). Our four proposed aims are to: 1) develop criteria and processes for the solicitation, selection,
funding, development, monitoring, and dissemination of 16 pilot projects (four per year during years 1-4) that
are focused on state-level policy and/or contextual factors influencing care coordination and integration for
persons living with dementia and their caregivers, and particularly underrepresented communities; 2) ensure
that pilot projects are well-designed, timely, rigorous, and meet data and code sharing requirements by
providing guidance, oversight, technical assistance, and access to Center data and support resources; 3)
assist in the further development, translation, and dissemination of completed pilot projects to key
stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders to promote translation of findings to practice and policy; and 4)
expand the expertise and network of funded pilot awardees by offering support after projects have concluded
via research/pilot grant review opportunities, ongoing communication, networking, and data sharing activities.
Close coordination with the StARS Health Equity Team will ensure a critical focus on underrepresented
communities in all Research/Pilot Core activities. The Research/Pilot Core is led by an experienced, visionary,
multidisciplinary team focused on advancing health equity, dementia care quality, access, and delivery. This
Core will contribute notably to our knowledge of the structure, process, and outcomes (e.g., care transitions) of
integrated/coordinated dementia care services, how they vary by state, as well as examine the effects of policy
variations/changes and other contextual factors on dementia care services within and across states."
10986806,"Project Summary/Abstract-Data Core
 State policymakers have made large investments in programs to support people with Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (AD/ADRD) and their caregivers, but the effects of these
investments on AD/ADRD programs and outcomes are largely unknown. Much of the data needed to
conduct these evaluations are siloed and restricted across agencies and platforms due to complex issues of
data privacy and linkage. States do not necessarily have the technical expertise and computing resources to
overcome these challenges, and researchers outside of state governments can face hurdles in accessing
data owned by states. To address these barriers, the Data Core of the proposed State Alzheimer’s
Research Support Center (StARS) will create a centralized set of resources and data for state policymakers
and outside researchers to rigorously evaluate integrated/coordinated dementia care programs, including
their effectiveness in delaying or preventing care transitions. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary group
with expertise in AD/ADRD, data infrastructures, and federal, state, and sub-state data to complete the
following aims: 1) create a data warehouse and data governance plan to support the rigorous evaluation of
state AD/ADRD programs and policies, including an inventory of state regulations governing home and
community-based dementia services, a catalog of the data contributed and created via StARS investigators
and affiliates, and standardized processes for ingesting/extracting, harmonizing, and linking data while
protecting privacy; 2) provide overall intellectual and technical assistance to states in obtaining data use
agreements, uploading data, and cleaning, linking, harmonizing, and analyzing data while attending to
health equity issues; and 3) disseminate data products (e.g., aggregated and de-identified data sets),
chartbooks (e.g., state summaries of AD/ADRD prevalence and service utilization), resources (e.g., data
dictionaries and metadata), and best practices (e.g., via Data Workshops) on equitable data analysis. We
will work closely with the other StARS Cores, conduct rigorous evaluation of our performance metrics, and
emphasize flexibility and responsiveness to the unique needs of each of the Center affiliates. By
establishing this robust and sustainable infrastructure and deep relationships with state data providers, our
highly qualified and multidisciplinary team will motivate other state entities to share data resources, thereby
promoting more rapid improvement in care for persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers."

development of a diverse group of trainees in leading-edge basic, clinical, and translational research.
We will provide the knowledge and support structure that will serve as a foundation for a successful
impactful career in the pursuit of new insight and new therapies for KUH disease processes across the
lifespan. Our vision is to cultivate a dynamic and diverse community of lifetime future global leaders in
research and innovation. We will establish a supportive learning environment that is trainee-focused,
collaborative, interdisciplinary, and highly interactive, with supportive feedback to trainees and program
evolution driven by feedback from trainees and faculty. HKUHTI faculty, trainees and alumni will not only
be well-versed in the latest technologies and methodologies but also will be deeply committed to ethical
and responsible conduct of research. Building on Harvard’s interdisciplinary and collaborative training record,
we will engage pre- and postdoctoral trainees, who will benefit from highly accomplished mentors, an individual
oversight committee, an individual training plan, a holistic training curriculum that focuses on personal as well as

and the Mentors and Trainee Evaluation Committees of the TL1 will have representation on the ESC. There will
be an Internal Advisory Board and External Advisory Board that will meet at least yearly. A Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion Committee will span the U2C and TL1. The Core will coordinate predoctoral and postdoctoral trainee
activities with high school and undergraduate programs that we have in place. We will plan to organize one of
the annual NIDDK face-to-face meetings. Aim 2. Establish research training milestones and implement
validated methods to track, monitor and evaluate HKUHTI success with focus on research training,
mentoring and career/network development. While one-on-one mentoring will remain a keystone of the re-
imagined training program, the program will also provide a strong emphasis on developing mentoring networks and
multidisciplinary team science. The ESC will set goals, objectives, and desired outcomes and targets for
achievement based on review of feedback, outcomes, and mentoring activities. Aim 3. Create a “Hub” web
portal to serve as the overall home of all things related to the HKUHTI and a platform for ongoing
collaboration, monitoring and evaluation. The Hub will serve as the source for all program-related information
and will be developed and maintained in collaboration with other Cores and TL1 leadership. The website will host

monitor trainee experiences, trainee progress and mentor effectiveness which will inform the evolution of the
overall program. Aim 2: Develop and present specific course curricula, interactive events, and materials
to enhance trainee education. In collaboration with the Network Core, the PDC will develop new didactic
experiences in areas important for the immediate and long-term success and competitiveness of academic
researchers with an introductory KUH minicourse, twice monthly seminar series and annual retreat. These will
benefit from input from the Industry/Entrepreneurism Council and Patient Input Council. The Core will also
leverage existing Harvard ecosystem resources summarized on the HKUHTI web Hub to ensure training in
scientific writing, mentoring and team science. Aim 3: Provide technical electives that reduce barriers for
incorporation of state-of-the-art technologies into trainee career development. The PDC will offer a
variety of curated opportunities to facilitate trainee competence in data analytics and large databases, as well
as exposure to novel technology platforms to enhance training in cross-disciplinary research. These
interactions will enhance the trainee’s professional network and create opportunities for interdisciplinary

Core will host quarterly, in-person, peer and near-peer mentoring, networking, and professional development
workshops, where trainees interact with each other and junior faculty K-awardees to discuss career development
strategies and promote joint problem solving. Aim 3: Expand existing outreach programs to strengthen and
diversify the KUH training pipeline. The HKUHTI will leverage existing institutional programs, including a
vibrant R25 program (Harvard Summer Research Program in Kidney Medicine) and Kidney Disease Screening
and Awareness Program that engage several hundred undergraduates across the country each year. Currently
focused on Kidney and, to a lesser extent, Urology, both programs will be expanded to integrate more
Hematology and Urology research and didactic opportunities, highlight successful role models and emerging
technologies, and incorporate HKUHTI trainees. In addition, the HKUHTI will collaborate with an existing Harvard
program to engage high school students in the Boston area for summer research in KUH laboratories together
with HKUHTI trainees. Together with the other Cores and the TL1, the Network Core will develop a community
to support and engage a diverse group of trainees, creating the next generation of KUH researchers and leaders."

bulk surgical resection of the tumor mass in combination with focal radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy,
using temozolomide (TMZ). Despite intense efforts, the prognosis of glioma patients remains dismal. Novel
approaches are greatly needed for this devastating form of brain cancer. Signal and Transducer of Activation 3
(STAT3) transcription factor has been proven to be a very attractive therapeutic target for malignant brain tumors,
as their growth is highly dependent of STAT3 signaling. Preliminary data from our team clearly suggest that
currently available small molecule STAT3 inhibitors are highly effective at eliciting regression of GBM tumors
growing in the periphery. In contrast, these same small molecule STAT3 inhibitors were ineffective in treating
GBM tumors located within the brain. We demonstrated that the lack of efficacy is due to limited BBB transport.
Similar difficulties are encountered for the delivery of other established chemotherapeutics, specifically paclitaxel
(PTX). Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems offer potential solutions, but current delivery carriers have still
relatively low efficacy or require invasive intracranial delivery, to enable transport of therapeutics across the
blood-brain-barrier. In our preliminary studies, we were able to demonstrate that albumin-based drug delivery
carriers developed by our group significantly accumulate in intracranial tumors after systemic administration. In
this proposal, our interdisciplinary team will develop and evaluate a novel and scalable bi-compartmental human
serum albumin-based carrier system that allows controlled encapsulation of therapeutic ratios of STAT3 siRNA
and PTX within distinct compartments of the same albumin-based drug delivery carrier, while also incorporating
tumor-penetrating peptides, which have been previously shown to promote nanoparticle penetration into GBMs.
The experiments will test the hypothesis that the proposed bi-compartmental (bi-NP) STAT3i/PTX delivery
carriers in combination with standard of care, i.e., radiation therapy (IR) and TMZ, will significantly improve medial
survival of intracranial GBM bearing mice. We also hypothesize that the co-release of STAT3 siRNA and PTX,
when spatially and temporally orchestrated by an appropriately designed delivery carrier, will not exhibit
untoward adverse side effects in the host, neither within the brain, nor systemically. This work may result in a
new treatment modality for GBM, a tumor type, for which no effective treatments exist. New information on
accessing brain tumors with drugs will also ensue. Our ultimate goal is to translate this novel therapeutic modality
to patients with GBM by implementing Phase I clinical trials."

Defects in motor neuron (MN) function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in susceptibility to disease.
There is currently no effective treatment for MN disorders in part due to a lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining
properties. Thus, basic research in model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice is needed to reveal
such mechanisms. MN subtype function is endowed by the differential expression of terminal identity genes.
Such genes encode proteins (e.g., ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, trans-membrane
receptors, adhesion molecules) that are expressed continuously, from the last steps of development through
adulthood, and thereby define the unique functional features of a given MN subtype. Hence, revealing the
molecular mechanisms that induce (during development) and maintain (throughout life) expression of terminal
identity genes will help us understand how MNs become and remain functional, a key goal in the fields of MN
development and disease. A remarkable wealth of terminal identity markers is available for all cholinergic MN
subtypes of the C. elegans nerve cord that control locomotion, providing a unique model system to elucidate
how MNs acquire and maintain their functional features. Leveraging these tools, we discovered that the
conserved Collier/Olf/Ebf-type transcription factor (TF) UNC-3 is required for the continuous function of all
these cholinergic MN subtypes, and that this outcome arises from UNC-3-dependent induction and
maintenance of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. Through unbiased genetic screens, we recently
identified several conserved regulatory factors (6 TFs, 2 chromatin factors) that control the terminal identity of
individual MN subtypes. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that while UNC-3 activates expression of
all MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes, these regulatory factors counteract the activator function of
UNC-3 by repressing UNC-3 targets in specific MN subtypes. These observations suggest a general principle
for the control of MN terminal identity, in which the transcriptional targets of a broadly acting activator (UNC-3)
are repressed in a MN subtype-specific fashion by distinct TFs and chromatin factors. To test this hypothesis
within the 5-year R01 timeframe, this proposal will focus on one TF (BNC-1/mammalian BNC1-2) and one
chromatin factor (PBRM-1/mammalian BAF180) that counteract UNC-3 in different MN subtypes. Specifically,
we seek to: (a) determine whether these two factors are required throughout life to secure subtype identity
(Aim 1), (b) define the mechanism underlying the repressor activity of BNC-1 (Aim 2), and (c) decipher the
function of PBRM-1 by identifying its downstream targets (Aim 3). The proposed experiments will establish a
paradigm for induction and maintenance of MN terminal identity in a genetic model system, which could serve
as a valuable entry point to understand how mammalian MNs become and remain functional."

Resistance to therapy is responsible for 90% of cancer patient mortality. Our understanding of how cancer
cells resist therapy-induced death is limited. My goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
cancer cell therapy resistance, with an eye toward improving therapy. Identifying and characterizing novel
resistance mechanisms should facilitate the design of more effective cancer therapies. Immunotherapy and
ionizing radiation are two common cancer therapies. These therapies kill cancer cells, in part, via ferroptosis:
a non-apoptotic cell death mechanism characterized by lipid peroxidation. Sensitizing cancer cells to
ferroptosis may improve the efficacy of these and other cancer therapies. To effectively sensitize cancer cells
to ferroptosis, we must identify how cancer cells normally resist ferroptosis. However, the mechanisms by
which cancer cells resist ferroptosis are poorly understood. I recently showed that the transcription factor
nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 1 (NFE2L1, or NRF1) is required to protect cancer cells from ferroptosis. My
overarching hypothesis is that NFE2L1 is central to an important pathway promoting ferroptosis
resistance in cancer cells. The goal of this research, as part of my overall training plan, is to test this
hypothesis and determine how NFE2L1 protects cancer cells from ferroptosis. Ultimately, this research has
the potential to inform advances in cancer therapy. I propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will test whether
certain post-translational modifications of NFE2L1 are required for ferroptosis resistance. These studies will
be conducted using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to perturb NFE2L1 N-glycosylation and cleavage
and assess the effects on ferroptosis sensitivity. To support the successful execution of this aim, I will be
trained in glycobiology by my co-sponsor, Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi, who pioneered this field. In Aim 2, I will
elucidate the role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in ferroptosis resistance. Preliminary data
suggest that NNMT, which encodes an enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism, is
a direct target of NFE2L1. I hypothesize that NNMT regulates cancer cell ferroptosis sensitivity by altering
redox homeostasis. Through my proposed experiments, I will determine whether NNMT is a direct target of
NFE2L1. I will also assess ferroptosis sensitivity in cells in which NNMT is knocked out or overexpressed.
Mass spectrometry will be used to measure the abundance of redox molecules in these cell lines to analyze
the role of NNMT in ferroptosis-related redox regulation. I will be trained in mass spectrometry by my
collaborator, Dr. Monther Abu-Remaileh, who is an expert in metabolomics. With the guidance of my expert
team of mentors at Stanford University, my proposed experiments will elucidate this novel pathway promoting
cancer cell ferroptosis evasion and identify possible strategies to minimize cancer therapy resistance."

Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is particularly lethal, due in part to a resistance to therapies and a high incidence of
metastasis. The overall goal of our research program is to define the molecular mechanisms regulating tumor
progression and metastasis of PDAC, thereby identifying new therapeutic strategies to improve patient survival.
This proposal focuses on an activator of the invasive cytoskeletal machinery, the proto-oncogene Vav1, which
is a GTP exchange factor and activator of the potent Rac/Cdc42 small GTPases that regulate actin dynamics.
Vav1 is aberrantly expressed in a subset of pancreatic tumors and correlates with a poor prognosis. Here we
have identified a novel role for Vav1 in the regulation of glutamine metabolism that we believe contributes to
cellular energy levels, thereby integrating a potent pro-invasive factor with an essential metabolic axis in PDAC.
Vav1 promotes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate via the enzyme glutaminase (GLS1). Further, we have
identified novel mechanisms by which the glutamine/glutamate axis contributes to tumor progression and
metastasis through both localized energy production and through paracrine signaling by both glutamate and
inflammatory cytokines. Our substantial preliminary data support the hypothesis for this proposal that ectopic
expression of the Rac/Cdc42 exchange factor Vav1 regulates glutamine metabolism to link nutrient status to
actin dynamics, invasion, and proliferation. Using a combination of cell biology, live cell fluorescence microscopy,
biochemistry, and in vivo models, we will test this hypothesis by investigating how Vav1 amplifies glutamine
catabolism (Aim 1), and how glutamate production drives tumor progression and metastasis in pancreatic tumor
cells (Aim 2). Successful completion of this research will provide fundamental mechanistic advances in our
understanding of the metabolic dependencies of PDAC, identify therapeutic vulnerabilities for patients with Vav1-
positive tumors, and establish novel links between cytoskeletal signaling and glutamine metabolism."
10996673,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately half of all cancer patients in the United States are treated with external beam radiotherapy (RT),
with approximately 40% of all curative treatment being attributed to it. Modern treatment planning systems (TPS)
are designed to optimize the target dose distribution such that the dose to the tumor volume is maximized and
doses to surrounding organs at risk are minimized. While this approach is successful in reducing the severity of
deterministic organ toxicities, there is mounting evidence to suggest that stochastic, radiation-induced second
primary cancer (SPC) risks are a serious concern following RT treatment and should be considered in TPS dose
engines. This is presently impractical due to the limited anatomical information present in the patient’s planning
computed tomography (CT) image studies. Furthermore, TPS that do compute doses to near- and out-of-field
organs either grossly underestimate their magnitudes or neglect to compute them entirely. A whole-body
computational phantom, with anthropometric parameters based on the patient’s demographic, could supplement
the limited geometric information present in the planning image. Implementing this model into a system-specific
Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation would then provide a practical means to compute doses to organs
distal to the treatment field with a high degree of accuracy. Previous work at the University of Florida has
produced the largest adult and pediatric computational phantom libraries to date, representing individuals of both
biological sexes over a wide range of heights, weights, and ages. Given this information, I hypothesize that
computational phantoms produced by merging CT planning images with patient-matched tetrahedral mesh-type
phantoms can be used to compute accurate near- and out-of-field organ doses and concomitant SPC risks
following RT, with potential for clinical implementation, medical record supplementation, prospective TPS dose
optimization, and future epidemiological studies. The proposed project will achieve this through the completion
of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop a system for generation of whole-body patient-specific mesh
phantoms from radiation therapy treatment planning CT images. Aim 2: Construct Monte Carlo radiation
transport source terms for external beam radiotherapy systems and assess normal organ doses and concomitant
SPC risks following radiotherapy treatment. The development of this system will fulfill an urgent need for RT
dosimetry methods which compute dose and SPC risk for all organs in the body post-treatment."

11001912,"Impairments in mitochondrial functions have been frequently implicated in ischemic brain injury
associated with cardiac arrest or stroke. However, the extent to which mitochondrial dysfunction contributes
to neurodegeneration is unknown; and the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial failure are not well
understood. Recently, it was suggested that an imbalance in mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics can lead
to neurodegeneration and brain damage. Furthermore, overactivation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD)+ degrading poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1) causes excessive cellular and mitochondrial NAD+
depletion resulting in impaired cell survival. We hypothesize that the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)
administration is inhibiting the post-ischemic neurodegeneration by (a) reversing excessive mitochondrial
fission via stimulation of mitochondrial NAD+ synthesis that (b) stimulates deacetylation of mitochondrial
proteins and leads to (c) reduction of mitochondrial superoxide production.
 Our preliminary data show that treatment of animals with NAD+ precursor NMN has dramatic
neuroprotection effect, reverses the excessive mitochondrial fragmentation and increases the brain
mitochondria NAD+ levels. As a downstream result NMN is decreasing mitochondrial proteins acetylation and
inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The primary goal of this study is to
determine the mechanistic link(s) between NMN induced changes in mitochondrial NAD+ metabolism, protein
acetylation, ROS generation and inhibition of fission. To address these questions, we propose to:
 1. Determine the specific role of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, nucleotide metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, and dynamics. Cells will be
prepared from our three transgenic animal models: (1) animals expressing mitochondria targeted enhanced
yellow fluorescence protein (mito-eYFP) alone, (2) animals expressing mito-eYFP and overexpressing SIRT3
(mito-eYFP-SIRT3OE), or (3) mito-eYFP expressing SIRT3 knockout animals (mito-eYFP-SIRT3KO). The
role of NMN-induced changes in mitochondrial protein acetylation on mitochondria ROS production,
mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death will be determined. Cellular NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial
respiratory function, and mitochondrial fusion and fission will be analyzed and their role in NMN
neuroprotection and oxygen glucose deprivation induced cell death will be determined.
 2. To study the specific effect of NMN treatment on post-ischemic modulation of mitochondrial
dynamics in brain, we will use our transgenic animals that will be subjected to transient forebrain ischemia
and the post-ischemic alterations in neuronal mitochondrial morphometry will be examined. In addition, NMN-
induced changes in NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial protein acetylation and mitochondrial ROS generation
will be determined. Additionally, NMN-induced changes in NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial protein
acetylation and mitochondrial ROS generation will be determined. Finally, we will assess the effect of NMN
treatment on post-ischemic cellular and mitochondrial NAD+ metabolism and mitochondrial respiration.
 The significance of this work is that it proposes both mechanistic and translational approaches to
unravel the mechanisms of NAD+ dependent mitochondrial ROS production, impairment in mitochondrial
dynamics and determine its role in acute brain injury. Furthermore, the identification of a novel metabolic link
between NAD+ catabolism, acetylation/deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial ROS generation
and inhibition of mitochondrial fission will identify new mechanisms for neuroprotection that could lead to the
use of NMN as a therapeutic compound for acute brain injury such as global ischemia, stroke and TBI or
chronic neurodegenerative disease, thus potentially have significant impact on the health of Veterans."

11002062,"The B7x pathway in the tumor microenvironment
 During the first five years of the R01 funding period (April 2014 – March
2019), we produced 37 publications and received 3 granted patents. We made
major discoveries on function and structure of B7x, a much less studied B7 family
member that was originally discovered by us.
 Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have advanced
the treatment of cancer patients. However, one of the biggest challenges is that
the majority of cancer patients do not respond to these treatments. Clearly, new
strategies targeting additional immune checkpoints are needed to improve the
immunotherapy of human cancers.
 Our basic and clinical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest B7x
immune checkpoint has very different mechanisms and provides an excellent
target to develop new immunotherapies. Furthermore, we recently discovered
HHLA2 as a homolog of B7x and a new member of the B7 family, which provides
a unique opportunity to study a new human immune checkpoint. Thus, our
central hypothesis is that B7x and HHLA2, two less-studied members of the B7
family originally discovered by us, are critical immune evasion pathways within
the tumor microenvironment and are therapeutic targets for new cancer
immunotherapies. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three aims: 1)
Dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms by which tumor-expressed B7x
induces immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment; 2) Develop new
immune checkpoint blockade targeting B7x: Combination therapies and
mechanisms; and 3) Elucidate the HHLA2 pathway: A new homology of B7x. We
have generated a number of novel tools which provides us with unique
opportunities to address challenges and realize goals. The outcomes of this
project will reveal new immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment and will establish the foundation for clinical design of new
immunotherapies, which could potentially be effective in tumors that resist
current PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 targeted therapies."

The short-term goal of this proposal is to understand how Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling influences remodeling of
the liver parenchyma during acute and chronic injury. This proposal will functionally define the response of
non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) to changes in epithelial Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling and validate candidate
signaling pathways that lead to NPC activation and recruitment. Our long-term goal is to understand the
intimate interactions and cellular decisions made by liver cells to generate a well-compensated organ.
Successful completion of this project would augment our ability to tailor medical therapies for cirrhosis and its
sequela by focusing on particular arms of Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling.
For several years, we studied the role that Yap plays in orchestrating regenerative responses. While Yap (and,
its paralog Taz) have long-established roles in regulating cell proliferation, they are increasingly being
recognized as having important non-cell-autonomous roles in proper tissue regeneration. Yap and Taz share a
similar biochemical structure but are differentially expressed after injury. Our work as well as of others suggest
that Yap and Taz are differentially activated in liver injury and, likely have common and distinct biochemical
targets mediating their injury response. We propose to closely examine our models of Yap and Taz activity that
lead to fibrosis to dissect common and distinct mechanisms for each molecule. We will further refine our
understanding of Cyr61, a widely reported Yap/Taz target which has been reported to have both pro- and anti-
fibrotic roles.
In Aim 1, we will interrogate the cell-cell interactions after hepatocyte-specific activation of Yap (Yap-Tg) with
immune cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and fibroblasts using next-generation sequencing and
advanced imaging approaches. Chemical and genetic approaches interrogating potential drivers of the
phenotype will be used in the Yap-Tg model to examine its effects on hepatic stellate cell activation. In Aim 2,
we developed a hepatocyte-specific Taz overexpression model with distinctive characteristics from Yap-Tg.
This Taz model displays less inflammation, but a similar degree of fibrosis as the Yap-Tg model suggesting it
drives unique biochemical mechanisms. We will characterize the Taz fibrotic microenvironment of this model
and perform in-depth genomic and transcriptional profiling of Yap-Tg versus Taz overexpression. Aim 3 will
investigate potential mechanisms that Cyr61 can operate as a pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic molecule depending
on the injury setting.
We propose that a detailed understanding of epithelial Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling in liver injury, their cellular and
biochemical targets will inform the field regarding critical checkpoints to limit or reverse cirrhotic development.

SUMMARY
Protein toxins and effectors are important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria, contributing to
disease progression by modulating or disrupting essential functions in target cells. Historically, research has
focused on several toxins associated with important human diseases, which in some cases provided the
framework for eradicating the disease associated with the toxin. However, recent advances in microbial
genomics and discovery-based screening techniques have dramatically increased the number of toxins and
effector systems under investigation. Advances in high-resolution microscopy, structural biology, cryo-electron
microscopy, proteomics, and CRISPR have provided new tools to study the structure and function of toxins
and effectors, as well as the mechanisms by which they contribute to interactions and modulation of target
cells. This R13 application derives, in part, from the realization that, although the field of protein toxins and
effectors is rapidly expanding, important activities, such as the dissemination of research findings and
establishment of interdisciplinary collaborations, have been challenging because of a relative dearth of
scientific conferences/meetings in North America specifically centered on protein toxin/effector
structure/function and mechanism. To address this gap, we conceived, designed and launched several years
ago an ""in-person-virtual"" hybrid conference, the ""Lakeside Conference on Protein Toxins and Effectors""
(#LakesidePTE), in October 2020, and which was followed up with a hybrid in person-online meeting in
October 2022. Based on the excitement and positive feedback resulting from these two meetings, we now
propose to follow up with the 2024 Lakeside Conference on Protein Toxins and Effectors October 6-9, at the
Abbey Conference Center located on Lake Geneva WI. The 2024 hybrid conference will concentrate on the
cellular, structural, and biochemical mechanisms of protein toxin and effector action, along with exploring the
translational potential of these proteins for treating human diseases. The conference will be organized by Chair

African American/Black adults are at an elevated risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias (ADRD)1–3.Thus, the identification of modifiable factors underlying this
heightened risk is urgently needed. One such modifiable factor essential to cognitive health is sleep.
Specifically, sleep is associated with impaired cognitive functioning and risk for mild cognitive impairment,
particularly within Black adults4–6. Additionally, life stressors and protective/resilient factors are associated with
cognitive and sleep health7–12, but limited research has revealed how all these factors interconnect to explain
observable differences in cognitive functioning within Black adults. Understanding these associations is even
more pressing in midlife – a period of life (a) where the sleep-cognition relationship has not been extensively
investigated, (b) for which Black people are at a high risk of cognitive dysfunction, and (c) represents an ideal
period to target for intervention13. The overall objective of this study, branded Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods
of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) Sleep, is to identify mechanisms of Black-White sleep disparities
and the mechanisms that account for Black-White differences in ADRD risk. The study includes annual
assessments across 3 years to assess sleep duration and quality, cognitive functioning, inflammatory
biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6), life stressors (e.g., perceived neighborhood disorder), and resilience factors (e.g.,
spirituality, coping) in a sample of middle-aged (30-64 years) Black and White participants from the HANDLS
Study. The HANDLS Sleep Study includes three specific aims: Aim 1: determine if there are racial differences
in the daily coupling of sleep and mobile cognitive functioning and whether differences in this coupling are
moderated by life stressors (e.g., financial strain and neighborhood disorder); Aim 2: test longitudinal
associations among sleep and performance on mobile cognitive assessments and explore the role of life
stressors, protective factors (e.g., spirituality and neighborhood cohesion) and inflammation; Aim 3:
determine whether changes in the strength of the daily coupling of sleep and performance on mobile cognitive
assessments relate to racial differences in traditional annual measures of cognitive decline over 3 years, and
to elucidate the potential mediational role of inflammation. The HANDLS Sleep Study is innovative because it
will examine the association between sleep and cognitive functioning over various time intervals (daily and
annual), and it will also examine the relationship of life stressors, sleep, inflammatory biomarkers, and/or
resilient factors on racial disparities in cognitive decline. Furthermore, this research is significant because of its
potential to identify psychosocial and contextual factors related to impaired sleep and cognition that could
serve as the basis for evidence-based interventions."
11003601,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children1, and is caused by both genetic and environmental
factors. Nevertheless, the modifiable risk factors for this disorder remain unknown, creating a pressing public
health need. As ASD likely arises early in prenatal development considerable efforts in identifying such
modifiable risk factors have focused on maternal exposures in pregnancy. Some of those studies have shown
higher rates of ASD among children of women with e.g. diabetes, depression or recurrent infections. However,
(1) women experience many other conditions in pregnancy, most of which have not been studied in the context
of offspring ASD risk; and (2) the mechanisms underlying the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD
remain unknown. While placental permeability to multiple factors in maternal circulation renders direct effects of
maternal health on fetus plausible, this explanation has not been rigorously evaluated against the possibility that
both maternal diagnosis and child’s ASD are caused by overlapping genetic factors, transmitted from mother to
the child. In response, the key objectives of our proposal are to (1) test the associations between maternal health
and ASD systematically, across the full spectrum of maternal diagnoses, and accounting for their correlation,
and (2) elucidate the genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms underlying those associations. To achieve this,
we propose independent, but synergistic, aims to increase the reliability and generalizability of our results.
Aim 1: Systematically identify maternal diagnoses in pregnancy associated with ASD in offspring. Aim 2:
Determine if the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD is due to transmitted genetic factors, using
information on family relations available in Denmark. Aim 3: Test the association between maternal diagnoses
in pregnancy and child’s genetic liability for ASD using molecular genetic data. We will use large, well-powered
sample of >723k live births from Denmark with full demographic, medical and pedigree information, as well as
genetic data for a subset of those individuals (N~26k). All significant associations will be replicated in an
American dataset (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) with ~320k births, ensuring external validity of our
results. The innovation of this project is three-fold: (1) it has a potential to identify novel risk factors (shown in
our preliminary data), (2) it introduces a methodological shift in ASD epidemiology, with large-scale, exposure-
wide and rigorous inference process, akin to that already applied in the field of genetics; and (3) for the first time,
it integrates national data from Nordic registries with one of the largest US-based cohorts (Kaiser Permanente).
This project will deliver a systematic list of high-confidence, maternal diagnoses around pregnancy associated
with ASD risk in two, independent cohorts, and triangulated evidence regarding genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms linking those diagnoses in pregnancy with risk of ASD in offspring. Collectively, these outputs will
contribute new insights into ASD etiology, suggest potential preventive factors and aid the efforts towards early
identification of high-risk families."
11018955,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children1, and is caused by both genetic and environmental
factors. Nevertheless, the modifiable risk factors for this disorder remain unknown, creating a pressing public
health need. As ASD likely arises early in prenatal development considerable efforts in identifying such
modifiable risk factors have focused on maternal exposures in pregnancy. Some of those studies have shown
higher rates of ASD among children of women with e.g. diabetes, depression or recurrent infections. However,
(1) women experience many other conditions in pregnancy, most of which have not been studied in the context
of offspring ASD risk; and (2) the mechanisms underlying the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD
remain unknown. While placental permeability to multiple factors in maternal circulation renders direct effects of
maternal health on fetus plausible, this explanation has not been rigorously evaluated against the possibility that
both maternal diagnosis and child’s ASD are caused by overlapping genetic factors, transmitted from mother to
the child. In response, the key objectives of our proposal are to (1) test the associations between maternal health
and ASD systematically, across the full spectrum of maternal diagnoses, and accounting for their correlation,
and (2) elucidate the genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms underlying those associations. To achieve this,
we propose independent, but synergistic, aims to increase the reliability and generalizability of our results.
Aim 1: Systematically identify maternal diagnoses in pregnancy associated with ASD in offspring. Aim 2:
Determine if the association between maternal diagnoses and ASD is due to transmitted genetic factors, using
information on family relations available in Denmark. Aim 3: Test the association between maternal diagnoses
in pregnancy and child’s genetic liability for ASD using molecular genetic data. We will use large, well-powered
sample of >723k live births from Denmark with full demographic, medical and pedigree information, as well as
genetic data for a subset of those individuals (N~26k). All significant associations will be replicated in an
American dataset (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) with ~320k births, ensuring external validity of our
results. The innovation of this project is three-fold: (1) it has a potential to identify novel risk factors (shown in
our preliminary data), (2) it introduces a methodological shift in ASD epidemiology, with large-scale, exposure-
wide and rigorous inference process, akin to that already applied in the field of genetics; and (3) for the first time,
it integrates national data from Nordic registries with one of the largest US-based cohorts (Kaiser Permanente).
This project will deliver a systematic list of high-confidence, maternal diagnoses around pregnancy associated
with ASD risk in two, independent cohorts, and triangulated evidence regarding genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms linking those diagnoses in pregnancy with risk of ASD in offspring. Collectively, these outputs will
contribute new insights into ASD etiology, suggest potential preventive factors and aid the efforts towards early
identification of high-risk families."
11005918,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. As of 2021, over 30 million U.S.
adults reported that they currently smoked cigarettes, and over 16 million Americans suffered from diseases
attributed to smoking. Alarmingly, the rise of youth “vaping” is creating a new generation of nicotine-addicted
individuals. Indeed, as of 2023, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than
11% of young adults used e-cigarettes daily. Given the relative success of anti-Tobacco public health policies
over the last several decades, the rise of youth vaping is a troubling statistic that could sustain inhaled forms of
nicotine dependence for decades to come.
Despite the unprecedented and ongoing havoc that cigarette smoking wreaks on U.S. and global public health,
our arsenal of FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies is woefully inadequate. It is estimated that over 80%
of smokers report a desire to quit smoking, with at least 40% attempting to do so each year. Despite this, there
are only three FDA-approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. The “gold-standard” treatment –
varenicline (Chantix) – is effective in less than 25% of individuals, and ongoing perceptions of severe
neuropsychiatric side effects have further limited its acceptance among both healthcare providers and patients.
Because of this, it is estimated that a smoker will attempt to quit up to 30 times on average before achieving
success. There is a clear and unmet clinical need for more effective smoking cessation therapies.
In response to recent calls to action from Key Opinion Leaders and the Biden Administration, including a draft
framework from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to “promote ongoing and innovative
research to support and accelerate smoking cessation,” our goal is to develop a highly structured, multimodal
nicotine cessation program with dramatically higher efficacy than the current standard of care. This Phase I
proposal is intended to support the development of the novel FDA-regulated pharmacotherapy at the core of our
platform."
11005933,"In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR application, NeuroDex, Inc. proposes to advance the development of a new blood-based biomarker TDP43, which is a potential marker of pathological progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a biomarker of interest for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and related dementias (ADRD). With support from the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, TargetALS, and ALS Finding a Cure®, NeuroDex conducted biomarker discovery work that indicated TDP43 associated with neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEs) in patient plasma has strong potential as a possible ALS diagnostic marker, a trial stratification tool, and/or an indicator of treatment response. Further development and commercialization of an assay for NDE-associated TDP43 is expected to improve the efficiency and success of clinical trials and to improve patient care and end-of-life planning. TDP43 has been proposed as a biomarker for ALS trials, but the ubiquity of TDP43 in tissues other than neurons has made it impossible to distinguish neuronal TDP43 from other sources in blood. NeuroDex previously developed an innovative technology (ExoSORT™) to selectively isolate NDEs from blood and examine their contents. In biomarker discovery work, NeuroDex evaluated the utility of NDE-associated TDP43 as a biomarker of changes in TDP43 in the brain, finding that NDE-associated TDP43 from blood 1) is significantly increased in a mouse model of the disease, suggesting it is an indicator of disease pathology; 2) is correlated with changes in ALSFRS-R scores over time, potentially providing a method for predicting rate of progression; 3) is correlated with levels of TDP43- regulated mRNAs; and 4) provides 96% sensitivity and 83% specificity for detecting ALS in combination with NDE-associated LC3 and Cathepsin D, indicating the potential for developing a combination of biomarkers to improve ALS diagnosis. Building on the success of the biomarker discovery phase, NeuroDex now proposes full analytical validation of the NDE-associated TDP43 assay and an initial characterization of the biomarker’s performance in stratifying patients to support a future clinical validation study. Aim 1. Validate analytical methods for ExoSORT in combination with the NDE-associated TDP43 assay. Success Metric: Assay performance meets or exceeds all FDA guidelines for validating bioanalytical methods. Aim 2. Characterize the ability of NDE- associated biomarkers to distinguish between slow and fast progressors with ALS through a longitudinal cohort analysis. Success Metric: ≥ 85% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity for distinguishing between slow and fast progressors. Impact—This project is expected to deliver a fully validated assay for NDE-associated TDP43 that can be adopted for patient stratification in ALS, FTD, AD, and ADRD clinical trials. The assay is also expected to have utility for tracking treatment response and improving diagnosis in clinical trials and clinical care. These applications would improve clinical trial efficiency and probability of success, leading to new treatments."

The currently marketed seasonal influenza vaccines have considerable impact on disease, but their efficacy
relies on successfully matching the vaccine strains to future circulating virus strains. These vaccines induce
neutralizing antibodies primarily against the head region of hemagglutinin and to a lesser extent to
neuraminidase. Since these antigens are variable, the vaccines need to be updated regularly. When seasonal
influenza vaccines closely match circulating strains, then these vaccines can provide nearly complete protection
from infection and disease but if the vaccine strains are poorly matched to circulating strains, vaccine efficacy is
severely reduced. Universal influenza vaccines are designed to address this gap by inducing immune responses
against antigens that are conserved across seasonal and potentially pandemic strains. These vaccines
significantly reduce disease and prevent mortality but generally, do no prevent infection and all disease. We
hypothesize that the best efficacy can be obtained by combining the advantages of a closely matched seasonal
influenza DNA vaccine with the advantages of a universal influenza DNA vaccine. The seasonal DNA vaccine
component can be manufactured closer to influenza seasons to provide a more precise match to circulating
strains than currently marketed vaccines. The universal influenza DNA vaccine component would protect from
widespread disease and hospitalization if an unexpected, shifted strain with pandemic potential emerged. We
also hypothesize that the gene gun is an ideal delivery modality to deliver such DNA vaccines. The GG is needle-
free, pain-free, induces protective levels of immunity in humans with 100-1000-fold lower doses than other
delivery technologies and notably, induces robust T cell and mucosal immune responses that could increase
protection from influenza especially the elderly and immunocompromised that bear the greatest burden of
influenza disease and mortality each year. Under Phase I, we will compare a novel doggybone DNA formulation
that enables even more rapid and cost-effective manufacture of DNA vaccines to our current plasmid DNA
formulation and select a lead formulation. Under phase II, we will compare the lead enhanced seasonal DNA
vaccine formulation to an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for immunogenicity and efficacy against viruses
that are mismatched to the vaccine strain in aged mice as a model for the elderly and in nonhuman primates as
a preclinical model that closely mirrors humans. If successful, these studies will result in a new vaccine ready to
advance to human clinical trials."

The majority of people living with dementia (PLWD) in the U.S. are cared for at home by family or friends
without formal training. The challenges of providing ADRD care, dealing with challenging ADRD behaviors,
and coordinating with the family care network causes significant mental, physical, and emotional burden for
caregivers, especially for minoritized ADRD caregivers who face additional adverse health outcomes and
cultural barriers in accessing support. Commercial solutions are not scalable for affordable use (i.e., remote
care with ADRD experts) or lack personalization and cultural responsiveness (i.e., mobile or web -based
caregiver apps with “generic” information). Support groups pose scheduling, geographic, and stigma barriers
and do not offer real-time expert feedback or evidence-based skills. Without 24/7 expert support, caregivers
are left to search through the Internet for “generic” solutions. There is a significant unmet need for culturally
relevant, accessible, and scalable personalized ADRD caregiving guidance and coordination support to
address the real-time needs of diverse ADRD caregivers, PLWD, and families. We are developing a family-
centered, conversational AI assistant called COMPASS to support ADRD caregivers in real-time with 1)
personalized, culturally relevant ADRD caregiving guidance and 2) assistive coordination within their family
care network. Our novel technology leverages advances in culturally responsive AI to understand diverse
caregiver queries and personalize responses and delivery to each caregiver and PLWD’s personal/cultural
context. A virtual avatar tailored to the caregiver’s preferences will be used to communicate guidance in areas
consistent with existing and validated multicomponent ADRD care interventions to assist with the daily
challenges of ADRD caregiving and communication within the family care network. With caregiver approval,
COMPASS can help share actionable information to family members in the network. In Phase 1, our 12-month
goals are to develop a prototype of COMPASS and test its initial usability/feasibility for racially and ethnically
diverse AD/ADRD family caregivers. By providing real-time support and building a care community, COMPASS
aligns with the NIA’s goals to improve access and adherence to evidence-based caregiving support while
reducing caregiver burden and enabling effective care for the PLWD."

Proposed is a sensing system that unobtrusively measures and reports gait properties that are correlated to
accepted measures of cognitive decline. Significance: As of 2023, there were 6.7 million Americans living with
AD/ADRD. Due to the aging demographics, this number is projected to double by 2050 at an estimated annual
direct cost of $1.1 trillion. Measures of cognitive decline can help to inform family members, caregivers, and
health-care providers about the functional status and needs of independent-living older individuals. The need
to improve the assessment of cognitive changes affecting daily functions has been identified by the NIH and
National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Many ADLs such as shopping, housecleaning, and bathing are difficult
to measure objectively. Measuring these ADLs is generally manually intensive, often requiring direct
supervision by a caregiver. The changing US demographics indicates that more aging adults will no longer
have the frequent interaction with caregivers required to make these measures accurately. Hypothesis: A
remotely administered system can be created that can accurately measure in-community gait parameters and
be used to monitor signs of cognitive decline. Specific Aims: In Phase II, IDL will 1) Complete production-
ready hardware and software systems; 2) Optimize and evaluate the performance of gait parameter estimation

11008853,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to rise in the US and globally, disproportionately affecting men
who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW), with the highest rates in people of color, living
with HIV (PLWH) and those ≤30 years of age. Doxycycline taken within 72 hours after condomless sex as post-
exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) is highly effective and significantly reduces incident STIs in MSM/TW who are
at elevated risk of recurrent STIs. Randomized trials demonstrated doxy-PEP reduced chlamydia (CT) and
syphilis by >80% and gonorrhea (GC) by >50%, was safe, well-tolerated, and highly acceptable. Doxy-PEP is
an important public health tool with potential to help turn the tide on the US's persistent STI epidemic. In October
2023, the CDC gave a Grade A1 recommendation for doxy-PEP for MSM/TW with recent STIs. However, to be
effective, doxy-PEP uptake, adherence, and persistence need to be high among MSM/TW at elevated risk for
recurrent STIs which includes MSM/TW who already experience significant health disparities, based on age
(under age 30) race/ethnicity (Black and Latinx), living with HIV or are taking HIV PrEP. The roll-out of HIV PrEP
in the US is an important reminder of the necessity to ensure equitable access to populations with highest need.
In parallel with enthusiasm for the public health potential of doxy-PEP, important concerns remain about longer-
term doxy-PEP use and potential antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in GC and clinically important “bystander”
bacteria, such as Staph aureus and Strep pneumoniae. To address these questions, we propose an open cohort
of MSM and TW currently taking doxy-PEP or initiating doxy-PEP per local or national guidelines in sexual health
and HIV clinics in five geographically and demographically diverse cities (Atlanta, Detroit, Miami, San Francisco
and Seattle). Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate guideline-based doxy-PEP effectiveness and patterns
of use in 2500 MSM and TG by key characteristics, including race/ethnicity, age, gender identity and HIV
serostatus as follows: SubAim 1a: Compare doxy-PEP effectiveness and patterns of use in doxy-PEP
users to a threshold consistent with at least 50% reduction in early syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea
from the DoxyPEP Study. SubAim 1b: Use mixed methods, including qualitative methods, to understand
users' decision-making about doxy-PEP use with different partners and continuation of doxy-PEP over
time. SubAim 1c: Establish a doxy-PEP to need ratio to assess gaps in doxy-PEP uptake and use, and
to guide efforts to increase equitable access. 2) Assess the impact of doxy-PEP on antimicrobial
resistance in gonorrhea and clinically relevant bystander bacteria."
11008997,"Project Summary
During effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists in memory T cells
and the virus from this cellular reservoir rebounds when people living with HIV (PLWH) stop ART. When ART is
discontinued, viral rebound takes place within 4 weeks in most PLWH (i.e., non-controllers). However, the time
to viral rebound varies and there are rare PLWH who maintain low levels of viremia for months or years after an
analytic treatment interruption (ATI). Previous studies have identified several factors associated with a delayed
time to viral rebound: 1) lower levels of total HIV DNA prior to treatment interruption; 2) lower pre-ART viral load;
and 3) initiation of ART during acute/early infection. In addition, CD8 T cell immune response directed against
structurally important viral protein regions is also associated with viral control in the absence of ART.
 From the results of the PULSE clinical trial, where 68 PLWHs underwent three consecutive ATIs, we
observed that 10% of the participants controlled their viral rebound up to 6 months (i.e., transient controllers).
Applying our novel near full-length HIV RNA sequencing assay to genetically characterize HIV from the plasma
of two participants enrolled in this clinical study, we found that genetically distinct HIV populations emerged when
transient viral control was observed. In the current study, we will extend our full-length HIV sequencing analysis
to all participants who experienced transient viral control during consecutive ATIs. In addition, to determine
whether enhanced CD8 T cell response and functionality are essential to achieve transient viral control during
consecutive ATIs, we will compare the proportion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells and the magnitude of their response
across pre-ART and ATI timepoints in both transient controllers and non-controllers. Furthermore, we will
determine whether consecutive ATIs improve HIV-specific CD8 T cell response to structurally important and
genetically conserved viral protein regions shaping the genetic composition of rebound viruses and controlling
viral infection.
 The proposed study will allow us to determine if consecutive ATIs enhance viral and immunological
mechanisms contributing to transient viral control. Of note, we will define the immunological parameters of CD8
T cells that result in a transient virological control and delayed viral rebound when ART is discontinued. Moreover,
this study will accelerate the development of new therapeutic strategies such as enhancing host immunity against
structurally important and genetically conserved HIV protein regions with the ultimate goal of achieving virological
remission following the discontinuation of ART."

The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of
Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke
Health in October 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and
in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Health,
including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new
initiatives, and a commitment for ongoing annual investment by the Duke Health System. DCI faculty include
well-established and funded experts spanning the full spectrum of cancer research fields, from intracellular
signaling to cancer genomics to therapeutic development and testing to population science. DCI programmatic
activities support the career development of the next generation of cancer experts and provide platforms for
multi-disciplinary scientific teams to develop and test new hypotheses. During the most recent funding period,
the DCI structure has continued to evolve and mature, currently consisting of 304 members from 34 departments
within 7 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Public Policy,
Environment, and Business) and organized as 8 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1
population science, and 5 translational/clinical) whose work is supported by 14 Shared Resources (8 lab-based
and 6 supporting translational/clinical/population research activities). In addition to Program and Shared
Resource leaders, DCI senior leadership, which includes an Executive Director, Deputy Director, 7 Associate
Directors, and 8 other key leaders, provides oversight and direction of DCI initiatives. DCI members are currently
supported by over $111M of external cancer-related grant support (direct costs), over $63M of which is peer-
reviewed, including 32 peer-reviewed, multi-investigator grants (involving 81 subprojects/cores) and 61 training
and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 5,750 cancer-focused papers during the past funding
period, ~40% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators. On average, ~7,000 new
cancer patients are seen each year at the Duke University Hospital. In 2018, DCI Programs enrolled over 4,000
patients on clinical trials, including nearly 2,000 interventional accruals and 770 therapeutic accruals. DCI is
heavily engaged in both community outreach/engagement and educating the next generation of cancer clinicians
and scientists. Duke Health support of the DCI included a total of over $65M of additional investment in the most
recent funding period, including support for recruitment, retention, and protected academic time for DCI faculty.
The DCI completed an extensive 5-year Strategic Planning process, identifying strategic goals and priorities that
enable the DCI mission to “Discover, Develop, and Deliver the future of cancer care…now”, resulting in a series
of discrete recommendations that are serving as a guide for determining current and future resource allocation,
recruiting priorities, and infrastructure changes required to achieve DCI goals."

TARGETING THE METABOLIC REGULATOR SIRT5 IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA. AML is an aggressive
hematologic malignancy with <30% long-term survival. The current therapy standard, chemotherapy alone or
combined with allogeneic stem cell transplant, has not changed for decades. Despite initial responses, most
patients eventually relapse, suggesting persistence of leukemia initiating cells in protective niches. Inhibitors of
FLT3 or mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have expanded therapy options and validated the
paradigm of genotype-directed therapy. However, even with these new drugs, relapse is common and frequently
due to selection of subclones with resistance mutations in the drug target. Unlike FLT3 and IDH1/2 inhibitors,
the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is active in multiple AML genotypes, indicating that targeting shared vulnerabilities
in a genotype-agnostic manner can be effective. Unfortunately many venetoclax-induced responses are not
durable as leukemia cells adapt by activating alternative anti-apoptosis mechanisms or by reprogramming
mitochondrial metabolism. Microenvironmental protection, intra-tumoral heterogeneity and metabolic flexibility
limit the utility of current AML therapies. To identify new therapy targets in AML, we adapted an shRNA screen
for testing primary AML cells under bone marrow microenvironment-like conditions. We discovered that many
AML patient samples are highly dependent on SIRT5, while normal CD34+ cells are not. SIRT5 is a lysine
deacylase implicated in the regulation of energy metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), fatty acid β-oxidation and glycolysis. SIRT5 knockdown (KD) reduces growth and increases
apoptosis in most AML cell lines, with consistent results upon disruption of SIRT5 using CRISPR/Cas9 or
NRD167, a novel cell-permeable SIRT5 inhibitor. Genetic absence of Sirt5 impairs in vitro transformation of
mouse hematopoietic cells by several myeloid oncogenes, including MLL-AF9, and attenuates leukemogenesis
in vivo. At a biochemical level, SIRT5 KD or inhibition with NRD167 is associated with reduced OXPHOS,
reduced glutathione levels and increased mitochondrial superoxide, suggesting that AML cells depend on SIRT5
to maintain redox homeostasis. Sirt5-/- mice are viable with minor metabolic abnormalities, suggesting that in
vivo inhibition of SIRT5 would be tolerated. We hypothesize that SIRT5 is a therapy target in AML and will test
this in three Specific Aims: (1) Identify and validate SIRT5-regulated metabolic pathways in normal and
AML stem and progenitor cells. (2) Identify biomarkers of sensitivity to SIRT5 inhibition in primary AML
cells. (3) Identify a potent, selective, and bioavailable SIRT5 inhibitor, starting from the NRD167 tool
compound. Our work will rigorously test whether SIRT5 is a therapy target in AML, clarify the mechanisms
underlying SIRT5 dependence, and identify potent and selective SIRT5 inhibitors for future clinical development."

Rates of mental, emotional, and behavioral problems among youth are concerningly high, with one in four
reporting a diagnosable disorder during the pandemic and its aftermath. Half of all lifetime mental health
disorders begin by age 14, but on average, services are not received until 8 to 10 years after symptom onset.
Schools are the primary mental health service setting for youth. Therefore, it is more critical than ever to develop
effective, scalable products to support school mental health (SMH) providers as they struggle to meet the ever-
growing mental health needs of students. Digital technologies offer a cost- and time-efficient medium to help
SMH providers optimize their limited in-person time and augment their care to address the clinical needs of as
many youth as possible. The goal of this SBIR is to create Assist-MH, a new interactive digital support system
for SMH providers. The proposed Assist-MH product will offer an innovative suite of SMH supports, including an
interactive treatment planning tool that generates provider-led and student self-paced MH strategies tailored to
the student’s individual needs, along with built-in tools to facilitate monitoring student progress over time. In
Phase I, we will focus on anxiety and depression for 12-to-17-year-old students as this age group has reported
a concerning increase in these MH symptoms in recent years. To guide the development of Assist-MH, we will
conduct stakeholder groups to gather initial input on current challenges and opportunities and specific
recommendations to guide software design and content development. We will use the stakeholder input to
finalize specific strategies and components from the Planning and Admin Centers to be built into the Phase I
fully functioning prototype. MH providers will use the prototype with students they serve over a two-month trial
period. We expect significant improvement in both provider and student outcomes as well as high usability,
feasibility, and value ratings, yielding a positive proof of concept for the full Assist-MH product. Phase I findings
will be used to guide Phase II refinement and expansion. As schools are the primary setting where youth obtain
MH care, Assist-MH offers the potential to provide crucial support to SMH providers in their efforts to address
our nation’s youth mental health crisis."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer globally, resulting in over 800,000
deaths annually. Approximately 10% of people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide are infected with HBV and
prevention of HBV infection remains a critical goal in PLWH. Vaccination with ENGERIX-B and other alum
adjuvanted hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccines has been the cornerstone of HBV prevention, but the
response to current standard vaccination is suboptimal in PLWH. HEPLISAV-B vaccine is HBsAg combined
with CpG 1018 adjuvant, a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist. A Phase III trial, A5379, randomized PLWH
with a prior history of HBV vaccination who do not achieve protective HBsAb levels to receive three doses of
HEPLISAV-B or ENGERIX-B. Preliminary analysis demonstrates significantly higher response rates with
HEPLISAV-B. To explore the immunologic mechanisms associated with increased rates of response, we plan
to compare innate and adaptive immune responses induced by HEPLISAV-B to those of ENGERIX-B
vaccination. In Aim 1, we define the innate immune signatures of CpG 1018 and alum adjuvated HBsAg
vaccination, including plasma chemokine and cytokine and transcriptomic profiles that are associated with
response to vaccination and with adaptive cell phenotypes defined in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we compare HBsAg-
specific B- and T-cell responses following three doses of HEPLISAV-B to those induced with a standard three-
dose regimen of ENGERIX-B, using high dimensional flow cytometry and single cell RNAseq to define the
immunologic and metabolic profiles of HBV-specific T and B cells associated with vaccine response. Previous
studies have shown that TLR9 activation in HIV infection increases HIV-1 transcription and reduces proviral
DNA, key outcomes in HIV-1 cure strategies. Thus, Aim 3 will assess the HIV reservoir and HIV-specific
immune responses before and after vaccination with HEPLISAV-B. With these three complementary but
independent aims, we will define innate and cellular characteristics associated with superior antibody
production, with broad implications regarding the use of TLR9 agonist vaccine adjuvants in populations with
suboptimal vaccine responses and improved understanding of dysregulation of immune responses in PLWH.
Additionally, this research leverages a large and diverse participant group to explore the dynamics of HIV
reservoir maintenance after TLR9 agonist exposure with the potential to inform development of HIV curative
strategies."

Further, more than one-quarter of cancer patients in Mexico suffer from a depression disorder and about half
have significant mood disorder symptoms. Also, research shows is a prevalence of 67-82% clinical depressive
symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Patients with advanced cancer have specific needs; among the
most pressing are to receive help in dealing with their mortality fears, uncertainty about the future, and spiritual
concerns. However, there are no targeted psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions available for
Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. Meaning-Centered psychotherapy (MCP) is a novel
psychotherapeutic intervention designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of
meaning, peace and purpose as they approach the end-of-life. Meaning Centered Psychotherapy has been
culturally adapted and found feasible in a pilot study with heterogenous Spanish-speaking Latinos with
advanced cancer, but not yet tested with Mexican cancer patients. This study is a collaboration of investigators
from two major cancer centers, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, where MCP f or Latinos,
MCP-L, was adapted) and the National Mexican Cancer Institute (INCan, Spanish Acronym), the major public
cancer center in Mexico and Central American region serving approximately 1000 new annual patients.
Implementation of this project in INCan is feasible given the resources (psycho-oncology service with 3 full
time psychologists) and institutional support for psycho-oncology research. Informed by implementation
science framework, the objective of this study is to conduct a type 1 hybrid (testing effects of an intervention
while gathering information on implementation) randomized clinical trial. The first aim examines the impact of
Meaning Centered Psychotherapy for Mexicans on improving depression and anxiety (primary outcomes) and
the secondary outcomes: distress, hopelessness, symptom burden and quality of life, compared to the control
condition (cognitive behavioral therapy) at one and three months after treatment. We will also examine the
mediation effect of spiritual and existential (meaning) well-being and moderation effect of socioeconomic
hardship and literacy. Guided by a dissemination and implementation model and using a mixed-methods
approach, the second aim examines the factors influencing the intervention implementation at the external,
organizational, and patient levels, and potential implementation strategies. The third aim is to increase and
support clinical and research capacity by providing specialized training to the INCan team and cancer MH
providers from Latin American. This study is significant in that it targets the emotional impact of a diagnosis of
advanced cancer in Mexican patients, a prevalent yet understudied need in this population. This study is
innovative because it will be the first evidence-based psychotherapy intervention adapted for a low- and
middle-income country to treat patients with advanced cancer."

Genomic sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify clinically relevant genetic variants, yet
there are many challenges to overcome before this technology can be applied routinely in the healthy
population to identify individuals with actionable disorders in time to prevent or ameliorate symptoms. This
project explores an innovative age-based genomic screening (ABGS) paradigm that aims to provide targeted
and highly actionable genetic information to parents via their child’s routine wellness visits, thereby avoiding
some of the more difficult aspects of genome-scale sequencing while retaining most of the benefits. We will
utilize an established metric that evaluates parameters relevant to “clinical actionability” and defines the age of
onset and/or the age of intervention, to identify conditions that would be applicable for screening. In
collaboration with a diverse Expert Deliberative Group, we will define a consensus framework for carrying out
the ABGS program using targeted sequencing panels at specified time-points during infancy and childhood.
We will engage community stakeholders to raise awareness of the ABGS program and obtain critical feedback
to inform the development of accessible study materials. We will apply the Genetic Medicine Implementation
Research framework and utilize rigorous methods and measures to identify potential barriers and facilitators
and develop strategies to address them. Finally, we will conduct a pilot project in a small number of primary
care pediatrics clinics assessing preliminary outcomes, including perspectives of parents and providers, and
the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of ABGS. The expected result of this proposal is a validated,
stakeholder-informed, and practical ABGS program that includes hundreds of conditions that are actionable
throughout the lifespan, setting the stage for a future longitudinal study in a larger number of practices that can
assess clinical and health economic outcomes. Throughout this work, we will employ a community-based
participatory research approach to seek out perspectives from diverse stakeholders and emphasize the
importance of studying ABGS in a wide range of settings. The long-term goal of this research program is to
create a broadly applicable genomic screening program that extends well beyond newborn screening and can
be incorporated into routine well child care. We envision that this program will also prepare individuals to
eventually make informed decisions about the potential benefits and risks of screening for adult-onset
conditions during adulthood, thus creating a connection between genomic screening efforts in all age groups.

In collaboration with partners and end users, we will define a consensus framework for targeted DNA-based
sequencing panels at specified time-points during infancy and childhood. We will engage community
stakeholders to raise awareness of the ABGS program and obtain critical feedback to inform the development
of accessible study materials. We will apply the Genetic Medicine Implementation Research framework to
identify potential barriers and facilitators and develop strategies to address them. Finally, we will conduct a pilot
project in four primary care pediatrics clinics assessing preliminary outcomes, including perspectives of parents
and providers, and the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of ABGS."

This K08 mentored career development award proposal details a research and training plan that is designed to
facilitate the career development and transition of Lisa Niswander, MD PhD to an independent physician-scientist
investigator. Dr. Niswander is a pediatric oncologist and an Instructor of Pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP) and University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Her long-term goal is to lead an NIH-funded
research program focused on the preclinical development and early bench-to-bedside translation of targeted
therapies and immunotherapies to improve outcomes for children with leukemia. During the 5-year award period,
critical technical and scientific training will be acquired in T cell and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
immunobiology, single cell transcriptomics, early-phase clinical trial design, leadership, and scientific
communication. Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Sarah Tasian, a leader in the development of molecularly-
targeted and CAR T cell therapies for high-risk pediatric leukemias, and co-mentorship of Dr. Martin Carroll, an
expert in acute leukemia signaling, in tandem with a complementary advisory committee of senior scientists, this
scientific research program and training plan will be bolstered by the resource-rich environment at CHOP/Penn.
Despite high cure rates in most children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), infants with B-ALL
have dismal outcomes. Most cases of infant B-ALL are characterized by KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-R)
with resulting fusion proteins that complex with critical adaptor protein menin to drive leukemogenesis and/or by
frequent activating RAS pathway mutations. Promising preclinical and early clinical efforts have focused on small
molecule disruption of KMT2A-menin binding (menin-i) and on MEK inhibitor (MEK-i) blockade of RAS signaling.
CD19-directed CAR T cell immunotherapy (CD19CART) has achieved high response rates in children with B-
ALL, including infants with KMT2A-R ALL. However, at least 50% of these patients will ultimately relapse. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that combining CD19CART with pharmacologic disruption of specific
KMT2A-R ALL biologic vulnerabilities, including menin-binding or aberrant RAS signaling, will improve treatment
efficacy and long-term remission in KMT2A-R ALL. To test this hypothesis, the combinatorial strategy of menin-
i (Aim 1) and MEK-i (Aim 2) with CD19CART against KMT2A-R ALL will be investigated. The effects of these
dual approaches will be elucidated for both anti-leukemia therapeutic activity and for CD19CART functionality
and persistence. Successful completion of this career development award will identify promising co-therapeutic
strategies with CD19CART poised for rapid clinical translation for children with KMT2A-R ALL. These research
and training efforts will also propel Dr. Niswander’s transition to independence by establishing a robust scientific
pipeline for future investigation of targeted inhibitors with immunotherapies in pediatric leukemias."
10983492,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiomyopathy is classified into ischemic cardiomyopathy, caused by coronary artery disease, or non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy, caused by other factors. The current standard practice for diagnosing the cause of
cardiomyopathy is to use coronary angiography to assess the presence or absence of coronary artery disease.
However, this approach is flawed and may not always accurately identify the underlying cause of the
myocardial disease. Recent advancements in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allow for a myocardial
approach to identifying the cause of cardiomyopathy by directly visualizing myocardial abnormalities, including
tissue damage. We hypothesize that a myocardial approach will reclassify the cause of cardiomyopathy in a
clinically significant proportion of patients and improve the prediction of long-term outcomes. To test this
hypothesis, we will use a large cohort of patients from an institutional registry of consecutive patients
undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for clinical reasons. Our study's anticipated results will
provide novel, large-scale data on the cause of cardiomyopathy and its long-term prognostic impact, clarifying
the extent of misclassification when using a coronary approach. This information will be essential to conduct a
randomized clinical trial comparing a myocardial approach to the coronary approach for identifying the cause of
cardiomyopathy. More accurate recognition of the cause of cardiomyopathy will allow for increased use of
appropriate cause-specific treatments, improving the long-term outcomes of patients. The study's results will
be relevant to the 1 million Americans diagnosed with heart failure and the several thousand others diagnosed
with cardiomyopathy without heart failure every year. The proposed work has a high potential to lead to
improvements in clinical practice and patient outcomes on a large scale."

10983541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue-specific genes are underutilized as disease targets. Tissue-specific genes show narrow expression, play
key roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and are thought to be good drug candidates. Thus, targeting of
dysfunctional tissue-specific genes can provide a safer therapeutic approach due to the reduced risk of side
effects. However, identifying which tissue-specific genes are critical in disease is a bottleneck in drug discovery.
We hypothesize that key tissue-specific genes have the ability to spread perturbations in a protein-protein
interactome and can be identified by their context specific functionality. This approach offers a paradigm shift
from conventional analyses that uniquely focus on one-gene expression levels. We recently proposed Gene
Utility Model (GUM) which hypothesizes that it is how a gene is utilized in protein-protein interaction (PPI)
network dictates its importance in disease development. We will use information flow of a gene within a PPI
network to represent the gene utility in a given biological state. Under this scenario, genes with high information
flows (i.e., high gene utilities) in a disease state, instead of gene expression level, are deemed to play more
important roles in disease development. Thus, this application seeks to increase the clinical utility of NIH
Common Funds datasets by employing state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to precisely and reliably
identifying tissue-specific druggable functional genes (TS-DFGs). We will construct a prototype for Common
Fund Gene Utility Compendium by leveraging four NIH Common Fund datasets: Genotype Tissue Expression
(GTEx), Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Illuminating the Druggable Genome
(IDG), and 4D Nucleome (4DN). We will focus on three disease types, liver cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as proof-of-concept studies. In Aim 1, we will uncover highly
utilized tissue-specific genes across multiple normal tissue types and three selected disease types. We will then
construct utility karyotype to indicate chromosomal regions enriched with highly utilized genes. In Aim 2, we will
employ selectivity, controllability, and suitability as criteria to score druggability for TS-DFG candidates with
respect to liver cancer, NAFLD, and AD. Druggable utility networks (DUNs) with respect to each disease type
will be constructed to assess the distribution of highly score TS-DFGs in a PPI network and signaling pathways.
The constructed prototype of the Common Fund Gene Utility Compendium will promote innovative research to
enhance the usage and provide added clinical value for the NIH Common Fund datasets by offering a new
paradigm shift for target and drug discovery. Our long-term goal is to enlarge this compendium by including
more diseases across different tissue types to facilitate integrative pan-tissue analyses and drive drug
discovery."
10983544,"Project Summary
 The aim of this project is to develop a novel, rapid, and memory efﬁcient open-source software for
radiofrequency (RF) coil modeling in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultra-high ﬁeld (UHF) scanners
(> 3T) can reveal remarkable anatomical details to diagnose diseases much earlier than high ﬁeld scanners.
Nevertheless, the operating wavelength at UHF is shorter than the dimensions of the body, therefore constructive
and destructive interference patterns of the coil-generated RF ﬁelds can occur in the torso and head. This can
lead to local RF energy deposition hotspots, which is a patient’s safety concern, and signal dropouts that can
deteriorate the diagnostic quality of the MRI. To address this, electromagnetic (EM) simulations are used for
the careful design and evaluation of RF coils arrays before prototyping. Commercial software can perform such
simulations but are restricted by expensive licenses and can be prohibitively slow for the optimization of complex
setups, for example, two months of simulation time for a 64-channel receive coil at 7T.
 A novel, highly accurate and memory-efﬁcient EM simulation tool for MRI modeling is proposed in this project.
Aim 1 will focus on the development of a domain decomposition method for modeling the EM interactions
between RF coils and biological tissue, using wire, surface, and volume integral equation methods. Tensor
decompositions will be used to assemble low-memory formats of these interactions for faster simulations, which
can be run on a GPU for hundred times speedup compared to commercial packages. Aim 2 will focus on devel-
oping an RF circuit simulator for coil tuning, matching, and decoupling using particle swarm optimization.
These methods will form a co-simulator for comprehensive RF coil modeling in MRI. In Aim 3 we will focus on
the validation of the novel simulation software, comparing its accuracy, memory, and speed to commercial pack-
ages and experimentally measured ﬁelds at 7T. The software will be used to design, optimize, and construct a
novel 7T coil for prostate imaging.
 This project will utilize, for the ﬁrst time, tensor decompositions to create a powerful and innovative EM mod-
eling software tool for MRI. The software will be compatible with any MRI frequency and anatomy without the
need for expensive licenses. This “Pathway to Independence” award proposal also includes a mentored career
development plan to help the candidate, Dr. Ilias Giannakopoulos, becoming an independent investigator. His
primary mentor, Dr. Riccardo Lattanzi, and co-mentors Dr. Daniel Sodickson and Dr. Ryan Brown, are leading
experts in the ﬁeld of EM interactions with biological tissue and coil design. The diversiﬁed mentoring plan and
the complementary background of these mentors will provide valuable exposure to coil design and prototyping,
UHF MRI, and interdisciplinary collaborations to help the candidate transition to an independent investigator posi-
tion. Ultimately, Dr. Giannakopoulos aims for a successful career as a faculty member in Radiology or Biomedical
Engineering, researching hardware and software tools to advance clinical biomedical imaging."
10984767,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide and at $475 billion/year also the costliest
disease in the US, is highly heritable. Ischemia initiates specific biological processes that are highly dependent
on genetic, transcriptional, and translational variation. In particular, regulation by noncoding RNAs (ncRNA),
crucial components in the human genome, play a significant role in the biology of myocytes undergoing
ischemia. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are emerging as new regulators of cell-to-cell communication carrying
biological information, including proteins, lipids, and ncRNAs. The ncRNAs contained in EV, namely
extracellular RNAs (exRNA), include microRNAs and other types of small RNAs and lncRNAs, some of which
have been shown to be regulated by stressors and mediate functional effects in their recipient cells. Thus,
exRNA offer tremendous potential as therapeutic molecules and biomarkers of disease.
We have built a unique human tissue sample bank of over 230 patients experiencing myocardial ischemia
while undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB is an applied human model of
ischemia, as it is associated with obligatory ischemic myocardial injury evidenced by cardiac biomarker
release, and therefore shares commonality with ambulatory myocardial infarction. Using this resource and as
part of our NHLBI award, in the past four years we examined mRNA differential expression, lncRNAs, and
microRNAs in ischemic human left ventricular myocardium, putting us in an ideal position to study the
significance of exRNA in myocardial ischemic injury.
We now propose to further explore the role of various short- and long ncRNAs by examining acute dynamic
changes in ncRNAs in response to ischemia. Therefore, we will characterize the ncRNA transcriptome in the
human and mouse heart, examine exRNA at various non-ischemic and ischemic time points in humans and
mice, test for expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and validate in a large population of cardiac surgical
patients. Furthermore, we will use an ischemic mouse model to determine if the dynamically regulated exRNAs
are present specifically in cardiomyocyte-derived EVs which will provide the framework for future interventional
genetic studies.
The results of this study will define the link between genetic variation, altered ncRNA expression and
myocardial injury in human myocardial tissue and its associated ncRNA peripheral biomarkers. These ncRNA
biomarkers can have an immediate clinical impact and advance the biological understanding, diagnosis and
therapy of myocardial injury in humans."
10987578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recording whole-brain activity with single neuron resolution and millisecond timescale precision is crucial to
understanding how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Simultaneous
recording and stimulation of large populations of neurons distributed throughout the brain are needed to
rigorously evaluate theories of neural computation at the cellular level in mammals, and extended longitudinal
recordings are required to establish general principles for neuronal circuits/dynamics and how complex
neuronal activity relates to behavior, both to further our fundamental understanding of the brain, but also to
surface underlying causes of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, TBI,
epilepsy, and depression, and to aid development of novel and more effective treatments.
These are key goals of the BRAIN initiative, and the driving force behind LeafLabs' Willow, an
electrophysiology recording system designed to take advantage of novel, close-packed 1000-channel silicon
probes originally developed by the Synthetic Neurobiology Group at MIT. These ultra-high-channel-count
probes allow for more neurons to be recorded simultaneously, opening up new lines of scientific inquiry, and
the dense packing of the electrodes permits spatial oversampling of the neurons, allowing for automated spike
sorting techniques with greatly increased capability for tracking individual units.
Additionally, LeafLabs' Catkin, a custom 1000 channel neurosensing IC chip (filter, amplification, multiplexing,
and analog-digital conversion) has been developed to integrate with these probes, resulting in a
probe/headstage combo suitable for use in freely-moving electrophysiology experiments that reduces size,
weight, and cost each by a factor of 10 compared to commercially available headstages. Currently, the Catkin
probe/headstage combo is tethered to the Willow DAQ system by an ultra thin and lightweight cable (a single
shielded 32 AWG twisted pair), resulting in a system ideal for many prolonged freely moving experiments.
However, in certain behavioral setups, even a lightweight, minimalist cable is undesirable. For example,
because the high data rates are incompatible with approaches used to manage the cable tether
(commutators), researchers must occasionally intervene to de-tangle cables; or, the presence of a tether may
result in altered behavior from animals. To address these needs, this application proposes the development of
a first-of-its-kind fully untethered 1000-channel-simultaneous 30kHz in-vivo electrophysiological
recording module, to be made available as a lightweight add-on to the extant Willow system."
10984676,"Abstract
In the past decade three highly virulent human betacoronaviruses have emerged, including SARS-CoV-2 which
has caused a devastating pandemic and is responsible for the deaths of over 6 million people worldwide. Current
vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments for SARS-CoV-2 are susceptible to mutations in the virus
which can lead to decreased efficacy of these therapies. Two other highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have no approved vaccines or therapeutics. There is an urgent need for broadly
acting antibodies and vaccines which can protect against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 or future emerging
human betacoronaviruses. Our current vaccines and mAbs for SARS-CoV-2 target the viral spike protein. The
spike (S) is necessary and sufficient to mediate entry of the virus into host cells. S is comprised of two subunits.
S1 is the receptor binding subunit and a major target of antibodies produced by current vaccines and mAb
therapies. S2 is the membrane fusion subunit and is highly conserved among betacoronaviruses. Little is known
about S2 targeting antibodies and their potential use in protecting against betacoronavirus infections. In this
project we will identify and design broadly acting S2 antibodies as well as investigate Fc-effector functions of
these antibodies. A multipronged approach using neutralization assays, in vitro Fc-effector function assays and
systems serology will evaluate the functional properties of S2 antibodies from mice immunized with S2
immunogens. Using a panel of replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) pseudotype viruses
expressing the spike protein from a wide range of betacoronaviruses (rVSV-CoVs) we will be able to identify
antibodies that are broadly acting. Finally, by using what we learn in our analysis of endogenously produced S2
antibodies we will design bispecific S2 targeting antibodies to develop novel therapeutics broadly targeting
betacoronaviruses. This project will significantly add to our knowledge of the role S2 antibodies play in infection
with betacoronaviruses and how these antibodies can be utilized for future pandemic preparedness."

This K08 application proposes to establish robust phenotyping pipelines for detection of early Collagen Type
IV-Associated Nephropathy (COL4A-AN) using electronic health records (EHR). The study aims to overcome
diagnostic challenges associated with the diverse manifestations of COL4A-AN, enabling timely, personalized
interventions crucial for delaying chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Utilizing EHR data presents an
opportunity to support CKD subtype identification but faces hurdles such as data heterogeneity and semantic
gaps across health systems. The proposed solution involves leveraging well-established, open-source, Natural
Language Processing (NLP) systems to convert unstructured clinical narratives into structured data, aiming to
extract nuanced phenotypic descriptions for early COL4A-AN patient identification. Moreover, these
experiments utilize the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and Observational Medical Outcomes
Partnership-Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM v5.4) to standardize language and guarantee data
interoperability, enabling broader research application.
The project endeavors to create precise, transferable EHR prediction models for diverse CKD subtypes, laying
the groundwork for automated decision support tools, with a broad impact on COL4A-AN patients, those with
genetic CKD subtypes, and the precision nephrology field. Through two experiments, it aims to develop highly
efficient early disease prediction models for COL4A-AN by mining unstructured text and leveraging nuanced
phenotype data from clinicians' narratives, distinct from ICD code-based models. The primary goal of this study
is to establish scalable phenotyping pipelines to identify patients with genetic CKD subtypes, using NLP and
standardized data models to enhance prediction accuracy and automate decision-support tools. Standardizing
the early COL4A-AN prediction models will facilitate research transparency and foster collaboration across
multiple institutions. This project facilitates the creation of EHR-embedded decision support tools. Moreover, it
lays the groundwork for a future R01 clinical trial application that aims to investigate the diagnostic yield among
patients highly likely to have COL4A-AN, who will subsequently be referred for genetic testing. These efforts
set the stage for future studies examining how early diagnosis influences the progression of CKD.
The comprehensive training plan is specifically designed to provide Dr. Jordan Nestor with NLP expertise for
extracting nuanced phenotypes from unstructured EHR narratives, creating EHR-based prediction models, and
aiding her transition into an independent NIH-funded investigator. Dr. Nestor's ultimate objective is to advance
patient care and enhance CKD outcomes through the direct implementation of precision nephrology at the
point of care."

UMaine’s Zebrafish Facility is critical to the success of most NIH funded faculty at UMaine. Overall, 12 UMaine
faculty, their technicians, undergraduate, and graduate students use the Zebrafish Facility for their research on
an annual basis. These faculty represent a number of different units at UMaine including the Department of
Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, the School of Biology and Ecology, and the School of Marine Sciences.
Zebrafish have been used by UMaine faculty studying many different disease processes, including influenza,
muscular dystrophy, and Candida fungal infections. The Zebrafish Facility is also relevant to UMaine faculty in
disciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, who are developing devices and technologies to
address the prevention and treatment of human disease processes.
UMaine’s current zebrafish facility typically operates at 98-100% capacity. Although an excellent facility that is
93% base-funded by the University of Maine; the limited capacity hinders all investigators who use the
zebrafish model. UMaine’s first Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant, which started in
April 2023, provides the initial nucleus of funding for converting a teaching laboratory into an additional
zebrafish facility that will more than double the available space for zebrafish. The remainder of the necessary
funding for the renovation is being provided by the University of Maine, demonstrating the deep commitment of
UMaine to this project. The Office of the Vice President for Research at UMaine has also committed funds to
purchase some necessary equipment including the live feed systems, dosing system, spawning tanks, and
crossing shelves (see letter of support). Here, we propose to purchase the central filtration system for the
facility, as well as 11 double-sided racks and the AquaTouch 2 monitoring system. These will more than double
our current capacity for stock maintenance and increase daily breeding capacity from 25 to 175 tanks per day.
This increased capacity is necessary for the continued success of this shared zebrafish facility. Thus, receipt of
this grant will have a tremendous impact on research growth at the University of Maine."

Extracting information that allows us to understand our experiences and predict the future is crucial for interacting
adaptively with our environment. This information takes on many forms, however, and we cannot always know
in advance the optimal way to encode something new. We know that the brain solves this problem in part by
encoding new information in multiple formats, but it must then have a way of retrieving the right format at the
right moments. Prior literature suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus are likely to
be the key regions involved in extracting new information and deciding how to deploy it, and this supplement has
the potential to provide significant new insight into how these regions communicate to accomplish these feats,
through both empirical and computational modeling investigations. The literature suggests that the monosynaptic
pathway (MSP) of the hippocampus is especially well suited to representing commonalities, whereas the
trisynaptic pathway (TSP) excels at the distinctions, and we propose that the mPFC is well positioned to help
guide the flow of information through these pathways of the hippocampus. Using univariate and multivariate
functional connectivity analyses, we will evaluate how subregions of the hippocampus and mPFC work together
to retrieve commonalities vs. distinctions as a function of the task. This work would be the first to use multivariate
connectivity techniques to investigate how the mPFC and hippocampus interact in deploying different forms of
task-dependent representations. In tandem with the functional connectivity analyses, we propose a
computational model that will provide a mechanistic account of how the mPFC influences the representational
content and information flow in the hippocampus. Our work will tackle basic brain mechanisms in a healthy
population but will set the stage for better understanding of how these networks and processes may break down
in the context of psychiatric and neurological disorders impacting the hippocampus and PFC."

High grade glioma (HGG) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults and is universally lethal. The
standard of care for HGG has remained unchanged for over 30 years and median survival is devastatingly low
at only 15 months post diagnosis. Epigenetic aberrations are a key molecular feature that contribute to disease
pathogenesis. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to define epigenomic dysregulations that promote HGG
growth and determine the mechanisms through which these alterations drive tumorigenesis.
HGG tumors with increased chromatin accessibility tend to have more favorable outcomes. We recently showed
Sox9 inhibits histone deacetylases in HGG to increase H3K27 acetylation, which significantly extends median
survival in mice. Analysis of Sox9 in human HGG revealed it interacts with numerous epigenetic modifying
proteins, including Hp1bp3, a heterochromatin binding protein. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing of
familial glioma patients and their families nominated Hp1bp3 as a potential tumor suppressor, with loss-of-
function (LOF) mutations driving oncogenesis. Using an in-utero electroporation (IUE) mouse model of HGG, we
found that Hp1bp3 loss-of-function (LOF) tumors are hyperproliferative with decreased median survival while
HP1BP3 gain-of-function (GOF) stunts tumor growth and extends survival. Additionally, ATAC-Sequencing of
LOF tumors revealed a global decrease in accessible chromatin. These preliminary results lead me to
hypothesize that Hp1bp3 orchestrates chromatin remodeling to slow tumor growth in HGG.
To understand the role of Hp1bp3 in regulating the epigenome and how this impacts HGG progression, I purpose
three aims. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of Hp1bp3 in our IUE and PDX models. In the second aim, I will
determine the epigenomic alterations associated with Hp1bp3 by profiling H3Kme3 and H4K20me3 marks which
appear to be altered by Hp1bp3 in HGG. Lastly, ChIP-Seq on Hp1bp3 in HGG mouse tumor revealed Hp1bp3
binds DNA at gene loci involved with methionine and one-carbon metabolism. Therefore, aim three will identify
the metabolic changes in Hp1bp3 mutant tumors using metabolomics and determine how these alterations drive
tumor growth.
Overall, this research aims to expand our understanding of how epigenetic dysregulation in HGG drives disease
progression. Importantly, this work will nominate new epigenetic candidates as potential drug targets in HGG."
10997121,"Project Summary/Abstract
An organism’s ability to grow, develop, and reproduce are some of the defining characteristics of life. Central to
growth and reproduction of organisms ranging from single-celled baker’s yeast to humans is the ability of a cell
to replicate its genome and accurately divide the genome into two daughter cells. Errors in the replication or
division of the genome can result in genetic changes that cause disease or are lethal to the cell or organism.
Segregation of the genome is accomplished through an intricate series of steps wherein spindle microtubules
must successfully bind sister chromatids and pull one copy of each chromosome into each daughter cell. The
kinetochore, a conserved megadalton protein complex, mediates microtubule attachment to chromosomes.
Although prior work has successfully charted many kinetochore components, as well as key regulatory steps in
kinetochore assembly and function, this process is still incompletely defined. The goal of this proposal is to
understand how post-translational modifications, specifically ubiquitin, contribute to kinetochore assembly and
function in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a combination of proteomics, yeast genetics,
and biochemistry, I will generate a comprehensive map of kinetochore regulation by the Mub1/Ubr2 E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex (Aim 1) and investigate how a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the cullin-RING ligases,
regulates kinetochore function (Aim 2). Combined, these approaches will allow me to address how ubiquitylation
influences kinetochore function and generate new knowledge surrounding kinetochore regulation. Given the
highly conserved nature of the kinetochore, this work will likely identify principles of kinetochore regulation that
apply to multiple organisms. Understanding these principles could provide insight into the cellular adaptations
that occur in response to pathological changes in chromosome number (aneuploidy), a common feature of
cancer cells. The training facilitated by this fellowship, along with my previous research experiences, will allow
me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent academic investigator, with the long-term goal of
establishing a research program that uses yeast and mammalian systems to study mechanisms of kinetochore
regulation."

1) Develop and administer a pilot project program within the center focused on the academic development of
underrepresented minority junior faculty and post-docs across the full spectrum of research focused on addressing
health disparities.
2) Mentor the pilot project investigators for their career development, publications, and research outcomes
derived from pilot project funds.
3) Implement and facilitate a grant submission timeline for extramural funding appropriate to the pilot
investigator's career stage. The IDC is envisioned as a magnet and an engine - a magnet that attracts early-
stage investigators into health disparities research and an engine that nurtures them toward success in NIH grant

many parents do not consistently parent in ways that protect their children from obesity. Further, several
interventions to improve parenting as a means to address early childhood obesity have struggled with parent
engagement and adherence. In adults, poor self-regulation, or limitations in an individuals' capacity to regulate
emotions, thoughts, and behavior, is a robust, yet modifiable, risk factor for obesity. Poor self-regulation may
similarly interfere with parents' ability to parent in ways that support their children's healthy weight, but there
are no robust data to directly support this conjecture. Further, while improving children's self-regulation has
been identified as a promising method to address childhood obesity, we do not currently understand how
parent and child self-regulation work together to impact children's growth. This lack of information precludes us
from identifying whether targeting child self-regulation alone, parent self-regulation alone, or both together,
may be the most effective means to prevent or treat childhood obesity. Our long-term goal is to identify
strategies to sustainably improve parents' use of practices that support children's healthy weight. The objective
of this study is to identify the interrelationships between mothers' self-regulation, their weight-related parenting
practices, child self-regulation, and child adiposity from ages 3 through 5, a critical period for preventing the
onset of long-term obesity. Our central hypothesis is that poor self-regulation impedes mothers' engagement in
parenting practices that support children's healthy weight, leading to excessive gains in adiposity among young
children. We also expect that in families where both mothers and children have poor self-regulation, mothers
have even greater difficulty engaging in effective weight-related parenting, and children will experience the
most rapid gains in adiposity. To test this central hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective cohort study
enrolling a socio-demographically diverse sample of 300 mother/child dyads, collecting data 3 times over 2.5
years to address the following specific aims: (1) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and
weight-related parenting practices, (2) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and changes in
child adiposity, and (3) Identify how child self-regulation modifies relationships between mothers' self-
regulation, weight-related parenting, and child adiposity. This project is conceptually innovative in its focus on
mothers' self-regulation, its recognition of the dyadic interactions between mothers and children, and the use of
rigorous methods to measure self-regulation and parenting. This research is significant because it will elucidate
when, how, and among whom deficits in mothers' self-regulation contribute to their young children's obesity
risk. There are known strategies to improve self-regulation and enhance behavior change among adults with
poor self-regulation. Findings will provide essential guidance for the development of novel intervention
approaches to target mothers' self-regulation as a mechanism to prevent and treat childhood obesity."
11004425,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition, with serious negative impacts on quality of life, as well as financial and personal burden on sufferers and caregivers. There remains no disease modifying therapy. PD is strongly linked to aberrant oligomerization and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (αsyn) protein. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be isolated from vascularized tissue throughout the body and exert regenerative effects through their dynamic secretome, which is influenced by multiple factors including their microenvironment and any surrounding pathology. In this proposal, we hypothesize that by conditioning MSCs with PD-simulating stimuli, both chemical and patient-derived, we will enrich their secretome for factors which are particularly beneficial in combating αsyn-associated pathology. The potency of conditioned MSCs in targeting αsyn pathology will be assessed using biochemical and staining methods, using protein complementation, semi-native western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of oligomeric αsyn in cellular models of synucleinopathy, as well as assessing toxicity. By comparative proteomic analysis of the MSC secretome in the presence and absence of PD-simulating stimuli we will identify these beneficial secreted molecules and validate them for efficacy in alleviating αsyn-associated pathology in cellular models of synucleinopathy. For the K00 portion of this proposal, focus shifts to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an even more common neurodegenerative condition with no meaningful therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials based on rodent studies fail to translate efficacy to human subjects, highlighting the need for physiologically relevant translatable models. Further, genetic association studies have highlighted more than 20 risk loci, usually relatively common but with moderate effect sizes. In order to mechanistically probe these different genetic risk factors in a relevant, pathology-developing model we propose to generate human brain organoids from iPSCs, gene edited to reflect various distinct genetic risk profiles. We will perform longitudinal comparative transcriptomics (RNAseq) to identify common and distinct pathways associated with the progression of pathology in these models and determine therapeutic targets which may be generalizable to AD or specific to certain genetic backgrounds."
11004426,"Project Summary
The inheritance of both the maternal and paternal genes is required for normal development to proceed. Yet,
we are not equal products of both parents’ genes. With exclusive expression of specific genes from only one
parent, allelic effects have been suggested to influence genetic architecture and disease risk, but little is
known about their contributions to development. Fundamental obstacles of comprehensively understanding
the parental genetic inheritance and its regulation during development are limitations in incomplete coverage
of each cell within developing embryos, and the accuracy of differentiation between allele sequences. As the
closest living relatives of vertebrates, the ascidians C. intestinalis and C. savignyi provide the right degree of
simplicity among multicellular organisms and extreme divergence of the maternal and paternal genomes for
overcoming these limitations. Here I propose to use hybrid ascidians to elucidate the regulatory grammar of
allele-specific gene expression during development at single cell resolution.
During the K99 phase, I will work on Aim 1 and initiate Aim 2. Based on my preliminary results, I have
reconstructed the reference lineage map of temporal expression profiles for hybrid embryos using single cell
RNA-Seq technology. Due to the small cell numbers of ascidians, I expect to obtain comprehensive coverage
of every cell type during development, including rare neuronal subtypes. In Aim 1, based on the extreme
divergence between parental genomic sequences in hybrid embryos, I will characterize allele-specific
expression of each defined cell lineage, and develop novel approaches that are able to simultaneously profile
gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells, which will link parental expression patterns with
putative cis-regulatory DNA sequences. Upon the completion of Aim 1, I expect to establish potential
associations of allelic-specific expression and the specification and morphogenesis of individual cells and cell
lineages.
During the R00 phase, based on my training gained during the K99 phase, I will work on the highly innovative
Aim 2, in which I plan to develop the spatial transcriptomics technique in order to add another dimension to
dissect the allele-specific expression pattern and its regulation in the context of cell-cell contacts. Upon
successful completion of Aim 1 and Aim 2, this data-rich approach will greatly enhance our understanding of
parental genetic inheritance and its regulation, and eventually let us move closer to a holistic and quantitative
understanding of embryonic development. It also outlines an extensive career development plan for me to
complete my training under the mentorship of Prof. Levine and the transition to an independent academic
position by establishing a multi-disciplinary research program."

NBER Coordinating Center on the Economics of AD/ADRD Prevention, Treatment, and Care
This application proposes to establish a coordinating center for economic research on Alzheimer's disease (AD)
and AD-related dementia (ADRD) at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The consortium will
encompass the 4-5 research project (R01) grants that are awarded under the NIA's companion program
announcement on “Consortium for Economic Research on AD/ADRD Prevention, Treatment, and Care;” newly
funded Center studies selected annually from a national competition and supported under the Center's research
project core; the work of early career scholars selected for the Center's mentored scholars program; the NBER's
ongoing and separately-funded projects on the economics of ADRD; and selected other research on ADRD that
may be developed in the future. The underlying research projects that will be coordinated through the NBER
Center will be organized, at least initially, around four overarching themes: (1) Emerging Challenges in
Caregiving for People with ADRD, (2) Understanding ADRD Diagnosis and Progression, (3) Prevention and
Treatment of ADRD, and (4) Disparities in Healthcare for Patients with ADRD. In cooperation with NIA, we will
foster collaboration and synergies across consortium member research projects, initiate new high-impact
research projects that apply economic methods to understanding and improving the treatment and care for
people with ADRD; expand the network of researchers studying the economics of ADRD; and disseminate
findings to key stakeholders to support policymaking. An administrative core will provide intellectual leadership
and governance; centralized administrative, communications, and research support; support of early career
investigators; and ongoing monitoring of performance metrics though a program tracking plan. A research
projects core will support cutting edge research projects on the economics of ADRD prevention, treatment, and
care. A stakeholder engagement core will assure that the research projects are informed by the on the ground
experience of those working to prevent, treat and care for people living with ADRD and their families and
caregivers. A closely related translation core will encourage the application of findings from consortium research
in practical uses that improve the health and wellbeing of people living with AD/ADRD and their families;
disseminating findings and research resources, and convening an annual conference in Washington, DC."

Falls are a significant issue for older adults, causing physical, emotional, and financial strain. Research indicates that
regular and early fall screenings can reduce fall incidents and their severity. However, this test usually requires
supervision by healthcare professionals, limiting its accessibility, especially in underserved and rural areas. Current
technologies are often costly, invasive, and complicated to use independently, with many relying on self-reported data and
needing professional oversight for comprehensive fall risk assessment.
ForesightCares presents AVA as the first AI-powered, video-based mobile app for reliable at-home fall risk assessment.
AVA, a software-only solution, uses built-in cameras and CPU processing capabilities of smartphones for intelligent
processing. It is primarily designed for caregivers of older adults, including family members and staff in Independent
Living communities, to perform the assessment. AVA differentiates itself by using AI to assess gait, balance, and strength,
aligning with CDC guidelines. Its deep learning-based visual mobility assessment technology operates entirely on-device,
enhancing privacy and accessibility while avoiding external servers or cloud reliance. This makes AVA more accessible
and affordable for a broader range of users. However, the current version of AVA still requires validation and
customization for independent use in older adult living environments.
This Phase I study aims to validate AVA’s AI and evaluate its feasibility and acceptance as an effective video-based app
for routine fall risk assessment of older adults. The AVA will not be used as an intervention tool or a diagnosis app;
instead, it is solely used as a home assessment app for fall risk. Our approach focuses on rigorous validation on older
adults and studying and optimizing it for independent use by their caregivers. Our multifaceted team is a blend of AI and
computer vision specialists, software engineers, UX experts centered on human-driven design, senior community wellness
directors, physical therapists well-versed in fall risk assessment, and geriatricians. This project also proposes a close
partnership and collaboration with Wingate University and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
We will undertake a comprehensive validation and AI fine-tuning against high-end motion capture systems for accurate
and reliable assessment in a lab setting (through a collaboration with Wingate University) and 100 diverse older adult
participants. By bringing recent advances in large language models and self-supervised pre-trained models, we aim to
make AVA a perspective-invariant assessment app to achieve reliable measurements while relaxing the setup requirements
for independent at-home assessment. This project also aims to perform comprehensive user experience research and
usability studies in a controlled environment, involving 50 older adults from a wide range of demographics, including
those from our partnered Independent Living communities and rural, underserved areas, in collaboration with the NC
Healthy Aging program. The outcomes of this Phase I study will lay the groundwork for further development and
widespread implementation of AVA in Phase II and beyond. By providing much higher accessibility at a much lower cost,
AVA has the potential to transform fall risk assessment practices and enhance the quality of life for older adults."
11007382,"Abstract
The goal of proposed experiments in this application is to determine how HIV infection disrupts intestinal
barrier function. It is now appreciated that microbial translocation across an impaired epithelial barrier leads to
circulating LPS, persistent immune activation and chronic inflammation in people living with HIV (PLWH).
These HIV associated effects are important contributors to premature development of neurocognitive
disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and bone abnormalities even in PLWH on optimal
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Untreated infection is characterized by the production of
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα). Following
therapy, cytokine levels decline but chronic inflammation continues. Prevention of inflammation-induced
comorbidities requires the development of more specific therapeutics targeting the underlying cause. However,
a gap exists in our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways involved. This proposal will capitalize
on an established collaboration between investigators with expertise in HIV biology and intestinal barrier
function/pathobiology. We have generated strong preliminary data that provides a framework for understanding
the underlying link between disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier function and HIV infection. While the overall
chronic inflammatory manifestations of HIV infection are likely to be multi-factorial, our exciting results support
an overarching hypothesis that lamina propria HIV-1 infected primary human CD4+T lymphocytes that closely
interact with intestinal epithelial initiate a process leading to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines that negatively impact epithelial homeostasis resulting in a leaky intestinal barrier. Given these
important new insights, funding is requested to support a major collaborative effort between established
investigators in the areas of HIV biology and intestinal inflammation/barrier disruption to determine the
mechanism(s) through which primary human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and HIV-infected primary T cells
synergize to cause intestinal pathobiology. Specifically, we will determine the HIV-dependent mechanisms that
alter T-cell function and disrupt the intestinal barrier. In addition, we will identify the pathways altered in IECs
exposed to HIV infected T-cells that lead to barrier dysfunction. Findings generated from these studies will
allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV related enteropathy that is known to be a
major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals and will lead to development of new
strategies to improve the health of HIV infected people.

11007383,"Summary
Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis collectively referred as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
are diseases in which an aberrant intestinal immune response leads to chronic inflammation. IBD
affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans, 2.2 million people in Europe and hundreds of
thousands in the rest of the world. The pathogenesis of IBD, while not completely elucidated, is
thought to be multifactorial and caused by the interplay of genetics, the microbiome and the
environment. One of the major environmental factors associated with increasing the risk for IBD
is the diet that an individual consumes. Therefore, the ability to harness nutrition to treat disease
is a unique opportunity for profound intervention in IBD progression. The major challenge for
implementing dietary therapy for IBD is the lack of understanding of detailed mechanistic
pathways to explain the impact of dietary interventions on IBD severity or progression.
Epidemiological studies of IBD have shown dietary fiber as the most consistent macronutrient
associated with changing risk of IBD. Fiber affects several aspects of the digestive process.
Notably, it is also a main energy source for several bacterial species of the microbiome, and
differences in fiber consumption strongly affect the microbiome composition and metabolic
behavior. However, very few studies have systematically addressed the role of fiber consumption
in fluctuations of the microbiome that lead to specific changes in the intestinal immune response.
The overall goal of this project is to discover relevant dietary fiber-microbe-immune cell
interactions that prevent, induce or alter the course of gut inflammation. We will analyze the
changes in microbiota composition and intestinal cell populations caused by the lack of
fermentable fiber intake using a model in which mice are fed a complex diet that contains
fermentable and non-fermentable fiber or semi-purified ingredients diet lacking fermentable fiber.
Moreover, we will select purified fibers representing different fiber types and supplement them in
the non-fermentable diet to identify those whose consumption modulate intestinal responses in a
healthy state and during inflammation. Finally, to assess the impact of consuming a diet lacking
fermentable fiber on the immune system in the context of human microbiota, we will colonize germ
free mice with healthy human donor fecal samples and feed them either a mixed fiber, a non-
fermentable fiber or a non-fermentable fiber diet supplemented with specific fibers to identify
specific fiber supplementations that result in the modulation of immune responses by human
microbiota, as well as the bacterial members mediating this interaction."
11007665,"SUMMARY - Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia
Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed
symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change
with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed
research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective
intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading
instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the
intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a
child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes.
Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it
is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions
provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel
quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to
quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal
measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of
white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological
mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children.
Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word,
a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of
computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first
model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on
this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in
children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction.
Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment,
some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What
biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre-
intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in
intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to
develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes."
11007868,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current non-invasive blood pressure (BP) technologies are occlusive arm cuff-based and provide only single-
point BP measurements. In US hospitals, 35 million critically ill patients annually require BP monitoring. Still,
periodic cuff-based measures lead to monitoring gaps and complications, including 14 million episodes of acute
kidney injury and myocardial injury annually. In hospitals, continuous BP monitoring can be achieved with
invasive intra-arterial pressure (IAP) monitoring, but with significant risks. To address these limitations,
Dynocardia has developed ViTrack, a continuous noninvasive BP (cNIBP). ViTrack is a cuff-less, wrist-wearable
device with a proprietary optomechanical sensor and computer vision technology for accurate and continuous
BP, heart, and advanced hemodynamic parameters. ViTrack is the first to measure beat-to-beat systolic (SBP)
and diastolic (DBP) BPs directly without external calibration, irrespective of subject movement or wrist position
relative to the heart (hydrostatic pressure change). In the SBIR Phase II study [1 R44 HL158374], we achieved
the proposed milestones: (a) Improved the core ViTrack technologies and built minimal viable product (MVP);
and (b) Clinical testing of MVP against IAP in 60 patients, demonstrated accurate and continuous waveform and
BP readings every 20 seconds (Q20) regardless of movement, divergent BPs, abnormal heart rhythms, and
hemodynamic conditions. Subsequently, we have achieved several milestones, including the successful
deployment of the MVP in several renowned hospitals to demonstrate its effectiveness and gather user feedback.
Based on the user feedback, we have completed the final product requirements and form factor and begun
developing the production equivalent device in accordance with Design Controls. With the support of the CRP
Program, we will complete the Verification and Validation (V&V) of the production-grade ViTrack hospital device.
This will help to mitigate risks and enable us to submit the FDA 510k clearance. The ViTrack wearable will
improve outcomes in critically ill hospital patients, leading to ~$14 B in annual savings in healthcare costs. The
initial market validation in hospitals will facilitate expansion into other markets, such as remote patient monitoring,
chronic disease management, and consumer wellness."

 The overall goal of this program is the development and commercialization of a novel, safer, and more
effective, therapy for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a progressive and generally
fatal disease for which there is no cure. IPF has a median survival rate of 3-5 years, which is less than most
cancers. There are approximately 100,000 people in the US with IPF with 30,000 – 40,000 new cases per year.
As many as 40,000 Americans die each year from IPF. The two FDA approved drugs for IPF, pirfenidone and
nintedanib, only slow disease progression, have side effects which limit their use, and do not improve mortality.
Clearly, there is a significant need for therapies to treat this devastating disease. Additionally, there are several
other causes of progressive pulmonary fibrosis including connective tissue-associated interstitial lung disease
(ILD), fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis for which new antifibrotics are required.
 IPF is characterized by excessive collagen deposition by activated myofibroblasts in the lung. NovoMedix
has developed a novel series of small molecules that inhibit myofibroblast activation and differentiation and can
also convert activated fibroblasts back to their quiescent state, potentially reversing fibrotic damage. NM novel
compounds inhibit IL-11 secretion by activated fibroblasts and epithelial cells and act as allosteric AMP Kinase
(AMPK) agonists. NovoMedix drug candidates decrease fibrosis and inflammation in two different bleomycin
models of pulmonary fibrosis. They also decrease fibrosis and inflammation in a liver fibrosis model; prevent
heart failure in mouse transverse aortic constriction (TAC) models; and prevent doxorubicin-induced
cardiomyopathy in mouse cancer models. IL-11 and AMPK play key roles in fibrosis and inflammation, and
activation of AMPK has been shown to be cardioprotective. However, the role of inflammation in IPF is unclear,
and there is widespread agreement that the bleomycin mode of lung fibrosis in mice has limitations as a
translational model.
 We have also identified new NM compounds that lower IC50s and better oral availability, which we believe
will be superior drug development candidates. Our hypothesis is that one or more of these compounds will
reduce lung fibrosis and block pro-fibrotic feedforward loops, reducing disease progression and improving
outcomes. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Confirm efficacy in novel cell assays including
physiologically relevant stretch and 3D models, and select lead candidates, 2) Scale-up production of lead
candidates for animal studies, and 3) Demonstrate efficacy in the TGF- model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis,
which has some key advantages over the bleomycin model. These studies will pave the way for trials in lung
fibrosis patients."

We have entered an exciting era for PrEP with two additional non-oral products, a monthly dapivirine vaginal
ring and a bi-monthly injectable cabotegravir, with several more options in various stages of clinical development.
While the effectiveness of these interventions is now well established, uptake and persistence on PrEP depend
not only on client-level factors but also on how well opportunity costs and health system barriers can be navigated
by potential PrEP clients. Thus, taking these novel PrEP interventions to full scale will require simplifying and
diversifying models for delivery, to achieve options that are accessible, scalable, and meet the needs of clients
and health systems. Since 2020, in collaboration with the Kenyan Ministry of Health we have demonstrated PrEP
can be delivered in African family planning clinics (FP) using existing staff and infrastructure in a programmatic
stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (FP-Plus project), significantly increasing the proportion of general
population women screened for PrEP from 3% to 93% and PrEP initiations among eligible women from <3% to
46%. We have also learned that there are several key health system barriers, such as heavy workload and
lengthy clinic visits that burden the health system and limit expanded delivery at scale up. Within the FP-Plus
project, we piloted model that allows HIV testing (HTS) counselors to screen and determine PrEP eligibility and
that it both reduced clinic time by 60% and resulted in higher PrEP initiations and early PrEP continuation versus
comparable control clinics maintaining usual care. We hypothesize that PrEP care can be done by HTS
providers, in a single HIV testing encounter with clinician oversight as needed, in a way that will be more time-
efficient and client-centered and will be acceptable, scalable, and readily transferable to other African settings.
With an interdisciplinary team and our deep knowledge of the Kenya health system, we will use a participatory
research approach with key stakeholders to co-develop and refine the core components of a ‘scalable unit’
composed of a simplified HTS counselor-led PrEP care intervention and an MOH feasible technical advisory and
provider training support delivery at scale (Aim 1). We will then road test the effectiveness and impact of HTS
counselor-led PrEP care to catalyze expansion of PrEP delivery at scale in 20 Kenyan health facilities
representing a spectrum of clinical contexts likely to occur at full scale implementation (Aim 2). Lastly, we will
use mixed methods to triangulate multilevel determinants of delivery at scale, including behavior science studies
to understand and incorporate women perspectives, explore partner and community influence, and barriers to
PrEP access and use; clinic and provider capacity to deliver multiple PrEP products; and key stakeholders’
power, interests, and perspectives (Aim 3). We have already demonstrated that PrEP can be delivered in African
health facilities; this work will boldly extend that further, aiming for simplified facility-based PrEP delivery with
greater clinic efficiency, diminished client burden, and greater public health impact of PrEP at population level."

Functionalized diaziridines are privileged scaffolds due to the multitude of reactivity profiles that can lead to the
production of complex N,N-containing heterocyclic pharmacophores. Among these, diazepines and benzodiazepines stand
out as one of the most pharmacologically relevant drug families. Thus, the chemical synthesis field has focused its
attention on the development of novel methods for the synthesis of such highly complex heterocycles. This proposal aims
to study the enantioselective rearrangement reactions of divinyldiaziridines under a series of reaction conditions for the
systematic synthesis of optically pure diazepines and benzodiazepines. This proposal consists of 3 Aims. Aim 1:
Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-Diazepines via the Stereoselective Rearrangement Reactions of
Substituted Diaziridines. Aim 2: Enantioselective Rearrangement Reactions of Substituted Diaziridines for the
Synthesis of Benzodiazepines. Aim 3: Diaza-Claisen Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Relevant Drug Scaffolds and
Complex Heterocycles.
 The Moura-Letts laboratory has developed a strong research platform for the development of methods for the synthesis of
heterocyclic scaffolds. This combination of skills and trained students would facilitate the successful implementation of
the aims described in this proposal.
The Claisen rearrangement reactions of divinyldiaziridines have never been reported. However, the knowledge acquired
from diaziridine synthesis and their cycloadditions has served as a cornerstone for the design and rationalization of the
proposed reactions. This work will allow efficient and systematic access to a large variety of unprecedented complex
diazepines and benzodiazepines and thus help further elucidate their pharmacological profiles. The GML group is highly
interested in developing organic methodologies for the synthesis and transformation of small heterocycles into more
complex pharmacologically-relevant scaffolds. The success of this project would allow for the potential discovery of an
unprecedented diaza-[3,3]-Claisen rearrangement and ring expansion pathways through the reaction of easily accessible
vinyl and divinyldiaziridines. The impact of this project is also expanded by its ability to develop state-of-the-art organic
chemistry skills in undergraduate students, high school students and returning veterans. These students have the potential
to acquire a level of organic expertise that will qualify them to compete at the highest academic and industrial levels.

11005106,"Emerging adulthood represents a uniquely sensitive period for studying social determinants of health in the
United States (US), as young people begin to establish their own paths towards higher education, careers, and
financial independence. College, specifically, is a time of changing socioeconomic position (SEP) that is not
often clearly captured in health research, despite strong ties between SEP and health. Over 40% of all young
adults aged 18-24 are enrolled as full-time college students in the US, and they increasingly represent the
diversity of the country in terms of SEP, race, and ethnicity, particularly colleges classified as Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs). (The 539 HSIs in the US serve over two-thirds of all Latinx, 40% of all Asian, and 22% of all
Black college students in the US.) Despite perceptions that emerging adult college students are at the peak of
health, over one-third of college students report being overweight or obese, and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease outcomes among young adults has been an increasing cause of concern. This risk is
exacerbated for low-SEP students, and students of color, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Therefore, emerging adult college students are a priority population to promote cardiovascular health, and
reduce health disparities, before the onset of chronic disease. The proposed longitudinal research addresses
these important scientific gaps by creating and studying a de novo, longitudinal cohort of 4,000 racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adult college students recruited as first-year students from two
HSIs in California and followed over three years, including if they leave college. The study will incorporate
anthropometric, institutional administrative, smartphone, behavioral, and self-reported data. The specific aims
are: (1) To determine the contribution of emerging adults’ economic stressors (e.g.,income, wealth, financial
stress, basic needs, residential environment, subjective social status) to cardiometabolic health outcomes
(e.g., weight-related measures, blood pressure) over time; (2) To determine the contribution of educational
protective factors (e.g., use of social supports, academic supports, basic needs supports) to cardiometabolic
health outcomes over time; (3) examine weight-related behaviors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, diet, disordered
eating, smoking) as mechanisms of associations between economic stress, educational protective factors, and
cardiometabolic health. This large, diverse sample will have sufficient statistical power to examine how
racialized and gendered identities may modify associations between economic and educational exposures and
cardiometabolic outcomes, which will help increase understanding of the complex interplay between different
social determinants of health and help inform potential interventions to reduce health disparities. Identifying risk
and protective factors that could affect weight and blood pressure among diverse emerging adult college
students can help inform novel interventions and support services to promote cardiometabolic health in a
significant portion of the young adult population."

The temperature of the ambient housing environment represents a major modifier of outcomes in many
studies. Maintenance of precise temperature and humidity control minimizes contributions to variation in both
behavioral and physiological outcome measures from differential recruitment of thermogenesis. Furthermore,
the ability to house animals at precise temperatures outside of standard housing ranges (65-75°F) permits
specific studies that rely on cold activation of adipose tissue, analyze metabolic demand without
thermogenesis for body temperature maintenance, or create perturbations that may drive, protect, or modify
pathology when modeling diseases such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Malignant Hyperthermia or other
disorders. Access to housing space that provides precise adjustable control of housing temperature is needed
to facilitate these studies. The TSE-Systems Climatic Control Chambers would provide this missing component
for extended duration animal housing at precise temperatures that is critical for the success of several

10986723,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of upper
and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. Many altered molecular and
cellular pathways have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, determining which are causative
remains challenging, and many clinical trials have failed in the last few decades. One explanation for the
unsuccessful clinical interventions is the difficulty of rescuing dying motor neurons once death has been
triggered, meaning that therapeutic interventions must be implemented early in the disease. Months before
clinical onset, ALS patients often experience fasciculations and cramps (i.e., spontaneous and persistent
muscle twitching), suggesting increased neural activity and excitability. Indeed, neurophysiological studies in
patients and rodent models with ALS-associated genetic mutations have identified that circuit dysfunction,
specifically motor cortex hyperexcitability, are among the earliest pathologies. Recently, two studies suggested
that upper corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) in the motor cortex play an essential role in the low motor
neuron death of transgenic mice expressing human SOD1 mutations. We thus hypothesize that CSMN
hyperexcitability might drive ALS pathogenesis. We propose to utilize recently developed enhancer-driven viral
tools that allow cell-specific targeting to 1) perform cutting-edge chemogenetics to modulate neuronal activity
to determine whether dampening CSMN hyperexcitability in the late pre-symptomatic stage can mitigate ALS-
related behavioral and pathological deficits in SOD1G93A mice, and 2) identify cell-specific altered molecular
pathways leading to motor cortex hyperexcitability. This study has significant implications in developing

 The overarching goal of this proposal is to facilitate mentored training of junior investigators in the conduct
of high-quality translational research into prevention of cardiometabolic disease. The PI is now Professor of
Medicine at the University of Washington and guides a research program that is focused on the neurobiological
basis of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risk. The current proposal broadens the impact of this
work by extending the existing program toward research focusing on understanding neurobiological factors that
promote health, particularly in young children. It investigates the mechanistic basis of preventive dietary
strategies that could alter trajectories of adiposity gain and ultimately reduce risk of cardiometabolic disease over
the lifespan. The candidate’s background includes productive research mentorship of Fellows and junior faculty
clinician-investigators, including K awardees. During this award, the PI will mentor a spectrum of trainees from
fields including endocrinology and metabolism, pediatrics, and nutrition. The PI will take didactic mentoring
courses and engage with experienced senior investigators to build skills necessary for the conduct of the
research. The PI’s research program is currently focused on translational studies of cellular processes consistent
with possible damage to the primary body-weight and glucose-regulating region of the hypothalamus—the
arcuate nucleus. Studies in rodent models show that diet-induced weight gain is dependent on an inflammatory
cellular response, known as gliosis, within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Importantly, the PI has
shown that gliosis is detectable in mice and humans by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using MRI, the PI
discovered the first evidence of hypothalamic gliosis in humans with obesity. The PI and trainees have shown
that hypothalamic gliosis 1) is independently related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in humans, 2)
correlates with increased levels of visceral fat, 3) is present in children with obesity, and 4) predicts adiposity
gain in children as well as worsening insulin sensitivity in adults. Funded projects investigate dietary antecedents
of hypothalamic gliosis and its reversal by obesity treatment. The proposed research pivots toward an emphasis
on prevention and intervention strategies that have the potential to modify the underlying neurobiological
processes that drive cardiometabolic risk in obesity. Aim 1 tests the effect of high diet quality feeding on a
radiologic marker of hypothalamic gliosis in children. Aim 2 evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of feeding
intervention strategies that improve diet quality for low-income families with children with overweight or obesity.
Completion of the Aims could provide fundamental insights into the central nervous system’s role in preserving
cardiometabolic health and lay the groundwork for future intervention studies in pediatric populations. Moreover,
the projects provide a breadth and depth of opportunities for promising trainees to gain the experience necessary
to perform high-quality, patient-oriented research on cardiometabolic disease prevention."

Racial, ethnic, and sexual and gender minority populations are disproportionately impacted by HIV and
substance use, with Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and Black transgender women (TW) bearing a
disproportionate burden. However, researchers have yet to synthesize a rigorous and holistic view of how
individual and complex factors interact to produce health disparities among minority populations. Therefore,
understanding the drivers of health disparities requires a novel approach – one which seeks to understand the
social and contextual systems around the most marginalized populations – as it is only through an individual's
interactions with their social context that any advantage or disadvantage is conferred. In line with RFA-DA-23-
061, this project proposes innovative observational research across five US cities in order to better understand
the social contexts of racial, ethnic, and sexual and gender minority populations, as well as how inequities in
those social contexts drive HIV and substance use. Specifically, through in-depth remote network surveys of
2700 racially diverse young men who have sex with men and transgender women (YMSM-TW), we will
examine how an individual's social position determines the people and the places they have access to, as well
as how supportive or risky these social and contextual environments are and how these connections might
pool risk and provide fewer resources to those with marginalized and multiple marginalized identities. In this
work we are guided by our systems framework which has been integrated with a literature on how stigma
maintains dominance by keeping marginalized populations in, out, and away. We also have a robust plan for
community engagement – which includes a Community Engagement Core, the building of Community Advisory
Boards across each of our five cities, and the utilization of our models to produce tangible targets for public
health intervention. Our approach is well-informed by our prior work. In particular, we hold ample expertise in
the modeling of the sexual networks of young racially diverse MSM and TW. Furthermore, this study builds off
our prior project chiSTIG where our team is using existing empirical data and community input to create
Chicago-specific simulations of how racial differences in how YMSM and transgender women co-locate shapes
sexual partnership in ways that pool risk for the most marginalized individuals. Furthermore, our approach is
enabled by our expertise in network data capture, specifically our leadership of Network Canvas, an NIH-
funded free and open-source network data capture tool. These experiences, as well as our skill in building and
leading strong transdisciplinary teams, make this work feasible. Taken together, this project is well-suited to
transform the scientific understanding of structural drivers of disparities in HIV and substance use."

 Cognitive impairment is a significant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). At least 75% of
PD patients surviving for more than 10 years will develop Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and the
incidence rate of dementia in PD is 4-6 times of the general population. PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), jointly known as Lewy body dementia (LBD), are both caused by abnormal deposits of proteins in the
brain called Lewy bodies, and account for 4-10% of all dementia patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is
considered an important biomarker for neurodegeneration. There remains an urgent unmet need to establish
reliable and practical neuroimaging biomarkers related to cognitive functions to describe both the spatial and
temporal progression of LBD. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a completely noninvasive method for measuring
CBF and is ideal for frequent non-invasive longitudinal monitoring. ASL methods typically apply spatially
selective inversion modules to supply arteries distant from imaging volumes, which is known to render
underestimation of CBF due to transit time delay, especially among elderly subjects. Velocity-selective
arterial spin labeling (VSASL) was proposed to remove the time-delay artifact. Our group has implemented the
first velocity-selective inversion (VSI) based VSASL with 3D segmented GRASE acquisition and
demonstrated its higher sensitivity to perfusion signal over conventional ASL methods. Furthermore, our
preliminary data showed that VSASL with 3D single-shot stack-of-spiral-based turbo FLASH acquisition
delivered better perfusion image quality with fewer artifacts than using segmented GRASE, and high temporal
resolution potentially allowing adequate retrospective motion correction. The overarching goal is to test the
hypothesis that the VSASL-based CBF pattern is a reliable biomarker for LBD that predicts long-term cognitive
impairment and dementia outcomes: Aim 1, we will conduct further technical developments for 3D VSASL with
accelerated acquisitions and improved immunity to head motion; Aim 2, we will assess VSASL’s between-
session reproducibility and its reliability to detect regional changes in CBF related to movement tasks and the
dopaminergic medication; Aim 3, we will investigate VSASL’s sensitivity to early cognitive impairment in patients
leading to LBD through both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. These studies are to ensure the
optimized VSASL MRI technique with high reproducibility, reliability, and sensitivity to detect early changes in
brain perfusion that are correlated with cognitive impairment and dementia in patients leading to LBD."

The older incarcerated population in the United States (US) has increased by more than 4,000% since 1981.
By 2030, there will be more than 400,000 adults ≥50 years in US prisons. These individuals experience
frequent hospitalizations, putting them at risk for delirium, a condition frequently seen in older adults and
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Incarcerated individuals face higher rates of both known delirium
risk factors and incarceration-specific risk factors. Similarly, incarcerated patients may not receive standard
evidence-based delirium prevention measures during hospitalizations due to incarceration-specific barriers
(e.g. routine shackling). Despite the increased risk of delirium in hospitalized older incarcerated adults, there
are virtually no data on delirium prevalence or incidence in this population or on the frequency with which they
receive evidence-based delirium screening and prevention. The goal of the proposed research is to establish
foundational data on delirium epidemiology (including prevalence, incidence, and risk factors), on the
frequency of delivery of evidence-based delirium prevention measures (e.g. cognitive stimulation, ambulation),
and on potential barriers and facilitators to delivery of those measures in this high-risk population. These goals
will be achieved through qualitative interviews with all relevant stakeholders, including correctional officers, a
group that has not previously been included in discussions around this issue, through a prospective
observational trial, and through a pilot study that establishes a novel multidisciplinary team to address delirium
prevention among older incarcerated patients. My long-term career goal is to improve the hospital care of the
rapidly aging population of older incarcerated adults, with a specific focus on delirium screening and
prevention. Through this award, I aim to strengthen my geriatric and delirium-specific knowledge, solidify my
research design skills, particularly in acute care environments and with marginalized populations, and begin
training in behavioral intervention science. I will access a wealth of resources through the University of
Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, including the opportunity to receive mentorship from world
leaders in geriatrics and health disparities and from researchers with established track records working with
incarcerated populations and correctional systems. Building on the training, mentorship, and data that I will
obtain through this career development award, I will submit an R01 to undertake a multi-site study that will
further increase knowledge surrounding delirium, delirium screening, and delirium prevention in older
incarcerated patients. My definitive goal is to design, test, and implement an incarceration-specific approach to
evidence-based delirium measures that will reduce the risk of delirium in the marginalized and high-risk
population of older incarcerated adults."

I am a dual-trained adult and pediatric nephrologist and I have been conducting patient-oriented research
(POR) in cardiovascular disease (CVD) for the last decade. My POR program is focused on hypertension,
cardiovascular outcomes, and health disparities in patients with kidney disease. I am currently Director of the
Master’s in Clinical and Epidemiologic Research Program at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in
the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and I am also co-PI of a joint multi-institutional nephrology,
urology, and hematology research training program which spans UCSF, Stanford, UC Davis, and UC Berkeley.
Thus, I have access to a large number of trainees who are interested in POR and who would benefit from
dedicated mentorship to ensure their success in cardiovascular-focused clinical research. My research
program provides unique opportunities for the training of early-stage investigators who are interested in
pursuing POR in CV topics given its depth and multi-disciplinary nature. Our infrastructure includes >30
datasets and access to national data registries and electronic health record data that can facilitate the design
of mentee projects and research training within NHLBI mission areas. The training environment at UCSF is
stellar and bolsters a variety of resources that are available to mentees through our Clinical and Translational
Science Award, K Scholars Program, as well as state-of-the-art electronic health record (EHR) databases and
tools that have been developed to allow researchers to leverage natural language processing when working
with EHR data. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults
with a history of kidney disease, but cardiovascular risk factor control remains suboptimal in these populations.
The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate patterns of cardiovascular disease risk in adolescent and young
patients with kidney disease, understand barriers to the implementation of guideline-recommended therapies
and the achievement of ideal CV health in young adult populations, and test the acceptability and clinical yield
of novel digital blood pressure monitoring tools using remote study designs in the young adult population. The
proposed work will provide a platform to support opportunities for mentees interested in POR in CVD and
facilitate learning experiences in the use of electronic health record data for research, natural language
processing, machine learning, mixed methods, and digital health/remote study designs. My mentoring aims
are to 1) hone my mentorship and leadership skills; 2) gain formal training in the mentorship of mentees who
are underrepresented in medicine and research; 3) expand my capacity to mentor trainees in topics such as
big data, natural language processing, and digital health; 4) receive guidance and feedback from a group of
experienced mentors on my K24 advisory committee. Given my numerous responsibilities, this award will
support the time needed for me to focus on mentoring advanced trainees in POR in CVD and refine my skills in
mentorship, which would otherwise not be possible given my current clinical and administrative obligations."

This renewal application of the K24 award (AT009198; 2016-2022) to Helen Lavretsky, MD,MS from the NCCIH focused on “Mentoring and Research in Translational Science of Complementary Integrative Health (CIH),” that was marked by the creation of Integrative Psychiatry and her appointment as the Director of Research for the UCLA Integrative Medicine Collaborative with over 100 faculty members and staff and a T32 training program in Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH). Over the past 15 years, Dr. Lavretsky has established herself as a thought leader in Patient-Oriented Complementary and Integrative Health research, both nationally and internationally, with continuous federal and foundation funding (NCCIH, NIMH, DOD, NIA, PCORI, ARPF), with high research productivity and 56 trainees mentored in the CIH POR research during the initial NCCIH K24 award (2016-2022), of whom 25 (45%) now have their own federal or other funding sources with 85% of her mentees being women or underrepresented minorities.
The proposed renewal of the K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research will continue to support Dr Lavretsky by providing protected time to help expand her mentoring and research program to the all-encompassing translational CIH science that includes the NIH defined phases of translation from bench-to bed-side-to community: T1 (developing novel interventions based on neural mechanisms)- T2 (testing the efficacy/effectiveness) and T3 (implementation research for healthcare system wide change in encompassing whole person health) that is closely aligned with the CTSA and NCCIH philosophy. The research opportunities for training purposes will include three trials with virtual Tai Chi: 1) the recently NCCIH funded (UG3/UH3 grant that supports the multi-site comparative embedded implementation trial of remote Tai Chi for knee arthritis across four large healthcare systems; 2) the DOD-funded trial of virtual Tai Chi vs PLIE vs Health Education in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and 3) the proposed pilot feasibility study of the rTMS neuromodulation added to Tai Chi in adults (50+) with knee arthritis and depression, in addition to others.
The main goals of this program will be to: Goal 1: Conduct rigorous research into developing new interventions (proposed pilot project) and testing the efficacy and effectiveness and implementation of Tai Chi in adults with chronic pain, mood and cognitive disorders; Goal 2: Advance expertise in implementation science via participation in the NIH Pragmatic Trial Collaboratory, academic courses, and consultations with the experts; Goal 3: Develop expertise in rTMS neuromodulation added to mind-body interventions via clinical training, research, and consultations with the experts; and Goal 4: Mentor future CIH researchers via research and academic mentorship provided at multiple levels of training, including developing medical student curriculum for the 3rd “Discovery” year of in-depth training in the CIH research. With the renewal of this K24, Dr Lavretsky will be able to advance the CIH mentoring and research priorities, both locally and nationally."
10984344,"Lifestyle health behaviors, such as physical activity, cognitive activity, healthy diet, and social activity, are low-
risk, non-pharmaceutical strategies that may help protect against cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). However, causal evidence across observational and trial research
is inconsistent. There remains a need to further understand the impact of lifestyle health behaviors on cognitive
outcomes, including what type(s) of behavior and magnitude of behavior change have greatest impact, and if
impact differs across diverse at-risk subgroups. The purpose of our proposed study, InLife (Individualized
Lifestyle Change For Every Aging Brain), is to harmonize existing participant-level data from randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) to examine how changes in lifestyle health behavior impact cognitive outcomes across
diverse adults. We will leverage previously collected de-identified data from 12 U.S. trials representing 9,570
older adults for de novo analyses. In trials that agreed to contribute data, one or more lifestyle health behaviors
(physical activity, cognitive activity, healthy diet, and/or social activity) were targeted and cognitive outcomes
were assessed, including change in cognitive function (primary outcome: episodic memory and executive
function, secondary outcome: perceptual speed and global cognition) and (in some) incidence of mild cognitive
impairment or dementia (exploratory outcome). Aim 1: Quantify impact of changes in lifestyle health behaviors
on cognitive outcomes. Following our innovative harmonization methods based on an item response theory
framework, we will harmonize data across trials to test hypotheses that (a) the association between amount of
change in behaviors and cognitive outcomes will be strongest for those with lower initial levels of the targeted
behavior and (b) there will be nonlinear effects of increases in behaviors on cognitive outcomes such that
benefits will diminish as behavior change increases (i.e., diminishing returns). Aim 2: Examine determinants of
health that moderate (enhance or inhibit) impact of lifestyle health behavior change on cognitive outcomes. We
will evaluate whether associations between lifestyle health behavior and cognitive outcomes in Aim 1 differ
between subgroups. Informed by National Institute on Aging and World Health Organization frameworks, we
focus on subgroups based on determinants of health that are structural/social (age, sex, education, racial
background, ethnic background), biological (e.g., cardiometabolic disease), and environmental (e.g., rural vs.
urban, U.S. region, area deprivation index [API]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Determine the impact of lifestyle health
behavior combinations on cognitive outcomes. We will evaluate whether two or more behaviors together have
more impact than one alone and quantify which combinations of behaviors are most impactful. The proposed
InLife study will result in the first harmonized dataset of U.S. trials testing lifestyle interventions for cognitive
outcomes. This research will be influential in shaping clinical guidelines focused on realistic lifestyle health
behaviors for cognitive outcomes across diverse aging populations."
10984349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infections with the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides affect up to an estimated 1.2 billion people
worldwide, causing significant disease and accounting for the loss of 749,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years
(DALYs) annually. Treatment of these infections in most endemic regions depends on mass drug administration
(MDA) programs primarily comprising benzimidazoles (BZ), such as albendazole and mebendazole.
Large-scale and prolonged usage of BZs selects for resistance in parasitic nematodes, as observed in
veterinary parasites (e.g., Haemonchus contortus, a parasite of small ruminants). Although no confirmed cases
of BZ resistance in human ascariasis have been described, BZ resistance has been confirmed in ascarids of
veterinary importance. Importantly, these veterinary parasites also appear to lack canonical alleles associated
with BZ resistance in other parasite species, suggesting that resistance mechanisms in ascarids likely differ.
Everything currently known about BZ resistance comes from studies of the model nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans and closely related parasites such as H. contortus. However, 350 million years of evolution separate
C. elegans and ascarids, limiting its use as a model for ascarid research. Therefore, it is necessary to establish
a new, more closely related, model to study BZ resistance in ascarids. Ascaridia dissimilis offers a powerful
model system to study BZ resistance in human ascarids because established resistant and susceptible isolates
exist, labor costs are lower than other veterinary parasites, and importantly no human infections are required.
Human parasites cannot be readily studied because of the ethical issues associated with controlled infections,
as well as difficulties in manipulating such a model. This project will identify genetic variants associated with BZ
resistance in ascarids, using poultry ascarids as a new model system, allowing for diagnostics to be developed
and improving treatment programs to control human infections. Aim 1 will create high-quality reference
genomes for sensitive and resistant A. dissimilis isolates. Reference genomes will allow known resistance
associated genes to be analyzed for high-impact variants, and enable future studies, including genome-wide
mapping. Aim 2 will use genetic crosses and BZ selection to create recombinant isolates with BZ resistance
associated loci in an otherwise susceptible background. After initial crossing of the resistant and susceptible
isolates, progeny will be backcrossed with the susceptible parental line and selected for BZ resistance and
used in a bulk-segregant analysis approach to identify BZ resistance loci. This innovative poultry ascarid
system enables discoveries of conserved BZ resistance loci in a tractable model. Results can then be
translated to human ascarids to improve the quality of care and quality of life for infected individuals across the
developing world."
10984648,"Project Summary Clostridioides difficile (CD) is a ubiquitous, spore-former and the most prevalent healthcare-
associated infection. While infections are often triggered by antibiotics, particularly in immunocompromised
individuals, we know little about the factors and risks for triggering symptomatic CD infection (CDI).
 The overarching objective of Dr. Cersosimo’s research is to understand the dynamics of CDI in at-risk
patient populations and optimize testing strategies for toxin C. difficile carriage to enable surveillance in broad
clinical settings. The proposed research uses advanced genomic-epidemiologic analyses to enhance our
understanding of CDI epidemiology in at-risk inpatients, identifies associations among C. difficile genomic and
antibiotic resistance profiles, and optimizes current hospital CD surveillance programs for deployment to a
diverse range of healthcare institutions. Aim 1 applies molecular epidemiologic strategies to identify patient and
strain-specific risks for the development of CDI. Subaim 1a defines the dynamics of infection risk in oncology
and ICU wards with genomic-epidemiologic analyses of CD in patients and using patient co-variate data obtained
from the electronic health record. Subaim 1b defines genomic and phenotypic drivers of strain antibiotic
resistance and their contribution to asymptomatic carriage and progression to CDI in inpatient oncology wards
versus other ICU settings. Aim 2 optimizes tools for CD surveillance through the a) development of a more rapid
and accessible clinical diagnostics assay for the identification of toxin positive CD and b) generation of
informative data that demonstrates antibiotic triggers of CD carriage to inform population-based CDI preventative
strategies in collaborations with clinical infection control and infectious disease pharmacy teams.
 Dr. Cersosimo brings a One Health background per her previous training in animal gut health, clinical
diagnostics, and food science. Her prior experiences and training goals will: 1) optimize bioinformatic and
statistical approaches in the analysis of C. difficile genomic data, 2) advance her understanding of microbiology,
infectious diseases, epidemiology through hands-on learning in the healthcare setting, 3) develop strategies to
generate, analyze, and interpret high-dimensional genomic and phenotypic antibiotic resistance data to inform
strain genomic landscapes and associated hospital-focused antibiograms for C. difficile, and 4) improve her
professional and leadership skills to progress as an independent investigator studying questions in infectious
disease genomics and epidemiology from a One Health perspective. Her appointments at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and Harvard Medical School provide access to state-of-the-art clinical, laboratory, and computational
resources and an internationally renowned mentoring committee with expertise in C. difficile epidemiology,
antibiotic stewardship, genomics, and hospital infection surveillance. Educational resources in infectious disease
epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, and clinical microbiology will further enable her training goals and career
progression to independence."

Funded parent grant CA260126-01: Identifying a proteomic signature for breast cancer detection in breast
milk and serum.
Project summary
 Breast Cancer (BC) in young women (reproductive age, pre-menopausal) is associated with increased
mortality, and current methods of detecting BC in this group of women have known limitations. Tools for
accurately assessing personal BC risk in young women are needed to identify the women who will benefit the
most from earlier intervention. Breast milk provides a noninvasive way to examine the health of the breast. We
will apply quantitative proteomics to a unique collection of breast milk samples to determine if there is a group
of proteins (proteomic signature) that can be used to detect early breast cancer and predict which women are
at increased risk of developing BC. We hypothesize that a set of proteins exist in breast milk that can be used
to identify women with BC and women at increased risk of developing BC at a young age. We also hypothesize
that the set of proteins, detected in the breast milk, can also be detected in the blood and be used to detect BC
in non-lactating women. We will identify and quantify proteomics BC signatures in breastmilk and serum
that are both potential diagnostics and also inform on pathways and processes that are dysregulated
in BC. In Aim 1, we will employ a Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) approach to develop a quantitation
method and then use it to quantify the proteins in the milk (20 vs 20) and serum (50 vs 50) samples of donors
with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) and matched controls, which were already identified as dysregulated by
our lab or in other studies. In Aim 2, we will perform peptidomics analysis of the same milk and serum samples.
We will analyze them by 1) nanoliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) and 2) by
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). These two methods complement
each other. In Aim 3, we will use bioinformatics approaches to investigate both the function of the dysregulated
milk & serum proteins and their role in onset and progression of BC. The unique aspects of our study
include proteomics analysis of breast milk for assessing BC risk. Translation of the proteomic
signature from a local microenvironment (breasts) to a systemic environment (blood) will then allow its
use in the detection of BC in non-lactating women. Our proposal can impact several medical and research
areas: 1) to prevent BC (primary prevention), 2) to identify what makes the breast susceptible to cancer
development, and 3) to identify the biochemical pathways that facilitate BC growth, leading to preventive
treatments. This AREA grant will also train an extensive number of undergraduate students and direct them
towards careers in biomedical fields.

10992316,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are dominantly inherited muscular dystrophies caused by
short tandem repeat, or microsatellite, expansions in the noncoding regions of two different genes. While DM1
results from CTG trinucleotide expansions in the DMPK 3' untranslated region, DM2 is caused by structurally
similar CCTG tetranucleotide expansions in intron 1 of the CNBP gene. DM1 and DM2 share underlying
pathomechanisms since transcription of mutant DMPK and CNBP genes produces expanded CUG and CCUG
RNAs, respectively, that are pathogenic because they alter the activities of developmentally regulated RNA
processing factors while also serving as templates for repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation.
Importantly, DM2 represents an emerging and prevalent class of STR expansion diseases caused by intronic
mutations. Therapeutic development for DM1 has been prioritized since it is the most common form of adult-
onset muscular dystrophy, and several mouse models such as HSALR have been used extensively to evaluate
potential therapies in vivo. In contrast, DM2 mouse models that replicate the DM2 clinical presentation have
not been reported. To address this deficiency, we have recently generated both an authentic DM2 mouse model,
or human CNBP-DM2 BAC transgenic mice, and an intensive DM2 model, HSA-DM2 mice which express 1,100
CTG repeats inserted into the highly expressed HSA gene. Preliminary studies show that CNBP-DM2 mice
reproduce DM2 clinical manifestations, such as repeat instability, nuclear RNA foci, centralized myonuclei,
muscle weakness, RAN proteins, while HSA-DM2 mice reproduce DM2 mis-splicing, myotonia and myopathy.
This project will use these new transgenic models to improve our understanding of DM2 pathomechanisms and
as a tool to accelerate therapeutic testing in vivo. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that CNBP-DM2 transgenic lines
varying in CCTG repeat expansion length and insertion sites provide an authentic DM2 mouse model. CNBP-
DM2 mice with >4,200 repeats will be tested to determine if they reproduce key pathophysiological hallmarks
of DM2 disease and if RAN translation occurs in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Aim 2 will focus on HSA-DM2
transgenic mice to define DM2 biochemical and pathophysiological mechanisms and compare these outcomes
to the HSALR model for DM1. A key question is to understand why an apparently larger burden of CCUG RNA
repeats causes a milder phenotype than in HSALR mice. Aim 3 will use CNBP-DM2 and HSA-DM2 mice to test
two potential therapies for DM2, including cell penetrating phosphorodiamidate morpholinos (cpPMOs) and
MyoAAV-dCas9, that selectively target mutant CNBP RNAs and CNBP transcription, respectively."
10997256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is growing evidence that some diseases can be influenced by biological sex, where male or female patients
have worsened outcomes or faster disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
interaction of systemic sex hormones and disease are largely unknown. There is a critical need to understand
the molecular basis of how circulating sex hormones can impact disease progression. I have shown that a mouse
model of rhodopsin P23H Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) presents as sexually dimorphic, where disease progression
is increased in females compared to males. RP is a group of devastating visual disorders that cause the death
of the photoreceptor neurons, leading to blindness. In addition to my findings of sexual dimorphism in retinal
disease progression in RP, I have discovered that this sex difference can be ameliorated by depletion of estrogen
and progesterone. Re-introduction of either of these sex hormones can worsen visual decline. The overall goal
of my work is to understand the mechanisms that influence photoreceptor cell death in RP. Specifically, this
proposal aims to determine how systemic sex hormones impact cell death and stress responses in the
rhodopsin (Rho) P23H form of RP. To do so, I will first employ targeted molecular biology techniques to
analyze the effect of circulating estrogen and progesterone on the unfolded protein response and caspase-
mediated cell death. By investigating these two pathways, I will describe how the hormones that are detrimental
to photoreceptor health in RP are affecting two of the central molecular mechanisms underlying this disease.
Next, I will investigate how these hormones are able to carry out their detrimental functions by defining the
hormone receptors that mediate this response through in vivo antagonist/ agonist studies. Furthermore, I will
determine the genetic control of the hormone signaling in the retina through RNA sequencing. Together, these
aims will inform how and what is being altered in the Rho P23H retina in response to hormone signaling.
Successful completion of this project will be vital for informing the clinical safety of hormonal medications for
patients with this form of RP, as well as discovering new pathways that can affect photoreceptor degeneration.
Furthermore, this work provides me the opportunity to advance my skills in the study of hormone signaling and
cellular stress and promotes my career goals of becoming an independent investigator."

The Montagna Symposium on the Biology of Skin has gathered nearly annually for 70 years with the goal of
bringing together leading scientists and clinical investigators in a uniquely designed conference to drive forward
the field of skin biology. Through cutting edge presentations and lively conversations in a laid back atmosphere
near Portland, Oregon, the conference serves and aims to: 1) Discuss new findings, techniques, and goals in
skin biology and adjacent fields; 2) Foster cross-disciplinary and innovative collaborations among disciplines that
will enrich the scientific and clinical specialty and bring novel solutions to bear on skin diseases; and 3)
Encourage young investigators to dream, imagine, and grow into the next generation of leading scientists and
dermatologists who can drive the field forward. Each year the Symposium addresses a different topic in skin
biology research and unanswered questions about causes and cures for skin diseases. Discoveries made in the
skin have enriched knowledge and treatment options in other organ systems for decades, as skin is the most
visible organ in the human body, presenting ample opportunities for its study. The unique atmosphere and limited
number of participants provides opportunity to debate controversies, propose solutions to puzzles and strategies
to overcome roadblocks, set new research agendas, and grasp opportunities for translation to new treatments.
Interactions are 1) Among participants in basic research, translational, clinical, patient care, disease-focused
foundation-led, and pharmaceutical researchers; 2) Between trainees and established scientists; and 3) Between
dermatology specialists and those from other departments/fields. Participation of young scientists is strongly
encouraged by presentation opportunities and competitive travel awards. The central support of this meeting is
a multi-year conference grant from the NIH that allows advance planning of program themes by leading Program
Chairs and invitation of highly competitive speakers. Annual fundraising from corporate and foundation sources,
together with modest registration fees, offset the balance of meeting production costs. The Symposium
communicates its findings to the broader academic community through annual publication of proffered, peer
reviewed papers in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology with waiver of submission fees under the Montagna
Symposium on the Biology of Skin logo. Topics planned and discussed in this proposal include the 70th
anniversary meeting “Visualizing the Future of Skin Biology and Dermatology”, “Skin of Color Dermatology: The
Interaction of Science and Society”, “Precision Dermatology”, “Resident Memory T Cells in Human Health and
Disease”, and “Innovative Technologies to Visualize and Diagnose the Skin”. We are thrilled to return to in-
person meetings following the disruptive COVID-19 pandemic and have renewed and increased our commitment
to gathering diverse researchers to elevate the meeting's discussions. This meeting uniquely fulfills the NIH goal
to advance scientific progress in understanding of the basic structure and molecular regulation of human biology

Liver disease is the 10th leading cause of mortality annually. Although most of these deaths are related to
cirrhosis from known causes, an estimated 10-30% of individuals have liver disease of unknown etiology.
Whole exome sequencing (WES) can provide an actionable diagnosis in 10-30% of these patients. The
Vilarinho Laboratory recently used WES to diagnose a cohort of patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
with loss of function mutations in the gene GIMAP5. GIMAP5 is a small GTPase that has previously been
implicated in immune cell development but had never been associated with liver disease. Using a mouse
model of Gimap5 loss of function, we determined that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) capillarize and
lose their organotypic features in GIMAP5-mediated disease. In my preliminary work I performed pseudotime
analysis on single cell RNA sequencing data to determine that LSECs dedifferentiate into capillarized
endothelial cells. Endothelial capillarization is a pathogenic process that occurs in numerous liver disorders
and involves loss of fenestrae and development of a basement membrane. Additionally, in order to better
understand the organ wide dysfunction caused by endothelial capillarization, I performed confocal microscopy
to evaluate zonation in hepatocytes. This demonstrated severe disruption of normal metabolic zonation of the
liver. Collectively, these findings suggest that GIMAP5-mediated liver disease is an LSEC-intrinsic disease
process that consequently effects hepatocyte zonation and regulates liver homeostasis. I hypothesize that
Gimap5 is critical to maintaining LSEC identity and subsequently hepatocyte zonation and function. My first
aim is to determine the role of Gimap5 in LSECs. I have created a novel mouse model, that uses a Cre-Lox
system in order to knockout genes within LSECs in an inducible and selective manner. I will use this model to
knockout Gimap5 within LSECs and then evaluate endothelial capillarization as well as organ-wide
dysfunction. I will use a combination of flow cytometry, confocal and electron microscopy to visualize changes
due to this dysfunction. My second aim is to determine the role of endothelial Gimap5 in maintaining
hepatocyte zonation and function. It has been well recognized that endothelial derived Wnt signaling is
necessary for the proper maintenance of hepatocyte metabolic zonation. Preliminary data shows that these
Wnt signals are significantly reduced in Gimap5 loss of function endothelial cells. I will perform single cell RNA
sequencing to investigate transcriptional alterations of hepatocytes in Gimap5 loss of function mice. I will also
isolate mouse hepatocytes from Gimap5 loss of function mice to evaluate alterations in hepatocyte metabolic
activity using functional assays. If successful, this proposal will identify the pathomechanisms behind GIMAP5-
mediated liver disease and potentially elucidate a novel mechanism of endothelial capillarization in other more
common forms of liver disease."
10996247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common human birth defect and occurs in ~0.8% of live
births. CHD has a known genetic etiology in approximately 45% of cases. Whole exome (WES) or genome
(WGS) sequencing of 9072 CHD probands by the Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium (PCGC) has
identified a significant burden of damaging protein-coding variants in 269 genes (denoted CHD genes).
Although WES analyses of the full PCGC cohort (17,000 probands) is ongoing, the predicted functions of these
CHD genes indicate that CHD often arises from dysregulated expression of cardiac developmental genes.
Within the ~55% of CHD cases with unknown etiologies (denoted WES-negative), CHD genes harbor many
rare missense, splice site-associated, and noncoding variants with unknown pathogenicity. Here we test the
hypothesis that de novo and rare variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in non-coding and coding
regions are responsible for a subset of CHD that remains unexplained. Non-coding de novo VUS
(ncDNV) identified in proximity to genes that impact heart development will be studied in massively parallel
reporter assays to determine if they impact cis-regulatory element activity in cardiac lineages differentiated
from iPSCs. Candidates will be further studied by introduction into the endogenous locus and impact on gene
expression and cell transcriptional states will be assessed by single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq).
Concurrently we will study coding region VUS in two ways. Using CLINVAR assignment of pathogenicity and
AlphaMissense, a deep learning model built on protein structure that variant effects, we will prioritize rare
missense VUS for introduction into iPSCs and cardiac lineages. Using snRNAseq we will compare missense
VUS to reference and loss of function variants. Additionally, we will interrogate splice site-associated VUS
using minigene splice assays. To validate cell-based analyses we will introduce and study a selected subset of
non-coding and rare missense variants in mice. With functional data on non-coding and rare missense VUS,
we expect to define and characterize a subset that cause or contribute to CHD and improve predictive models
of pathogenicity in genes that cause CHD and other human disorder. Identifying genetic contributors in a
subset of unexplained CHD cases will improve clinical assessment of outcomes and recurrence risks and
enable genotype-phenotype analyses. These insights will also advance knowledge about the mechanisms for
normal cardiac development and CHD and identify patients that are appropriate for studies of non-genetic
etiologies. We propose to:
Aim 1. Assess the contribution of de novo noncoding VUS (ncDNV) to unexplained CHD.
Aim 2. Define the contribution of rare coding region VUS in CHD genes to unexplained CHD."

The SDSU HealthLINK Center for Transdisciplinary Health Disparities Research (SDSU HealthLINK Center;
Center) was established in 2018 to augment investigator, partner, and institutional capacity for minority health
and health disparities (MHHD) research at SDSU and SDSU Imperial Valley (SDSUIV), a second campus
located in a rural community along the California-Mexico border. SDSU is a Minority-Serving Institution with
health-related doctoral programs in several health-related disciplines. Despite significant strides in improving
individual, partner, and institutional capacity to conduct innovative, transdisciplinary research, our institutions
continue to lack adequate infrastructure and support services to foster research. Thus, the objective of the
SDSU HealthLINK Center is to build capacity within individuals and institutions to allow for new discoveries to
be made and the translation of these discoveries to evidence-based practices and policies to promote health
equity and reduce health disparities. In this revised renewal application, in response to RFA-MD-24-001, we
propose the following five specific aims that align with the goals of the RCMI specialized centers: 1) enhance
institutional research capacity; 2) enhance investigator and partner capacity; 3) foster an institutional
environment conducive to career development; 4) enhance the availability of research tools and resources;
and 5) cultivate sustainable research and research translation efforts with community partner organizations. To
accomplish Aim 1, the Center will support the implementation of three innovative research projects (RPs),
including a basic biomedical RP, a behavioral/population RP, and a clinical/health services RP. In addition,
through the Research Capacity and Community Engagement Cores, the RP teams will receive training and
consultation in innovative and rigorous approaches for engaging in MHHD research. To accomplish Aim 2, the
Center will fund 10 pilot projects and support their completion and transition to extramural funding through
focused grant writing and project management training, gaps identified in our first 5-yr. funding cycle. To
accomplish Aim 3, the Center will broaden the reach of the knowledge and skills transfer process by hosting
career enhancement workshops for a broader audience, and fostering the use of research services through the
RCC and CEC, in part, by promoting the established Cost Recovery Service. To accomplish Aim 4, the Center
will expand the availability of research services to include training in data science and the ethical conduct of
human subjects’ research. Research training and tools will be broadly disseminated through the Center-
developed Health Science Research Portal. To accomplish Aim 5, the Center will maintain a 12-member
Community Coalition to foster the uptake of evidence-based practices and policies. This application to renew
the SDSU HealthLINK Center will simultaneously address critical needs identified by faculty, staff, and
administration at SDSU and SDSUIV, as well as foster innovative transdisciplinary MHHD research that has
the potential to promote health equity and reduce health disparities."

many advances over the first five years of the Center, SDSU, SDSUIV, and community partner organizations
continue to have significant gaps in research administrative support critical for fostering innovative
transdisciplinary MHHD research and dissemination for the uptake of research to practices and policies. The
objective of Administrative Core (AC) is to create a sustainable infrastructure for innovative and impactful
MHHD research at SDSU, SDSUIV, and with community partner organizations by removing barriers, building
capacity, and fostering a transdisciplinary environment. We propose the following three Specific Aims that align
with the goals of the RCMI specialized centers: 1) support the advancement and retention of investigators
involved in MHHD research; 2) facilitate the exchange of ideas, best practices, and research tools and
resources for fostering innovative and rigorous research, and translation of evidence to practices and policies;
and 3) implement a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess investigator, partner, and institutional capacity to
conduct impactful MHHD research. To accomplish Aim 1, AC will implement an organizational and governance
structure that is compliant with SDSU, SDSUIV, SDSURF, and federal guidelines, collaborate with institutional
leaders to implement institutional support, including a faculty hire and faculty course releases; facilitate career
enhancement activities; and support mentor engagement. The AC will support implementation of activities
within the Research Capacity Core (RCC), Investigator Development Core (IDC), Community Engagement
Core (CEC), and Recruitment Core (RC) by providing support for hiring, fiscal management, use of facilities
and equipment, among other Center-wide activities. To accomplish Aim 2, the AC will facilitate the exchange of
ideas, best practices, and research tools and resources by maintaining a National Advisory Committee with
experts in relevant sciences, community-engagement, faculty development, as well as by supporting
communication and dissemination efforts, including with the RCMI Network. To accomplish Aim 3, the AC will
implement a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess seven constructs, including implementation,
engagement, and satisfaction with Center activities, as well as four measures of impact: impact on the
institution to support MHHD research, impact on investigators and partners to conduct and disseminate
findings from MHHD research, impact on the acquisition of extramural funding, and impact on innovations in
MHHD research and practice with implications for policy, system, and environmental change. The ultimate goal
of the Center is to contribute to reductions in health disparities and optimize health outcomes for all. The AC
contributes to this goal by creating an effective and efficient organizational system to support research."

11003457,"SUMMARY
The overall goals of this U01 application are two-fold. First, to investigate two potential KSHV targets, one
structural and one non-structural, to determine if these two targets are capable of protecting vaccinated animals
from infection. And, the second, to compare two vaccine strategies to stimulate immune responses to the KSHV
antigens. The first approach utilizes mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) vaccines, the widely used vaccine
strategy that has proven capable of inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV2. The second approach
employs a novel vaccine strategy that targets CD180, a toll-like receptor (TLR) expressed on antigen presenting
cells (APCs) that can stimulate robust immune responses to conjugated antigens, even in the context of immune
suppression. To accomplish these goals, we will utilize the rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV)/rhesus macaque
(RM) model of KSHV-like infection to evaluate the KSHV targets and compare the immune responses induced
by the mRNA-LNPs and targeted CD180 vaccine platform. The innovation and strengths of this application are
several and include the collaboration formed amongst the principal investigator, and co-investigators from the
biotechnology sector (Abacus Bioscience), whose company's focus is on a novel targeted CD180 vaccine
platform (anti-CD180) capable of inducing robust immune responses to conjugated antigens in rodents and
nonhuman primates (NHPs), and academic co-investigator, whose expertise is on the characterization of primate
antibody-mediated function. Importantly, data presented in the preliminary studies section supports this
application as 1) CD180 is expressed on multiple B cell lineages, dendritic cells and monocytes, similar to that
shown in humans. 2) fusion of an antigen to agonist anti-CD180 antibody (aCD180) provides the simultaneous
antigen delivery and activation of the APC, resulting in a potent antigen-specific IgG production and expansion
of activated antigen-specific T cells in immunocompetent and immune suppressed animals. 3) we have
successfully expressed two recombinant aCD180-KSHV antigen complexes (aCD180-K8.1 ectodomain and
aCD180-KSHV vIL6) to evaluate in vitro and in vivo. 4) we have established an oral challenge model for RRV
infection, that results in virus infection. 5) we have created the necessary chimeric KSHV/RRV recombinants
pseudotyped with KSHV glycoprotein K8.1 or a recombinant RRV encoding KSHV vIL-6 in place of RRV vIL-6.
These chimeric RRV recombinants can infect and establish latent infections in RM, identical to wild-type RRV.
Thus, the overall goals are to compare state-of-the-art mRNA-LNPs to the novel anti-CD180 platform to
stimulate an anti-K8.1 and anti-vIL6 immune responses in immune competent and SIV-infected RM prior to oral
RRV challenge/infection. The overall hypothesis is immunization targeting KSHV proteins will develop cell and
humoral immune responses against viral antigens. This direct head-to-head comparison serves as a necessary
prerequisite to evaluating either vaccine platform in RM prior to clinical evaluation in humans."

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that causes Kaposi sarcoma (KS), one of
the most common malignancies in people living with HIV worldwide. KSHV also causes primary effusion
lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD). Infection is common in sub-Saharan Africa
and often occurs early in childhood, while in the western hemisphere, infection is rare in the general population
but more frequent in men who have sex with men. A vaccine that prevents KSHV infection and/or associated
morbidity and mortality represents a critical unmet need. However, the types of immune responses a vaccine
would need to elicit have not been well defined. Here we will seek to identify the relevant antigenic targets and
specific epitopes targeted by KSHV-neutralizing antibodies and to establish the ability of neutralizing antibodies
to protect against KSHV infection in a small animal model. To do this, we will leverage a large pre-collected
repository of serum and PBMC samples from KSHV+ participants with and without KS disease to characterize
the neutralizing antibody response to KSHV. We will produce recombinant KSHV glycoproteins that will be used
to deplete serum binding antibodies and assess their contribution to the polyclonal serum neutralizing response.
In parallel, we will isolate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from KSHV+ PBMC samples and carry out in-depth
structure-function analyses to identify critical sites of vulnerability on KSHV glycoproteins. Lastly, we will evaluate
the ability of neutralizing KSHV monoclonal antibodies to prevent infection in a humanized mouse model of
KSHV infection. Our studies will define the relevant antigens and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies
that arise from natural KSHV infection and thus inform the design and development of KSHV vaccines. Moreover
in vivo protection from KSHV infection will establish critical proof of concept that a KSHV vaccine should seek to
elicit neutralizing antibodies."

11007881,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Weight bias internalization (WBI), or self-directed weight-based stigma, has been associated with a number of
negative physical and mental health consequences for adolescents with obesity, including negative weight-
related outcomes (e.g., increased calorie consumption, poorer weight loss outcomes). The prevalence and
salience of WBI as a stressor impacting weight-related outcomes in adolescents paired with the heterogeneous
response to interventions for adolescents with obesity highlights the potential utility of combined intervention for
WBI and obesity in youth to promote improved weight management outcomes during this critical developmental
period. This K23 award is designed to fill gaps in my training and support a research study that will provide next
steps in improving the health of adolescents with obesity. The first phase of the research project will employ
focus groups and an open pilot trial to develop and test feasibility of an integrated intervention that combines
treatment for WBI with an evidence-based adolescent behavioral weight control (BWC). I will then conduct a
small RCT to test the effects of the newly designed WBI+BWC intervention on WBI and mechanisms of weight-
stigma stress induced weight gain, specifically physiological markers of stress (diurnal cortisol) and inflammation
(c-reactive protein, interleukin-6), and dysregulated eating behaviors (emotional eating, loss of control, unhealthy
weight control behaviors). I hypothesize that BWC combined with intervention for WBI, will lead to improvements
in mechanisms of weight-stigma stress induced weight gain, in turn promoting improved weight loss outcomes.
This research project has significant clinical implications for the improvement of adolescent BWC and reduction
of the negative effects of weight-based stigma in adolescents. To conduct this research and fill critical gaps in
my training that will facilitate becoming an independent investigator focused on behavioral treatment of obesity
in adolescents, I will complete a rigorous, targeted training program. The proposed training plan includes
developing expertise in 1) conducting RCTs to develop and test BWC interventions for adolescents; 2) theoretical
and conceptual models of weight-based stigma and WBI; 3) integration of mechanisms in clinical trials focused
on biological markers and dysregulated eating behaviors; and 4) professional development. This training will be
conducted under the primary mentorship of Dr. Elissa Jelalian, with co-mentors Drs. Rebecca Puhl, Stephanie
Parade, Andrea Goldschmidt, and contributor Dr. David Barker. The skills I will acquire map directly onto the
proposed research project and provide the knowledge and expertise necessary to prepare a successful R01
application by the end of the award period. The mentorship team, in combination with the rigorous academic and
training environment provided by the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at The Miriam Hospital and
Brown University, represent an ideal environment to accomplish these training and research goals. Through this
Career Development Award, I will establish myself as an independent investigator dedicated to the development
of novel interventions to improve health outcomes for adolescents with obesity."

This Direct to Phase II SBIR initiative aims to comprehensively validate the Pink Cloud digital platform, a
groundbreaking mobile health application linked to the world's largest database of substance and alcohol use
disorder (SUD and AUD) 12-Step program treatment resources. This innovative platform, designed to
significantly reduce accessibility barriers and treatment disparities across diverse economic and demographic
groups, offers a user-friendly interface with a suite of robust features. These include a centralized database with
over 245,000 in-person and virtual meetings, a sobriety counter, customizable daily planners, resentment
diaries, and personal inventory lists, all aimed at promoting comprehensive care in SUD/AUD treatment. The
Pink Cloud app, available for free and with additional premium services at an affordable rate of $1 per month,
emphasizes user privacy and does not require personal information, usernames, or social media connections.
This commitment to confidentiality has contributed to the app's widespread adoption, with over 350,000 users
across 104 countries, including over 6,000 premium service customers. Despite its extensive user base and
anecdotal evidence of its effectiveness in promoting sobriety and aiding in recovery, Pink Cloud has not yet
been subjected to a rigorous, controlled clinical evaluation to ascertain its efficacy in the treatment of
SUD/AUD. The proposed study seeks to address this gap. It is structured in two distinct phases: the first phase
involves the research team enhancing the app with new features to improve user experience and marketability
(AIM 1). This includes the addition of automated meeting attendance tracking, provider search functionality,
and a 12-Step AI chatbot, and the introduction of coupon codes that will broaden the app's appeal to treatment
centers and insurance companies. The second phase constitutes a comprehensive RCT with 1,410 participants
in various stages of recovery. This trial is pivotal in determining whether access to Pink Cloud (vs. control) can
influence the duration of sobriety over a 6-month period and help to reduce substance use problems (AIM 2).
Potential mediators of these effects, such as meeting attendance history, sober social support network, and
engagement in recovery behaviors will also be evaluated. We will conduct an in-depth analysis of user
engagement within the app, identifying factors, such as race/ethnicity, gender, substance use history that may
predict participant interactions with its features with the RCT participants randomized to receive the Pink
Cloud app (AIM 3). Findings from the RCT will then inform the development of Pink Cloud’s new marketing
plan and materials (AIM 4) promoting the app as a tool treatment center can provide their client to improve
recovery and individuals can access on their own to accomplish the same. With an estimated market of 60
million people, the potential impact of Pink Cloud in transforming SUD/AUD treatment is immense,
presenting a significant opportunity to influence global health outcomes in this domain."

Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease represents a major public health challenge. The long
treatment period and high-dose systemic administration of antibiotics often leads to adverse effects, resistance
development, and suboptimal therapeutic accumulation at the infection site. Identifying new drugs and routes of
administration as well as shorter and better-tolerated treatment regimes are highly desired for treating NTM lung
infections, including those caused by MAC and M. abscessus, among other species.
Here, we propose a novel antibiotic delivery system, cyclodextrin-based metal-organic frameworks (CD-MOFs),
to form antibiotic/CD-MOF cocrystals administered through an inhalation route via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) to
tackle the challenges in NTM infection treatments. Highlighted innovations include (1) High loading ratios and
deep lung delivery with minimized systemic exposures and adverse effects; (2) Cyclodextrin-improved
bioavailability and permeability for the boosted antimicrobial activity; (3) Synergistic anti-mycobacterial efficacy
via multiple antibiotic integration; (4) Controlled release of antibiotics towards optimized PK/PD performance; (5)
MOF-induced intracellular internalization by alveolar macrophages favorable in treating NTM and other
intracellular infections; and (6) Significantly lowered production cost with complete avoidance of toxic solvents.
Because of the unique value of CD-MOF cocrystals provided, our proposal will offer multiple benefits to the field
of pulmonary antibiotic delivery for the improved efficacy and safety in treating NTM lung infections.
In Aim 1, we plan to demonstrate the pulmonary anti-mycobacterial feasibility of antibiotics/CD-MOF cocrystals.
The investigation starts by synthesizing cocrystals with high loading ratio (>10wt%) and appropriate aerodynamic
performance (MMAD: 1-5µm) suitable for deep lung pulmonary delivery. Then, we will evaluate the in vitro anti-
mycobacterial efficacy using standard broth microdilution method (M. abscessus, 30±2°C; CAMHB) to determine
MIC, providing quantitative insights into the therapeutic potential of the proposed antibiotics/CD-MOF cocrystals.
In Aim 2, we will incorporate mycobacterial intracellular infection by introducing Mycobacterium avium (MAC,
ATCC 700898) in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), co-cultured with a rationally designed 3D alveolar
ALI microtissue (MOI=10), to model the NTM infection in lung. The infected microtissue will be treated in apical
surface with (1) air (negative control), (2) standalone antibiotics (positive control), and (3) antibiotic/CD-MOF
cocrystals (treatment). Multiple endpoints will be evaluated including anti-mycobacterial killing efficacy (CFU
enumeration and log reduction), toxicity (cell viability, pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions, ALI barrier integrity,
gene expression of type I/II pneumocytes), cellular internalization, and antibiotic release and absorption profiles.
In future SBIR phase II, we target to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic/CD-MOFs in treating NTM
infections using an IFNγ-knockout mice model infected with M. abscessus."
11006814,"Project Summary:
Chest tubes are commonly implanted between the ribs and into the pleural space after cardiac surgery and during
management of thoracic injury. While these devices are essential for providing drainage of air and fluid from this
space, they are exquisitely painful because they mechanically irritate sensitive pleural membranes and intercostal
space with normal breathing and upper body movements. In fact, the indwelling chest tube is often listed by
patients as one of the most painful and dissatisfying aspects of their post-surgical care. The severity of the pain
necessitates serial, systemic administration of opiate medications in approximately 80% of patients with a chest
tube. This opioid use produces many deleterious side effects including respiratory depression, sedation,
hypotension, urinary retention, and nausea/vomiting that slow patient recovery. In addition, opioid use comes
with a risk of dependence, potentially leading to life altering addiction issues for some patients.
The overall goal of this proposal is to create and test a drug eluting chest tube to locally manage the pain of the
device using a non-narcotic anesthetic agent. Local treatment of the pain of a chest tube would be highly
advantageous in reducing or eliminating the need for systemic opioids for controlling pain from the implanted
chest tube. This would provide a significant benefit to patients in reducing pain, speeding recovery,
and lowering the risk of side effects and addiction.Using a novel, patent pending technique, our preliminary
studies have demonstrated that we are able deliver high levels of anesthetic agents locally from a chest tube for
several weeks. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop this technology into a clinical device that can be
tested in human studies. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Complete GMP/GLP studies of drug
release kinetics, drug stability and manufacturing repeatability for the drug releasing chest tube. Aim 2. Perform
studies to evaluate mechanical stability over time and clinical usability by cardiothoracic surgeons.
Local delivery of a non-narcotic painkiller from the chest tube will reduce or remove the need to treat patients
with systemic narcotics. This would reduce healthcare costs by lowering the risk of side effects and addiction
potential from narcotic administration and enhancing the time of recovery. In addition, our technology could be
easily adapted for delivery of other agents including anti-inflammatory or anti-thrombotic compounds. Thus, it
may have wide applicability to other indwelling medical devices."

 Shoulder contracture or “arthrofibrosis” is a painful and gradual loss of shoulder motion caused by trauma,
surgical procedures, inflammation, prolonged joint immobilization, or for no clear cause (i.e. idiopathically), as is
the case in “frozen shoulder”. Shoulder arthrofibrosis occurs in 9 million individuals in the United States with
more than 1.6 million seeking surgical remedies each year. Current treatment options, including intra-articular
corticosteroid injections, NSAIDs, and nerve blockers, provide only marginal and temporary relief of patient
symptoms and do not address the underlying cause of the disease—the accumulation of fibrotic collagenous
tissue. Surgical interventions are used in more severe cases, but these procedures are fraught with complica-
tions and can further aggravate symptoms. Ortholevo is developing a local injectable polymeric microparticle
sustained release formulation of relaxin-2 for the treatment of shoulder arthrofibrosis. Relaxin-2 (RLX) is a 6-kDa
naturally-occurring peptide hormone that is present in males and females but is especially known for temporally
downregulating collagen production and upregulating matrix metalloproteases to loosen pelvic ligaments prior to
childbirth. Using this peptide therapeutic for the treatment of arthrofibrosis provides an unprecedented
opportunity to treat this disease with a first of its kind therapy and a resulting paradigm shift in the
treatment of shoulder arthrofibrosis.
 Ortholevo proposes to advance its technology down the path of commercialization by the completion of the
following late-stage product development proposed aims: 1) Perform pilot scale production of IND-enabling re-
laxin (RLX) drug substance for use in late stage drug product development; 2) Complete late-stage manufactur-
ing activities and sterilization development of sustained-release relaxin (SR-RLX) drug product, resulting in a tox
batch for IND-enabling studies; 3) Conduct key rat GLP acute local toxicology studies to demonstrate a wide
therapeutic window; and 4) Execute FDA regulatory strategy in support of pre-IND meeting and IND submission.
To accomplish these aims, we have collected key preliminary data demonstrating efficacy using a relaxin-2
loaded microparticle formulation as well as assembled a team with expertise in science/engineering/medicine
(e.g., protein therapeutics, microparticles, biomechanics, and clinical joint contracture) and translation and com-
mercialization (e.g., management, regulatory, manufacturing, and marketing). With the successful completion of
the specific aims in this CRP proposal, the next commercialization steps include completing remaining IND-
enabling studies, producing clinical trial drug product, obtaining IND approval, and initiating clinical investigation.
Achievement of these goals will lead to the first standard of care treatment for shoulder arthrofibrosis based on
reversing the underlying and abnormal accumulation of fibrotic collagenous tissue that delivers the therapeutic
in a sustained and controlled manner to the site of disease while keeping systemic exposure to a minimum."

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and is characterized by the severe
deterioration of cognition and memory due to the production of amyloid-β plaques, and neurofibrillary tau tangles
in the brain. Current drugs on the market reduce symptoms of AD, but none cure the disease. There is a need
for innovative new therapeutic approaches. Increasing evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota
can modulate disease-associated pathology in the brain, such as inflammation and toxic metabolite
accumulation. Recent studies show that microbiome imbalances are involved in the early stages of Alzheimer’s
disease and increase neuroinflammation. Therefore, by reducing systemic inflammation and gut-derived toxic
metabolites, the brain can be protected from neuroinflammation, curtailing the progression of neurodegenerative
disease. Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium found in the human gut. It plays a key role in
regulating gut barrier integrity, intestinal inflammation, and toxic metabolites. By enhancing intestinal barrier
integrity, A. muciniphila reduces the translocation of LPS into circulation, and subsequently decreases pro-
inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, A. muciniphila was found to downregulate systemic levels of trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite associated with neurodegenerative pathology23,24, and that was found elevated in
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD. Overall, the data suggest that A.
muciniphila offers an innovative multifaceted therapeutic approach to inflammatory and neurodegenerative
diseases. As such, we propose to leverage our proprietary isolate collection, to select the most suitable A.
muciniphila candidate and enhance its neuroprotective properties by engineering beneficial metabolites into its
genome. We have identified three anti-inflammatory metabolites to engineer into A. muciniphila: the short chain
fatty acid butyrate, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the bile acid UDCA (converted by the liver in
TUDCA), all three of which have been shown to reduce inflammation in the CNS. Therefore, our central
hypothesis is that engineering these anti-inflammatory compounds into the well-established probiotic A.
muciniphila will create a highly effective, targeted and safe therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease. To test this
hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will validate the efficacy of a cocktail of BHB,
butyrate and UDCA in a mouse models of AD. This will act as a proof-of-concept study to test the effects of the
metabolites in a model of AD pathology, and justify the following aims. Specific Aim 2 will build a single strain
of E. coli Nissle to produce butyrate, UDCA and BHB, to precisely identify the best combination of genes and
regulatory elements to achieve the target production rates. Specific Aim 3 will involve the rational selection and
engineering of Akkermansia muciniphila strain. This will include first screening Bloom’s library of Akkermansia
isolates to identify top candidates for AD therapeutics, and secondly engineering the metabolites into the genome
of Akkermansia, and progress to a phase II project and begin pre-clinical characterization."

 Homeostatic proliferation, in particular that mediated by IL7, is an important driver of HIV persistence in
CD4+ T cells. We recently established that CD127, the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor, is expressed on a subset
of tissue-derived, long-lived memory CD4+ T cells preferentially prone to latent infection by HIV. These latently-
infected cells, however, harbor incomplete HIV transcripts, and hence belong to a category of latent cells termed
transcriptionally-active reservoir cells. These active reservoir cells are important targets for HIV cure, as they
can be rebound-competent and can drive chronic inflammation in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed people
with HIV (PWH). We postulate that given the role of IL7-driven homeostatic proliferation in reservoir
maintenance, the IL7-CD127 axis serves as a good target for HIV cure. Here, we leverage a safe and potent
chimeric CD127 monoclonal antibody called 4A10, developed for T-ALL cancer therapy, to simultaneously target
IL7 signaling and CD127+ reservoir cells as a novel approach for HIV cure. We postulate that by both inhibiting
IL7-mediated signaling through CD127 and potentiating innate immune effector functions (ADCC, ADCP) to
deplete CD127-expressing cells, 4A10 can reduce the HIV reservoir and potentially lead to HIV remission. In
Aim 1, we use an ex vivo tissue model of HIV persistence to test the direct IL7 antagonism effects of 4A10, as
well as its ability to mediate ADCC and ADCP, against HIV reservoir cells expressing CD127. In Aim 2, we use
a recently-developed humanized mouse model suitable for ADCC and ADCP studies to interrogate the effects
of 4A10 on HIV persistence. These studies will administer 4A10 to mice already stably suppressed on ART, as
well as those about to initiate ART. The latter will be done to in order to implement intervention at a period of
time where reservoir cells are stabilized and homeostatic proliferation is proceeding in the context of immune
reconstitution. Treatment interruption studies will assess the ability of 4A10 to lead to ART-free HIV remission.
In both aims, multi-omics single-cell sequencing approaches will be used to assess the effects of intervention on
HIV and host gene expression, and on clonal expansion of HIV reservoir cells. Collectively, our study will
characterize mechanisms of homeostatic proliferation-driven HIV persistence, and directly test the potential of
4A10 as a novel cure strategy. Should the latter prove promising, rapid translation to the clinic can occur as 4A10
has an excellent safety profile and is soon entering patients in the context of cancer therapy trials."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major clinical problem affecting more than 3 million Americans
each year, and 60 million worldwide. Brain injuries are varied and depending on the region of
the brain impacted, the cell type injured, or the gender of the person, outcomes can vastly differ.
Misdiagnosing TBI can have devastating long-term consequences that can affect quality of life.
Solutions are needed that can better accurately prognosticate outcomes post TBI. At present,
substances in blood referred to as biomarkers serve as prognosticating tools for TBI outcomes.
Two FDA-approved biomarkers namely GFAP and UCH-L1 are used to triage mild TBI (mTBI)
patients that don’t need unnecessary computer tomography scans. Both GFAP and UCH-L1
proteins are released from cells upon injury and are found in neurons and glial cells. CIAN, Inc.
has preliminary data that suggests that blood flow and blood vessel health are important
components of TBI progression, and the endothelial cells that underlies the blood vessel needs
to be accounted for in biomarkers. A hair-like organelle called cilium that senses blood flow gets
dismantled upon high or disturbed blood flow conditions, which were observed in mTBI and
severe TBI. Our hypothesis is that vascular blood flow-associated markers in cilium when
combined with neuronal and glia markers will provide better outcome determination post TBI.
CIAN, Inc, technological innovation is based on the ciliary proteins expressed in the cilium that
serve as surrogate markers of vascular flow changes in TBI in blood. The long-term goal of this
project is to develop a point-of-care test that is based on ciliary biomarker detection in a drop of
blood. To facilitate this long-term objective, we need to develop specific monoclonal antibodies
and an immunoassay that can be miniaturized. In this STTR phase I project, CIAN, Inc. will
develop antibodies towards two protein targets that are expressed in cilia (aim 1), and an
immunoassay (aim 2) to detect these proteins in human plasma. Combining the two objectives
will result in a kit that can be run on colorimetric based ELISA readers available in most clinical
labs in levels 1 and 2 trauma centers in the US. In Phase II, we will validate the assay on TBI
samples to facilitate the development of a CLIA lab test. The commercial opportunity here is to
have a TBI prognosticating or monitoring biomarker test available in 450 level 1 or 2 trauma
centers in the US."
11006503,"Project Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks for cancer. Emerging studies show that viral infections induce
similar metabolic rewiring for viral persistence and propagation. Human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and multiple types of B cell malignancies. Oral KS is one of
the most common clinical manifestations in AIDS patient, and is associated with higher KSHV viral loads. KSHV
infection reprograms metabolic pathways, including but not limited to glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lipogenesis.
Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which KSHV manipulates cellular metabolism remain poorly understood. Our
recent study shows that pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD has a non-canonical function to target NF-κB
transcription factor RelA for protein deamidation. Remarkably, deamidation of RelA downregulates NF-κB
responses, but drives aerobic glycolysis to promote cell proliferation. In KSHV-infected oral keratinocytes and
endothelial cells, the viral Cyclin homology, vCyclin, hijacks cellular Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) to
phosphorylate CAD, thereby driving pyrimidine biosynthesis and deamidation-dependent glycolysis. Besides
CAD, our preliminary data suggest that vCyclin-CDK6 complex phosphorylates fatty acid synthesis enzymes to
reprogram de novo fatty acid synthesis. These findings support our overarching hypothesis that KSHV exploits
host CDK6 for metabolic reprogramming to facilitate viral replication and tumorigenesis. In the proposed study,
we will determine the mechanisms by which KSHV vCyclin-CDK6-mediated phosphorylations regulate metabolic
enzymes (Aim 1), delineate KSHV-driven reprogramming of metabolic pathways by vCyclin-CDK6 (Aim 2), and
determine the physiological relevance of CDK6-mediated metabolic reprogramming in KSHV pathogenesis (Aim
3). Overall, the proposed study will identify unprecedented mechanisms underlying viral manipulations of
glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Our research will also uncover CDK6-associated
metabolic vulnerabilities of KSHV-infected cells which will establish the foundation for the development of novel
therapeutics against KSHV-associated malignancies.

Cervical insufficiency is a severe complication of pregnancy that leads to preterm birth. Preterm birth is a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns infants and can cause long-term disabilities during
childhood. Healthcare spending for preterm infants is expensive, with infants born before 37 weeks costing an
average of $76,000 in the first six months after birth. Cervical insufficiency is caused by structural failure of the
cervix. In normal pregnancy, the cervix is strong enough to stay closed throughout pregnancy. However, in cases
of cervical insufficiency, the cervix is unable to retain the pregnancy during fetal growth. The cervix dilates in the
absence of uterine contractions, which leads to preterm birth. The mainstay of treatment is cervical cerclage, a
surgical procedure that uses a suture to compress the cervix. Cervical compression prevents preterm dilation
and maintains a sterile barrier between the fetal and vaginal environments. Approximately 15,000 cerclage
surgeries are performed each year in the U.S. (0.4% of pregnancies). Although cerclage is well-integrated into
clinical practice, the efficacy of cerclage is limited, and adverse effects occur. Cx Therapeutics is developing the
Cx Device, a medical device to improve the efficacy of cerclage and to decrease its adverse effects. The Cx
Device is composed of four silicone plates arranged circumferentially around the cervix. A suture is threaded
through each plate and alternately passes into the cervix for placement. Upon tightening, the suture compresses
the plates, which in turn compress the tissue, effectively applying compression more evenly to the cervix. More
uniform application of compression decreases stress concentrations in the tissue. Previous work has
demonstrated the Cx Device has a higher load carrying capability compared to cerclage. The Cx Device also
lengthens the cervix compared to cerclage, suggesting the Cx Device will lead to improved efficacy in vivo. The
current Direct to Phase II proposal will continue to advance this novel device for cervical insufficiency closer to
commercialization by completing engineering validation and conducting a limited first-in-human study. Cx
Therapeutics brings together a highly qualified team with expertise in medical device design, product
development, regulatory affairs, and high-risk obstetrics, to achieve the following Aims. Aim 1 will finalize the
design of the device and complete engineering verification. Engineering activities will be informed by
computational modeling and usability testing with physicians. Experiments in Aim 2 will validate the Cx Device
through compression measurements on ex vivo human tissue and assess its usability in the operating room.
Experiments in Aim 3 will assess biocompatibility by performing studies to determine in vitro cytotoxicity and
evaluate long-term effects in a pig model of pregnancy. At the end of Phase II, Cx Therapeutics will have
developed a production equivalent device that satisfies both engineering and clinical requirements. The activities
of Phase II will position Cx Therapeutics for a Phase IIB designed to secure FDA clearance and complete a
clinical trial in pregnancy."

Pregnancy and infant loss (perinatal loss) impact approximately one in four families in the United States. Three
out of five mental health related perinatal deaths are caused by suicide. Parents who have a perinatal loss are
often not the focus of suicide prevention. Additionally, posttraumatic stress disorder is more common among
birthing people who have a perinatal loss compared to birthing people who do not. This reflects the acute,
somatic, distressing, and often disenfranchised (e.g., dismissed or ignored) experiences of bereaved parents.
Compounding the heightened distress experienced by many parents after the death of their baby, there are
few resources and those that do exist are often inconsistent and do not provide evidence-based therapeutic
content. Approximately half of Americans live in an area with a mental health professional shortage. Even
when counseling services are available, there are few providers specifically trained to support bereaved
parents. In Phase I, we developed a functional prototype of Along With Me for perinatal grief (AWM), a web-
based application that combines therapeutic content for bereaved parents and healthcare professional training.
Our clinical trial yielded moderate effect sizes for improving grief self-efficacy and reducing post-traumatic
stress avoidance symptoms. These findings were in line with our theory of change and study developed
application modules. Our successful Phase I results suggest we can confidently move to Phase II to build
additional cognitive behavioral therapy modules to support bereaved parents, tailor content for parents who
speak Spanish and those who have experienced miscarriage, complete a randomized controlled trial to
establish the evidence base for AWM, and enhance the product for adoption. Phase II development and
evaluation of the dual-language tool will allow us to create a commercially-viable product for adoption by
healthcare organizations. To accomplish this goal, we will achieve three specific aims: (Aim 1) Complete
development of an enhanced AWM application informed by the formative, usability, and outcome data
generated from Phase I, by a diverse bereaved parent community board (n = 12), and by healthcare
administrators. (Aim 2) Pilot and assess the usability of the AWM mobile app with English- and Spanish-
speaking bereaved parents (n = 20) and healthcare professionals (n = 10) and make necessary revisions.
Testing and feedback will occur in 3 waves to prepare the prototype for evaluation. (Aim 3) Conduct a clinical
trial to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and usability of the AWM app with 300 recently bereaved parents
randomly allocated to (a) services as usual (n = 100), (b) AWM alone (n = 100), or (c) AWM plus a peer guide
(n = 100). Our primary outcomes will be posttraumatic stress symptoms and suicidal ideation. We hope to
establish that AWM can prevent and address posttraumatic stress and suicidal ideation to improve outcomes
for bereaved parents. Without dedicated resources toward intervention, bereaved parents, especially Black,
Indigenous, and rural residing parents, will continue to have suboptimal access to evidence-based care."

11004511,"SUMMARY
The International Gap Junction Conference (IGJC) is a biannual international meeting that has been alternating
between Europe and America since 1987. This meeting is the only one of its kind that gathers scientists and
clinicians from all over the world to present and discuss research on connexins, pannexins, innexins, and gap
junction proteins in general. The most well-known connexin-mediated function is perhaps in formation of gap
junctions within cardiac muscle which provide direct intercellular electrical coupling necessary for each
heartbeat to occur. Alterations in connexin regulation and function are understood to cause arrhythmias of
sudden cardiac death, and a significant portion of IGJC2024 will be dedicated to normal and pathological
mechanisms of connexin regulation encompassing transcription, translation, post-translational modification,
channel biophysics/structure, and stability/degradation. In addition to intercellular communication, connexin
hemichannels occur on the cell surface, and increasing non-junctional cytosolic functions of connexins are
being uncovered. Pannexins share a protomeric structural similarity with connexins but are not considered to
form intercellular channels, but rather function intracellularly or as cell-surface channels controlling release of
ATP and other metabolites for purinergic signaling. Just as with connexins, but through distinct mechanisms,
pannexin function is closely related to heart and vascular biology, with significant roles in heart disease
progression and blood pressure maintenance, for example. Pannexins have evolved from innexins, which form
gap junctions in invertebrates. There has been a recent resurgence in innexin research using model organisms
which is providing further insight as to evolution and mechanisms of pannexin/connexin structure and function.
By combining these three dynamic fields of research, the IGJC provides a uniquely diverse and rich intellectual
space with a demonstrated history of fostering collaboration to move the field forward and providing support
and exposure for early career investigators to share their science. It is our overall Aim to ensure that IGJC2024
continues the success of this highly anticipated and long-running forum by facilitating the dissemination of new
discoveries, fostering collaboration, and attracting trainees from diverse backgrounds supporting early-career
investigators in the fields of connexin, pannexin, and innexin biology."

Black and Latinx people in the United States (US) suffer disproportionately high levels of substance use and
mental health disorders. Further, racial and ethnic minoritized groups have decreased access to behavioral
health treatment services than white people. Emergent literature has zeroed in on how structural factors can
impact various health outcomes. In this application, our main objective is to understand the connection between
behavioral health outcomes, structural racism, and an urgent and escalating contemporary issue: natural
disasters. Therefore, in response to RFA-DA-23-013 we propose our project, “The Contribution of Structural
Racism to the Effects of Natural Disaster on Behavioral Health Outcomes (SALENDO)” study. The objective of
this study is to clarify the overlapping effects of structural racism, natural disaster exposure and risk, and
behavioral health. Our specific aims are: 1) Evaluate temporal and geographic correlations of structural racism,
utilizing indices at the concentration of extremes (ICE) measures, natural disaster susceptibility, and rates
behavioral health-related emergency department visits/inpatient hospitalizations/overdoses by county in Texas
(TX) and Louisiana (LA); 2) Examine how Hurricane Harvey shaped behavioral healthcare utilization and
overdose fatalities and the role that structural racism played in these consequences; and 3) Interpret and
actionize data in collaboration with impacted communities."

 There is a pressing need to identify and validate new targets for chronic pain and new sources for novel
compounds. This proposal will use novel extracts and pure compounds from multiple Cameroonian plants
namely Paullinia pinnata, Petersianthus macrocarpus and Acacia sieberiana to probe the biology and therapeutic
potential of an exciting non-opioid target for pain, focusing on calcium homeostasis especially through sigma 2
(σ-2) (aka transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97)). “Agonists” for σ-2/TMEM97 reduce neuropathic and
inflammatory pain in mice. Our primary research goal is to use a focused interdisciplinary approach to isolate
bioactive compounds from traditional medicine and utilize these new tools in Cameroon to address research and
education disparities that contribute to poor pain outcomes in Central Africa. This goal will be pursued with a
unique collaboration that we have developed between researchers at the University of Dschang (Cameroon; Dr.
Nguelefack), the University of Texas at Dallas (USA; Dr. Kolber) and the University of Kentucky (USA; Dr.
Tidgewell). Preliminarily, the Nguelefack lab has shown that crude extracts of P. Pinnata, P. macrocarpus and
A. sieberiana significantly decrease inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rats. The Tidgewell/Kolber groups
have shown that the methanol extracts of P. pinnata show in vitro binding affinity to σ-2/TMEM97 and modulate
primary sensory neurons. This proposal will utilize our interdisciplinary and international approach with in vitro
evaluation of plant extracts, followed by fractionation, in vitro testing of σ-2/TMEM97 binding, and additional in
vitro validation at UT Dallas and Dschang with pure compounds. In addition to the research focus on Ca2+
homeostasis, this proposal aims to build research and clinical capacity for the study of pain in Cameroon and
surrounding countries. This will be accomplished using a mixture of capacity building initiatives including the
training of Cameroon trainees in the US and Cameroon, the building of Dschang University as a center for pain
research in central Africa, and the hosting of local workshops at Dschang to support the spread of research
knowledge in Cameroon and surrounding countries."
10986288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Guided by Fundamental Cause Theory with innovative methodologies, this proposal examines the impact
of geospatial intersectional stigma and affirmation on substance use and HIV risk among bisexual Black and
Latino men. Bisexual men experience co-morbid health disparities including elevated substance use and HIV
risk. Black and Latino men are disproportionately represented in bisexual populations relative to the general
population in the United States making up 45% of bisexual men. Bisexual Black and Latino men experience
elevated substance use and HIV risk relative to heterosexual Black and Latino men. One contributing factor is
stigma. Intersectionality informs us that bisexual Black and Latino men experience a range of stigma types
including binegative stigma based on their sexual identity, racist stigma, substance use stigma, and HIV
stigma. While stigma is theorized to be multilevel and intersectionality experiences have called for geospatial
examinations of stigma, few studies have sought to measure stigma geospatially. This proposal seeks to
address these limitations by first collecting a general sample of adults to generate geospatial stigma scores
then using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to quantify activity space for a sample of bisexual Black
and Latino men including momentary assessments of substance use and HIV risk. This will be addressed
through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Describe geospatial distribution of intersectional stigma in Cook County, IL and
Palm Beach County, FL including bi-negativity, racism, substance use stigma and HIV stigma. Approach. We
will generate geospatial stigma scores through a household-based probability sample of the general adult
population (N =
2,000
). Survey responses will be geocoded to generate geolocated averages of stigma scores.
Hypothesis. There will be unequal distribution of stigma including areas of increased or decreased stigma. Aim
2: Examine the impact of geospatial stigma on the relationship between substance use and HIV risk.
Approach. We will link geospatial estimates of stigma generated in Aim 1 to a second survey sample of HIV-
Black and Latinx bisexual men using EMA to capture activity space (N =
600
). Hypothesis. Bisexual men who
reside or have activity spaces in areas with higher stigma will be more likely to use substance, and engage in
HIV risk behaviors, while access to affirming social resources will buffer against geospatial stigmas. Aim 3:
Analyze qualitative perspectives on the impacts of intersecting stigmas on substance use and HIV risk in
bisexual men, provider interactions, and messaging. Approach. We will collect qualitative interviews with
bisexual men (N = 48),
and key informants
(N = 24) addressing perspectives on the impact of stigma on
substance use and access to HIV prevention and community services as well as preferences for prevention
messaging. Findings will inform the development of multilevel intervention strategies."

The goal of this K08 Career Development Award proposal is to provide training for Elizabeth Nguyen, MD,
PhD, as she establishes her career as an independent academic investigator in the fields of epigenetics and
kidney regeneration. As a pediatric nephrologist, Dr. Nguyen helps patients navigate the progression of kidney
injury to chronic kidney disease, an irreversible process resulting in immense burden for these families and the
healthcare industry. As there is currently no treatment to reverse injury to a fibrotic kidney, her research
interest is to identify mechanisms that promote kidney regeneration. To achieve this goal, she is training under
the mentorship of Dr. Mark Majesky, whose lab identified that the African spiny mouse evolved the ability to
exhibit scar-free kidney regeneration after kidney injury. With her research experience in computational biology
and genetics, Dr. Nguyen determined that kidneys of the spiny mouse express the same proteins as the house
mouse, but its response to injury is remarkably different, indicating that epigenetic control of gene expression
may be the key to its regenerative capabilities. She generated a fully annotated reference genome for the spiny
mouse which enables the epigenomic interrogations she proposes. Her central hypothesis for this proposal is
that histone modifications in spiny mice proximal tubular epithelial cells activate gene regulatory networks that
promote kidney regeneration in response to ischemic injury. The aims of this proposal will 1) define proximal
tubule cell states during kidney regeneration in the spiny mouse, 2) construct gene regulatory networks
controlling proximal tubule cell regeneration in the spiny mouse and 3) identify mechanisms critical for kidney
regeneration in the spiny mouse, examining the role of the Yap-TEAD pathway as it undergoes histone
mediated activation in the spiny mouse kidney as presented in her preliminary data. To achieve these aims,
the applicant proposes a career development plan that allows her to gain advanced skills in epigenetics,
regeneration biology and models of kidney injury. She has assembled a mentoring team of nationally
recognized experts with a history of training successful investigators including her primary mentor, Dr. Mark
Majesky (African spiny mice regeneration), and committee members Dr. David Beier (epigenetics of kidney
disease), Dr. Steven Henikoff (chromatin profiling methods), Dr. Samir El-Dahr (epigenetics of kidney
development), Dr. Shreeram Akilesh (multiomic investigations of kidney injury) and Dr. Hannele Ruohola-Baker
(stem cell and regenerative biology). Her training will be complemented by coursework, conferences, and
faculty development programming. Her research will be performed at Seattle Children’s Research Institute
where key resources include a colony of spiny mice and state-of-the-art genomic technology. Achieving these
aims will provide the foundation necessary for her to construct a competitive R01 proposal. Through this
proposal, Dr. Nguyen will be well prepared for an independent research career aimed at understanding the
epigenetic regulation driving mechanisms of kidney regeneration."

Decision-making by and on behalf of people with dementia poses especially complex clinical, ethical
and policy problems. Addressing these complexities will require combined expertise at many different
levels, e.g.: neurobiological (brain function and degeneration), psychosocial (effects on family/caregiving
relationships), sociological (stigma), legal (elder abuse), and conceptual (changes in values over time).
This K24 grant proposal will support the mentoring activities of Winston Chiong, MD PhD, a behavioral
neurologist and Director of Bioethics at the University of California, San Francisco whose clinical and
research practice addresses Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Drawing on his advanced
training in clinical neurology, philosophy/bioethics and cognitive neuroscience, Dr. Chiong mentors
junior scholars in an interdisciplinary research program encompassing both (1) decision neuroscience in
aging and disorders of aging, and (2) the ethical, policy and health equity implications of alterations to
brain function. The primary goal of this proposal is to expand Dr. Chiong’s mentoring in patient-oriented
research, with a focus on training scholars with diverse expertise to make novel contributions to the
challenges associated with decision-making in Alzheimer’s disease and other disorders of aging. In his
plans for career development and mentoring, Dr. Chiong will (1) increase his engagement with mentees
and national leaders in geriatrics and palliative care, (2) build knowledge in geriatrics and caregiver
research, (3) enhance his ability to mentor trainees from underrepresented backgrounds, and (4) grow
as a national leader in aging and dementia research. The research specifically supported by this award
will build upon new work in the cognitive science of making decisions for others, applying this to the
difficult clinical and ethical challenges associated with caregivers’ decisions on behalf of people with
dementia. This will provide opportunities for trainees with expertise in neurology, cognitive science,
dementia, geriatrics, palliative care bioethics and other fields. The project is supported by collaborations
with accomplished scholars who have complementary expertise: Alex Smith, MD MS MPH, a national
leader in geriatrics and palliative care who directs the UCSF T32 fellowship in aging research; Robert
Levenson, PhD, a psychologist who has extensively studied dementia caregivers and changes in
caregiving relationships; Howard Rosen, MD, a behavioral neurologist who has previously mentored Dr.
Chiong and will guide Dr. Chiong’s own career development; and Nicole Rosendale, MD, a national
leader in addressing neurologic health disparities and in advancing the training of junior scholars from
marginalized groups. Their expertise will contribute to the research specifically funded by this award,

10986802,"Project Summary/Abstract-Overall
 Coordinated and integrated care programs for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's
disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) and their family caregivers are growing. These models of care integrate
disease care management, provide multidisciplinary care planning, and navigate healthcare and social service
systems for persons living with dementia and their caregivers. However, knowledge of these services’
effectiveness is limited due to the lack of high-quality data at the state and sub-state levels, which hampers
evaluation of policies that support integrated/coordinated dementia care services. Lack of data also inhibits
opportunities to adapt and scale integrated/coordinated dementia care services within and across states,
particularly to underserved communities. The State Alzheimer’s Research Support Center (StARS) will guide
states through partnership, engagement, and 1-year pilot projects to build collaborations and create a shared
data infrastructure to advance the accessibility, affordability, and effectiveness of dementia care services
across the United States. Guided by the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Research Framework,
the specific aims are as follows: 1) to establish partnerships to identify existing coordinated/integrated
dementia care services and available data sources within states; 2) to support 16 dementia care pilot projects;
3) to build a within- and across state data infrastructure to evaluate dementia care services and policies; and 4)
to implement a multifaceted dissemination strategy to promote best practices in the identification, linking, and
sharing of dementia care data. The State Alzheimer’s Research Support Center will create a national data
infrastructure that enable states and all communities to better understand dementia care services’ effects on
key care transitions, such as hospitalization readmissions, nursing home admission, home health care, as well
as the health and well-being of people living with dementia and their caregivers. This infrastructure will also
facilitate the examination of policy variations and changes on dementia care services within and across states.
The partnership building, pilot project support, and data sharing infrastructure of StARS will ultimately result in
greater dissemination of integrated/coordinated dementia care services that yield positive outcomes for people
with dementia and care partners living in various regions and underrepresented communities."
10983398,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) results from the cumulative effects of aging on the auditory system. There
is growing evidence linking ARHL with cognitive impairment and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias. In fact, the 2017 Lancet Commission for Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care found
that hearing loss is associated with the highest relative risk of dementia (RR 1.9) among 9 potentially modifiable
risk factors. It is hypothesized that poor peripheral encoding of sound due to ARHL contributes to cognitive
impairment by increasing cortical resources to auditory decoding from memory and other cognitive domains.
 Research shows an association between the severity of hearing loss and disability in activities of daily
living, including shopping, preparing meals and household chores. Older adults with ARHL become socially
isolated as communication problems increase, resulting in emotional and cognitive difficulties. The goal of this
study is to understand the effect of cochlear implants and hearing aids using real-world data documenting daily
performance in study subjects’ natural environments as a predictor of cognitive impairment, or progression
from mild cognitive impairment to dementia in people with ARHL. Six groups of individuals, 65+ years of age,
will be studied: 1) cochlear implant (Implant) users with normal cognition; 2) Implant candidates who
naturalistically retained hearing aids (HA retainers) with normal cognition; 3) Implant users with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI); 4) HA retainers with MCI; 5) normal hearing/normal cognition; and 6) normal hearing with MCI.
 Data from a smartphone ecological momentary assessment (EMA) system is this study’s primary outcome
measure, including patient-reported outcomes collected in real-time across multiple domains: 1) listening
environment; 2) hearing-related function; 3) hearing loss-related mental health; and 4) cognitive function.
 Aim 1. Compare the cross-sectional association of Implants or HAs on real-world EMA outcomes in ARHL
with normal cognition. Hypothesis: Implants will be associated with better EMA outcomes (auditory function,
cognitive performance, social interaction, psychosocial wellbeing) as compared to HA retainers.
 Aim 2. Compare the longitudinal effects of the use of Implants or HAs in AHRL with and without cognitive
impairment on cognitive function, using real-world EMA outcomes and a neuropsychological battery.
Hypothesis: Implants will be associated with better cognitive performance and less cognitive decline than HA
retainers as measured by both EMA cognitive items and by neuropsychological testing in those with baseline
ARHL-related MCI.
 Aim 3. Deploy study data in our visual analytics platform for precision medicine, clinical decision-support,
and data-sharing of hearing/cognitive outcomes by 1) identifying predictor variables, 2) developing

10983413,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) shows significant racial disparities, especially impacting African American (AA) men, who
have a 1.4 times higher risk of PrCa diagnosis, and a double risk of PrCa-related mortality compared to European
American (EA) men. AA men are also more frequently diagnosed with early-onset PrCa (≤55 years) than other
racial/ethnic groups. Despite these disparities, we have limited knowledge about how ancestry/race influences
epigenetic age and whether early-onset PrCa is linked to accelerated epigenetic aging due to genetic or
environmental factors. This study builds on prior research that suggests ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation is a
reliable marker of biological aging, with direct links to aging, longevity, and cancer We hypothesize that
accelerated rDNA methylation (rDNAm) age is linked to early-onset PrCa (EO) in African American (AA) patients,
potentially explaining their higher risk. By studying the rDNA methylation-EO PrCa relationship in AA men, we
aim to uncover factors contributing to racial disparities. This insight may lead to targeted interventions for
reducing the increased risk of EO PrCa in AA men. In the first aim, we investigate whether African American
(AA) prostate cancer patients have a higher rDNA methylation age at diagnosis compared to age-matched
European American (EA) prostate cancer patients. The second aim explores if AA men with prostate cancer
exhibit an increased rDNA methylation age at diagnosis in comparison to age- and race-matched non-cancer
controls. In the third aim, we assess the performance of the rDNA methylation clock in AA prostate cancer
patients within their age range, relative to alternative metrics of epigenetic aging. Our hypothesis is that the
rDNAm clock's age prediction will rival or surpass other measures like the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and
GrimAge clocks in both prostate cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This cross-platform validation
strengthens study rigor, advancing clock performance evaluation in the context of health disparities, ultimately
progressing the field. Our main objective is to uncover the reasons behind racial disparities in prostate cancer
among AA patients. In the short term, we expect the rDNA clock to emerge as a valuable tool for assessing the
risk of early-onset prostate cancer in African American patients. In the long term, our research aims to provide
strong evidence supporting the widespread adoption of the rDNA clock as a biomarker for monitoring age-related
diseases in this unique group of cancer patients. Most importantly, this proposal lays the groundwork for future
research to establish rDNA methylation epigenetic age as a fundamental baseline for epigenetic aging
measurements in studies involving exercise, dietary, or other interventions for individuals at risk of prostate
cancer, especially those of African descent."

 Diseases of aging, like Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington disease, are expected to affect 153 million individuals
worldwide by 2050.1, 2 Treatments to prevent or slow these diseases will significantly decrease the projected impact,
and modeling how disease symptoms worsen over time—the symptom trajectory—before and after a diagnosis can help
evaluate if a treatment can prevent or slow a disease. Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy because these
diseases of aging progress slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before a diagnosis can be made.
This makes time to diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient will reach the criteria for a diagnosis sometime after the
last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom
trajectory without full information about when diagnosis occurs.
 This challenge raises the question: How do we model the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored
covariate, time to diagnosis? Endeavoring to answer this question using “model-based methods,” which use models to
estimate the expected time to diagnosis and then predict the symptom trajectory, are convenient, but when the model
for time to diagnosis is wrong, so too is the estimated symptom trajectory. In contrast, a model-free strategy makes
it easy to estimate the symptom trajectory without bias, but no model-free strategy yet exists that is simultaneously
robust and predictive. This NIH supplement will provide technical training opportunities to Mr. Kyle Grosser, a doctoral
candidate of biostatistics at UNC-Chapel Hill, so that he may advance our proposed two-step approach—wherein we
estimate a patient’s time to diagnosis and then estimate their symptom trajectory—by adjusting for the possibility that
this estimated time to diagnosis is error-prone. We will advance the two-step approach using this error adjustment, first for
linear longitudinal models (Aim 1) and then for nonlinear longitudinal models (Aim 2). This supplement will also provide
mentoring and career development elements tailored to prepare Mr. Grosser for a future career in academic research.
These components include instruction in effective oral and written communication; guidance in grant development and
proposal writing; engagement with the faculty, staff, and patients affiliated with the UNC Huntington Disease Program;
and opportunities to present his research at scientific conferences and meetings."
10987161,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is a disease that results in irreversible blindness and due to its chronic, progressive nature, imposes
a psychosocial burden on patients. Appropriately, the focus of ophthalmologists is on controlling the disease to
prevent vision loss. Yet, patient’s psychosocial distress during and after therapy has not been routinely
addressed and is another important target of care. Psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) negatively
impacts all outcomes in glaucoma and is associated with poor follow-up and medication adherence, worse
vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, and faster rates of visual field progression. Direct
assessment and treatment of psychosocial distress is likely to improve glaucoma outcomes. While uncommon
in glaucoma clinics, psychosocial distress screening has been occurring with some consistency in other
medical settings (e.g., oncology) for more than a decade, leading to referrals for intervention and
improvements in psychosocial distress and subsequently overall health. Our overarching scientific premise is
that a screening program for psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in glaucoma clinics would
enhance the patient’s adherence to medical recommendations, and quality-of-life, ultimately leading to
improvements in vision-related outcomes (e.g., visual field progression). Patient-reported outcome measures
are the gold standard measures of distress, however are not routinely collected in patients with glaucoma due
to perceived time and cost burdens. To remedy this, the PI proposes an automated pre-screening framework,
motivated by preliminary analyses that demonstrate that distress can be reliably identified using predictive
modeling based on glaucoma clinical risk factors from electronic health records (EHR) data. This predictive
model will be developed in aim 1 using an existing EHR database, the Duke Glaucoma Registry, and will yield
automated risk estimates of distress that can be used to inform clinical decision making, regarding the
administration of a distress survey; therefore, limiting distress assessment to a subset of high-risk patients.
Secondary aims will focus on external validation of the automated technique, and gauging acceptability to
distress screening in a glaucoma clinic (aim 2), and the refinement of a behavioral intervention to improve
coping skills for distress in patients with glaucoma (aim 3). This research will positively impact patient well-
being in glaucoma, serving as an evidence-based assessment of a distress screening program. The proposal
also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher.
The mentored phase of the award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Felipe Medeiros, and
multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Tamara Somers (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences), Dr.
David Page (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics), and Dr. Kevin Weinfurt (Population Health Sciences). Performing
the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will provide the PI with highly
sought-after skills and experiences to help ensure a successful transition to independence."
10984729,"Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease of unknown cause marked by dysfunctional wound
healing and aberrant fibrotic remodeling of the lung that claims the lives of more than 40,000 Americans each
year. The median age of IPF is 66 years and patients have an average life expectancy of 3 years. The
scientific discovery into this disease has been slow and has resulted in only two FDA approved medications
that do not reverse or cure the disease. Our emerging conceptual understanding of IPF highlights the
significant role of alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT2) cell dysfunction in underlying susceptibility, disease
severity, and disease progression. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical SftpcI73T murine and patient-
specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models a time dependent metabolic reprogramming promoting a
loss of mitochondrial function in the AT2. Our preliminary data has also revealed the emergence of a recently
characterized aberrant AT2 cell stated marked by the inability to complete differentiation into the alveolar
epithelial type I cell (AT1). Finally, and relevant to the observation in humans, we have observed increased
mortality and increased transitional cell accumulation in aged SftpcI73T mice. Together these observations
suggest a potential link between metabolic reprogramming, the aging process, and AT2 progenitor cell biology.
The biology of this aberrant progenitor cell within the alveolar niche has become a high impact question that
requires further elucidation. To address this unmet need, we will utilize an aged murine SftpcI73T model of IPF
that closely recapitulates many aspects of the human disease and permits temporal modeling of subclinical
events in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, we will apply novel genetic approaches including a lineage trace
model of the AT2, multiple viral constructs to manipulate key metabolic enzymes in the AT2, and an AT2
specific murine model allowing us to knock out genes of interest. Founded in this compelling preliminary data,
the overall goal of this project is to identify the mechanism by which aging increases susceptibility to disease
progression and alters alveolar homeostasis. We hypothesize that that aging exacerbates defects in cell
quality control and metabolism to disrupt AT2 progenitor function and enhance aberrant transitional cell
accumulation. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims: 1) In-vivo application of the SftpcI73T fibrosis
model to characterize the impact of aging on mitochondrial quality control and metabolic disruption in
transitional AT2s throughout fibrogenesis. 2) In reductionist SftpcI73T models, determine the effect of aging
and/or senescence on AT2 progenitor capacity, AT2-AT1 transition, and the AT2 profibrotic phenotype. 3)
Define the role of AT2 derived lactate on AT2 transition cell dysfunction and fibrotic remodeling in aged models
of fibrosis The findings from this study will expand our understanding of AT2 progenitor function and link age
associated changes with metabolic dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis. Beyond the scope of IPF, epithelial
dysfunction is a key aspect of chronic and acute lung disease, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Observational studies based on big data from electronic medical records (EMRs) have been conducted recently
in many areas of medical research [1, 2]. These results provide high impact information on rare events or rare
diseases that otherwise would not be available in non-EMR studies with much smaller sample sizes. Many EMR
studies have also been done in Ophthalmology [3], especially using data from the Intelligent Research in Sight
(IRIS®) [4]. These studies face several challenges which could affect the validity of the study results. First, one
common issue is the EMR data may not fully represent the background population, especially minority groups.
This may cause biased disease estimates for underrepresented groups and gives invalid conclusions, if the ob-
served differences are not taken into consideration during data analysis. Second, when estimating prevalence
and incidence of target diseases and their associated risk factors, the entire cohort without the primary disease
or a group of healthy individuals with similar sample sizes could be considered as the control group (over 70 mil-
lions records in IRIS). Optimal sampling methods adjusting for related risk factors are inevitable tools (currently
unavailable) for selecting equally informative study groups with much smaller sample sizes and higher compu-
tational efficiency. Thirdly, among about half of the publsihed IRIS studies to date, the primary outcomes are
frequently rare events. Moreover, when we combine classes from categorical variables, unbalanced subgroups
with much smaller sample sizes often appear and this may lead to unreliable estimates with much wider confi-
dence intervals. The results become even less trustworthy when the variable recombination happens to a rare
disease outcome. It is evident that other big data EMR studies could also face the same challenges. In addi-
tion, these issues may have significant financial consequences, e.g, the lengthy running times are costly when
the EMR is hosted in secure cloud environment and the situation becomes even worse when statistical software
would crash without giving any meaningful results after long runs. To address these challenges, in this applica-
tion, through a collaborative effort between Wills Eye Hospital and the University of Connecticut, that combines
theoretical and applied statistical expertise, we propose to develop and evaluate novel subsampling and optimal
analysis methods which to the best of our knowledge do not exist to date. This application proposes to achieve
the following aims: 1) Derive optimal subsampling probabilities for both rare and non-rare events data with both
categorical and numerical covariates, which are also invariant to measurement scales for numerical covariates; 2)
Design an effect balancing approach for covariates with rare category combinations to better include underrepre-
sented subgroups to prevent potential disparity in analysis results and protect health disparity. 3) Develop optimal
sampling strategies to adjust for selection bias in EMR studies. Most importantly, we will create user-friendly
software packages on optimal subsampling for practitioners that will be applicable for similar settings in medical
research."
10991874,"Summary
Although it is becoming increasingly clear that CD8 T cells responding to chronic infection are phenotypically
and functionally diverse, little is known about how to overcome T cell exhaustion to treat infectious diseases.
Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the investigator's team has confirmed the presence of
previously identified TCF-1hi progenitor and PD-1hi exhausted T subsets. Surprisingly, they also found a
CX3CR1+ effector subset at the late phase of chronic infection. More importantly, they have shown that
CX3CR1+ effector cell formation is critically dependent on IL-21-producing CD4 helper T cells. The discovery of
this potent antiviral effector subset provides new opportunities for therapeutic interventions to treat infectious
diseases. To better understand the genesis of CX3CR1+ effector cells, the investigator's team proposes to use
the newly developed technology of paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) to “lineage trace”
back to the ancestors (progenitors) of effector and exhausted cells. Their preliminary data suggest that TCR
signaling strengths positively correlate with exhausted T cell subset differentiation, but negatively correlate with
effector T cell differentiation. In parallel, they also provide evidence that CX3CR1+ effector cell formation
depends on cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), especially Batf3+ XCR1+ cDC1s. These cDC1 cells are
likely subjected to CD40-mediated CD4 helper T cell licensing, which is unexpected in the context of persistent
infection and possibly occurs in specialized cellular structures. Taken together, the investigator hypothesizes
that progenitor CD8 T cells need to be primed and activated by the cDC1s again at the late phase of chronic
infection to enter into a proliferative burst as a transitory differentiation state, and then bifurcate into two
terminally differentiated subsets: CX3CR1+ effector and PD-1hi exhausted CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, CD4 T
cells need to provide signals to license DCs for their cross-presentation, and TCR signaling strength dictates
the threshold of progenitor cell activation and influences the effector versus exhausted cell fate choice.
Harnessing this knowledge, they intend to alter the course of T cell differentiation by changing TCR signaling
strength through identification and validation of TCR signaling negative regulators (TSNRs) that can be
exploited to favor the formation of CX3CR1+ effector T cells for improved viral control. The investigator's team
will test these hypotheses in the following three aims. First, they will use paired scRNA- and scTCR- seq and
associated computational tools and biological validations to delineate virus-specific CD8+ T cell differentiation
trajectories and dissect how TCR signaling strength affects cell fate decisions. Second, they will use genetic
models to delineate the mechanisms by which DCs are licensed by CD4 helper T cells for CD8 T cell priming
and differentiation. Third, they will employ high-throughput targeted CRISPR screen and gene editing to test if
manipulating TCR signaling strength can redirect CD8 T cells towards effector differentiation and overcome
exhaustion to treat chronic infection and cancer."

Our long-term objective is to define cellular pathways that regulate cellular cholesterol flux and to elucidate
their impact on metabolism and pathology. Most of the free cholesterol in mammalian cells resides in the
plasma membrane (PM). We previously showed that the Aster family of nonvesicular lipid transporters are
critical for the movement of cholesterol from the PM to the ER in most if not all mammalian cells. Asters are
ER-anchored proteins that bind cholesterol and facilitate the formation of ER-PM contacts in response to
elevated accessible PM cholesterol levels. Although they are required for efficient PM to ER transport, Asters
almost certainly do not act alone. Other factors are very likely to be involved in the spatial organization of
accessible PM cholesterol, the formation and stabilization of PM-ER contacts, the movement of Aster proteins
from ER to PM, and the channeling of PM cholesterol to specific regions of the ER for SREBP regulation or
esterification by ACAT. The identity of such factors is currently unknown. A complete understanding of how
cellular cholesterol is transported in vascular cells through nonvesicular pathways will fill important knowledge
gaps and may uncover new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cholesterol movement in the setting of
cardiovascular disease. Specific Aim 1 will identify new players in nonvesicular lipid transport. We have
devised proximity labeling strategies to identify proteins that localize with Asters to ER-PM contacts in a
cholesterol-dependent manner. Specific Aim 2 will define the physiological functions of Aster interactors in
cellular and systemic lipid transport. We will validate the functional importance of Snap23 and other factors for
lipid metabolism and inflammation in cell culture and animal models. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate the
mechanisms and physiological consequences of Aster phosphorylation. We have discovered that Aster-A is
phosphorylated in response to cholesterol loading or LPS stimulation. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms
that control PM cholesterol levels in cells, and thereby impact lipid metabolism and inflammation, is central to
understanding cell physiology and is expected to provide insight into the etiology and future therapy of
metabolic disease."

Commensal

colonizes mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and the female reproductive tract (FRT), however
microorganisms contribute significantly to the mucosal environment and host defense against
 bacteria.

establishment of GBS intestinal colonization in newborns i s also believed to be a critical precursor
 Late-Onset Disease (LOD) which typically presents as meningitis and results in long-term neurological
sequalae in survivors. The bacterial and host determinants that promote GBS mucosal colonization and systemic
infection, as well as the role of native microbiota are essentially unknown and represent significant knowledge
gaps in the field. Previous microbiome studies have demonstrated that GBS colonization impacts vaginal
microbial diversity. Using a mouse model of GBS vaginal colonization, we found that GBS vaginal persistence
is associated with the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila (AM), a Gram-negative intestinal commensal that
degrades mucin; however, the specific mechanism(s) for this synergy is unknown. Our preliminary data show
that the presence of AM dramatically increases GBS adherence to human vaginal epithelial cells (hVEC). Using
triple RNA-sequencing we identified numerous GBS and hVEC genes that are significantly altered in the
presence of AM, including increased bacterial surface adhesins, such as pili, and decreased transcription of
hVEC genes involved in neutrophil signaling and chemotaxis. I hypothesize that AM may promote the observed
increase in GBS vaginal persistence by increasing GBS attachment and modulating host immune responses
that dampen host defense against GBS. I further hypothesize that AM will similarly promote GBS intestinal
colonization which could impact LOD. To examine these hypotheses, we propose the following aims: 1)
Determine the mechanism by which AM promotes GBS attachment to epithelium, 2) Characterize the impact of
AM on mucosal immunity in the FRT, and 3) Examine the effect of AM on GBS intestinal

 Diseases affecting the heart valves are among the most common type of cardiovascular medical
condition affecting 2.5% of the population in the United States. The aortic valve is the most often affected and
encompasses both congenital and acquired forms. Congenital aortic valve disease is the result of a malformed
valve and represents the most common type of congenital heart defect when including bicuspid aortic valve
(BAV), which has a prevalence of 1-2% in the population. At birth, diseased aortic valves are often myxomatous
with bicuspid valve morphology and display congenital aortic valve stenosis (AVS). If untreated, congenital AVS
results in progressive left ventricular hypertrophy and ultimately heart failure. Severe congenital AVS is treated
with surgical or catheter-based valve intervention or replacement. Accordingly, there is a critical need for
pharmacologic therapies for AVS that will obviate the need for surgical intervention. We were the first to discover
that pathogenic variants in NOTCH1 were associated with BAV and AVS in humans, and we subsequently found
that Notch1 signaling is critical for heart valve development in murine models. Furthermore, our prior publications
have demonstrated a genetic and molecular link between Notch1 and nitric oxide (NO) signaling. We and others
also found pathogenic variation in GATA5, a zinc finger transcription factor, was associated with BAV in humans.
Interestingly, Gata5-null mice display BAV and decreased expression of Nos3 and Notch signaling in the
embryonic heart. These findings support the prevailing view about the critical roles of NOTCH1, GATA5, and
NOS3 in the pathogenesis of human BAV and congenital AVS. We recently generated Notch1 and Gata5
compound mutant mice (Notch1+/-;Gata5-/-); these mice display highly penetrant congenital AVS and survive to
adulthood with progressive aortic valve stenosis. This exciting, new murine model recapitulates the human
disease condition and will allow us to decipher the mechanisms of disease development and progression. The
long-term goal of this research is to understand how molecular pathways regulated by NOTCH1, GATA5, and
NOS3 in the aortic valve can be manipulated to treat congenital AVS and progressive valve stenosis. The
objectives are to utilize this new highly penetrant and clinically relevant congenital AVS mouse model for the
discovery and testing of mechanism-based pharmacologic therapies. We will achieve this in the following aims:
Specific Aim 1. To define the cell-type specific molecular pathways underlying development of
congenital AVS using the Notch1;Gata5 compound mutant mouse model. Specific Aim 2. To determine the
cellular and molecular mechanisms for disease progression in congenital AVS using the Notch1;Gata5 mutant
mouse model. Specific Aim 3. To test novel therapeutics for congenital AVS and stenotic disease progression."

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which somatic genes are mono-allelically expressed
depending on their parental origin. Imprinted genes play critical roles in prenatal and postnatal development,
including growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment. Thus, genomic imprinting is essential for organismal
viability, and disrupted imprinting frequently results in human disease. Imprinted genes are abundantly
expressed in the brain; however, investigation into their regulatory mechanisms and physiological significance
in the brain has been limited. Emerging evidence suggests that chromatin structure at imprinted domains may
differ between the two parental alleles, implying a mechanistical model where differential chromatin structures
may confer allele-specific regulatory roles. Nevertheless, the exploration of the impact of allele-specific chromatin
structure on imprinted gene regulation is still in its early stages. The Mest-Copg2 imprinted domain, located on
mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 7, presents a neuron-specific imprinting pattern and is
associated with developmental and postnatal growth defects and atypical maternal behavior. In preliminary data,
striking differences in parental chromatin structures at the Mest-Copg2 domain were observed. Yet, the extent
to which chromatin structures play a role in imprinted expression of Mest-Copg2 remains entirely uncharted.
Thus, this proposed research delves into the regulatory mechanism and functional role of the Mest-Copg2
domain. The focus of Aim 1 will be elucidating how allelic chromatin structures are established in the Mest-
Copg2 domain. Epigenetic perturbation tools will be used to establish what are the basis of allelic chromatin
structures in this domain. Aim 2 will identify cis-regulatory elements modulating Mest-Copg2 imprinted
expression. CRISPRi experiments will be conducted in hybrid primary neurons to validate the activities of cis-
regulatory elements in mediating imprinted Mest-Copg2 expression. In Aim 3, the physiological implication of
neuron specific Copg2 imprinting will be investigated to provide insights into the role of genomic imprinting in
neurons. These results will provide a novel regulatory mechanism mediated by chromatin structure, as well as
functional implication of genomic imprinting in the Mest-Copg2 domain. The Harvard University will provide a
vibrant research atmosphere with ample opportunities for inter- and intradepartmental collaborations. This
environment, coupled with the guidance of Dr. Whipple and Dr. Dulac, will provide valuable training opportunities
to develop scientific and professional skills necessary for becoming an independent researcher."

The International Conference on Gram-Positive Pathogens (ICGPP) brings together scientists at all stages of
their careers to exchange ideas and research strategies stemming from shared interests in gram-positive
pathogens. This conference, initially held in 2006 and then continued in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018,
and 2022 because of participant enthusiasm, grew out of collaborations between investigators at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center and other academic institutions in the great plains region of the United States. The
overarching benefit of ICGPP is the opportunity for investigators to share the science, approaches, and protocols
that are unique to gram-positive bacteria in contrast to gram-negative bacteria. While gram-positive pathogens
cause a myriad of infections, ranging from antibiotic-associated colitis to necrotizing fasciitis, fundamental
aspects of biological function such as protein secretion across single membranes, cell wall biosynthesis and
protein anchoring, and cell-cell communication are shared between this group of medically important bacteria.
The impact of gram-positive infections continues to grow, and antibiotic resistance remains a significant threat.
As an example, Clostridioides difficile enterocolitis, once primarily associated with antibiotic use in hospitals, is
now found in young, healthy adults that do not have an epidemiological relationship to a healthcare facility.
Recent data suggests that infections caused by C. difficile are the leading cause of mortality among antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in the US. In addition, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-
MRSA) strain USA300 continues to cause skin and soft tissue infections in schools, locker rooms, and hospitals
in otherwise healthy individuals. This R13 application is requesting funds to support the 9th ICGPP to be held
October 13 -16, 2024 in Omaha, Nebraska. Our diverse organizing and scientific committees comprise twelve
principal investigators from various academic institutions representing the full range of medically relevant gram-
positive bacteria. Although other meetings exist in the US that cover various aspects of bacterial pathogenesis
or prokaryotic biology, this is the only meeting focused specifically on gram-positive pathogenesis and biology,
and which provides a collegial and supportive environment that fosters interactions between established
investigators and junior scientists. Young scientists have the option of presenting their research in either poster
or oral format and, in 2022, out of the 31 non-keynote speakers, 16 trainees and 6 Assistant Professors gave
oral research presentations. Four internationally known scientists have already agreed to give keynote
presentations at the 2022 ICGPP: Drs. John-Demian Sauer (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Jodi Lindsay
(University of London), Bas Surewaard (University of Calgary) and Kumaran Ramamurthi (NIH). To keep
registration fees low for participants and to encourage the engagement of young investigators, we request funds
to support travel of our keynote speakers and for 20 travel grants that will be awarded to trainees."

acquire research instrumentation and technologies to enhance the research capacity of the existing Cores and
thereby increase research quality and productivity at MSU; (2) revamp current management structures and
institute cost recovery systems to further institutionalize the resources and engender long-term sustainability;
and (3) facilitate collaborations between researchers across disciplines and institutions with a view of promoting
impactful team science. Under the proposed scope, instrumentation will be purchased to meet the needs of the
three proposed RCMI projects, planned pilot projects, and other research projects at the university. New
equipment for genomics and genetics analyses will support the proposed basic biomedical research project and
the behavioral research project. The current cell analysis capabilities will be expanded with the acquisition of a
benchtop flow cytometer capable of multiplex fluorophores to support the behavioral research project, pilot
projects, and ongoing projects on cancer and cell biology. Data analysis and archiving will be expanded with the
purchase of computers and relevant software to allow HIPAA-compliant informatics to meet the needs of the
behavioral research project and clinical project. The RCC will strengthen core laboratory management practices
by implementing new laboratory management software and drawing on more faculty expertise. A sustainability
plan will include cost-recovery efforts and continued institutionalization of some RCC functions. The BBSU will
promote the use of national data such as All of Us data and promote engagement with the NIH Clinical and
Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) programs. In collaboration with the Investigator Development Core and
Community Engagement Core, the RCC will support pilot and community-based projects. The RCC will also
engage the Baltimore community in education, research, and disseminate current scientific advances related to
healthy urban communities through the Community Engagement Core. The RCC will incorporate evaluation
feedback on an ongoing basis. In sum, these objectives will increase health disparities research output as
measured by research publications, grant awards, and the training of students."
11002066,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Investigator Development Core
The RCMI@Morgan has established an Investigator Development Core (IDC) that focuses on providing junior-
level faculty and postdoctoral fellow investigators with the research resources and training needed to catalyze
the scientific growth and professional development of early-stage investigators (ESI) and facilitate their transition
to independent biomedical researchers. The IDC will implement strategic initiatives including an effective Pilot
Project Program, a Summer Research Partnership Program, hands-on grant writing workshops, grant and
manuscript writing support, and a variety of activities to help network investigators with multi-disciplinary
professional communities and mentors. The proposed activities are widely recognized as the best practices in
research infrastructure enhancement and ESI career development. An innovative aspect of our approach is to
foster interdisciplinary conversation and collaboration between social/behavioral scientists and basic biomedical
science researchers in STEM disciplines as well as translational researchers. Our aims are designed to equip
Morgan State’s investigators with what they need to become successful, technology transfer-minded, funded,
and productive biomedical and behavioral health investigators who will advance their research careers in areas
related to minority heath and health disparities. Our Aims are 1. To administer an effective Pilot Project Program
designed to jump start research projects including potential technology transfer projects that will result in
externally funded research grants (K Series, SuRE, R21, R01, etc.) As such, the IDC will continue to promote
and implement our program for soliciting, receiving, reviewing, and funding pilot grant proposals that focus on
research related to diseases and conditions that disproportionately impact minority and under-represented
populations. 2. To build on our infrastructure to support investigators’ efforts to establish robust academic
research careers, with special emphasis on ESI. Under this Aim, the IDC will administer hands-on grant writing
workshops for new investigators and investigators new to NIH research, provide early-stage investigators with a
structured mentoring relationship, including post-review support, to help them build their networks of colleagues
and research collaborators, support a Summer Research Partnership Program with faculty at research-intensive
regional institutions, and continue to network with MSU’s Office of Research Administration to help devise
protocols and procedures to facilitate the grant and patent submission process at MSU. 3. To build on and
maintain “Communities of Research” for biomedical and behavioral health researchers at MSU and with partner
institutions. The IDC will foster interdisciplinary collaborations among MSU investigators as well as collaborations
with investigators at research-partner institutions, including other RCMI institutions, through health disparities
colloquia and mixers, annual health disparities mini-symposia and conferences, and conduct interdisciplinary
scientific writing accountability groups (SWAGs) to support investigators’ efforts to develop peer-reviewed
articles that are published in high-impact journals."
11002067,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Community Engagement Core
Morgan CARES (MC) is designed to be a vibrant learning community that supports community-campus
collaborations from inception through implementation and the dissemination of projects that address health
disparities, by providing supportive services and access to a strong infrastructure. Through the continuation of
this program we hope to 1) maintain and further expand to include the local Latino community in the Morgan
CARES learning community where members of the community and academia exchange their knowledge and
resources, and work toward achieving a dual mission of eliminating health disparities and producing new
generalizable knowledge; 2) further enhance the capacity for conducting and sustaining CBPR projects by
adding a clinical component for practitioner research as well as the provision of training, mentoring, and technical
assistance to students, junior investigators, and partner community members; and 3) facilitate the
communication and dissemination and translation of research findings into effective community-owned services
and interventions both locally and internationally. MC is housed in a renovated historical building in an
underserved neighborhood of East Baltimore. The facility serves as a hub for community and academic
partnerships to produce high-quality, community-led projects that contribute to the understanding of health
disparity issues and promote health equity. Furthermore, the facility serves as a physically accessible space for
creating a dynamic learning community where community and academic members network, share knowledge
and resources, and work toward eliminating health disparities while producing new generalizable knowledge.
MC also provides a wide range of free services including office space for meetings, a kitchenette, a space for
Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) projects that involve youth, and access to computers and
printers for community use. Partnerships are formed and strengthened through research training, technical
support, workshops, classes, and community events and activities."
11006684,"This SBIR Phase I project will develop and characterize components for an ‘in-the-field’ test strip to detect
chemical pollutants in drinking water.
The US Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) establishes the methods and frequency of water monitoring for
drinking water procurement. Currently >90 contaminants (microorganisms, disinfectants and byproducts,
inorganic and organic chemicals, radionuclides) are mandated for measurement and another 80 are under
active investigation for future inclusion. However, just on the chemical side, 100,000 “contaminants of
emerging concern” (CECs) have been identified. To broaden monitoring to all chemical CECs, some water
authorities have started using ‘BioAssays’ as a chemically-agnostic survey for water samples that contain
CECs at levels affecting the activity of CEC-Sensors built into each cell-based BioAssay. There are time and
cost disadvantages for shipping water samples to central facilities that have the instrumentation and personnel
infrastructure needed to conduct each BioAssay measurement. Each water sample also must be tested
against multiple, distinct cell-based BioAssays which further impedes the economics of BioAssay monitoring.
We propose to develop a hand-held, BioAssay-like CEC-Sensor ‘Strip’. By the end of Phase II, a 1 x 1.5 cm
Detection Strip printed with 20 physiologically relevant Sensor proteins and captured by smart phone, would
permit field determination of water samples containing CECs at concentrations affecting Sensor activity.
Although the chemical identity of any contaminant would not be known, the unique activity signature across 20
Sensor proteins, and the field-accessible low-cost product, would permit the rapid tracking of a chemically
unknown contaminant to its source. Such a product would have a far-reaching ENVORNMENTAL IMPACT.
Phase I will define the TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY of the Sensor Strip approach. A common detection protocol
will be optimized for two pilot Nuclear Receptors Sensors of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) of high
concern. Go/No Go milestones will be based on Receptor activation at the lowest concentration of natural
Receptor ligands normally present in the body; Thus, EDCs at physiologically meaningful levels, or less, will be
detectable. The Receptors chosen include one now used by the CA State Water Resources Control Board for
cell-based BioAssay monitoring, which will allow comparison of the in-field product with current practices.
The in vitro detection method developed in Phase I will be generalizable to all Nuclear Receptors. If Phase I
sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility milestones are achieved, Phase II will have a technical emphasis on
expanding reliable, sensitive EDC detection to 20 Nuclear Receptor targets for different EDC classes. Strip
printing, stability and storage, and the smart phone-based quantitative capture by in-the-field users also would
be deliverables for Phase II. Overall, Phase I will create a method that, by the end of Phase II, will achieve a
product to submit to the EPA’s Drinking Water Alternate Test Procedure Program for wide-spread use."

Dr. Cirrincione will gain expertise in conducting mechanistic, clinical pharmacology studies in transgender adults. Data generated from this proposal will be used to advance clinical strategies to overcome changes in drug safety and efficacy in transgender adults and to increase available in vivo mechanistic data to establish the role of sex hormones on pathways of drug disposition."
11006886,"Project Summary
 Pharmaceuticals and various industrial chemicals undergo comprehensive toxicological assessment in
order to safeguard human health. Genetic toxicology is a key component of this risk assessment. This testing
evaluates chemicals for their potential to damage DNA, an integral factor in the development of cancer and
other diseases. For decades, in vivo assays have guided genotoxic risk assessment due to their ability to
mirror physiological responses in humans. Their endogenous metabolism provides the enzymatic activation
necessary for generating genotoxic intermediates, many of which are difficult to detect with in vitro assays.
Additionally, their complete organ systems provide the structure for identifying organ specific genotoxicity,
especially effects in liver and blood. Leading in vivo assays include the mammalian micronucleus assay, comet
assay, chromosomal aberration assays, and rodent-based mutational assays. While these have served as a
pillar of genotoxic risk assessment, regulatory agencies worldwide have begun to restrict and even eliminate
the use of animals in toxicology research. This significant shift in risk assessment has left the field of genetic
toxicology in need of a non-animal, metabolically-active systems that effectively models genotoxic risk in
humans. In vitro assays provide initial insight into genotoxic risk, but many lack endogenous metabolic
activation or only focus on individual cell types/organs. We will address the pressing need for an effective in
vitro genotoxicity assay through our development of a comprehensive hen’s egg model for genotoxic analysis.
The hen’s egg is a unique system in that it is not considered an animal model due to deficiencies in brain
activity and pain perception early in development. Yet, similar to in vivo models, the hen’s egg has endogenous
metabolic activity and functioning hepatic and hemopoietic organ systems. We will leverage these features to
develop an assay that simultaneously evaluates genotoxicity in the blood and liver. Our utilization of flow
cytometry and high content imaging will automate micronuclei quantification in the erythrocytes and
hepatocytes. Furthermore, we will incorporate the assessment of genotoxic and cytotoxic biomarkers,
providing valuable insight into organ specific toxicity and genotoxic mode of action. The development,
optimization and validation of our hen’s egg genotoxicity assay will meet the critical need for an accurate,
metabolically-active in vitro genotoxicity assay, while fulfilling upcoming regulatory requirements."
11006411,"Abstract – Medication non-adherence is a persistent public health problem that impacts many patient
populations and causes all stakeholders—patients, families, pharmacies, pharmaceutical developers, doctors,
and insurers—to lose. It contributes to 45% of treatment failures, 700,000 annual hospitalizations, and one death
every 19 minutes, making it responsible for $100B in preventable medical costs per year. Medication non-
adherence occurs across diverse care settings, including in increasingly utilized (Covid and post-Covid) home-
based acute care and post-acute care programs. For example, a study of 50 patients at a Hospital at-Home
program found nine potential adverse drug events related to unintentional medication non-adherence. Similarly,
therapeutics have been kept off the market due to non-adherence during clinical trials, resulting in erroneous
conclusions. Many device- and app-based technologies have repeatedly failed due to the high cost and high
level of interaction required on the part of the patient or caregiver. To address the need for a cost-effective,
usable/deployable/scalable, and highly versatile solution for real-time adherence detection at the point
of care, Insightfil is developing a novel disease and medication-form agnostic technology platform using
Near-Field-Communication (NFC) tags to measure medication adherence and reduce non-adherence in
home-based settings with minimal need for technological interaction. Low-cost, disposable NFC tags are
attached to a variety of medication packages for automatic detection of the package opening, allowing the
moment of pill-taking to be captured via an accompanying smartphone application and entered into the patient
record without the need to optically capture information. In addition, the app delivers real-time, personalized,
context-sensitive notifications to encourage medication adherence to the patient’s care plan. Our Phase I pilot
study of an early prototype demonstrated that medication adherence improved from 64% to >95% with the use
of Insightfil technology which was maintained over 18 months. In Phase II, Insightfil will collaborate with UMass
Chan Medical School’s innovative Program in Digital Medicine to develop an NFC-enabled native app (Aim 1),
optimize the app based on iterative user-testing (Aim 2), and rigorously demonstrate acceptability and fidelity
(Aim 3) of the technology in home-based acute care, post-acute care, and outpatient settings The proposed aims
will advance Insightfil’s technology toward commercialization and adoption by demonstrating its utility to increase
adherence and improve patient outcomes across a variety of care settings and empirically and quantitatively
demonstrate the usability and accessibility of the platform. These key technical demonstrations will be leveraged
to fund a type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, evaluating the technologies’ efficacy and
implementation within clinical workflow in preparation for commercial launch."

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 11% of children and adolescents, leading
to impairments in cognitive functions and decreased academic performance. Cognitive training presents a
promising non-pharmaceutical intervention for ADHD, although the benefits often exhibit limited transfer to
real-world tasks. This study aims to address this gap by testing a virtual reality (VR) cognitive training approach
called NeuroTrainer, which integrates physical activity, prolonged training near performance threshold, and
variability in task dynamics and demands. These factors are shown to be key for transfer success in diverse
populations. VR technology provides immersive, ecologically valid, and physically engaging environments that
motivate and engage students' attention.
Preliminary testing of NeuroTrainer has shown feasibility in school-based settings and potential efficacy for
students at risk for ADHD. The current proposal seeks to develop a commercially viable VR cognitive training
intervention for students with ADHD and aligned with National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) strategies and
funding topics. The study will focus on improving attentional and executive control function (Aim 1), evaluating
efficacy of NeuroTrainer to engage the target of ADHD inattention symptoms (Aim 2), and demonstrate transfer
of skill with improvement in academic behaviors (Aim 3) within a sample of 155 students in school settings.
The primary outcome measures are effect sizes for attentional and executive control function, clinical
inattention symptoms, and academic behaviors (classroom engagement and attentiveness) in both ADHD and
non-ADHD groups. By leveraging VR technology, this study aims to contribute to the development of an
innovative, accessible, and effective intervention for ADHD students and a supplementary tool for others, with
potential for broad dissemination and applicability in diverse contexts."
11006856,"ABSTRACT
The technical challenges faced by pediatric cardiovascular physicians (surgeons and interventionalists alike)
have long been ignored, forcing them to use devices designed for adults and different conditions to treat ailing
babies with very specific anatomical considerations. One such case is in the sustained opening of the ductus
arteriosus, a natural conduit that exists in all newborns but closes shortly after birth. In certain congenital heart
defects, it is crucial to maintain ductus patency for the newborn to survive without surgical intervention. There is
no ductus arteriosus stent commercially available in the US. Pediatric interventional cardiologists currently
repurpose adult stents for the ductus, and all-cause ductus reintervention is 47%. The alternative is open-chest
surgery on a neonate to place a shunt that carries a 13% risk of morbidity and 7% risk of mortality, even in the
United States. Starlight Cardiovascular has created a ductus arteriosus stent that is specifically designed to
address the challenges facing treating physicians, including a right-sized delivery system, end-to-end coverage
of the ductus, navigation and deployment through tortuous ductus anatomy, and precise placement to avoid
stent protrusion into the aorta and pulmonary arteries. A stent designed and tested specifically for this purpose
has the potential to decrease reinterventions, morbidity, and potentially mortality for babies with ductal-
dependent circulation. The feasibility of the innovative stent system designed for pediatric applications using
self-expanding technology has been demonstrated, and a Phase II SBIR is underway to complete the formal
preclinical testing of the device. This CRP SBIR application proposes finalizing the manufacturing processes,
manufacturing devices for clinical use, and obtaining Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from FDA
to begin a clinical trial. This CRP project will enable Starlight to move into clinical testing for its ductus arteriosus
stent system. If the trial is successful, Starlight Cardiovascular will seek FDA approval and commercialization of
the first ductus arteriosus stent in the United States."
11008373,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is growing recognition that extracellular vesicles (EVs)¾micrometer- or nanometer-sized lipid
particles containing protein and nucleic acid cargoes (information)¾are highly promising for new
diagnostics/prognostics and experimental therapies. There is, however, a key unmet need for technical
platforms able to solve a fundamental problem confounding the exploitation of EV information in biology and
medicine. That is, because EV populations are naturally complex and thus heterogeneous, it can be
challenging to detect and characterize unique subpopulations-of-interest present only at low abundance in a
sample containing other (normal) EVs from, e.g., a host. In this Phase I project, we will apply a novel
technology platform designed to address the problem of resolving multiple EV subpopulations at the single-
particle level by directly identifying specific surface proteins of dispersed particles, through rapid highly-
multiplexed fluorescence imaging analysis We have chosen to focus on analyzing medically important
categories of EVs called exosomes (here from human cancer cells) and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs; from
bacterial cells). Our goal ultimately is to develop a unique imaging platform for the high-content, high-
throughput analysis of the surface proteins of single exosomes or OMVs present in clinically relevant
specimens.
 Briefly, our innovative platform will simultaneously analyze, in one pass, up to 10 known or potential
exosome/OMV surface markers in up to 107 dispersed particles obtained from a biofluid such as blood, saliva,
or stool. Unlike conventional methods, our platform can rapidly: a) analyze diverse EVs; b) simultaneously read
multiple protein surface markers (cargoes) and thus detect subpopulations-of-interest; c) read single particle
protein surface cargoes, greatly raising information yield compared to typical bulk methods producing pooled
cargo data; and d) identify exosome/OMV subpopulations based on unique combinations of biomarkers from
points a-c. We propose three stepwise aims in development of a highly multiplexed, high throughput platform
for nano-scale EV detection: (1) construction of the instrument based on an existing high speed hyperspectral
designed specifically for cells and tissue sections; (2) testing and calibration of the platform using fluorescent
nanoparticles and fluorescently labeled liposomes; and (3) application of the platform to detecting exosomes
from human cancer cell lines or OMVs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (represented by E. coli
and S. aureus, respectively).
 We anticipate that our platform could become a new tool for EV research; a new diagnostic/prognostic tool
for studying and managing pathologies in which EV analysis is clinically informative; and a novel method for
monitoring normal or aberrant microbiome status."

11004542,"Summary
Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. There are
nearly 3 million poisonings per year resulting in three hundred thousand deaths. OPs bind to acetylcholinesterase
(AChE), rendering the enzyme incapable of hydrolyzing acetylcholine (ACh) in the cholinergic synapses and
neuromuscular junctions. Subsequent accumulation of ACh leads to overstimulation of the affected neurons
acting through muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Some of the adverse effects of pesticides on non-target
organisms such as fish, amphibians and humans have also occurred as a result of biomagnifications of the toxic
compounds. Since AChE is a very well-studied target, the likelihood of finding further new inhibitors amongst
well-known drugs and molecules is likely unlikely and therefore we need to look further afield and do this in a
more efficient manner. Computational approaches such as machine learning are an approach that can be used
to learn from diverse literature to enable virtual screening. Following our preliminary work generating Bayesian
models for human AChE we have performed a high throughput screen of 2431 compounds and identified 66
compounds that were “active” against eel AChE. We recently completed a phase I SBIR in which we expanded
the use of these machine learning models to curate additional AChE data, built and validated AChE models with
many algorithms in parallel and used them to identify AChE inhibitors from various species to predict OP induced
poisoning and possible threats to the environment. In addition, we have recently curated further literature data
and generated models for the closely related enzyme BChE using a contrastive learning algorithm approach to
score a library of 5 million molecules from various vendors in order to select molecules for testing and have
identified several novel selective inhibitors. In Phase II we will develop the MegaAChE software product further
for prediction of AChE inhibition and incorporate uncertainly prediction features and new algorithms such as
large language models. We will also use this software to design and develop AChE reactivators that could
provide a new treatment for OP pesticide and nerve agent exposure. We now propose the following aims to
further develop and validate the MegaAChE software as a commercial product:
Aim 1: Modeling uncertainty in AChE models
Aim 2: Large language models for AChE and BChE datasets
Aim 3: Develop new reactivators to treat AChE poisoning using generative design
Our ultimate goal will be to provide software and models to predict AChE inhibition which will be a commercial
product. In addition we will develop new molecule intellectual property which we can then license to a larger
company. Computational models for AChE therefore have beneficial dual-use potential both for identifying
molecules that could have environmental or human toxicity, while alternatively such machine learning models
could also help us identify molecules with therapeutic utility for Alzheimer’s disease or as treatments for
poisoning."
10983476,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common disorder that causes inflammation predominantly in the digestive
tract. Although treatment options have expanded in the past two decades, a significant portion of patients still
suffer from poor treatment response and chronic clinical courses. Various responses to currently available
therapy are in part due to the heterogeneity of pathogenesis, and novel mechanistic insight that could lead to
new therapeutic options is critically needed. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are a heterogeneous
group of tissue-resident lymphocytes, and pathological activation of IELs is implicated in the exacerbation of IBD.
However, the regulatory mechanisms of IELs during activation are not well understood. Aiolos, a transcription
factor encoded by Ikzf3, is expressed exclusively in lymphocytes, and contributes to B cell activation and NK cell
maturation. Aiolos mutations are implicated in various autoimmune diseases including IBD, but the roles of Aiolos
in IELs or gut homeostasis have not been studied in the past. I discovered that Aiolos is highly expressed in IELs
and that Aiolos-deficient IELs are more activated and express higher levels of activation markers (NK receptors)
and cytokines (interferon-g and granzymes) compared to wild-type cells. These preliminary results indicate
that Aiolos strongly suppresses IEL activation. Since Aiolos is a transcription factor modulating chromatin
remodeling, I hypothesize that Aiolos binds to the enhancer regions of genes associated with IEL activation and
controls their expression by altering epigenetic modifications. Additionally, since Aiolos potently regulates IEL
activation, I hypothesize that Aiolos-deficient IELs modulate the host response to colitogenic infection and
intestinal inflammation. In this proposed project, I will address these hypotheses with the following aims: (Aim
1) to identify Aiolos binding sites and define the contribution of Aiolos to epigenetic landscape in IELs, and (Aim
2) to investigate the impact of Aiolos-deficient IELs during mucosal inflammation. In Aim 1, I will utilize state-of-
the-art epigenetic techniques to examine Aiolos binding sites in wild-type IELs and investigate how Aiolos
deficiency alters epigenetic modifications in IELs. I plan to examine differences of epigenetic modifications
between Aiolos-deficient IELs and wild-type IELs by comparing open chromatin regions and histone
modifications. In Aim 2, I will challenge mice with Aiolos-deficient IELs and mice with wild-type IELs with
Salmonella typhimurium and dextran sodium salt-induced colitis to delineate the impact of Aiolos-deficient IELs
on host responses to intestinal infection and inflammation. Taken together, this project will contribute to profiling
cis-regulatory circuits of IELs and could advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, which could
eventually lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets."
10986772,"PROJECT SUMMARY FOR THE PREDICATE GRANT. Opioids are the most prescribed drug in US hospitals,
and opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a widespread and life-threatening problem. Episodes of
OIRD on the general hospital floor are common, occurring in up to 46% of patients. Despite the prevalence of
this problem, OIRD has yet to be effectively addressed through monitoring technology. There is great clinical
need for a wearable sensor capable of detecting the onset and progression of OIRD with actionable alerts, well
before the onset of severe hypoventilation, hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. To meet this clinical need,
RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a wearable, wireless Respiratory Monitoring System (RMS) with an
acoustic Trachea Sound Sensor (TSS) and a software algorithm that continuously measures a person’s
respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV), breathing pattern, duration of apnea,
oxygen saturation, degree of snoring, heart rate (HR), body position, and activity level. The RMS
algorithm calculates a Risk Index Score (RIS) specifically for OIRD every 20 seconds. RTM has received
Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA to develop the RMS for the prevention of an opioid overdose
and death in hospitalized patients, outpatients, and US citizens that chronically use or abuse opioids. RTM plans
to commercialize the RMS first for monitoring hospitalized patients managed with opioids on the general nursing
floors, due to the high incidence of OIRD in these environments and the impracticality of using existing methods
such as pulse oximetry combined with capnography to provide sufficient monitoring for all patients receiving
opioids. Having already demonstrated feasibility of our technology, we are working to optimize the RMS to handle
noisy environments and validate the system in a clinical study. In Phase 1, we will optimize the existing RMS
with dynamic filtering and active noise cancellation software (Phase 1, Aim 1) and conduct a human study using
the optimized RMS to measure the accuracy of RR, TV, and apnea duration in a noisy environment with the
filtering/noise cancellation software turned on, versus turned off (Phase 1, Aim 2). In Phase 2, we will construct
and bench-test functional RMS prior to a human clinical trial (Phase 2, Aim 1), obtain an FDA Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE), and then conduct an observational clinical trial in post-operative surgical patients
managed with fentanyl and other opioids to demonstrate RMS’s ability to detect and predict the onset and
progression of an OIRD event (n = 120 patients) (Phase 2, Aim 2). Together, these steps will accomplish key
development milestones and clinical testing needed for regulatory approval and commercialization of the RMS
device. Successful completion of this project will produce a commercially viable wearable wireless RMS
with the potential to improve the health and safety of patients receiving opioids by accurately detecting
and predicting OIRD with actionable alerts prior to the onset of severe hypoventilation, hypoxemia,
cardiac arrhythmia, and death."

10984289,"Although the pandemic phase of SARS-CoV-2 infections has diminished the disease remains highly
endemic in the US population with current weekly hospitalizations from infection remaining in the thousands and
significant morbidity. Further, there is always the risk that new SARS-CoV-2 variants may arise that are more
transmissible and/or pathogenic. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infections will remain a significant health issue in the
US for the foreseeable future. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely viewed as a respiratory disease there
is substantial evidence that SARS-2-CoV-2 infection is a “vascular disease” caused by endothelial cell uptake of
the virus via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that can affect various organs including the brain. With
regards to the cerebral vasculature, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause coagulopathy and local thrombotic events
in the brain including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. How other cerebral vascular diseases interact with
SARS-CoV-2 infections is poorly understood.
 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common amyloidal form of cerebral small vessel disease of the
elderly that is characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid b-protein (Ab) in blood vessels of the brain.
CAA is also a frequent vascular comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD).
Cerebral vascular accumulation of Aβ can result in perivascular neuroinflammation, cerebral infarction,
microbleeds and intracerebral hemorrhages. Because of these cerebral vascular insults, CAA is a significant
cause of vascular-mediated cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Recently, we generated a novel
transgenic rat model for CAA, designated rTg-D, that recapitulates many of the pathological features of the
disease in humans including cortical and meningeal vascular amyloid, cerebral microbleeds, small vessel
occlusions, and VCID. The rTg-D rat model provides a useful platform for investigating the pathogenesis of CAA
and the impact of comorbidities.
 There are reports in the literature indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection can impact CAA in a highly
detrimental manner promoting hemorrhagic events. Yet despite this link the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
the course of pathology of CAA and other ADRDs remains largely unknown. Thus, the goal of this R21
exploratory proposal is to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the emergence,
progression and severity of CAA in the novel rTg-D transgenic rat model of CAA. To accomplish this goal,
we propose two specific aims. First, we will determine if the SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein accelerates the
emergence and progression CAA and associated pathologies in younger rTg-D rats. Second, we will determine
if the SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein exacerbates CAA associated vasculopathies in aged rTg-D rats. Our studies
will combine quantitative pathological measures and transcriptomic approaches in a novel preclinical model of
CAA to identify key elements of activation pathways that are shared between CAA and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

LabSys’s objective is to create a transformative wearable patch, designed as a low-cost
Continuous Drug Monitoring Device for Opioid Use Disorders (CDM-MOUD). Our state-of-the-art
patch utilizes a microneedle—so fine that it is painless—to monitor medication levels directly
within the interstitial fluid, a technique that has been shown to reliably mirror blood concentrations.
Our proprietary detection method can secure both sensitivity and specificity of the opioids at
concerned concentration range. This approach promises a leap forward in managing OUD by
providing uninterrupted insights into the effectiveness of treatment protocols. In our upcoming
Phase I research, our specific aims focus on engineering an alpha prototype with fentanyl sensing
capability. This initial model will integrate our patented electrochemical sensor technology with
low-power electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, coupled with seamless wireless
communication for real-time data transmission. This endeavor is not just about technology; it's
about people. As we refine our prototype, evaluating critical factors such as accuracy, response
time, and device longevity, we will engage with the potential customers. We will tailor the patch to
the nuanced needs of customers to ensure our product aligns with the real-world demands. Our
vision extends into Phase II, where we will further adapt our prototype for broader clinical use,
pursuing the FDA's “Breakthrough Devices Program” participation to meet rigorous regulatory
standards, and clinical trials to ensure the highest standards of patient safety and product efficacy.
LabSys's mission through this project is to empower individuals battling OUD with discreet,
continuous health monitoring, as essential as a glucose monitor. Our products will empower
patient-centered care, fostering better outcomes and facilitating a more personalized approach to
treatment. We believe that our CDM-MOUD has the potential to revolutionize opioid treatment

 The co-occurrence of substance use and trauma is an urgent health priority. The vast majority of U.S.
adults (89.7%) have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. Individuals with (versus without)
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher rates of problematic drug and alcohol use, and individuals with
co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders have greater functional impairment, more severe PTSD
symptoms, and worse substance use outcomes relative to individuals with either disorder alone. Yet, work
focusing on mechanisms which underlie this co-occurrence has been limited in its use of retrospective, self-
report designs. Emotional processes may be especially potent predictors of substance use among trauma-
exposed individuals. Given that emotions and substance use each tend to fluctuate widely across contexts and
over time, they are best captured through methodologies which allow them to be modeled as such. The proposed
project will leverage a combination of subjective (i.e., experience sampling methodology) and objective (i.e.,
physiological indices via biosensor) metrics to explore the role of emotional processes in substance use in the
daily lives of trauma-exposed community adults. This study lays the groundwork for the early detection and
intervention of substance use among trauma-exposed individuals.
 Dr. Schick is extremely well-qualified for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award. She is a highly productive NIDA-funded T32 Postdoctoral Fellow in Substance Use Prevention Research
in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. During the training period, Dr. Schick will be
housed within the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, which provides an intellectually
stimulating environment with outstanding resources to ensure the successful achievement of her training plan.
She has assembled a team of mentors who are each nationally known for their research in areas pertinent to
the training plan, which will provide access to world-class expertise in research design, methodology and
analysis. Dr. Schick's program of research focuses on the ways in which intra-individual processes, most notably
emotional processes, influence substance use. Her long-term goals are to be a leader in research aimed at
elucidating emotional processes in substance use among trauma-exposed individuals and to lead an
interdisciplinary research team to develop, test, and disseminate prevention and treatment programs targeting
reduced substance use among trauma-exposed individuals. Continued sponsorship, mentorship, and directed
study will facilitate the development of advanced research skills so Dr. Schick can be at the forefront of cutting-
edge research in these areas. Short-term career objectives focus on (a) developing proficiency in micro-
longitudinal research design, methods, and analysis; (b) enhancing knowledge of autonomic nervous system
functioning and psychophysiological indices of emotional processes; and (c) use of wearable biosensors to
passively collect indices of emotional processes."

 This R03 application aims to create innovative magnetically responsive drug delivery electrospun fibers
to improve regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition
currently affecting approximately 296,000 US citizens, with around 18,000 new cases each year. SCI occurs
when a severe physical force causes compression of the spinal cord, killing neurons and glia at the injury site.
Multiple secondary injury cascades are initiated immediately after the initial insult and lead to additional neuronal
loss. The degree of inflammation that occurs after SCI has been shown to relate to the magnitude and duration
of secondary injury. Depending on the severity of the SCI and the demographics of the patient, the inflammatory
response varies after injury. Biomaterials, such as electrospun fibers, can provide local release of therapeutics
to limit adverse off-target effects; however, drug-releasing biomaterials do not address the variability of patient
inflammation. To provide a means of tailoring the therapeutic delivery to a patient, we propose to fabricate
magnetic, growth factor-loaded coaxial electrospun fibers that can be stimulated non-invasively with a magnetic
field to increase the rate of growth factor release from the fibers.
 Over the past several years, the Gilbert laboratory in collaboration with several other laboratories have
applied superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to astrocyte and neuronal cultures. More recently,
our group has applied SPIONs to polymer systems, creating unique composites where magnetic fields can move
aligned polymer fibers to more successfully direct extending neurites in culture. In collaboration with the Samuel
laboratory, we were able to apply magnetic field stimulation to neurons cultured on scaffolds where SPIONs
were tethered to fibrous scaffolds to stimulate neurite outgrowth. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the
combination of SPIONs with electrospun fibers can create unique drug delivering scaffolds capable of releasing
drugs at precise dosages that are tailored to a patient’s inflammatory response. Our group recently showed that
the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) mitigates astrocyte reactivity in culture.
Loading TGFβ3 into magnetic polymer fibers may allow for on-demand delivery of precise TGFβ3 dosages to
mitigate astrocyte reactivity and more effectively treat an individual’s unique SCI.
 This project is likely to make significant contributions by developing new biomaterials capable of releasing
large therapeutic molecules at precise dosages using an external magnetic field. Furthermore, approaches that
focus on astrocyte phenotype may yield new areas of research where the astrocytes, not extending axons, are
the focus of future treatments for SCI."

Substantial research demonstrates dispositional optimism is related to reduced mortality; fewer studies
evaluate optimism specifically in relation to cognitive health - despite the critical importance of cognitive aging
to healthspan. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a leading cause of death, and with
limited availability of treatment, prevention must be a priority. Given prior work showing optimism is associated
with longevity and is also modifiable, identifying a relationship between optimism and less cognitive decline
and obtaining greater understanding of mechanisms underlying the associations may help to identify new
targets for interventions to improve cognitive aging. We previously identified physical activity as a promising
mediator of optimism's association with longevity but did not find evidence to support posited biological
pathways (e.g., telomere shortening, epigenetic age). Research on physical activity as a pathway linking higher
optimism and cognitive health could provide key details for targeting interventions and demonstrating the full
range of ways optimism may alter health. As prior studies of optimism and physical activity were based on self-
reported activity, findings lack granularity and may not adequately portray activity levels in aging populations.
Also, research on relevant biologic mechanisms linking optimism to better health remains limited; recent
findings linking psychological factors with the gut microbiome suggest this may be a promising pathway.
We will examine the relationship of optimism to traditional long-term cognitive trajectories in 4 cohorts (Aim 1),
focusing on memory as a domain strongly linked to ADRD, as well as associations of optimism with novel, high
frequency testing via smartphones to assess cognition in the “natural environment” among 2500 adults ages
60-69 years in a fifth cohort (Aim 2). Together, this will facilitate fuller understanding of associations of
optimism with cognitive health across middle and older ages. To pursue research on pathways, we will
leverage the mobile app used in Aim 2 to collect intensive physical activity data via accelerometer, to deeply
characterize optimism in relation to physical activity (Aim 3). Finally, we will conduct exploratory analyses of
optimism and the gut microbiome, leveraging existing stool metagenomic data (n=4500) (Aim 4). We will utilize
cohorts with men and women, and multiple diversity groups: Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, Jackson Heart Study, Health and Retirement Study, Nurses' Health Study II
(NHSII). We will rigorously harmonize/co-calibrate the cognitive batteries in Aim 1 to compare findings across
diverse groups represented in the cohorts; we will collect new data only in NHSII (Aims 2, 3). IMPACT: These
Aims, leveraging cohorts spanning both sexes and diverse racial groups, provide new directions for building a
science of psychological resilience in ADRD prevention. Findings will reiterate the value of shifting the focus of
traditional disease paradigms from reducing risks/deficits to enhancing resilience and building strengths."

Rapidly evolving proteins constitute a significant portion of a bacterial proteome. These proteins diverge
substantially from their homologs, frequently change functions and locations of active sites, and therefore are
more challenging to study. Fast-evolving proteins are nevertheless as crucial as conserved ones for our
fundamental understanding of molecular evolution and biomedical applications: pathogenicity factors in bacterial
pathogens typically undergo fast evolution due to arms races between hosts and pathogens.
Revolutionary advancements in computational protein science now facilitate the efficient investigation of fast-
evolving proteins. Advanced artificial intelligence methods such as AlphaFold have produced accurate models
of protein 3D structures, which could revolutionize bioinformatics approaches. Now, instead of relying on
sequence-based homology searches, which frequently fail to find relatives of fast-evolving proteins, we can use
similarity in 3D structures, which tend to be more conserved evolutionarily. Additionally, methods for predicting
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are nearing the accuracy of high-throughput experiments, offering another
approach to gain functional insights to a protein by finding a well-studied interaction partner. The time is ideal to
capitalize on these developments and tackle challenging problems that were previously impossible to address.
In this proposal, I intend to study fast-evolving proteins using state-of-the-art computational methods, followed
by experimental validation. First, I have developed methods to recognize domains from AlphaFold models and
assign them to an evolutionary context for functional inference. I plan to enhance these methods using deep
learning techniques and develop additional methods to predict functional categories. While existing tools are
primarily optimized for conserved protein families with deep sequence alignments and extensive experimental
data, my methods will cater specifically to fast-evolving proteins. Subsequently, I will apply these tools and my
expertise in comparative genomics and PPI modeling to study the fast-evolving and pathogenicity-associated
proteins encoded by the pan-genomes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vpara) strains isolated from human patients.
By determining their evolutionary origins, predicting their interacting partners, and inferring their functions, I aim
to identify a set of uncharacterized and fast-evolving candidate pathogenicity factors (CPFs). Finally, I will select
several promising CPFs and experimentally validate their secretion and interacting partners using medium-
throughput experiments. This preliminary functional characterization will be the initial step toward elucidating the
mechanisms of these novel PFs and will pave the way for future discoveries in my lab and in the field.
This project will allow me to undergo rigorous and multidisciplinary training in cutting-edge computational
methods and experimental techniques that can generate large datasets to complement and validate
computational studies. I expect to contribute to science by sharing my computational tools and analytical results
through a web server and an online database, and by characterizing novel pathogenicity factors in Vpara."

The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei that regulates motor and cognitive functions. Recent
identification of neuronal heterogeneity in the basal ganglia suggests that functionally distinct neural circuits
defined by their molecular identity and efferent projections exist even within the same nuclei. This distinction
may account for a multitude of symptoms associated with basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease
(PD). However, our incomplete understanding of the basal ganglia functional organization has hindered further
investigation of individual circuits that may underlie distinct behavioral symptoms in different disease states.
The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a central basal ganglia nucleus that can influence numerous downstream
regions. While the prevailing circuit model assumes that the GPe is a homogeneous population of neurons
transferring the signal in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, accumulating evidence suggests that neurons
in the GPe are more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Although GPe is known to be a nucleus with
GABAergic neurons, we have identified novel cell types expressing VGLUT2, glutamatergic neuronal marker, at
the outer layer of GPe. In our careful anatomical and molecular examination showed that VGLUT2GPe neurons
project mainly to inner part of GPe, making synaptic contacts onto other neuronal populations. Recent evidence
showed that the distinct cell types in GPe may have different roles in modulating basal ganglia circuitry and
associated behaviors. Thus, elucidating the anatomical and functional organization of VGLUT2GPe neurons will
provide novel cellular and circuit information to understand basal ganglia function.
The progressive nature of behavioral deficits associated with PD is very well documented in human patients.
However, what neural adaptations associated with behavioral deficits at different stages of PD are not fully
understood. In this application, we try to address this with two different animal models. First, as in our preliminary
results and recent reports, we will administer different doses of neurotoxin administration to induce different
degrees of DA neuronal loss, which elicit the different behavioral deficits. Second, we will confirm the neurotoxin-
induced PD-related behaviors in MitoPark mice which show the progressive loss of DA neurons. Examining the
circuit adaptation in two animal models will provide an important information on the neural mechanisms
underlying the progressive nature of PD. Therefore, using cutting-edge techniques including optogenetic, genetic
and viral-mediated manipulation, in vivo multi-unit recording, and so on, we will decipher roles of VGLUT2GPe
neurons in behavioral deficits in these two animal models for PD."

Defects in motor neuron (MN) function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in susceptibility to disease.
There is currently no effective treatment for MN disorders in part due to a lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining
properties. Thus, basic research in model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice is needed to reveal
such mechanisms. MN subtype function is endowed by the differential expression of terminal identity genes.
Such genes encode proteins (e.g., ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, trans-membrane
receptors, adhesion molecules) that are expressed continuously, from the last steps of development through
adulthood, and thereby define the unique functional features of a given MN subtype. Hence, revealing the
molecular mechanisms that induce (during development) and maintain (throughout life) expression of terminal
identity genes will help us understand how MNs become and remain functional, a key goal in the fields of MN
development and disease. A remarkable wealth of terminal identity markers is available for all cholinergic MN
subtypes of the C. elegans nerve cord that control locomotion, providing a unique model system to elucidate
how MNs acquire and maintain their functional features. Leveraging these tools, we discovered that the
conserved Collier/Olf/Ebf-type transcription factor (TF) UNC-3 is required for the continuous function of all
these cholinergic MN subtypes, and that this outcome arises from UNC-3-dependent induction and
maintenance of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. Through unbiased genetic screens, we recently
identified several conserved regulatory factors (6 TFs, 2 chromatin factors) that control the terminal identity of
individual MN subtypes. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that while UNC-3 activates expression of
all MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes, these regulatory factors counteract the activator function of
UNC-3 by repressing UNC-3 targets in specific MN subtypes. These observations suggest a general principle
for the control of MN terminal identity, in which the transcriptional targets of a broadly acting activator (UNC-3)
are repressed in a MN subtype-specific fashion by distinct TFs and chromatin factors. To test this hypothesis
within the 5-year R01 timeframe, this proposal will focus on one TF (BNC-1/mammalian BNC1-2) and one
chromatin factor (PBRM-1/mammalian BAF180) that counteract UNC-3 in different MN subtypes. Specifically,
we seek to: (a) determine whether these two factors are required throughout life to secure subtype identity
(Aim 1), (b) define the mechanism underlying the repressor activity of BNC-1 (Aim 2), and (c) decipher the
function of PBRM-1 by identifying its downstream targets (Aim 3). The proposed experiments will establish a
paradigm for induction and maintenance of MN terminal identity in a genetic model system, which could serve
as a valuable entry point to understand how mammalian MNs become and remain functional."

The diversity of human tissues and cell types is controlled by differential regulation of gene expression. Enhancers
are the primary units of gene expression control in humans, which physically interact with the target genes
to activate them. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, several landmarking consortia
have accumulated large amounts of genomic data. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has revealed tissue-
specific gene expression and transcriptional regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project
has characterized 3D chromatin interactions in many human tissues and cell types. The ENCODE project and
the Roadmap Epigenomic project have profiled tissue-specific epigenomic states and annotated the regulatory
elements accordingly.
 However, our understanding of human transcriptional regulation remains limited. A major challenge in studying
Enhancer-Promoter (E-P) interactions is that enhancers are often located tens to hundreds of kilobases distal to
their target genes, yet must physically interact with their target genes to activate them. Therefore, to understand
gene regulation in human, a necessary first step is to precisely map all E-P interactions. However, current 3D
maps of the human genome remain sparse and noisy and fail to detect the vast majority of E-P interactions. In
addition, the datasets generated from the Common Fund consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue
types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data, resulting in additional barriers for
integrative analysis.
 Here we propose to combine the experimental approach, Region Capture Micro-C, and the deep learning
algorithms to accurately quantify E-P interactions. These results enhance the current 3D maps from 4DN and
ENCODE projects. We also plan to integrate experimental and imputed E-P interactions with NIH Common Fund
data in a knowledge graph. Our knowledge graph will support efficient cross-modality queries, graph visualization,
and customized computational modeling for investigating quantitative rules in transcriptional regulation. Not only
would this accomplishment have an enormous positive impact on the utility and usage of the Common Fund
datasets, but it would also help to promote open science and reproducible research in the areas of computational
genomics and data science."

 Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling regulates cell growth in normal cells and is frequently
overactivated in cancer. Within this pathway, RAF kinases are core signaling nodes and are of particular interest
as cancer drug targets. Despite extensive study, RAF kinase function and regulation remain incompletely
understood. Intriguingly, several studies have shown that the expression of CRAF protein but not CRAF kinase
activity is essential for the growth of KRAS mutant lung cancer. To date, only a handful of function modifying
mutations have been used to study CRAF function in this context, and these are often utilized in vitro or in
exogenous overexpression experiments where stoichiometry is non-physiological and native scaffolding factors
are absent. Interpretation of these experimental results can also be complicated by the modular nature of RAF
dimers, and it is seldom clear which RAF homo-/hetero-dimers are responsible for observed cellular phenotypes.
A clearer understanding of CRAF’s oncogenic role, including homo-/hetero-dimer functions, would inform future
efforts to target CRAF in KRAS-driven cancers via inhibition, targeted degradation, or other mechanisms.
 This proposal will utilize a combination of unbiased base editor scans and “bump-hole” methodologies to
elucidate the role of CRAF in KRAS-driven cancer and understand the relative activity of various RAF dimers.
Specifically, I will test the hypothesis that CRAF’s role in KRAS mutant lung cancer is to form less active
RAF dimers, diminish downstream signaling, and prevent otherwise toxic levels of MAPK signaling.
Confirming this hypothesis has direct implications for cancer therapeutic development and would suggest that
CRAF degraders but not competitive active-site inhibitors would be effective in this tumor subtype.
 This project will also advance fundamental knowledge of RAF kinases and expand the methods used to
study them. In confirming the central hypothesis of this proposal, I will validate the goldilocks premise of RAF
signaling – that too little or too much signaling impedes cancer growth. In aim one, unbiased base editor scanning
paired with rigorous follow-up characterizations will expand knowledge of CRAF’s multiple functions and
interaction partners. In aim two, I will validate a co-mutational approach to reveal the relative contribution of each
RAF dimer to cancer growth and MAPK signaling. This aim also has broad application in cell signaling research
and could constitute a generalizable approach to studying protein homo-/hetero-dimers with conserved
dimerization interfaces.
 While advancing knowledge of RAF biology, this fellowship will also provide a rich training environment
across two cutting edge research institutions: Harvard’s department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Training will include regular meetings with my mentors, seminars with relevant
scientific experts, and opportunities to present my research internally and externally. Mentorship provided by
Brian Liau and Andrew Aguirre will greatly facilitate my development as an independent cancer researcher."

The overall purpose of this SBIR Phase 1 project is the development and test of nucleusRx’s (NRx) Virtual
Care Platform and remote intervention tool targeting post-acute care Heart Failure (HF) patients, providing a
safe and cost-effective discharge transition plan from the hospital to home. HF is the largest common cause for
disease-related hospitalization in the US (estimated 1 million/year) and has a mortality rate of 42% within 5
years of initial diagnosis. An additional 4.1 million emergency visits, 3.4 million hospitalizations, and 231,000
deaths have HF as a comorbid or contributing cause. The economic impacts from heart failure, both direct and
indirect, are estimated to hit $70 billion by 2030. Despite many HF re-hospitalizations being considered
preventable, HF related hospitalizations among older adults and Medicare beneficiaries have the highest
readmission rate of any medical condition.
Currently, there is no remote monitoring platform available in the market providing real-time, 24/7 visibility of
patient’s health and treatment compliance when discharged from the hospital to home after an acute episode
of HF. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends the implementation of the Guideline Directed
Medical Therapy (GDMT) for post-acute HF treatment, which consists of a rapid initiation of four pillar drugs to
treat HF patients during hospitalization, and its continuation at home after discharge. However, over a 12-
month period after initial diagnosis, less than 1% of HF patients in the US receive optimal GDMT doses. There
is also no one fixed agreed guideline of introduction of all GDMT medications for the treatment of HF within 30
days of acute HF hospitalizations, although there is a general consensus of the need to initiate all four pillar
therapies while the patients are in the hospital or during the first week of discharge to home.
Our complete solution, nucleusRx’s Virtual Care Platform, consist of a physical device -a specially designed pill
dispenser and accompanying blood pressure monitor and weight scale- and an interconnected software
platform, all connected to patient’s mobile phone. The platform works in an integrated manner to enable
healthcare providers to implement a safe discharge transition plan from hospital to home, while allowing rapid
GDMT dose optimization remotely with total visibility on patient health status and therapy compliance. In this
project, work is proposed in a short (28 days) clinical feasibility trial to determine the effectiveness of
nucleusRx platform functionalities. HF patients discharged from the hospital will be provided with the device
and access to a patient companion digital app with information on their health and medication compliance,
while doctors and other caregivers will monitor patients’ health status through a specially designed computer
dashboard interface. Clinical assessments, performed as part of the second objective of the project, will help
determine the clinical impact of the Virtual Care Platform by assessing medication compliance and satisfaction
and usability of the platform from the point of view of both patients and providers. Improvement of the software
user interfaces based on feedback and experiences from patients, caregivers and providers, and integration of
the Virtual Care Platform with the major EPIC electronic health record software used in most hospitals are the
final objectives in the project."

Significance. In Africa, AIDS is the leading cause of death among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW).
In 2022, 3100 adolescent girls and young women in Africa were diagnosed with HIV every week. Despite the
availability of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for over a decade and its nearly 100% effectiveness,
daily oral PrEP uptake and persistence have been inadequate, especially among AGYW in Africa. New PrEP
modalities, such as long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA), have shown promising results in clinical trials
by significantly reducing the risk of HIV compared to daily oral PrEP. Beyond data from controlled trials or
preference-based studies using hypothetical scenarios as they were conducted when CAB-LA was unavailable
to participants, we know little about implementing CAB-LA in real-world settings in Africa. In 2024, Zambia will
be among the first countries to introduce CAB-LA within their national HIV program, and the Ministry of Health
(MOH) selected the University of Maryland Baltimore and Ciheb-Zambia to support its implementation.
Research plan. This is a prime and time-sensitive moment to assess CAB-LA's early implementation
determinants and outcomes in a real-world setting using a rigorous approach grounded in implementation
science to optimize the impact of CAB-LA and prevent HIV acquisition. The proposed study, Scaling
Comprehensive Access to Long-acting for Equitable and Effective Use of PrEP (SCALE-UP), aims to assess
in real-time and comprehensively the first-ever implementation of CAB-LA among AGYW who are most at-risk
for HIV acquisition in real-world settings in Zambia. Aims: (1) Assess implementation determinants of CAB-LA
guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Using qualitative methods, we
will assess multi-level barriers and enablers to CAB-LA implementation encountered by adolescent girls and
young women, healthcare providers, and peer mentors; (2) evaluate the early effects of CAB-LA on
implementation outcomes and clinical outcomes using the RE-AIM framework. We hypothesize that adolescent
girls and young women using CAB-LA will have higher PrEP persistence than daily oral PrEP users at months
three and six. Team: The research team, led by Multiple Principal Investigators (MPI), has expertise in
implementation science, HIV clinical care, epidemiology, qualitative and quantitative research, and has a deep
knowledge of HIV response and service delivery models in Zambia for priority populations, including AGYW. In
addition, the study team will work collaboratively with study advisory panels with representation from youth,
healthcare providers, MOH, and PEPFAR/CDC as partners to inform, refine, and prioritize implementation
strategies to optimize CAB-LA implementation. Impact: The proposed study has the potential to not only
accelerate the implementation and scale-up of CAB-LA in Zambia but also provide a blueprint for other African
countries that will follow in Zambia's footsteps. This is crucial for optimizing HIV prevention continuum and
ending the HIV epidemic in Africa."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related neurodegenerative disease and dementia.
Despite its prevalence and deliberating health consequence, early diagnosis of AD is a serious unmet need.
The current proposal seeks to develop a behavior biomarker that differentiates AD from a normal ageing
process.
The project proposes to develop an automated rodent behavior testing system for non-invasively assessing the
early AD, based on strong evidence from AD imaging studies and neurophysiology research on a specific type
of innate defensive behavior across a variety of species.
The midbrain structure governing the sensorimotor computation of looming stimuli can trigger defensive
behaviors, such as freezing and escape, in rodents. Interestingly, a number of clinical studies have shown that
the midbrain region is affected very early in AD. Taking the findings from the two areas together, it is
conceivable that the defensive behaviors triggered by looming stimuli can serve as a biomarker for early AD.
MPI Drs. Chen and Luo’s preliminary study with AD mice has provided a proof of concept. In this SBIR grant,
we propose to develop an automated defensive behavior testing system, and conduct rigorous studies to show
the association between AD pathology and defensive behaviors. We believe the system can help accelerate
AD research, by providing a novel assessment of early AD and saving cost."

The HIV epidemic has changed dramatically since the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which substantially increased the life expectancy of people with HIV (PWH). As ART regimens and health care
for PWH continue to improve, the population of PWH in North America and Europe is aging. As the treatment
landscape changes, it is important to provide up-to-date data on prognosis for PWH in the modern ART era
and compare effectiveness of modern ART regimens. Large datasets are required to study important
subgroups of PWH. The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) is the largest collaboration of
HIV cohorts across North America and Europe, with 20 HIV cohorts and data on around 250,000 PWH on
ART. ART-CC pioneered standardized coding of causes of death in treated PWH and has classified causes of
death for 16,832 PWH. ART-CC has fostered a collaborative approach to research and enabled researchers
across the globe to utilize its data and methodological expertise.
Approaches to analyzing data from HIV cohort collaborations have evolved with increasing awareness of the
need to protect participants’ privacy, international data protection laws, and wide use of data use agreements
to govern data transfers. We will develop a new secure data platform that enables international ART-CC
collaborators and external researchers to conduct secure, privacy-protecting analyses of pseudonymized ART-
CC data using reproducible, shared code. data will be accessed in a controlled environment, with export of
analysis results requiring approval from trained output checkers. This platform will facilitate a distributed
collaborative model in which researchers from any contributing cohort, as well as verified external researchers,
can conduct analyses, whilst participating cohorts retain ownership of their data.
Research within the secure platform will incorporate 3 aims. 1) Enhance the understanding of cause-specific
mortality and cause-specific hospitalizations among PWH, building on ART-CC’s world-leading data on causes
of death among PWH and extending these methods to causes of hospitalization. 2) Enhance understanding of
prognosis for all-cause mortality in under-studied groups of PWH, such as transgender PWH and PWH starting
ART aged ≥60. 3) Estimate the comparative effectiveness of novel ART regimens versus older, more
commonly used regimens and of GLP-1 agonists, which are increasingly used to address ART-associated
weight gain in PWH. ART-CC’s large size and geographical heterogeneity will allow analyses to be sex-
stratified and for comparisons between US and non-US cohorts.
In summary, this proposal will develop a data platform to simplify data sharing for HIV cohorts in North America
and Europe, enabling efficient analyses based on open science principles that address high priority research
questions for PWH in the modern ART era."

challenge for ASD research is to establish convergent mechanisms that group apparently distinct genetic
etiologies. We identified a novel point of convergence between the histone-methyltransferase ASH1L, a major
ASD genetic risk factor, and a cluster of ASD high-risk genes (e.g. FOXP1, RIMS1, NRX1a). We also find that
ASH1L counteracts the activity of Polycomb repressor complex in neural development. Hence, our data
uncover a transcriptional and epigenetic node linked to cell and circuit dysfunction underlying ASD phenotypes.
However, the transcriptional programs modulated by ASH1L that lead to neuronal dysfunction are
understudied. Our central hypothesis is that ASH1L counteracts Polycomb activity to orchestrate
neuronal development by modulating transcriptional programs that control synaptic function and
neuronal morphogenesis. We will define how ASH1L regulates neuronal development and function. We will
use a multilevel, synergistic and translational approach that leverages human and mouse systems to
determine how ASH1L modulates neuronal programs relevant to ASD pathogenesis. We are positioned to
undertake this work, based on our robust preliminary data and combined expertise in cellular/molecular
neuroscience, bioinformatic, chromatin biology and electrophysiology. 1) Determine how mutations in ASH1L
disrupt neuronal arborization and function in human stem cell experimental systems, 2) Define functional and
circuit phenotypes associated with ASH1L in rodent systems. 3) Define bulk and cell type specific epigenetic
and transcriptional signatures associated with ASH1L mutations that cause disease in mouse and human
neurons. Finally, we will define rescue strategies for the cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological
phenotypes observed in both mouse and human experimental systems."
10990217,"The long term goal of proposal is the development and testing of new optical technology for
photochemical control of neuronal function. The caged neurotransmitters developed we have
previously made have been widely used by many research groups around the world. An important
feature of our work is that we have forged long-term collaborative relationships with noted
physiologists. These interactions have been vital the development of useful and important caged
compounds as it is the biological problems that define the probes. In this proposal we seek to
address several major gaps in the area of optical chemical methods that are used for
photochemical probing of neuronal function. Namely: multi-color photoactuation is not a
standard technique; caged compounds are not designed for 2-photon excitation a priori.
Photoreversible drugs for “next generation” (opto)pharmacology; genetically targeted
photoswitchable, subunit specific probes to control behavior. The overall goal of this proposal is
to develop new photochemical tools that allow optical control of a wide variety neuronal
signaling processes in vitro and in vivo."

Fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) remains a poorly understood but highly fatal cancer
of childhood. The pathognomonic fusion oncoprotein of ARMS is PAX3-FOXO1 (i.e., PAX3::FOXO1, P3F), a
transcription factor fusion driving ARMS progression through dysregulation of gene expression and chromatin
state. Major obstacles to the development of therapies for FP-RMS and other oncogenic fusion proteins
include the high degree of conformational plasticity of the fusion protein drivers and the lack of knowledge
about protein partners or suitable mechanisms for inhibiting or clearing the fusions. To solve these gaps, we
need a comprehensive, coordinated approach to discover and develop chemical agents that clarify the
relevance of various molecular mechanisms capable of inhibiting PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. We
assembled a team of chemical biologists, medicinal chemists and RMS-focused physician-scientists whose
unique and complementary expertise in high-throughput screening, chemoproteomics, quantitative molecular
interaction analyses, transcriptional biology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and RMS biology will be
applied to the discovery and development of small molecules that impact PAX3-FOXO1 function in FP-RMS.
A key goal of the Center is to explore multiple mechanisms of action for targeting PAX3-FOXO1 and efforts
will emphasize 1) identifying direct small-molecule binders of PAX3-FOXO1 or nearest neighbor proteins that
may be pursued as direct functional modulators or silent binders for degrader development, 2) development
of PAX3-FOXO1 degraders, including heterobifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and
molecular glues that degrade a target by hijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and 3) indirect targeting
of PAX3-FOXO1 by targeting transcriptional network collaborators that modulate the function of the fusion or
that control transcription of the fusion. We propose three complementary Projects supported by four Research
Groups, including the High-Throughput Screening Group (HTS), the Molecular & Cellular Mechanism Group
(MCM), the Medicinal Chemistry Group (Med Chem), and the Pharmacology Group (Pharm). The Specific
Aims involve all four Research Groups and include: 1) Ligand Discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 (Project 1); 2.
Discovery and Development of Targeted Protein Degraders for PAX3-FOXO1 (Project 2); and 3. Targeting
the PAX3-FOXO1-associated core regulatory transcriptional complex (Project 3). While the aims to explore
multiple pharmacologic modes of perturbing PAX3-FOXO1 activities are ambitious, our combined expertise
and experience in balancing foraging and focusing in drug discovery or development will enable our goal of
accelerating the identification of therapies for PAX3-FOXO1-positive FP-RMS. Our unique strengths will also
inform the TFCC Network, resulting in knowledge generalizable to targeting of fusion oncoproteins in
childhood cancer and accelerating advances in clinical care."
10983483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Complex human traits and outcomes have substantial genetic and environmental contributions that, when
identified, lead to a better understanding of underlying biological process and are potential targets of prevention,
intervention, and treatment strategies. Advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies over the last 20
years has enabled a golden age of genomic discovery, resulting in the identification of thousands of genome-
wide genotype-phenotype associations. Comparatively, the identification of modifiers of these genetic
associations has been slow. And most interrogations of modifiers of genetic associations have been limited to
select non-genetic variables such as sex and age or exposures such as smoking. Relatively few have explored
the impact of social determinants of health despite their independent associations with health disparities.
Regardless of the modifier under study, their identification requires large, well-phenotyped and diverse cohorts
with exposure and genome-wide data available for powerful statistical analysis. Compounding the challenge is
defining the phenotype or outcome of interest generalizable to populations but still useful in specific clinic
settings.
The relatively recent availability of UK Biobank and All of Us, among other diverse datasets linked to phenotypes,
exposures, and genome-wide data, makes the earnest search for environmental modifiers of genetic
associations possible. Here we propose to use APOL1 as a model and possible framework for the methodical
search for environmental “second hits” that distinguish truly at-risk participants and eventually patients from
others. APOL1, associated strongly with negative kidney outcomes that disproportionately affect African
Americans, is an ideal model given that its renal risk variants are 1) common among African-descent and
admixed groups and 2) found exclusively on African-specific haplotypes. We aim to access NEPTUNE, UK
Biobank, and All of Us to quantify the evidence that APOL1 genetic risk for rare (focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis or FSGS) and common negative kidney outcomes (albuminuria, kidney-disease related
eGFR, and composite chronic kidney disease) is modified using observed heterogeneity in its effect sizes across
populations (African Americans, British Blacks, and Hispanics). We further aim to interrogate potential modifying
effects of heavy metal exposure, a quantitative marker association with social determinant of health. The Specific
Aims proposed here, when accomplished, will provide additional data toward at-risk profiles for APOL1 renal risk
variant carriers useful for clinical risk prediction models as well as targets for prevention efforts and/or
development of novel therapeutics. The accomplished Aims will also provide a framework for the systematic
interrogation of “second hits” relevant for human outcomes with known genetic associations."
10983484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our proposal is in direct response to NIDA RFA-DA-24-020, “Mechanistic Studies to Investigate the
Interrelationship between Sleep and/or Circadian Rhythms and Substance Use Disorders”. The opioid crisis in
the United States has led to skyrocketing economics costs and a surge in fatal overdoses due to availability of
synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Individuals struggling with opioid use disorder commonly experience severe and
persistent disruptions in their sleep and circadian rhythms, which may contribute to increased cravings and risk
of relapse to opioids. There are critical gaps in our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular
mechanisms in the brain that link opioid addiction with sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. We found that
synaptic and behavioral responses to fentanyl are controlled by a circadian-dependent, molecular clock
mechanism in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (mNAcSh), a major nexus for regulating reward and
motivated behaviors. Importantly, we discovered that the circadian transcription factor, neuronal PAS domain 2
(NPAS2), is an integral to this circadian regulation of opioid actions and is markedly enriched in a mNAcSh
subpopulation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that specifically expresses the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R-
MSNs). Indeed, ablation of NPAS2 function in the NAc leads to increased fentanyl craving and relapse behaviors.
Notably, the effects of NPAS2 on D3R-MSN function and opioid-related behaviors depend both on sex and time
of day, resembling a putative sex-specific and circadian-dependent pathway in the brain that contributes to opioid
addiction. Our recent work has also established the importance of D3R signaling in the NAc to control effortful,
motivated behaviors to obtain rewards. Thus, our central hypothesis is that NPAS2-dependent transcription in
D3R-MSNs of the mNAcSh is a key signaling mechanism involved in opioid craving and relapse in males and
females. To test this, our proposal employs novel genetic tools combined with cell type-specific RNA-sequencing,
and slice electrophysiology. In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular signaling pathways regulated by NPAS2
in D3R-MSNs involved in fentanyl self-administration behaviors at different times of day. In Aim 2, we will examine
the impact of fentanyl on D3R-MSN excitability and activity and NPAS2’s roles in in mediating these effects in a
diurnal manner. In Aim 3, we will determine whether loss of either NPAS2 function or D3R expression in D3R-
MSNs leads to alterations in fentanyl craving and relapse behaviors across the day. Overall, our proposed
studies, if successful, will definitively identify the mechanistic role of NPAS2 in D3R-MSNs in opioid reinforcement
and relapse in males and females at different times of day. These advances will drive future development of new
circadian-dependent interventions that result in more effective treatment of OUD."

Substance Use Disorders (SUD) has become a major public health crisis of our times. Although
medications for SUD have been available, many patients often encounter significant barriers to
receiving a diagnosis and treatment for SUD because there are no devices for rapid and low-cost
quantitative measurement of drug concentrations and their metabolites that can be used for monitoring
the compliance and metabolism of SUD medication drugs (buprenorphine, Methadone, Naltrexone) in
patients who are undergoing opioid dependence therapy or pain management in low-resource setting
or at home. We propose to develop a low-cost, disposable, point-of-use, highly sensitive and specific
non-instrument urine test strip that enables the rapid quantification SUD medication drugs
(buprenorphine, Methadone, Naltrexone) and their metabolites in patients’ urine. The test requires no
special training to operate and qualitative yes/no and quantitative results are visibly
obtained within ten minutes while quantitative results can be measured with mobile-phone-based strip
reader. To circumvent the technical challenge of current lateral flow assay (LFA) strip’s ability to
measure low concentration of SUD medication drugs and their metabolites, we will implement
innovative strip architecture of strip built-in signal amplification by Pt nanoparticle amplified
chemiluminescent(CL) signal readout which enhance the detection sensitivity. To increase the
specificity for drug/metabolite detection, we propose a new lateral flow assay format by using specific
peptide against the immunocomplex of analytes-capture antibody selected from Phage-peptide display
library in the LFA. Furthermore, a Lab-on-Mobile-Device Apps (mReader™) is tailed for strip image
acquisition and quantitative analysis. We will optimize reagent concentrations and LFA parameters
along with statistical validation of dynamic range, specificity, and sensitivity in Phase I project. The
completion of these proof-of-concept studies will demonstrate the ability of this new type LFA to
measure drug concentration in urine samples. In future Phase II, we will: 1) optimize the LFAs
configuration to reduce false negatives and false positives to ensure reliable detection, 2) design and
develop any associated devices (cassette, packaging and labeling), 3) develop smartphone based
quantitative analysis of the LFA test results and data processing Apps recording and wireless
communication of test results, and 4) develop manufacturing processes for pilot scale production of
2000 LFAs and validate the cannabis saliva test with a large cohort of samples (> 250 clinical samples).
At the end of Phase II, the colorimetric LFAs will be ready for transferring to full-scale automated
manufacturing, and the final LFA device will be produced at large scale for clinical validation towards a
defined 510(k) clearance by the FDA."

Climate change has myriad health effects. An index condition of its impact on the kidneys appears to be
Mesoamerican Nephropathy (MeN), a form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) found in individuals living in rural
communities and working in agriculture along the Pacific coast of Central America. Its cause is unknown, but
epidemiologic evidence suggests heat stress is a significant risk factor for disease. A potential mechanism
linking heat stress and MeN may be recurrent subclinical ischemic or inflammatory injury to the kidney. Prior
research shows that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic derangement is an important
diagnostic and pathophysiologic feature of ischemic and inflammatory kidney injury, and that administration of
niacinamide boosts NAD+ biosynthesis and prevents injury. A key marker of NAD+ biosynthesis is the urine
quinolinate to tryptophan (Q/T) ratio, which increases during injury. Across three parallel aims, this project will
test the hypothesis that kidney injury and NAD+ biosynthetic derangement develop in individuals at risk for
MeN when they are exposed to heat stress, and that both metabolic derangement and kidney injury may be
mitigated by administration of niacinamide. Aim 1 will be observational, evaluating urinary Q/T ratio and kidney
injury biomarkers in heat-stressed sugarcane cutters, a profession with very high rates of MeN. Aim 2 will
define a dose-response curve between heat stress and kidney injury in a controlled human experimental
setting, with parallel measurement of urine Q/T and other metabolic features to study the mechanisms
connecting heat stress and injury. Participants will exercise in a heated environmental chamber under
increasingly intense heat stress, modeling the spectrum experienced during sugarcane cutting. Aim 3 will be a
randomized cross-over double-blind placebo-controlled trial of niacinamide during heat stress. Participants will
exercise in a heated environmental chamber, at heat stress levels determined to elicit kidney strain and a rise
in urine Q/T in Aim 2. Kidney injury biomarkers and Q/T will be compared between niacinamide and placebo
groups. This project will (1) help isolate the role of heat stress in driving kidney injury in populations at risk for
MeN; (2) develop an experimental protocol to study the mechanisms of heat stress-related kidney injury; and
(3) evaluate a potential therapy to mitigate injury. It will also permit my further training in metabolomics; enable
me to refine my skills in experimental physiology, clinical trials, and provocative testing; expand my capacity to
work with vulnerable populations; and help me continue to develop my academic leadership within the
supportive and well-resourced Beth Israel Deaconess / Harvard Medical School system. The proposed
research Aims and career development plan will help me establish a career as an independent investigator,
with expertise in uniting human trials and provocative testing with metabolomics to explore mechanisms
connecting environmental exposures, kidney disease, and therapeutic response in vulnerable populations."

The goal of this study is to characterize a novel mouse mutant with a phenotype resembling Braak
stage I/II Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in humans and to develop this line into a novel animal
model for AD research. AD is a major public health crisis predicted to affect 13.8 million Americans and
cost $750 billion per year by 2050. However, the pathological mechanisms underlying AD have
remained controversial, especially regarding how amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation, the
three hallmarks of AD, may interact with each other at the molecular and cellular level to promote AD
pathology development. This uncertainty has impeded the development of effective intervention. In
pilot studies, we have generated a microglia-specific mouse mutant with strong tauopathy and atrophy
specifically in the entorhinal cortex. This is the first time such a unique tauopathy phenotype has been
observed in the mouse brain. In humans, tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex predicts not only that rate of
future tau pathology spread and deterioration in the brain but also the rate of cognitive decline in
affected patients. Thus, the mouse mutant we have provides a unique opportunity for uncovering
mechanisms of tauopathy development in AD. To characterize this mutant, we will:
 1) determine spatial and temporal pathologic progression across cell types in the mutant brain
 2) identify key cellular/molecular drivers of the tauopathy phenotype
Through these experiments, we will determine primary and secondary changes in the various brain cell
types in the mutant brain and pave way for elucidation of mechanisms of AD tauopathy development in
this unique mouse model. We will also gain insight into the mechanisms by which inflammatory
cytokines may drive entorhinal tauopathy in this mutant and pave way for determining the functional
significance. Together, through this study, we will provide not only a novel AD animal model with strong
entorhinal tauopathy and neurodegeneration yet no complications of gene overexpression.
Furthermore, since the predominant group of risk genes for late-onset AD, which comprises >95% of
AD cases, are related to microglial function, we will also provide a model to elucidate pathogenic
mechanisms of tauopathy that are specific and relevant to the vast majorities of AD cases."

Among men, prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-
related death. While patients with localized disease have a positive prognosis, those with metastatic disease
have a five-year survival rate of 30%. The main therapeutic target in prostate cancer is the androgen receptor
(AR). Most patients treated with anti-androgens will develop resistance and continue disease progression to
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Second-generation anti-androgens, including
enzalutamide and abiraterone, extend life expectancy, but eventually result in resistance to the treatment.
These findings highlight the need for new treatment approaches necessary to overcome or limit the
development of resistance. As many as 20% of aggressive prostate cancers have mutations resulting in
upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. β-catenin is a transcription factor that is activated in response to Wnt
pathway signaling. To cause changes in gene transcription β-catenin interacts with the DNA binding protein
called TCF. Importantly, recent analysis identified the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as the foremost differentially
modulated pathway among enzalutamide-resistant individuals. To target the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we used
structure-based design of oligomeric macrocycles to identify new molecules that potently inhibit Wnt/β-catenin
signaling and the growth of prostate cancer cells. Our goal is to evaluate the ability of macrocycle 13, the lead
inhibitor identified in our screen, to suppress β-catenin signaling in castration resistant prostate cancer using in
vivo models of prostate cancer. We will also determine the impact of β-catenin inhibition on immune cells."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic adults, attributable,
in part, to disparities in socioeconomic status and age-related health conditions. ADRDs are among the costliest dis-
eases to treat, posing a profound burden for people already experiencing health disparities. Mass incarceration,
which disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic people, may play a key role. We propose to extend our current
28-year longitudinal study, the Northwestern Juvenile Project (NJP), to conduct the first comprehensive, prospective
study of how the dose of incarceration—frequency and duration of stays, type of facility (juvenile detention, jail,
prison), age(s), and recency—affects health, age-related conditions, and risk factors for ADRD. Leveraging our orig-
inal sample (n=1829 (now 1492), who will be ages 39-49 in the proposed study), we will use a mixed-methods ap-
proach, focusing on modifiable, midlife risk factors for ADRD as noted in the Lancet Commission 2020 report on
ADRD prevention and other risk indexes: hypertension, smoking, obesity, depression, exercise, diabetes, social con-
tact, and alcohol abuse. Middle adulthood (40+ years) is a critical developmental period for targeting ADRD risk
factors. We have already conducted a pilot study (n=65) that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed methods
and the need to study health, age-related conditions, and risk factors for ADRD in people who have been incarcer-
ated. We will: (1) Interview participants to assess physical and mental health, psychological well-being, and cogni-
tion using the NIH Toolbox (crystallized and fluid intelligence) and the Uniform Data Set (memory); (2) Collect
blood-based biomarkers of health (glucose metabolism, lipid ratios, kidney function, inflammation, and biological
aging); (3) Collect physiological measurements of health (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, rest-
ing heart rate); and (4) Use detailed data on dose of incarceration and the framework of dose-response models to as-
sess how incarceration affects health, age-related conditions, and risk factors for ADRD. We have 3 specific aims:
(1) To assess health, age-related conditions, and ADRD risk factors among participants at median age 45 and com-
pare them to participants in the Add Health study, an NIA-funded study with a similarly aged sample; (2) To exam-
ine the relationship between the dose of incarceration and health, age-related conditions, and risk factors for ADRD;
and (3) To identify risk and protective factors—including geocoded addresses to determine environmental risks—
that moderate the relationship between dose of incarceration and health, age-related conditions, and ADRD risk fac-
tors. We hypothesize, for example: that our participants will have worse health than those in Add Health; that per-
sons who cycle in and out of jail will demonstrate poorer health and greater risk for ADRD than persons with long
prison stays, even after controlling for days incarcerated; and that limited exercise in corrections and unstable hous-
ing upon release will exacerbate incarceration’s consequences. By elucidating how the dose of incarceration and sub-
sequent reentry experiences influence risk for ADRD, the proposed study will establish the empirical foundation
needed to reduce disparities in healthy aging and mitigate risk for ADRD in persons who have been incarcerated."

South Asian is one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States (US). The striking overweight and
obesity prevalence (78%) among foreign-born South Asian American adults is a public health concern, as it
affects not only their own health, but transgenerational obesity risks for SA American youth. Physical inactivity
among South Asian American adults partly explains their high obesity risk. Despite the potential of elevated
physical inactivity and obesity risks among South Asian American children, few studies evaluated physical
activity and obesity among South Asian American children at a national level. Further, cultural factors, such as
gender norm, among South Asian American families may discourage South Asian female youth to participate
in physical activity. However, US data are lacking to understand how parents’ and child’s cultural factors
influence the child’s physical activity behaviors among South Asian American families. To address these
research gaps, the goals of this R03 project are to evaluate physical activity and body composition of South
Asian American youth and to elucidate their cultural factors associated with physical activity behaviors. This
R03 project proposes to conduct secondary data analyses to achieve two aims. Aim 1 is to evaluate physical
activity and body composition among South Asian American youth using the 2011-Mar2020 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. This evaluation will be conducted in comparison with other
Asian (i.e., Chinese, Filipino) and racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Black, Hispanic, White). We will apply an innovative
machine learning analytic method to estimate physical activity levels. Aim 2 is to examine the relationships
between South Asian parents’ and daughters’ cultural factors and daughters’ physical activity using the
baseline data of the South Asian Active Together (SAATH) clinical trial. This cost-efficient R03 project will
produce high-impact knowledge, including a national evaluation of physical activity and body composition and
the cultural determinants of physical activity behaviors among South Asian American youth. The outputs of the
project will lay the foundation for designing an intervention for physical activity promotion of South Asian
American youth. This project will also contribute to accelerating the adoption of the innovative machine
learning analytic approach in physical activity research."

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are complex and heritable mental disorders and serious public health
challenge with uncontrolled use of substances like tobacco, alcohol and cannabis. SUDs are highly heritable
(h2~40-70%), with multiple replicable genetic loci associated with SUDs reported by large-scale Genome Wide
Association Studies (GWAS). Neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
showed alterations in both gray and white matter structural and functional signatures of addiction, however, the
pathway from genes to brain alternations to addiction remained unclear. In this project, we focus on brain
functional connectivity (FC) data and hypothesize that genes impact addiction partially via modification in brain
FC. My goal in seeking this Mentored Research Scientist Development K01 Award is to have protected time
and acquire the necessary training from the mentoring team in (1) analysis of functional MRI data; (2)
understanding clinical and neurobiology of nicotine and cannabis addiction; (3) exploration of large-scale
imaging genetics linked to addiction behavioral data; (4) developing grant writing and management skills. The
knowledge and hands-on experience gained from this project will help the PI develop into a leading
independent investigator in the field leveraging various types of big data (e.g. neuroimaging, multi-omics) to
improve the mechanistic understanding of addiction and mental illness and contribute to his long-term career
success. GWAS identify gene-trait association at SNP level, but do not yield direct evidence on gene function
or the underlying biological mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) fill this gap by using
GWAS data and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to perform gene-level association analyses that
informs potential tissue-dependent functions of candidate loci. The proposed project will combine the PI’s
background in statistical genetics with the additional training in neuroimaging and neurobiology of addiction to
advance novel TWAS methods development to identify genes associated with brain FC changes as well as
pleiotropic genes associated with both brain FC and addiction, which is a critical first step to our understanding
of the hypothesized gene->FC-> addiction causal mediation pathway. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a
new TWAS method with robust statistics for cross-sectional genetic-rsFC studies on nicotine addiction and
identify pleiotropic genes associated with both FC and nicotine addiction; in Aim 2, we will perform TWAS for
genetic-rsFC studies on cannabis use and identify pleiotropic genes associated with both FC and cannabis
use; in Aim 3, we will develop software package to implement the methods and a FC- addiction-TWAS
database with curated knowledge. Successful completion of this project will provide the PI with the new
skillsets and preliminary data to develop a subsequent R01 application.

This F32 proposal describes a comprehensive training and mentorship program for Dr. Rebecca Davidson,
a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan. Dr. Davidson
will participate in a rigorous training plan, guided by their mentor along with a multi-disciplinary advisory
committee. Their training program will include hands-on molecular, bioinformatics, and physiological training, as
well as mentored opportunities to engage in scientific writing, presentations, and grant applications. The ultimate
goal of this proposal is to best position Dr. Davidson for an independent and productive scientific career. Diabetes
is a global epidemic of increasing prevalence, where all forms of diabetes are linked by insufficient β-cell function
or mass to meet peripheral insulin demands. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metainflammatory disease additionally
characterized by impairments in mitochondrial function and ultrastructure that contribute to overall disruption of
β-cell function. Mitochondria rely on their own 16.6 kilobase-pair circular genome to generate the machinery
required for oxidative phosphorylation. Recently, our group identified a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
copy number in islets from T2D donors compared to islets from non-diabetic donors, indicating a disruption in
genome stability in diabetes. While mtDNA genome instability is implicated in several diseases, its impact on β-
cell dysfunction in diabetes has yet to be explored. The long-term objective of my project is to better
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic settings. My project
focuses on the β-cell-specific role of mitochondrial genome integrity on maintaining healthy mitochondrial
function to meet the energy demands of the β cell. My preliminary data indicate that the progressive accumulation
of deletions in β-cell mtDNA impair glucose homeostasis and β-cell function. Thus, I hypothesize that loss of
mtDNA genome integrity occurs in the presence of inflammatory stressors and contributes to mitochondrial and
β-cell failure in diabetes, which I will test through 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the importance of mtDNA
genome integrity to β-cell function and survival in mouse models of β-cell-specific mtDNA disruptions. Aim 2 will
evaluate how diabetogenic stressors impact mtDNA genome integrity utilizing primary human islets and mouse
models of diabetes. Successful completion of these Aims will provide novel and critical insights into the
mechanistic contribution of mtDNA genome integrity on overall mitochondrial health and β-cell function required
to preclude diabetes development."

Systems Approach to Understanding Cardiovascular Disease
 -Ion Channels, Ca2+ regulation and signaling-
Cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias and stroke, are the number one killer
in the developed world. In order to develop better and more effective therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases,
it is critically important for scientists and physicians to obtain in-depth and accurate understanding of the
mechanisms underlying heart and vascular function and dysfunction. In recent decades, researchers studying
heart and vascular diseases have been accumulating more and more experimental data from the molecular, to
cellular, to tissue and organ levels. However, there is a critical need to integrate these data into mechanistic and
quantitative models to understand emergent properties of complex biological systems, such as arrhythmias and
vasospasms that are often counterintuitive due to non-linear dynamics interactions. Moreover, just from a
fundamental view, it is important to understand how different cells of the cardiovascular system may interact with
each other in physiology and disease. Here, we propose to take the necessary step forward to integrate
experimental data into quantitative models that enable the use of mathematical tools and computational power
to understand the complex interactions of the cells and molecules in the cardiovascular system. The unique
design of this conference series is to combine experimental study and mathematical modeling to achieve in-
depth understanding of the dynamic systems that control cardiovascular function in health and disease. The
proposed interdisciplinary conference is the 8th in this series. The last installment of the conference integrated,
for the first time, studies in cardiac and vascular tissue. The previous conferences have received overwhelmingly
positive evaluations from attendees and resulted in high-impact publications. The proposed conference will
combine experimental and modeling studies in the field of cardiac and vascular physiology and focus on in-depth
comparison of the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle function, with emphasis on ion channels, cellular Ca2+
regulation, and signaling. The aims of this conference will be on (1) summarizing the current state of research in
the focus area, (2) identifying consensus and controversy that warrant more investigation, and (3) exchanging
ideas, data, and information among the experimentalists and modelers to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations.
As previously done, the conference results will be summarized in the form of a comprehensive review paper,
which will be published in a leading scientific journal that have broad impact on the research community."

Nonmuscle Myosin IIB (NMIIB) is an ATPase motor complex that generates force on actin filaments. This force
generation is an essential driver of the actin re-organization that occurs in dendritic spines, actin dense post-
synaptic structures, that allows spines to enlarge when stimulated. When a neuron is stimulated, actin
mobilization in spines, spinal enlargement, and then actin stabilization of the enlarged structures occurs, and
this dynamic process results in plasticity. Spine plasticity in regions of the brain such as the hippocampus
(HPC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) contributes to the molecular basis of learning and memory storage.
While NMIIB is known to be a critical contributor to the structural plasticity underlying learning and memory,
surprisingly little is known about its action and regulation in mature excitatory neurons. Previous work from our
group established that NMIIB is a driver of actin polymerization in rodent hippocampal neurons and that it is
regulated as a part of the NMDA receptor pathway upon synaptic stimulation. Inhibiting NMIIB in the HPC
results in disruption of memory. Our group has also discovered a regionally specific role of NMIIB in the BLA.
Methamphetamine (METH) exposure induces the actin cytoskeleton of a subset of spines to remain
constitutively active in an NMIIB-dependent manner. Upon NMIIB inhibition, this overactive population returns
to normal motility. Accordingly, NMIIB inhibition after METH exposure disrupts METH-associated memories
and drug seeking, establishing NMIIB as a therapeutic target. With new advances in molecular level imaging, a
comprehensive cellular biological study of NMIIB is now possible to elucidate its regulation of synaptic actin
dynamics. To support this, I have generated and validated a novel endogenously tagged NMIIB knock-in
mouse line containing both 3x FLAG and Halo tags as a tool compatible with super resolution imaging
and biochemical analysis. Super resolution imaging is necessary to address our questions about NMIIB
localization and dynamics because at 300nm, myosin filaments are just at the diffraction limit and any non-
filamentous myosin structures will be even smaller. Preliminary data shows NMIIB interacts with proteins in the
shaft and at tips of spines, suggesting that dynamic changes in subcellular localization are occurring on a scale
< 1 micron and therefore super resolution, and even more specifically, single molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM) is most suitable to investigate. In Aim1 we will determine the subcellular distribution on NMIIB in
neurons from our tagged NMIIB line using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) in fixed
samples. We will also treat neurons to simulate synaptic plasticity to determine if that changes NMIIB
distribution. In Aim 2 we use live neurons from NMIIB mice to track the subcellular location of NMIIB and
measure its trafficking dynamics within the spine using single particle tracking photoactivatable localization
microscopy (spt PALM). This will enable us to image NMIIB dynamics in live cells under basal conditions and
then image the same cells during synaptic activation."

Opioid abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and is responsible for more than 40,000
overdose deaths each year 1. In particular, synthetic opioid addiction has proven to be extremely difficult to
combat, in part because it generates powerful opponent processes in the user. Each dose of synthetic opioid
produces rapid and potent euphoria that is strongly associated to drug cues, while withdrawal and abstinence
from synthetic opioids induce severe distress. Avoidance of withdrawal and subsequent exposure to drug cues
are key deterrents to long-term abstinence. The Lateral Habenula (LHb) is an exciting target for studying
neuronal facilitation of relapse, as LHb activity is correlated with both stress evasion and the encoding of
motivational value 6. LHb activity during acute withdrawal may motivate relapse via stress avoidance
mechanisms, while during abstinence cues that are normally paired with drugs go unrewarded, inducing activity
in the LHb. This activity may motivate drug seeking via a process akin to reward prediction error. Under the
primary mentorship of Drs. John Neumaier, Michael Bruchas, Paul Phillips, and Charles Chavkin, this K99/R00
Pathway to Independence award will allow me to obtain training in cutting edge in-vivo calcium imaging and
optogenetics, and oral self-administration model development. This training will allow me to elucidate the roles
of the major LHb output pathways in motivating avoidance of fentanyl withdrawal and cued reinstatement. During
the mentored phase of this grant I will be trained to use GCaMP6-based in-vivo calcium imaging to record LHb
neurons that project specifically to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the rostromedial tegmentum (RMTg), or the
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, conditioned place aversion testing, and
fentanyl reinstatement. I will also be trained to combine in-vivo calcium imaging with red-shifted optogenetic
inhibition in order to leverage simultaneous circuit imaging and recording, and test causal relationships between
neural pathway activity and behavior. Finally, I will be trained in novel oral fentanyl self-administration (SA) model
development, which will be invaluable to my independent research career as a behavioral neuroscientist. During
the independent phase of the award, I will combine this training with my prior expertise to determine if activity in
each LHb pathway is necessary for expression of withdrawal related negative affect, withdrawal induced CPA,
or cued reinstatement to fentanyl seeking. I will do so by simultaneously inhibiting LHb projections and recording
from each LHb target region (VTA, RMTg, or DRN) to determine the effect of inhibition on behavior and
monoaminergic nucleus activity. In summary, the research proposed in this Pathway to Independence Award
will elucidate the role of individual LHb pathways in motivating avoidance of withdrawal and cued reinstatement,
as well as their role in the expression of negative affect. This award will provide training in new technical tools,
grant writing, lab management, mentorship, and other skills necessary to establish an independent research
program capable of producing high impact studies and training the next generation of scientists."

Humoral immunity against infections requires the germinal center (GC) differentiation process in the B cell
follicles of lymph nodes. In GCs, naïve B cells rapidly proliferate in response to T cell-dependent
antigen presentation and somatically mutate into high-affinity antibody-secreting cells (plasma cells).
Despite a deep understanding of immunology, numerous challenges exist in understanding disease
transmission, pathology, and developing new vaccines against life-threatening infectious diseases. These
include a limited understanding of immune correlates of protection, identification of viable vaccine candidates,
and off-target effects that must be evaluated in staged clinical trials. Significant pre-clinical research depends
on mice, non-human primates, or other animal models. However, to date, no ex vivo technology has shown
evidence of hallmark GC functional characteristics and the ability to generate high-affinity, long-lived human
plasma and memory B cells. Existing technologies, such as 2D B and T cell co-cultures lead to inefficient GC
responses, and human tonsil transwell aggregates are short-lived. The long-term goal of this project is to
microenvironment that sustains the survival and differentiation of human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC)-derived B cells into bona fide human GCs as well as long-lived plasma cells that engraft in vivo.
The central hypothesis is that a synthetic hydrogel-based presentation of cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM)
microenvironmental cues that mimic lymphoid tissues will induce differentiation of human PBMC-derived naïve
B cells into GC B cells and memory cells and prolong the survival of plasma cells ex vivo and in vivo. The central
objective of this project is to understand how the lymphoid microenvironment regulates the ex vivo differentiation
kinetics of human B cells and generate ex vivo long-lived plasma cells that engraft in vivo. The specific aims are:
Aim 1: Bioengineer PEG-4MAL-based lymphoid organoids with human B, T, and stromal cells to recapitulate
temporal kinetics of decision-making of human GC B cells against antigens and adjuvants. Aim 2: Integrate
engineered GCs with forced affinity maturation to isolate high-affinity B cells. Aim 3: Evaluate the in vivo
engraftment of engineered human B cells delivered using injectable gels. This renewal project is highly
significant and innovative because it will 1) engineer a hydrogel-based human immune organoid, inspired by
lymphoid tissues, for generating antigen-specific GC B cells, 2) enable forced affinity maturation ex vivo, and 3)
examine in vivo engraftment of ex vivo engineered B cells."
11003488,"An RNA sequence and all its diverse modifications constitutes the true informational content of
RNA. Defects in RNA modifications account for >100 human diseases, affecting millions of
Americans, including those with breast cancer, skin cancer, and lung cancer. Despite its
significance, our understanding of RNA sequence and modification diversity remains limited.
Current sequencing technologies only partially capture RNA sequences and modifications, leaving
gaps in our understanding. For instance, the exact count of unique RNA sequences in a sample
remains elusive. NGS-based RNA sequencing methods require converting RNA to cDNA, and
such indirect methods can not accurately reflect the original RNA content. While nanopore-based
RNA sequencing permits direct RNA sequencing, it relies on ligating RNAs to sequence adapters,
a process with variable yields ranging from 30% to 90%. Consequently, any RNA failing this
ligation remains unsequenced, leading to potential underrepresentation.
Furthermore, sequencing all RNA modifications is challenging due to the presence of >170 unique
nucleotide modifications. NGS-based RNA sequencing technologies, relying on cDNA synthesis,
often neglect or bias towards certain RNA modifications, thus failing to deliver a comprehensive
profile of RNA modifications. This issue is exacerbated by the heterogeneous nature and
quantification difficulties associated with partial RNA modifications.
To address these challenges, DSI has innovated next-generation mass spectrometry-based
sequencing (NGMS-Seq) methods. Utilizing two-dimensional (2D) mass-retention time ladders
instead of MS/MS fragmentation, NGMS-Seq has demonstrated the potential to sequence specific
tRNAs de novo and simultaneously sequence and quantify all nucleotide modifications without
bias. In this application, we will 1) further develop NGMS-Seq into an exhaustive de novo RNA
sequencing method, which not only directly identifies but also sequences every RNA species
completely in a sample without any omission, and provides a comprehensive modification
landscape for each RNA without bias, and 2) test exhaustive sequencing of synthetic RNA
therapeutics (Aim 1) and human cancer tRNAs (Aim 2) for comprehensive RNA sequence and
modification profiling. This advancement could revolutionize our ability to fully understand RNA's
sequence and modification diversity, crucial for RNA drug development and functional studies."
11007744,"Healthcare disparities in the US result in large segments of the population without access to radiation
therapy (RT). This manifests itself in Eastern Kentucky and Appalachia, wherein the impact is exacerbated by
the high incidence of smoking-related cancers. RT is an effective component of the treatment strategy for
these patients. Advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided RT
(IGRT), stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improve outcomes and are delivered
using medical linear accelerators (i.e., ‘linacs”). SBRT is especially appealing in these settings, given that the
precise treatments are delivered in 1-5 daily treatment fractions, as opposed to the 20-40 fractions required for
conventional techniques. Providing SBRT in rural settings can improve access by administering these precise,
abbreviated treatments to patients who have difficulty traveling to large, regional medical centers.
 The quality assurance (QA) that medical physicists provide is critical for safe treatments, yet there is a
shortage of qualified medical physicists (QMPs), both in the US and globally. At the same time, more centers
are introducing modern techniques that are more precise but intrinsically have more risk, due the high doses
and geometric precision required. There is widespread noncompliance with industry standard QA protocols in
the US and internationally. Existing QA devices have not evolved sufficiently to provide the precision, versatility
and efficiency that is needed for high precision RT. Given these exacerbated safety risks, the market needs a
paradigm shift in how QA is performed in modern RT.
 Wild Dog Physics (WDP) proposes to design and test a new-generation QA device, that addresses these
unmet medical needs. We have trademarked this device the RetrieverTM. When complete, it will be more
precise, efficient, and comprehensive than any QA solution currently on the market. The proposed project
seeks to develop a clinical prototype to be tested in the Radiation Therapy clinic at the University of Kentucky,
as well as partner organizations located in rural, underserved areas.
 Having proven feasibility in our feasibility study, we seek to advance this innovation to commercial
viability in Phase 2 through three specific aims: 1) hardware refinement, to allow measurement of machine
performance metrics to within 0.5 mm and 1% relative does; 2) software development to allow real-time data
analysis, real-time compliance assessment and analytical tools that can monitor long-term trends, abrupt shifts,
and inter-machine and inter-institutional comparisons and; 3) clinical testing to validate the sensitivity and
specificity of the Retriever to shifts in machine characteristics. We will work with key academic and clinical
partners in the design and testing phases, including Qualified Medical Physicists (QMPs) serving in sparsely
populated, low resource settings in the US. When successful, this important innovation will help to bring
accurate, state-of-the-art radiation therapy treatments to patients who might otherwise not receive them."
11008650,"Project Summary
 The long-term goal of this project proposal is to develop and commercialize a therapy to assist pre-term and
term infants with brain injury overcome difficulties in learning to feed. Independent feeding is critical for infants
to be discharged home with their families and avoid placemen of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) for direct stomach
feeding. The current standard of care for infants with feeding difficulty involves early oromotor stimulation and
feeding practice with therapists who guide safe feeding. Few other therapies exist for infants who are not making
progress with feeding volumes at term age. Technologies currently on the market are used to stimulate early
sucking patterns at 31-32 weeks gestational age with a puff of air, but do not work to stimulate active feeding in
older infants. Other technology monitor parameters, such as suck amplitude, but no technologies actively
improve oral feeding in older infants whose main reason for continued hospitalization is feeding delays.
 To tackle this problem, we took the novel approach of pairing a non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus
nerve stimulation (taVNS) stimulation with bottle feeding. In these first-in-infant open-label pilot studies 54% of
infants in discussions for G-tube placement for feeding delay, reached full feeds within 2 weeks, and even infants
who did not achieve full feeds improved their po feeding volumes. Further, infants who got to full feeds showed
stronger and more complex circuits associated with motor skills, suggesting neuroplasticity associated with the
activity of taVNS-paired with feeding.
 During the phase I STTR award period, our team moved from a complex system of electronic pulse
generators and computers to a handheld taVNS device, and a slimmed down, custom ear electrode targeting
the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the tragus. We customized and refined the taVNS unit operation and
worked with manufacturers to make it specifically fit the needs of our infants. We obtained advice and feedback
from our parent and therapist advisors in deciding on a product. With this compact set-up that is easier to use,
we are ready to test the BabySTrong feeding system in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded trial to
show efficacy in improving the daily feeding volumes, the days to full oral feeds, the number of infants who avoid
G-tube placement and increased neuroplasticity in white matter circuits. If this groundbreaking new approach to
infant feeding is successful, we may impact length of stay and associated hospital costs, and address family and
care provider frustration inherent with continued hospitalizations for feeding delays. With positive results from
this phase II trial, we hope to move the vision of feeding delay treatment to one of taVNS facilitating activity-
dependent neuroplasticity and feeding competence. The findings from this proposal will support our FDA
application and commercialization plans for the BabySTrong system."
11007517,"Abstract
Tambo is developing a platform to activate drugs at specific sites in the body, thus enhancing their efficacy while
minimizing systemic toxicity and adverse drug events (ADEs). Most drugs distribute throughout the body; due to
lack of specificity for the pathological site, high doses are required to achieve effective therapeutic
concentrations, causing toxicity and ADEs in healthy tissues. Each year, there are ~1.2 million reports of ADEs
in the U.S., with overall costs of ADE-related morbidity and mortality thought to exceed $177 billion. ADEs also
contribute to the 90% failure rate of drug candidates. Common prodrug approaches to overcome these critically
limiting ADEs rely on biological or physiological factors, such as selected biomarkers, enzymatic activity, altered
pH, or reactive oxygen species, which have found limited success due to inherent variability among patients.
Tambo’s Click Activated Protodrugs (CAP) platform was designed to achieve higher concentrations of active
drugs at specific pathological sites while minimizing systemic toxicity using an activation method independent of
native biological processes; thus the approach is not affected by variations across patients. The platform also
enables the reinvestigation and repurposing of drug candidates that may have previously been shelved due to
off-target effects. A CAP therapeutic consists of 2 components: 1) a tetrazine (Tz)-modified activating agent that
is not therapeutically active but is targeted to a disease site; and 2) a systemically administered trans-cyclooctene
(TCO)-modified payload (a protodrug) with attenuated activity/toxicity. At the target site, the activating agent
selectively and rapidly captures the protodrug via a bioorthogonal click chemistry reaction, followed by local
release of the payload. One challenge the CAP platform has encountered is that the low solubility of certain
protodrugs limits the feasible dose to subtherapeutic levels. To address this, the Phase I project successfully
synthesized a selection of TCO-modified protodrugs carrying different solubilizing groups, including branched
amino acids, linear PEG chains, and both positively and negatively charged groups. Solubility of a paclitaxel-
based protodrug reached 16 mg/mL in an aqueous formulation buffer; free paclitaxel requires a toxic
cremophor/ethanol mixture to be formulated. Solubility of an exatecan protodrug was similarly high, enabling
high doses of each protodrug when tested in vivo. The protodrugs were tolerable in mice, and when the exatecan
protodrug was tested in a murine tumor model with a biopolymer targeting agent carrying the activator, the tumors
were completely eliminated. Phase II aims to further advance the CAP platform and to demonstrate its modularity
by undertaking three specific aims: 1) synthesizing and characterizing protodrugs from novel therapeutic classes,
2) confirming in vitro and in vivo efficacy of developed protodrugs with a targeting agent, and 3) undertaking
toxicology studies of a lead protodrug with a HER2-targeted activating agent. Phase II success will be defined
by developing new protodrugs that translate to tissue-targeted efficacy and attenuated toxicity in vivo. Ultimately,
the CAP platform could be used to develop better treatments for a wide range of disease indications."
11003955,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hoarding Disorder (HD) is characterized by the acquisition of and failure to discard materials regardless
of their actual value, resulting in a dysfunctional accumulation of possessions. The disorder affects 2.5%
of the U.S. population daily (~6.5 million individuals). HD causes significant functional impairment,
reduced quality of life, and represents a substantial public health, safety, and economic burden. The only
evidence-based treatment (EBT) for HD is a specialized form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The
treatment is associated with large effect sizes on average; however, many do not respond due to limited
adherence to at-home behavioral assignments. On average, patients with HD complete less than half of
their assigned CBT homework. Between-session behavioral avoidance and distress, lack of in-the-
moment support and accountability, and limited methods to objectively measure homework completion
all contribute to low patient adherence, which in turn predicts treatment non-response. The current Phase
I STTR seeks to develop and assess an asynchronous telehealth tool and digital support resource to
assist in facilitating delivery of and adherence to CBT for HD. Clutter-GO™ will consist of a web-based
clinician portal and patient-side mobile app designed specifically for HD treatment. The platform will allow
clinicians to access expert-created EBT homework assignments that can be pushed to patients’ mobile
devices. Unlike traditional pen and paper homework lists and logs,
Clutter-GO™ will contain a library of
step-by-step behaviorally interactive multimedia homework assignments. Thus, patients can do
assignments by themselves with increased real-time support and tracking. The platform allows for just-
in-time psychoeducation videos, coping skills, emotional processing, and therapeutic accountability via
asynchronous connection to therapists, who can monitor objective results immediately. Importantly, a set
of image and video capture tools with visual overlays make it easy to track progress over time to promote
positive reinforcement. Ultimately, use of Clutter-GO™ is expected to facilitate patient adherence,
treatment effectiveness, provider fidelity, and dissemination of EBT for HD. The overall goal of the project
is to create a rigorously vetted and highly usable platform for Phase II testing, via four stepwise Aims.
Aim 1 is to complete initial development of the product build based on input from internationally known
experts in HD treatment. Aim 2 is to iteratively refine the clinician user interface (UI) via consultation and
user acceptance testing (UAT) with (N = 20) licensed clinicians who treat HD. Aim 3 is to iteratively refine
the patient UI via consultation and UAT with (N = 12) individuals diagnosed with HD. Finally, Aim 4 is to
confirm the platform by allowing the expert consultants and licensed clinicians re-test the patient-vetted
product for a final round of iterations. The primary outcome criterion is exceptional platform usability as
measured by an industry-standard usability scale shown to predict ultimate product success. Positive
results will be followed by a Phase II application to test the clinical efficacy of Clutter-GO™ in a large
randomized controlled trial and to continue improvements via large scale UAT."
11008274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Molecular analysis of limited biological and clinical samples is of high significance and growing interest, as
observed from the exponentially increasing number of publications, citations, and startup businesses. Scarce,
precious, and amount-limited clinical and biological samples, including small-volume liquid biopsies (i.e., blood,
CSF, and other physiological fluids), microneedle tissue biopsies, rare cell isolates (e.g., circulating tumor cells,
cells from liquid biopsies, or laser-capture microdissected tissue biopsies), neonatal specimens, model animal
samples, dried blood spots, minute amounts of cells used in cell-based therapies, and even single cells and
organelles often hold keys for solving long-standing puzzles in biomedical research. Currently, the most efficient
technologies to tackle such limited samples rely on transcriptomic and genomic profiling techniques.
Unfortunately, genomic and transcriptomic profiles are poor surrogates for predicting quantitative proteomic
profiles, and these techniques cannot deliver structural and quantitative information for the characterization of
proteoforms, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and protein interactions, which are essential for
discovering cellular and molecular level pathways of disease, mechanisms of cell signaling, cell
activation/differentiation states, as well as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therefore, the ability to
reliably characterize proteomes in such limited samples will help define strategies for enabling early diagnostics
and personalized treatments of deadly diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, infectious diseases,
cardiovascular diseases, and traumatic brain injury), ensure the efficiency of cell-based therapies, characterize
cell model systems, and answer pressing questions in fundamental biology that could not be resolved before.
However, deep and high-sensitivity proteomic profiling of limited samples using conventional mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomic techniques is still a major challenge because (1) there are no amplification techniques
available for proteins, proteoforms, and PTMs, and (2) the current state-of-the-art conventional nanoflow liquid
chromatography (nanoLC) technologies provide suboptimal sensitivity and separation performance for scarce
samples. Consequently, numerous critical biological and pathological phenomena can not be investigated by
research laboratories using amount-limited samples, and multiple deadly diseases can not be diagnosed early
and successfully treated. In this study, we propose a unique ultra-low flow (ULF) proteomic technology based
on porous layer open-tubular (PLOT) and monolithic nanoLC columns developed by our laboratory that has the
potential to disrupt a sector of the nanoLC products market to enable deep proteomic profiling of scarce biological
and clinical samples that would be critical for numerous academic, clinical diagnostics, and forensic research
laboratories, as well as for industrial researchers in biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and instrument
development companies. In this study, our main goal is to develop, build, and thoroughly evaluate a
commercialization-ready prototype ULF LC platform based on our unique monolithic and PLOT columns."

 The proposed project entitled Enhancing Diversity in Genomics Education and Research (EDGER),
submitted to the Initiative to Maximize Research Education in Genomics: Diversity Action Plan (R25) program
within the National Human Genome Research Institute, aims to recruit and train twelve undergraduate students
each year for five years at Hampton University in Virginia. Based on the student demographics of the institution
(designated an HBCU), it is anticipated that all student participants will be African Americans, typically under-
represented in the genome sciences. By hosting mentored extracurricular and curricular education and research
opportunities during the academic year and summer, students will focus on comparative genomics, experimental
cell biology, multi-omics data analysis and career development skills.
 To contextualize the evolutionary innovation of exceptional bone phenotypes, students will have an
opportunity to examine the genomes of multiple divergent species including the gorilla, moose, beaked whale,
walrus, ocean sunfish, bowfin, sea lamprey and brown hagfish (Aim 1). Revealing key genomic regulatory
elements will allow for the experimental manipulation of bone progenitor cells (mesenchymal stem cells) in
culture using essential nutrients, antioxidants, phytochemicals, epigenetic regulators, and polyphenolic
compounds hypothesized to influence bone formation in vertebrates, including humans (Aim 2). Extracurricular
research experiences during the academic year will reinforce curricular training by pairing each student with an
HU faculty member participating in the EDGER program and provide examples relevant to human health (e.g.,
bone formation, homeostasis, repair, and regeneration).
 Collaborators at the University of Vermont (a research intensive institution with a genomics core facility
and expertise in genome sciences) will assist with genomic data collection, data analysis and student training.
Integrating the skills and data acquired during the academic year, students will participate in month-long summer
sessions focused on data analysis each morning (hosted virtually by UVM collaborators), and career
development skills in the afternoons (hosted locally by HU faculty) (Aim 3). In total, eight faculty mentors and
sixty students will be supported by the program to achieve the long-term goal of increasing African American
representation in genome sciences (or related biomedical) research careers."

The widespread adoption of inaccurate and biased methods has impeded effective analysis and stymied
comprehensive understanding of the composition and dynamics of the human virome. In this project we aim to
develop innovative and novel laboratory techniques and computational methods to overcome the major
challenges in identifying and characterizing human viruses. Our research team has successfully developed and
deployed robust viromics methods for soil microbial communities, leading to a revolution in understanding of soil
viral ecology. Preliminary data strongly indicate that these methods are also effective on human stool samples.
Here, we will first optimize laboratory methods for recovery and quantification of RNA and DNA viruses from
human stool (Aim 1). This aim directly addresses multiple specific interests described in the NOFO by developing
techniques for 1) viral isolation and viral detection, 2) viral quantification, 3) viral enrichment for downstream
sequencing, 4) eliminating environmental background and contaminating sequences, and 5) proper human
sample procurement and storage. We have specific plans to complete this aim by leveraging our research team’s
extensive experience in viromics, software development, and the human microbiome. Next, we aim to
comparatively evaluate stool viromics techniques by applying them to a longitudinal human cohort (Aim 2). Here
we will assess DNA and RNA viromics and other omics techniques for their ability to capture viral dynamics and
develop a computational approach to translate the data generated from different methods to enable meta-
analyses across studies. This directly addresses the specific interest to develop in silico methods to compare
viromes across studies. We will complete this aim by leveraging our research team’s extensive experience
developing, publishing, and maintaining user-friendly and highly used software programs. Finally, we aim to
extend our technique’s applicability to diverse types of human samples, including those with low biomass (Aim
3). Priority sample types will be chosen in consultation with the full HVP Consortium. This work addresses the
key technological and methodological challenges that are currently hindering robust interrogation of the
constituents and functionality of the human virome."
10986857,"Project Description
 Hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit in humans. Half of all cases of early onset hearing
loss in developed countries have a genetic etiology, with single gene mutations in over 100 different loci
identified so far. Mutations in the majority of these genes result in nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss,
where abnormal inner ear function is the only diagnostic feature. In comparison to children, the genetic causes
of hearing loss in adults are less well understood. Approximately, 80% of hearing loss cases are diagnosed
after the second decade of life and yet, adults are rarely tested for genetic mutations as a possible cause of
their condition. To help address this gap in knowledge our research seeks to elucidate the unexplained genetic
underpinnings of adult-onset hearing loss, focusing on rare coding variants within established and
undiscovered hearing loss genes. Taking advantage of a genome first approach in a hospital-recruited biobank
cohort and functional studies in mice we identified ZNF175, and its mouse orthologue Zfp719, as a novel adult
onset hearing loss gene. ZNF175/Zfp719 is a member of a large family of Krüppel-associated box zinc-finger
proteins that bind DNA and silence target gene expression, including transposable elements and host genes,
through the formation of heterochromatin. Our preliminary data indicate that Zfp719 mutant mice exhibit
several inner ear pathologies, including synaptopathy, hair cell dysfunction, and hair cell degeneration that
progress with age and hearing loss severity in a gene dosage-dependent manner. The overarching goal of
experiments in this proposal is to identify the genomic targets of Zfp719 mediated heterochromatin silencing,
and determine the pathogenic consequences of their misregulation on ribbon synapses, ion homeostasis, and
innate immunity. Importantly, since dysfunction in each of these auditory processes has been implicated in
adult onset hearing loss, our studies are likely to provide a better general understanding of this condition.
Moreover, the outcome of these efforts may lead to the identification of new drug and gene-based therapies for
hearing loss prevention and enable screening of high-risk individuals at an earlier age who might benefit from
preventative and restorative treatment options."
10983387,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Today's sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth are coming out at increasingly younger ages, with the
average age of disclosure at 13 years old and 35% coming out as preteens. SGM preteens experience up to
14 times higher risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) compared with their heterosexual, cisgender
peers. SGM preteens' social and developmental contexts likely contribute to significant risk and protective
factors for STBs. For example, they must simultaneously navigate preteen developmental stressors and
supports (like peer relationships and first romantic experiences) while also managing an emerging SGM
identity and associated exposure to stigma-related stress and resilience. Yet, several knowledge gaps remain.
The field of SGM preteen research is in its infancy, without consensus on best practices for sampling and
recruiting high-risk SGM preteens. The field also lacks psychometrically valid assessments for SGM preteens
as well as longitudinal studies assessing risk and resilience trajectories during this sensitive developmental
period. The overarching goal of this rigorous multi-method project is to address these gaps. Youth and parent
advisory boards will be assembled to enrich our research and ensure its cultural responsiveness, ethical
soundness, and ultimate benefit to SGM preteens and families. Our research will address three aims. First, we
will use a five-step Delphi process to develop consensus among a diverse panel of experts (including
researchers, clinicians, legal experts, parents, leaders of SGM community youth groups) on best practices for
safely, ethically, and effectively sampling, recruiting, and retaining SGM preteens at risk for suicide into
research. Second, we will create and pretest an assessment of stigma-related stress and resilience for SGM
preteens using a three-phase approach (developing an initial item pool; refining items; establishing content
validity with SGM preteens). Last, we will enroll a national cohort of 120 SGM preteens at risk for suicide with
one parent/caregiver, which we will call the SPARK (SGM Preteens Advancing ouR Knowledge) Cohort.
SPARK participants will be administered an online assessment battery of developmental stressors and
supports, stigma-related stress and resilience, and STBs every 6 months for 2 years. Analyses will use
rigorous weighted generalized estimating equations to estimate trajectories of risk and protective factors for
STBs. Subgroup analyses will further examine how trajectories of STBs and associated risk and protective
factors differ by race and ethnicity, gender identity, and other theoretically informed intersectional factors
among SGM preteens. This research is guided by an innovative conceptual model integrating advances in
developmental science with the NIMHD SGM Health Disparities Framework and involves community partners
at SGM youth organizations nationwide to enhance feasibility. Findings from this project will advance best
practices for sampling SGM preteens, measuring stigma-related stress and resilience, and mapping
trajectories of risk and protective factors for STBs, aligning with key NIMH priorities."

No single North American clinical center sees a large enough number of patients with these disorders to permit a rigorous approach to addressing unresolved questions including etiology and pathogenesis, optimal methods of diagnosis, and treatment, and factors that influence disease severity and prognosis. This competitive renewal proposal from the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital (BCM/TCH) seeks to continue ongoing research activities in the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN). The clinical center at BCM/TCH includes an outstanding group of clinician investigators with an extensive track record in synergistic translational and clinical research relevant to pediatric liver diseases. Performance to date in the on-going studies of ChiLDReN has been exemplary and has taken full advantage of a predominant market share of the population base of the Houston metropolitan region (5th largest in the United States) and the large referral patterns to TCH as a quaternary center for Pediatric Hepatology and Liver Transplantation. This renewal application includes a strong commitment to continuing the on-going research efforts including; 1) continuation of prospective longitudinal follow up of participants enrolled in ChiLDReN-based studies at BCM/TCH, 2) prospective enrollment of participants with biliary atresia in longitudinal studies either at the time of presentation with neonatal cholestasis or after diagnosis and 3) prospective enrollment of participants with primary sclerosing cholantitis in longitudinal studies either at the time of presentation with sclerosing cholangitis or after diagnosis. The overall hypothesis for these studies is that collaborative investigation will accelerate advances in pediatric cholestasis especially when rich clinical metadata can be leveraged with detailed imaging studies and a deep longitudinal biosample repository."

extensive infrastructure of Duke's NIH Autism Center of Excellence research program synergizing with the
proposed study as well as the departmental and university commitment to the careers of physician-scientists.
Early childhood represents a critical period for delivering early autism intervention to affect lifelong skill
development which impacts an individual's overall functioning. This proposal responds to NIMH autism research
priorities to develop “new tools for use in screening, stratification and/or measuring outcome in response to
intervention” by investigating electrophysiological biomarkers in autistic preschoolers with relevance to a core
construct of early intervention, enhancing social engagement. Preliminary evidence from
electroencephalography (EEG) studies from my mentor's team identified decreased gaze to social compared to
nonsocial stimuli is associated with decreased frontal and posterior ß1 power and increased posterior θ EEG
power in autistic children. This proposal will validate this finding in participants undergoing simultaneous EEG
and automated detection of eye gaze, analyze the relationship between these EEG power features and rigorous
coding of child-caregiver social engagement, and examine the longitudinal relationship between change in these
EEG measures and change in standardized assessments of social communication functioning over time. Finally,
the candidate will explore novel analyses of functional connectivity developed from her preclinical
electrophysiology studies to determine whether these biomarkers also relate to the above measures of social
engagement given the evidence that aberrant connectivity is a hallmark of autistic brains. Future work will extend
these biomarkers to other populations and apply them to early intervention trials."

Suicide is a leading cause of death in youth ages 8–12 years, and rates of suicide in children
are increasing. Alarmingly, suicide increased 87% in ages 10–14 from 2000 to 2021 and 49% in
those ages 15–24. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) will support a Consortium of
six research projects and a data coordinating center (DCC) to improve understanding of risk and
protective factors related to preteen suicidal thoughts and behaviors for a range of youth. We
recognize that this important and complex endeavor requires exceptional coordination across a
range of activities inherent to a multi-site Consortium as well as expertise in data harmonization,
integration, and a multidisciplinary lens. RTI proposes to serve as the DCC for this Consortium
of investigators. In this capacity, RTI will facilitate data coordination by assisting the Consortium
in developing common measures and metrics and in establishing common data formats, data
structure, and data-sharing processes (Aim 1). RTI will also facilitate scheduled data monitoring
and analysis as well as dissemination of Consortium results (Aim 2). RTI will promote research
efficiency and foster collaboration by establishing a centralized structure for scientific,
administrative, and logistical operations (Aim 3). Finally, RTI will maximize the scientific impact
of Consortium data by facilitating data sharing and developing best practice guidelines to
optimize use of the data by the broader scientific community (Aim 4). Our DCC team will be led
by a developmental psychopathologist with extensive data coordination experience and data
integration and harmonization science. The broader team will comprise experienced leaders of
multi-site studies and experts in consensus building, data harmonization, and preteen suicidal
thoughts and behaviors for this age group. Core leaders, key staff, and consultants will bring
robust data harmonization and data science approaches interwoven with a deep understanding
of preteen suicide and suicide multidisciplinary science. We offer proven computational
infrastructure and statistical expertise to support all the required data management and analysis
needs for the Consortium. RTI will back this project with its unsurpassed experience and
proficiency—born from successful leadership of over 40 other coordinating centers—to support
and accomplish these aims. Collectively, we are well prepared to help NIMH and the
Consortium to produce data and best practices for the research community studying preteen
suicide risk and protective factors across developmental trajectories that are sensitive to all
youth, including those in underrepresented and under-resourced contexts."
10983593,"ABSTRACT: Approximately 1.6 million children access the healthcare system through Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) each year in the U.S. Despite an absence of validated EMS triage tools, 30% of all children
are left at the scene, while many low acuity children are transported to an emergency department (ED)
unnecessarily. This non-standardized EMS approach results in both under-triage and over-triage of children.
The use of EMS for non-emergent complaints is unsafe because it causes delays in EMS response times for
other patients and exacerbates ED overcrowding.
Current EMS triage tools were not designed to identify
children who can be safely managed without emergent transport to the ED. There is an urgent need for a
pediatric EMS risk assessment tool (similar to the Emergency Severity Index [ESI] ED triage score developed
with support from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ]). The Pediatric Observation Priority
Score (POPS) was developed to identify children at low risk of deterioration in emergency settings. POPS has
been validated in EDs with moderate/excellent inter-rater reliability between different healthcare professionals
and is used in some EMS agencies in the United Kingdom. The acceptability and accuracy of the POPS tool in
EMS is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine and pilot-test the POPS tool for use by EMS
clinicians. This will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) identify factors associated with under-
triage for children not transported by EMS; (2) optimize the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the
POPS tool with clinical end-users; and (3) assess the refined POPS tool through simulation and field pilot
studies. Aim 1 will be conducted in a multisite retrospective analysis linking EMS records and Medicaid Claims
data (a high-risk population). The POPS tool will be refined by incorporating factors found to be associated with
under-triage. Aim 2 will be addressed using a mixed-methods approach with EMS clinicians. The POPS tool
will be refined and iteratively assessed before pilot testing. Aim 3 will involve assessing the refined POPS tool
in simulations with EMS clinicians and a feasibility field pilot test linking POPS scores with patient outcomes.
These studies will generate preliminary data on tool accuracy and under and over-triage rates, leading to a
national effectiveness trial of the refined POPS tool. A validated pediatric screening tool would enable urgently
needed studies of EMS innovations (including treatment in place, telemedicine, and integration of primary care)
for children, an AHRQ priority population. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Caleb Ward, is an early career
physician-scientist with a strong clinical background in pediatrics, emergency medicine, and EMS. This award
will foster his development as a researcher with content expertise in large database analytics, multisite EMS
research, and implementation science. A mentorship team with expertise in these content areas will support
Dr. Ward as he completes these research aims and related career development activities to ensure his
transition to research independence."

This proposal outlines the five-year research and career development plans for the PI, Stephen P. Persaud,
MD, PhD, who is preparing for a career as an academic physician-scientist. Dr. Persaud completed his MD
and PhD in immunology in 2015 at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM), then completed his
residency in Clinical Pathology in 2018 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital as part of the Pathology Physician Scientist
Training Program. During his residency elective time, he began postdoctoral research in the lab of John
DiPersio, MD, PhD, in the Oncology Division of the Department of Medicine at WUSM. Dr. DiPersio is an
expert in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), normal and malignant hematopoiesis,
and cellular immunotherapy, and has an outstanding track record of training successful physician-scientists.
The exemplary scientific resources and environment provided by the DiPersio lab and WUSM, combined with
the mentoring and training plans described herein, will enhance Dr. Persaud’s research program and advance
his progress towards becoming an independent investigator. The long-term goal of the proposed research
is to optimize HSCT conditioning, stem cell mobilization, and therapeutic gene editing to safely enable
transplantation for non-malignant hematologic diseases, particularly sickle cell disease (SCD). Dr.
Persaud published the first study showing that CD45- or cKit-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
combined with Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitors could enable fully MHC-mismatched HSCT in mice. This
work was the DiPersio lab’s first contribution to the antibody-based conditioning field and gave rise to several
successful projects, including 1) development of fully myeloablative ADCs suitable for HSCT conditioning in the
context of leukemia therapy, 2) the combination of anti-CD47/cKit antibodies with JAK1/2 inhibitors for toxin-
free allo-HSCT conditioning, and 3) development of a novel streptavidin-based platform for rapid ADC
production and screening. Dr. Persaud will build on this body of work in this proposal via two Specific Aims,
which focus on overcoming the major hurdles to autologous gene therapy for SCD. In Aim 1, he will evaluate
novel stem cell mobilization regimens combining VLA-4 and CXCR4 inhibition and assess their ability to
generate a sufficient quantity and quality of stem cells for autologous gene therapy compared to standard-of-
care regimens. In Aim 2, Dr. Persaud will optimize toxin-free conditioning with anti-CD47/cKit antibodies for
transplantation and cure of SCD, including the development of novel bispecific CD47 x cKit antibodies.
Collectively, these studies will explore the basic biology and translational potential of several novel approaches
for improving the safety and efficacy of HSCT. Although this proposal focuses on autologous gene therapy for
SCD, the work has important implications for both autologous and allogeneic transplantation for malignant and
non-malignant diseases alike. Finally, the research will advance Dr. Persaud’s primary goal of building a
research program dedicated to maximizing the therapeutic benefit of HSCT while minimizing injury to the host."
10984825,"ABSTRACT: Maternal mortality (MM) and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) have been on the rise, and racial
disparities are widening. Rochester is the city with the highest Black MM/SMM rates in the state of New York,
and Black women are 2 to 3 times more likely to die and to have severe morbidities associated with pregnancy.
Researchers continue work towards assessing these disparities and identifying modifiable structural and social
factors to improve pregnancy outcomes for Black women and birthing persons, while communities are called to
action to address disparities in MM/SMM. Our local community efforts include the initiatives of the Consortium
to End Black Maternal Mortality, created in 2019 (PCORI funded project) to engage multiple stakeholders in the
quest to understand local disparities and create a research agenda to inform local programs. Our initial project
consisted of conducting listening sessions with Black women in Rochester to understand their experiences with
the perinatal care system (Alio et al, 2022). Mothers identified their partners/infants’ fathers’ support as an
important factor influencing their experiences with perinatal care. In the literature, the emotional, physical and
financial support of fathers during pregnancy has been associated with improved birth outcomes, especially
among Black women. However, little is known about the role of fathers in helping to reduce MMM/SMM.
Fathers/partners are an untapped source of emotional and logistical support during perinatal care, and their
involvement may have indirect impact on MM/SMM, and longer-term benefits for the family. Furthermore, fathers
can serve as advocates for their birthing partner, and allies in the care of women during the perinatal period. We
build upon the work of our community Consortium to continue our efforts to understand the experiences of Black
parents and identify specific areas for intervention. Supplementing our data on Black women, this study aims to
explore Black fathers’ experiences with perinatal care, and their potential role in mitigating these dire outcomes.
Like our study with Black women (N=44), we will conduct listening sessions with 40 Black fathers and individual
interviews with 20 Black fathers in Rochester, NY, to explore their group and individual experiences with perinatal
care and understand their potential role as advocates for mothers and allies in perinatal care (AIM 1). We will
then merge results of LS with existing data from Black women for an integrated, group dyadic analysis (AIM 2).
Additionally, we will compare data from LS with fathers with results from induvial interviews to assess differences
in themes from the two methods. Findings will provide a comprehensive picture of Black parents’/co-parents’
experiences with perinatal care. The socio ecological model will guide the identification of multi-level elements
of Black fathers’ experiences and allow for comparisons with women’s data, and for assessing couple’s
experiences. The patient experience framework will guide analysis of themes from both groups. Results will
inform local efforts to identify and address specific elements of perinatal care to increase equitable care for Black
women and to reduce MM /SMM."
10984333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is on the rise, and we are in dire need of effective
treatments. In AD, the spatiotemporal progression of tau pathology within the CNS remains the strongest
neuropathological correlate of cognitive impairment, thus constituting a likely effective treatment target ( long-
term goal). Compelling evidence supports a trans-synaptic framework for pathological tau spreading, driven
primarily by the propagation of toxic soluble tau oligomer (tauO) conformers between functionally connected
brain regions. Numerous investigations further postulate the influence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) on trans-
neuronal pathological tau spreading, while emerging evaluations of primary tauopathies (e.g. Primary Age
Related Tauopathy—PART), which lack Aβ, observe limited regional tau spreading alongside little-to-no
amnestic changes. Within the trans-synaptic spreading framework, however, the precise mechanisms by
which tauO selectively engage key synaptic subtypes (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory), and the role of Aβ in
this process, remain unknown. We thus hypothesize that Aβ modulates pathological tau spreading by
increasing oligomeric tau binding and internalization to vulnerable synapses. To support this hypothesis, we
provide novel preliminary evidence for increased binding and internalization of toxic tauO binding in the
presence of soluble Aβ oligomers in human synapses. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of AβO in
modulating synaptic tauO binding within a framework of cellular, regional and clinical resilience to
pathological tau burden. In Aim 2, we will determine key synaptic proteins that modulate the binding and/or
internalization of tauO in the presence and absence of AβO. To execute these aims, we have developed an
innovative and translationally relevant approach to interrogate mechanisms of tau binding directly in human
synapses isolated from post-mortem autopsy specimen using an array of biochemical techniques. At the
completion of this project, we expect to document previously unappreciated mechanisms that modulate
synaptic tauO binding and internalization—a key component of pathological tau spreading."

Severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) due to viral pathogens remains one of the most common causes
of death for young children worldwide. Current management of patients with viral-induced LRTI focuses on
supportive care, but outcomes may be improved by augmenting the host immune response to fight the virus and
regain immune homeostasis. A growing body of literature suggests that children with severe viral LRTI have an
impaired adaptive immune response, specifically decreased T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous cell population that expand during inflammatory
conditions and potently inhibit T cell proliferation and function. MDSC have been extensively studied in adult
oncologic populations where clinical trials show promising results of improved outcomes by inhibiting MDSC as
part of chemotherapy and anti-tumor vaccine treatment regimens. Our group has identified significant increases
in the frequency of MDSC populations in children with septic shock and COVID-19 and demonstrated
associations between increased percentages of MDSC and worse clinical outcomes. However, it is unknown
what role MDSC play in children with viral-induced severe LRTI. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify
MDSC as contributors to the immune response in children with viral LRTI and identify mechanistic pathways as
potential therapeutic targets for future investigations. Our central hypothesis is that increased frequency of
MDSC will be associated with worse clinical outcomes and decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells in children with viral LRTI, and that pediatric MDSC-induced T cell suppression is reversible
through inhibition of the PD-1 pathway. The proposed experiments will involve blood sampling of children
with PCR-confirmed viral LRTI to characterize the dynamics of MDSC and lymphocyte populations during
hospitalization. We will also use our in vitro model of MDSC induced from pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and select patient samples to establish the PD-1 pathway as an important mechanism of MDSC-mediated
inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine production in children. This career development award will generate
the necessary data to inform the design of future studies of the pediatric immune response in severe lower
respiratory tract infections and will equip me with the necessary tools to achieve independence as a patient-
oriented clinician-scientist."
10984778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Factors that lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs; i.e., passive or active suicidal ideation,
behaviors, plans, gestures, or attempts) are complex. An important factor in suicide deaths and attempts is
alcohol use; up to 36% of completed suicides involve acute alcohol use, while those with AUD may account for
up to 20-40% of suicides. Despite this relationship, processes that may underlie the two are unclear. A
common variable between alcohol use and STBs appears to be behavioral economic decision-making such as
delay discounting (i.e., devaluing a commodity as a function of time). However, other forms of discounting (i.e.,
probability; devaluing an outcome based on its likelihood, social; devaluing an outcome based on the
closeness of another) have not been explored. Other behavior economic decision-making, such as demand for
alcohol (i.e., continued purchasing and consumption a commodity as prices increase) has been related to
increased discounting. Furthermore, losses of close social supports, through suicide or overdose death, could
result in allocation towards further alcohol use, which could affect decision-making and therefore affect suicide
risk. Together, excessive discounting and demand with losses of social reinforcers might be markers for
suicide risk for those with excessive alcohol use. Behavioral economic decision-making has also been
predictive of engagement and success of substance use treatment. The contextualized reinforcer pathology
model allows for integration of these different factors to help better understand how alcohol use could influence
suicide risk, as well as who might engage in treatment for alcohol use. Therefore, the purpose of this proposed
K99/R00 is to determine relationships between alcohol use, behavioral economic decision-making,
bereavement, and STBs within a contextualized reinforcer pathology framework. In Study 1 (K99) this will first
be assessed within a group of adults with risky alcohol use (n = 100) to determine cross-sectional associations,
prevalence of STBs in this sample, and determine factors that predict engagement with a remote intervention
for alcohol and its effects on alcohol use. Participants will complete a baseline assessment and be given
access for remote, self-guided CBT4CBT modules for alcohol use. Participants will also complete three follow-
up assessments over three months to determine engagement with CBT4CBT and changes in alcohol use. In
Study 2 (R00), adults with risky alcohol use without current STBs (n = 100) and with current STBs (n = 100) will
be compared using a 2x2 design to further determine relationships between alcohol use and STBs (Study
2/R00). Half will be randomized to immediate access to CBT4CBT, while the other will be waitlist controls and
receive access 28 days later, with remaining procedures being similar to Study 1. This allows for determination
of predictors of engagement and efficacy of a remote intervention for alcohol use as a function of STBs. This
will allow the candidate to develop skills in alcohol use and STB research and initiate an independent career
path uncovering factors that underly the relationship between alcohol use and suicide risk."

Although many persons living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD)
prefer to remain at home as long as possible, they spend a great deal of time in institutional settings, such as
acute care hospitals, skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs), and long-term care nursing homes. Days spent at home
(DAH) has emerged as a person-centered outcome measure for AD/ADRD care, given that patients value DAH
more than other clinical outcome measures, including mortality and hospital readmission rates. However, there
is a lack of evidence regarding the role of clinicians and health care organizations in determining DAH in the
context of AD/ADRD care. This knowledge gap has hindered efforts to develop interventions that could
effectively optimize DAH among persons living with AD/ADRD.
Research has shown that certain physician, hospital, and SNF factors related to geriatric care are associated
with improved quality of care and patient outcomes for older adults, including subspecialty training in geriatrics,
interdisciplinary teams of clinicians, and greater experience with older populations (i.e., volume). Literature also
suggests that relationships between physicians, hospitals, and SNFs (e.g., health system) are associated with
better outcomes. However, studies have not focused on AD/ADRD care or investigated DAH; therefore, the
impact of such factors on DAH among persons living with AD/ADRD remains unknown, despite these factors
being particularly relevant due to the AD/ADRD population’s unique clinical needs.
We seek to examine the role of these factors in three important clinical settings using Medicare data linked to
other nationally representative data sets with the following aims: (1) determine the effect of physician factors
related to geriatric care(([1] subspecialty certification in geriatrics, [2] number of treated patients with
AD/ADRD, and [3] health system affiliation) on DAH among persons with AD/ADRD in the ambulatory care
setting (Aim 1); (2) determine the effect of hospital factors related to geriatric care ([1] staff-to-patient ratio of
interdisciplinary team members, [2] number of treated patients with AD/ADRD, and [3] participation in geriatric
programs) on DAH among persons with AD/ADRD who are discharged from an acute care hospital (Aim 2);
and (3) determine the effect of SNF factors related to geriatric care ([1] staff-to-patient ratio of interdisciplinary
team members, [2] number of treated patients with AD/ADRD, and [3] hospital-based status) on DAH among
persons with AD/ADRD who receive post-acute SNF care (Aim 3).
The proposed study will inform future policies to improve AD/ADRD care, such as providing incentives for
bolstering geriatric training, a higher case volume of patients with AD/ADRD, and interdisciplinary care."

Despite the wide availability of the antidote naloxone, fatal opioid overdoses still occur at a rate of ~50-70,000 /
year in the US. The problem is that naloxone requires a bystander to find and diagnose the overdose, find
someone who has naloxone, and then properly administer it. Unfortunately, if this does not occur within 5
minutes, the patient will suffer from brain damage, which is often considered the “hidden epidemic” underneath
the opioid death epidemic. Additionally, ~52% of opioid overdose deaths occur when the patient is totally
alone, without nearby bystanders around.
To solve these problems, here we introduce the DOVE device, which is an armband that detects an opioid
overdose via pulse oximetry and accelerometry, and then automatically injects an antidote. Our collaboration
between industry and academia has already moved forward the DOVE technology significantly: We published
a paper showing 76% of persons who use opioids (PWUOs) (n=97) expressed a strong desire for a device like
DOVE, and showed a strong preference for an armband over many other device designs. We next
preliminarily validated the other technical challenges of DOVE: we showed our sensor’s accuracy was high on
healthy volunteers with induced hypoventilation; and our autoinjector injected reproducibly into bench-top
models of skin/fat/muscle. Additionally we validated the market, reimbursement, sales channels,
freedom-to-operate, and regulatory path.
In this STTR grant, we will optimize & test the 3 major components of DOVE (harness, sensor, and injector): In
Aim 1, we will optimize and validate the harness which keeps the device position on the deltoid muscle. We
will do this with structured interviews and observations of PWUOs interacting with each of 6 harness
prototypes. In Aim 2 we will test if the DOVE sensor can accurately detect hypoxemia in sleeping patients.
Overdose events are relatively rare, so to increase the probability of detecting hypoxia using the DOVE’s pulse
oximeter, we will apply 2 DOVE pulse-oximeter prototypes (a finger-ring, and one placed on the shoulder skin)
to 20 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients already undergoing sleep studies. We will compare the DOVE’s
pulse oximeter and accelerometry traces vs. those of FDA-approved devices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will optimize
the DOVE auto-injector to meet the size & shape constraints specified by PWUOs, and to accurately inject into
fresh, cadaveric pigs."
10987954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myelin—the electrical insulator around neuronal axons—is essential in vertebrates for rapid nerve signaling,
and its loss in diseases like multiple sclerosis and following injury causes severe disability in patients. In the
central nervous system, oligodendrocytes build myelin by first extending their membrane processes to
ensheath axons, then wrapping spirally around the axon while compacting their membranes to become
electrically insulating. In chronic multiple sclerosis lesions, oligodendrocytes ensheath axons but fail to wrap,
suggesting that wrapping is a rate-limiting step for remyelination. To ultimately understand why remyelination
fails in multiple sclerosis, we first aim to understand the mechanism by which myelin wraps normally. It was
long hypothesized that the assembly of actin filaments provides the force required to drive wrapping, like the
lamellipodium of a motile cell or a neuronal growth cone. However, we and others recently discovered that the
dramatic disassembly of the oligodendrocyte actin cytoskeleton is required for wrapping. This finding was
completely unexpected and suggests two models for wrapping. Cycles of actin disassembly and reassembly
could be required to “ratchet” the oligodendrocyte membrane forward. In contrast, based on our preliminary
data, we propose that actin disassembly acts as a “trigger” to initiate actin-independent wrapping and that the
major role of actin disassembly is to allow myelin to compact. To test these models, we are using a suite of
innovative approaches including first-in-class genetic tools we created to experimentally induce actin
disassembly (DeActs) or block actin disassembly (StablActs) in oligodendrocytes during wrapping in vivo,
advanced microscopy techniques to resolve myelin in vivo, and live cell imaging of oligodendrocytes in culture.
Our preliminary data demonstrate: (1) actin filaments disassemble in oligodendrocytes prior to wrapping, (2)
experimentally inducing actin disassembly specifically in oligodendrocytes in vivo increases myelin wrapping,
and (3) experimentally blocking actin disassembly impairs myelin membrane compaction in a culture model of
myelination. These data support the “trigger” model of myelin wrapping, laying the foundation for future
translational studies to test whether this actin disassembly-based mechanism is recapitulated or perturbed
during remyelination. By defining the role of actin disassembly in myelin wrapping and compaction, this project
will open up new research directions towards understanding myelin formation, plasticity, and disease in the
central nervous system."

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a fatty liver disease with dysregulated metabolic phenotype
but without excessive alcohol consumption and is a significant public health concern worldwide. The
pathogenesis of MAFLD involve multiple cell types and usually accompanied by decreased metabolic capacity
as well as increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver. The intestinal environment (i.e., gut
microbiome, host intestinal cell types) also contributes to MAFLD via the gut-liver axis. MAFLD has traditionally
been linked to nutritional imbalances, such as a western diet (WD). However, the pathogenesis of complex
metabolic disorders, such as MAFLD, is rarely caused by only one risk factor. Early life exposure to
environmental stressors is an emerging contributor to the delayed onset of metabolic diseases later in life. Among
various environmental stressors, epidemiological and animal studies showed that legacy and current-use flame
retardants (i.e., polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs] and tetrabromobisphenol A [TBBPA]) are associated
with altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which are hallmarks of MAFLD. PBDEs and TBBPA can activate
important xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors, namely the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive
androstane receptor (CAR) in the liver and intestine. PBDEs and TBBPA are enriched in breast milk and can
cross the placenta making neonates especially susceptible to flame retardant-induced toxicities. I demonstrated
that neonatal exposure to BDE-99 (i.e., human breast milk enriched PBDE congener) persistently up-regulated
proinflammation- but down-regulated lipid metabolism-related genes in mouse livers, which was accompanied
by a dysbiotic gut microbiome at young adulthood. Furthermore, I observed immune cell infiltration in the liver
with compromised xenobiotic and lipid metabolism pathways in hepatocytes at later adulthood from neonatal
exposure to BDE-99. Large intestinal microbiota transplantation using donors that were neonatally exposed to
BDE-99 showed altered the immunological landscape of the gut environment towards proinflammation in the
germ-free recipients, suggesting the involvement of the gut microbiome in the dysregulated gut-liver axis later in
life. Building on these findings, my central hypothesis is that early life exposure to legacy and current use flame
retardants predisposes MAFLD development later in life, modulated by the gut microbiome. Specifically, the
flame retardant-induced proinflammatory gut environment leads to the exacerbation of liver injuries later in life
by. I will use a novel humanized transgenic mouse model with human PXR and CAR as well as their targeted
human CYP3A genes to test my hypothesis with 2 specific aims: 1) early life PBDE or TBBPA exposure
exacerbates MAFLD following WD; 2) altered gut environment from early life toxicant exposure critically
regulates aggravation of WD induced MAFLD. The proposed work lay the foundation for how the gut microbiome,
environmental stressors, and secondary risk factors interact in complex diseases."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite
advances in both diagnostic and therapy, a large inter-individual variability in therapy response and diagnostic
accuracy can be observed. The optimization of medical imaging agents in CRC is a critical component for
improving our technical capabilities relating to early diagnostics, complete labeling of tumor-positive tissue for
surgical resection, surveillance, and precision therapy. One major requirement for improving the clinical
performance of therapeutics and medical imaging agents is the characterization of structural and functional
chemistries in cancerous tissue that are either different from or absent in normal tissue. This is especially
important in regions that may not be sufficiently labeled by existing imaging agents with a clinically acceptable
and implementable signal-to-background ratio. In these cases, curative surgical intervention achieves mixed
success in the CRC patient population due to the technical inability to label accurately and precisely tumor-
positive tissues. Moreover, these differences may potentially explain the clinically observed variation in patient
therapy response and disease aggressiveness.
To develop a computational workflow that integrates CODEX imaging with high-dimensional hyperspectral
chemical mapping and test my hypothesis, my experimental structure is divided into two main components. (1)
I will perform preliminary non-destructive, label-free spatiochemical imaging on normal and CRC patient biopsies
to identify differences in the functional heterogenous chemistries. (2) I will perform spatial omic identification of
CRC related tissue architectures using CODEX for integration with the high-dimensional label-free 2D infrared
spectral maps.
The innovation of this research is the development of the computational workflow and framework that integrates
highly multiplexed CODEX with high-dimensional label-free 2D hyperspectral chemical imaging. This approach
can lead an alternative representation of physicochemical tissue properties for the characterization and
identification of spatiochemistries relevant to CRC and its tumor-invasive front. Long-term, this can be used in
the future to guide the development and optimization of cancer imaging agents to improve patient overall
outcomes."

diabetes mellitus (DM) individually have considerable morbidity & mortality, they often occur together, worsening
adverse outcomes, quality of life, & care costs. This is especially true as the AD/DM combination creates a
complex balancing act of med management & symptom monitoring in older populations. While the goal is to
keep older adults with dementia at home as long as possible, these challenges lead to untold personal & family
suffering, as well as billions in potentially avoidable healthcare costs annually.
 The HiDO-ALZ platform will solve these challenges by automating medication administration for PwD to
eliminate mismanagement, decrease caregiver burden, reduce healthcare utilization, and facilitate PwD to age
in place. HiDO is being developed as an automated, AI driven medication dispensing and direct observation
platform to optimize adherence. The device integrates medication dispensing, dose administration time,
medication synchronization, & pair of front-facing cameras to validate the right meds, right route, right time, right
dosage to the right patient (5R’s). Cameras record every dose using facial recognition & provide real-time
medication consumption recordings. Through cloud connectivity, providers & caregivers have access to video
observation logs, dose administration time, adherence trends, & longitudinal adherence via web dashboard.
Patients & caregivers can easily setup complex medication protocols in minutes using a smartphone app. The
device then alerts patients and dispenses up to 7 different types of meds simultaneously, with up to 90 days of
medication. Connected data sources including remote blood pressure and weight measurements, as well as
electronic health record lab results and videoconferencing integrate in a single dashboard.
 The project will build on successful Phase I, in which the medication dispensing unit was updated with
modifications for dementia, passed all bench testing, and was successfully validated in pilot usability with
dementia subjects. Phase II will expand the foundation with four Aims: 1) Enhance device with remote sensors
for diabetes management, expanded data integration, and video conferencing, 2) Test enhanced platform for
usability in dementia subjects, 3) Transition the design to formal manufacturing process to ensure system meets
performance standards and regulatory requirements & produce pre-production devices for testing, & 4) Conduct
in-home clinical trial to demonstrate adherence and efficacy."
11003945,"ABSTRACT: Approximately 2.2 million Americans suffer from liver cirrhosis [1, 2]. Approximately 60%
of cirrhosis patients will progress into advanced stage cirrhosis with ascites, an accumulation of fluid in the
peritoneal cavity, which is associated with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and decreased
survival [4-8]. Ascites is treated with a salt restricted diet and pharmacologic therapy using diuretics,
however, 5% to 10% of these patients become refractory to medical therapy [7]. Half of patients who
develop refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis will die within a year without a liver transplant and
therefore expedited referral for liver transplantation is recommended. Temporary treatment while waiting
includes large volume paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and
peritoneovenous shunt surgical procedures. Complications from these procedures that can further increase
mortality include paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD), bacterial peritonitis, and chronic
hepatic encephalopathy from TIPS. Pharmacological therapies that can stop the progression or extend
survival and function as a therapeutic bridge to liver transplantation are thus desperately needed.
Terlipressin is an inactive pro-drug of Lysine-vasopressin (LVP, a V1a full agonist) that releases active LVP
slowly to minimize LVP spike that can cause ischemic side effect. In a tightly controlled dosing and
monitoring this V1a agonist can reduce portal vein pressure, restores hemodynamic balance, and is an
effective treatment for portal hypertension driven ascites. Terlipressin is better tolerated and has a far
better safety profile than human native vasopressin ([8-Arg] vasopressin). Terlipressin has been available
in Europe for the past twenty years and more recently in the US; it is one of the most cost-effective drugs
for treating bleeding varices and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), with well documented improvement in
survival rates. Despite its good safety profile, the use of terlipressin is currently limited to the acute care
setting because the short half-life (reports vary from 8-50 min average) that necessitates administration by
IV bolus injection every 4-6h. We developed a new terlipressin derivative, PHIN-214, which slowly releases
V1a partial agonist into the blood, and to a much lesser extent under the skin. PHIN-214 is effective in
reducing portal pressure in a rat model of portal hypertension and can be administered subcutaneously as
a bolus once a day without causing skin necrosis (in animals and human patients). Along with a wider
therapeutic index than Terlipressin, PHIN-214 significantly increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on
Child’s Pugh A patients and highly anticipated to prevent progression of the disease to Hepatorenal
Syndrome (HRS). This product has the potential to be a significant market opportunity in the U.S.,
especially in an outpatient setting (which will reduce overall health care cost by eliminating cost of
hospitalization) for the treatment of refractory ascites from cirrhosis-induced portal hypertension ascites.
PHIN-214 demonstrated a substantially longer blood presence than terlipressin, without causing severe
vasoconstriction that can affect the heart. This proposal is intended to request additional funding to
produce more GMP materials and additional chronic or extended animal toxicology studies that are needed
to enable the upcoming Phase 2 efficacy and pivotal clinical trials.

11006727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 is the leading cause of recurrent genital herpes which can have severe
physical and psychosocial consequences. The mainline therapy to treat HSV infection, acyclovir, is still
inadequate as it only shortens the duration of lesions during primary or recurrent disease by a few days at
best. Furthermore, while long-term therapy can limit the frequency of lesions, it only reduces the likelihood of
transmission to a sexual partner by about 50%. Most importantly, acyclovir only suppresses viral replication,
but it does not eliminate latent HSV harbored by ganglionic neurons, which is the source for recurrent disease.
Thus, once treatment is stopped viral replication can begin again. We have developed a potentially curative
therapy for latent HSV infection, based on gene editing using HSV-specific meganucleases. Our original work
focused on the treatment of infections and pathogenesis caused by HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and demonstrated
that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of anti-HSV-1 meganucleases eliminated up to 97% of
latent HSV DNA from ganglia in animal models of latent HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, we showed that this
reduction in ganglionic viral load led to a reduction or even elimination of peripheral virus shedding. In this
Phase I STTR proposal, we plan to extend our anti-HSV gene editing strategy to target HSV-2, the leading
cause of genital herpes. After in vitro selection of a highly active and specific anti-HSV-2 meganuclease, we
will demonstrate its activity in an in vivo guinea pig model of HSV-2 infection, and carefully evaluate the safety
and tolerability of this approach. There is tremendous patient interest in potentially curative therapies, and with
approximately 20 million people infected with HSV-2 in the US alone, the potential impact of a successful
therapy is enormous.
 Specific Aim 1. Select a lead anti-HSV-2 meganuclease variant. We used our established informed
randomized mutagenesis and selection approach to generate 6 lead candidate meganucleases recognizing
HSV-2 as determined by yeast surface display and in vitro cleavage assays. These candidates will be further
assessed and validated using a mammalian cell reporter system for on- and off-target activity, to select a lead
meganuclease for further in vivo development.
 Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate meganuclease antiviral activity in the guinea pig model of HSV-2
infection. The meganuclease showing the best activity and specificity will then be evaluated in the guinea
model of HSV-2 infection for its ability to reduce ganglionic load and HSV shedding and symptomatic disease.
We will also carefully examine treated animals for general tolerability and evidence of therapy-associated
genotoxicity, specifically off-target activity, chromosomal translocations, and integration of sequences in host
genomes."

 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) hierarchy of controls (HoC) certification
programs encompass in-classroom, online, and hybrid training methods. This requires instructors to deliver
PowerPoint or video-based hands-on exercises that fail to meaningfully engage or immerse trainees. Hands-on
and paper-based training methods cannot adequately represent physics-based concepts, such as differences
between particulate matter and droplets, or more complex activities, such as how to make the determination of
hazardous materials on a site and then establish an exclusion zone. These necessary training activities currently
require trainees to complete the targeted steps using only their imaginations. Trainees are poorly served by this
roleplay approach of complex and potentially lifesaving skills. This current approach provides neither immersive
environments nor supportive learning for adults. Therefore, emergency response training organizations need a
cost-effective training solution that increases the stakes, authenticity, and engagement of simulations to better
equip trainees to remain safe and effective when in the field.
 Based on our successful Phase I demonstration of feasibility, Charles River Analytics, in partnership with
The New England Consortium and Lt. Mike Kates of the Boston Fire Department, proposes to develop and
evaluate a full-scope Immersive Modular Preparedness Intelligent Tutor for the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (IMPRINT NIOSH). IMPRINT NIOSH aims to provide a robust, commercially
viable, portable virtual reality (VR) solution that will be complemented by an intelligent virtual training system and
development framework that actively improves trainees’ ability to perform HoC procedures within a range of
engaging and realistic case studies, field scenarios, modules, and activities. IMPRINT NIOSH will include an
intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that guides training via the untethered Meta Quest VR headset to provide an
immersive, personalized experience. With IMPRINT NIOSH, trainees can overcome complex, dangerous
situations in a safe, controlled environment through guided and immersive procedure rehearsal. Trainees will be
accompanied throughout their experience with a virtual “training buddy” that employs adult learning theory in the
context of lessons to enhance training outcomes. In Phase II, we will produce a system that complements existing
training with a library of VR training modules and natural interactions, including locomotion and haptics that
replace or augment current scenario-based activities.

11006736,"Project Summary
BackStop Neural proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel paddle-type epidural stimulation lead to
relieve chronic arm and neck pain. To date, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used primarily to treat
chronic back and leg pain, which require placement of electrodes in the thoracic region of the spine. Although
a few studies have also shown that SCS is effective in treating chronic arm and neck pain, current
commercial leads are not well suited to placement in the cervical spine. Percutaneous leads suffer from high
lead migration rates, a key issue for cervical placement. Paddle leads offer lower risk of migration but are ~2
mm thick, making placement in the narrow cervical epidural space difficult. In this Phase I SBIR project,
BackStop Neural will scale our softening electrode arrays validated in rats to human-sized epidural leads that
are 10× thinner than commercially available leads yet stiff enough for established surgical implantation
techniques. These leads are capable of softening and conforming to the spinal cord once implanted in the
body providing positional stability that limits migration and provides chronic, effective stimulation. We build on
preliminary data showing effective cervical stimulation in rats for 4 months using softening electrode arrays,
conformation of paddles to rat and human cadaver spinal cords, hydrolytic stability of newly developed
softening polymer chemistries, and preliminary biocompatibility and electrode fabrication on these re-
formulated softening polymers. The first aim of this grant is to design and fabricate a 16-channel, 0.2 mm
thick human-sized softening paddle lead. The main outcomes are a 10× change in modulus from dry, 25 °C
conditions to wet, 37 °C conditions, electrode charge storage capacities of at least 2 mC/cm2, and fully
packaged lead resistance of < 20 ohms. The second aim will demonstrate the mechanical and electrical
stability of the epidural leads using tensile, lead body flex, connector flex, and current pulsing testing. The
metrics of success will be a < 20% change in electrode impedance following tensile testing to the earlier of
5N or 20% elongation, 100,000 cycles of lead body bending 90° (+0° / -5°) in each direction, and 100,000
cycles of connector bending 45° ±2° in each direction, and < 20% change in charge injection capacity over a
billion stimulation pulses. The third aim will demonstrate the biocompatibility and surgical feasibility of the
epidural leads using ISO 10993 cytotoxicity, intracutaneous, systemic toxicity, and ASTM hemolysis studies
and a pilot sheep study (n=2) conducted at NAMSA. The main outcomes are passing all ISO biocompatibility
tests, minimal inflammation and fibrous capsule formation at 21 days, and confirmation of the mechanical and
electrical integrity of leads via visual inspection, cyclic voltammetry, and electrical impedance spectroscopy
after explant. Successful completion of Phase I aims will enable Phase II efforts in full SCS system testing
with implantable pulse generators, advancing regulatory efforts with the FDA, and full biocompatibility and
large animal study testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy for our regulatory submission."
11007923,"ABSTRACT
 The persistence of latently infected memory CD4+ T cells releasing a low-level trickling of viral RNAs and
proteins in people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) provides a strong rationale for the
development of cure strategies. HIV functional cure approaches are being explored, at the transcriptional level,
to achieve sustained ART-free viral remission that would result from epigenetic changes over time. These
approaches are supported by evidence in PLWH who spontaneously control their viral load below the limit of
detection, in the absence of ART (elite controllers, ECs). These ECs were shown to have a large proportion of
their proviruses in condensed chromatin (heterochromatin) loci, with virus refractory to reactivation.
 The chromatin environment surrounding the HIV promoter is believed to be regulated by host transcription
factors, host chromatin remodelers and the viral Tat protein. Our hypothesis is that the pioneer factor (PF) family
may also remodel the HIV locus chromatin, via their unique epigenetic modulator properties, resulting in the
regulation of HIV transcription. PFs play critical roles in chromatin remodeling, mostly during development and
disease phenotypes. Unique properties of PFs include 1) trigger assembly of regulatory factors on target DNA
in heterochromatin; 2) bookmark genes for rapid reactivation/repression and 3) induce persistent epigenetic
modulation of the cellular chromatin. A few PFs were reported to modulate HIV latency and persistence in primary
CD4+ T cells but were poorly studied mechanistically. Preliminary data using shRNAs targeting 13 PFs in the
HIV latently infected CD4+ T cells, revealed 3 novel hits that hindered HIV transcription. This data further
highlights the significance of uncovering the role played by the PFs on HIV transcription in CD4+ T cells, with the
long-term goal to harness them for HIV cure approaches and/or diagnostic purposes. Here, we propose to:
Aim 1. Screen a shRNAmir library targeting 31 PFs (and controls) by flow cytometry, taking advantage of
the HIV reporter pMorpheus-V5 vector in Jurkat T cells. This vector allows the distinction of productively infected,
latently infected, and uninfected cells. The shRNAmir relative abundance in these populations will reflect their
activity on HIV transcription. The follow-up of the candidates will be based namely on reproducibility and novelty.
 Aim 2. Validate the hits identified in preliminary data and Aim 1. Their activity will be confirmed in cell line
models of latency with different HIV transcriptional environments, and in primary blood CD4+ T cells from
uninfected and virally suppressed ART treated female and male donors since estrogen modulates certain PFs’
activity. Their impact on CD4+ T cell proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity will also be measured.
 Aim 3. Characterize the 3 hits identified in preliminary data. Their recruitment to the host/HIV promoters
(ChIP-Seq analysis), their modulation of the HIV chromatin (MNase nucleosomal mapping, enChIP-MS) and
transcriptional regulation (RNA Seq analysis) in cell models of HIV latency will be studied for their comprehensive
transcriptional regulatory profiling. Cell based- and in vitro- assays will define their dependence to HIV Tat."

Adolescents & young adults (AYA) accounted for >400,000 new HIV infections in 2021 worldwide. Heavy
alcohol use is a prevalent and strong modifiable risk factor for HIV transmission risk behavior in Uganda.
Studies from in high-income countries show that AYA often misperceive peer norms around health and health
risk behavior and that these misperceptions increase risk behavior and impede health behavior. While these
perceptions are modifiable risk factors, few studies of AYA in southern & eastern Africa describe how
misperceptions of peer norms drive alcohol use and HIV/STI transmission risk and prevention behavior and
associated health outcomes nor address how to change misperceived norms. The central hypotheses of this
application are that AYA in rural Uganda frequently misperceive peer norms about alcohol consumption and
HIV/STI prevention; that these misperceptions affect their own propensities to engage in HIV/STI transmission
risk behavior; and that perceived norms are malleable when AYA receive information about actual peer norms
that conflicts with personal perceptions and behavior. These hypotheses have been formulated based on
preliminary data showing that AYA in rural Uganda misperceive norms about alcohol use and HIV/STI
transmission risk behavior, a finding that is consistent with other preliminary data demonstrating similar
phenomena among adults in this context. The preliminary data are also consistent with published trials from
the U.S., UK, and elsewhere showing that AYA misperceptions can be altered through “personalized normative
feedback” and other norms correction interventions wherein they are provided with correct information about
actual norms. The team has engaged local leaders & educators in Mbarara, Uganda to propose a population-
based cohort study, in which they will embed a randomized controlled trial, of AYA in 3 secondary schools to
achieve three specific aims: 1) Use qualitative methods to explore perceived norms around alcohol, HIV/STI
transmission risk behavior, and HIV/STI prevention among AYA in Mbarara, Uganda; 2) Estimate the causal
effects of perceived norms around alcohol use and HIV/STI transmission risk behavior on HIV/STI prevention
among AYA; and, 3) Conduct a mixed-methods, randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary efficacy and
mediating mechanism of a personalized normative feedback intervention on behavioral intentions, heavy
alcohol use, and HIV/STI prevention among AYA. The key innovation is that this study will be the first to
rigorously estimate the causal influence of perceived peer norms around alcohol and HIV/STI transmission risk
behavior on HIV/STI prevention among AYA in Africa. The study will have significant public health impact by
laying the foundation for strategies to focus on changing misperceived norms to influence HIV/STI prevention
uptake among AYA throughout eastern & southern Africa."
11007926,"Hijacking the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) to degrade undruggable proteins has launched a new era of
targeted protein degradation (TPD). Two main drug modalities in TPD field are PROTACs (PROteolysis
TArgeting Chimeras) and MGs (Molecular Glues). MGs and PROTACs both function by inducing proximity
between an E3 ligase and target protein for event driven proteolysis. While PROTACs are heterobifunctional
molecules with a distinct ligand that target a specific E3 ligase linked to another ligand specific for the target
protein, MGs function by inducing target-ligase interactions by bridging protein-protein interfaces. Molecular
glues have significant advantage over PROTACs as they adhere more closely to conventional small molecule
design principles making them suitable for many therapeutic applications including CNS diseases. Unlike
conventional small molecule inhibitors, MGs are not ‘occupancy driven’ they function at sub-stoichiometric levels
for degradation efficiency at exceptionally low doses. Because ubiquitin proteasome system is a complex multi-
step process that involves multiple enzymes, development of molecular glues by structure-based design or
monitoring proximity of proteins or analyzing degradation of target has been challenging and full of artifacts. Over
past few years multiple studies suggest that protein degradability is heavily influenced by protein-intrinsic
features, especially the protein’s endogenous “ubiquitination potential”. Novel approaches that identify chemical
modulators to induce not only proximity but also induce ubiquitination of native endogenous protein targets will
be a game changer in the field of TPD. The current proposal describes simple and high-throughput ubiquitination
assay, that can be applied invitro and in cells to expand drug discovery enterprise to rationally design molecular
glues. The proposed approach will rely on monitoring true function of a molecular glue i.e., compound mediated
ubiquitination of target protein without need for adding external tags to target proteins. We propose to integrate
split luciferase approach with LifeSensors’ TUBEs (tandem ubiquitin binding entities) technology to accurately
monitor ubiquitination of target proteins without the need for external tags on target proteins that might render
false positives. Our ability to understand nature and type of compound mediated poly-ubiquitination will provide
mechanistic information, enabling medicinal chemists to rationally design reliable SAR. Development of the
technology platforms will dramatically speed up the discovery and clinical development of this class of protein
degraders."

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence is rising globally and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs)
have shown some success in relieving the symptoms of IBD. However, LBP efficacy has been limited in part due
to inadequate engraftment and colonization. Novel technologies are needed to identify and address the factors
limiting the engraftment and efficacy of LBPs in the clinic. Lytic and lysogenic phage predation has the potential
to inhibit the colonization of LBP strains and obstruct their engraftment. Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems, while
extensively used for genome engineering, provide adaptive immunity against phage predation by degrading
foreign DNA in a programmable and sequence specific manner. Thus, the addition of a rationally designed
CRISPR-Cas system to an LBP can provide phage immunity and support bacterial survival in the presence of
phage predation. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is an LBP with a long history of human use for a variety of
applications, including treatment of UC and as a chassis for the delivery of therapeutic payloads. However, like
most LBPs, EcN variably engrafts in patients, which can limit its utility in the clinic. We have identified and isolated
EcN phages from stool samples of patients with UC, and further validated the existence of these phages in in
vitro experiments. This work suggests that these phages could directly prevent the survival and efficacy
of this therapeutically significant strain in the clinic.
 Ancilia Bioscience’s long-term goal is to harness CRISPR’s natural function to develop a new class of
LBPs with enhanced engraftment and therapeutic efficacy. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve
EcN colonization in the presence of phage. Our central hypothesis is that phages can directly prevent the
therapeutic efficacy of LBPs. By strategically engineering CRISPR, we can immunize EcN to robustly colonize
the intestinal tract and increase bacterial engraftment. This proposal aims to investigate phage immunity as a
method to augment EcN therapeutic efficacy and fitness in the context of IBD. These studies will be executed
by Ancilia Biosciences through collaborations with Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou, Todd R. Klaenhammer
Distinguished Professor at NC State University, and Dr. Casey Theriot, Associate Professor in Infectious
Disease at NC State University. Furthermore, we expect these results to establish the feasibility of engineering
CRISPR-Cas immunity for improved bacterial engraftment to enable the therapeutic efficacy and
commercialization of LBPs for a range of applications."

Chronic, or non-healing wounds are defined as wounds that are present at 4-weeks after wounding.
Older adults are at significant risk for non-healing wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and
diabetic foot ulcers, owing to underlying metabolic disease (diabetes), persistent pressure (immobility)
and vascular complications (reduced arterial or venous flow). Non-healing wounds affect ~ 8.2 million
Medicare beneficiaries in the United States with costs of up to ~$97 billion. Data from 38 studies across
11 countries suggest a prevalence of pressure ulcers of up to 26% among in-patients, and up to 53.2%
of older adults living in nursing homes suggesting significant impacts from friction/pressure mediated
effects. The 5-year survival rate for diabetic foot ulcers (~31%) is similar to that of cancer. For each of
these classes of non-healing wounds in elderly patients, timely identification and intervention,
particularly within an initial 12-week window, is essential to ensuring better outcomes. Current wound
assessment technology has been limited to imaging methods such as x-ray, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to determine wound structure, and laboratory tests of exudate samples or biopsied
tissue. In all such modalities, wound dressings must be removed for each assessment which can
disturb the wound healing process. These methods are invasive and unsuitable for daily wound
monitoring. Additionally, this increases both workload and costs, as the wound dressings are then
changed without medical necessity. These limitations frustrate the ability to monitor wounds in real time
in out-patient settings after initial treatment. In many cases, the lack of timely interventions can result in
amputation. A biomedical device capable of monitoring wound parameters noninvasively at the wound
site in real time via telemetry represents an important unmet clinical need. We have identified 2 key
biophysical markers with which to track wound healing: (1) temperature and (2) moisture balance in the
wound microenvironment. Through the activities outlined in this proposal, Rhaeos will develop its
technologies in wireless, wearable thermal characterization of skin to yield a conformal thermal sensor
(CTS) capable of localized measurements these biomarkers. A benchtop model simulating key
biological and geometrical properties will allow for refinement and validation of the technology, and
battery-free Bluetooth technology will support wireless data transfer (Aims 1&2). A preclinical small-
animal model for diabetic wounds will validate measurements in vivo (Aim 3). If successful, this
proposal will yield a set of technologies for the continuous, noninvasive monitoring of wounds for
patients with nonhealing wounds, suitable for clinical human studies."
11007510,"Summary/Abstract
Shock physiology, from any cause, is characterized by an inability to deliver sufficient oxygen to the
tissues to meet cellular metabolic demands. Unfortunately, tools that assess the adequacy of oxygen
delivery in neonatal critical care patients are often invasive, imprecise, intermittent, and may be
misleading. For example, a patient with significant microvascular shunting may exhibit a falsely
reassuring arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation or normal lactic acid levels. Still, early identification of the
shock state is critical to the appropriate triage, resuscitation, and treatment of patients. Here, we propose
the advanced development and testing of an optical probe that monitors peripheral tissue oxygenation
as a marker of systemic hemodynamics with strong correlation to central venous oxygen saturation.
Local, capillary-ShbO2 (called StO2), primarily reflects the venous or post-O2 extraction compartment of
the vasculature and, thus, reflects the adequacy of oxygen delivery to tissues. Changes to systemic blood
supply, for example due to bleeding, infection, or low cardiac output may not change arterial oxygen
saturation, but are quickly reflected in peripheral StO2 as total oxygen delivery is reduced or peripheral
capillaries are shunted to maintain systemic perfusion.
We have developed a method for measuring StO2 based on resonance Raman Spectroscopy
(RRS). RRS takes advantage of resonant enhancement of the vibrational spectra from hemoglobin when
excited using a low power laser near a strong absorption peak (405nm). Thus, the StO2 measurement
can be taken against a tissue background and is insensitive to factors such as subcutaneous fat and skin
color. Using a prototype device in animal models, we have demonstrated the utility and feasibility of
measuring StO2 from the esophagus as a predictor of decompensation due to hemorrhage. In addition,
we confirmed the safety of long term use of the device. Here, we propose improvements to our sensor
which will enable measurements in a wider range of tissues and will prepare us to begin clinical trials in
a neonatal critical care patient population."

Summary
Bloodstream infection caused by yeast is a life-threatening condition that affects approximately
50,000 patients each year in the United States. Yeast bloodstream infection is a highly lethal
infection associated with mortality rates greater than 40%. Early antifungal administration is
crucial to improve the probability of patient survival. However, the current gold standard for the
diagnosis of yeast bloodstream infection is blood culture (BC), which takes one to five days. To
provide physicians with the needed diagnostic information to properly treat these patients, we are
developing an automated platform for rapid, broad and cost-effective identification of yeast in
whole blood without BC. The new platform is based on Single MOLecule Scanning (SMOLT), a
novel sample preparation and molecular detection method developed at Scanogen.
Here, we propose to complete the development of an automated instrument and the SMOLT-
Yeast assay that will detect most yeast responsible for bloodstream infections directly on whole
blood. We successfully completed or surpassed all Phase II milestones. The SMOLT-Yeast assay
was developed, automated, and tested with clinical samples. To diagnose a patient, a vacutainer
with the patient’s blood is inserted into a disposable cartridge and processed by a desktop
instrument. The new assay demonstrated high analytical and clinical performance with limit of
detection of 1 CFU/mL for 11 yeast species, an overall clinical sensitivity of 94.2% and an overall
clinical specificity of 99.8%. In Phase IIB, we will address all the design improvements that are
needed before the FDA pivotal studies. We will optimize the cartridge design to reduce
manufacturing variability and cost, as well as to increase storage stability (Aim 1 and Aim 2). We
will optimize the instrument design to improve its usability, increase its mechanical stability, and
reduce its size (Aim 3). We will also conduct an in-hospital pilot study to test the assay and the
approach that will be used for the pivotal studies (Aim 4). We have assembled the appropriate
team to accomplish these tasks: assay development scientists that developed the SMOLT
technology and experienced engineers, including the former Vice President of Engineering at
Becton Dickinson. In addition, Scanogen has established a collaboration with a team from the
Johns Hopkins University that will conduct the clinical evaluation and will provide feedback to
ensure that the new system responds to the clinical needs. If successful, the new platform will
significantly improve the outcome of patients with yeast bloodstream infection by providing rapid
results and enabling timely initiation of proper antifungal treatment. Furthermore, the new platform
will have a broader impact by enabling assays targeting other microorganisms that cause
bloodstream infections."

The NeuroAccess system represents a pioneering approach to address the unmet critical need for effective
blood-based molecular characterization in brain cancer patients. By utilizing focused ultrasound and
microbubbles to open the blood-brain barrier non-invasively, it allows biomarkers such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
into the systemic circulation, facilitating liquid biopsy in conditions where biopsies with traditional techniques are
difficult to obtain. The overall objective of this study is to ensure the optimized safety and efficacy of the
NeuroAccess system in enabling liquid biopsies (LB) for brain tumor patients.
The study comprises three aims: Firstly, to demonstrate the safety of repeated BBB opening (BBBO) in healthy
rats with variable intra-treatment delays. Secondly, to optimize BBBO volume and transmit sequence in diseased
rats, assessing the increase in mutant EGFR biomarkers in peripheral circulation. Finally, to optimize the
sensitivity and specificity of the LB method by confirming BBBO and measuring biomarker levels in both healthy
and tumor-bearing rats. Success criteria include statistically significant biomarker concentration increases and
confirmed safe BBBO.
Our long-term goal is to significantly improve the management and outcomes of brain tumor patients through
reliable and non-invasive liquid biopsies. Tissue biopsies are difficult to obtain for brain tumor patients other than
in an invasive manner and/or when surgery is performed. Liquid biopsies are not currently used because the
blood-brain barrier prevents biomarkers from migrating from brain tissue into the circulation system. The
NeuroAccess system addresses this challenge by enabling non-invasive liquid biopsies. Existing research
including data from studies on humans, demonstrates the potential and feasibility of safe blood-brain barrier
openings for the purposes of liquid biopsy, however the NeuroAccess device makes the approach feasible and
practical.
This project proposes innovative techniques to increase the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of the focused
ultrasound based liquid biopsy method. The proposed research is significant because it tackles the complexities
of brain tumor diagnostics, aiming to bring substantial improvements in the detection and management of brain
tumors. The successful implementation of the NeuroAccess system has the potential to shift the paradigm in
brain tumor treatment, aligning with the urgent needs of patients.

 Membrane proteins play key roles in many cellular functions and are the largest class of drug targets.
Measuring the molecular interactions of membrane proteins are critical for understanding protein functions,
discovering biomarkers, and developing drugs. Most popular methods for measuring membrane protein
interaction kinetics involves extraction, purification, stabilization of the membrane protein in an artificial lipid
environment, which is not only labor intensive but may also introduce bias and costly missteps due to the loss of
the heterogeneous native cellular microenvironment. Therefore, an in situ detection technique that enables
sensitive measurement of native receptor behavior at single cell and population level is critical to expediting drug
development.
 We propose to develop Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy (PSM) as a breakthrough technology for high
throughput label-free quantification of membrane protein binding interaction kinetics on single cells. PSM
advances the field of biomarker discovery and drug development by enabling high throughput real-time functional
study of drug candidate interactions with cell membrane receptors in their native microenvironments.
 Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is the current state-of-the-are for studying label-free binding
kinetics. PSM is a breakthrough advancement of SPR-based sensing. Rather than measuring changes in sensor
reflectivity, PSM innovatively measures changes in plasmonic scattering. This novel approach enables
quantitative real-time measurement of label-free molecular binding kinetics on single cells in high throughput but
avoids the major drawbacks of reflection-based imaging known to plague traditional SPR-based approaches.
 Unlike SPRM, PSM exhibits several distinct technological advances, including a ~5 times greater signal to
noise ratio, ~10 times greater field of view, ~5 times greater resolution, ~50 times higher throughput, enhanced
sensitivity and data quality that avoids interferences from secondary reflection and near-field diffraction events,
and the capability of simultaneous fluorescence imaging for orthogonal validation.
 In this fast-track STTR project, Biosensing Instrument Inc. (BI) will work with the inventor of PSM technology
at Arizona State University to develop a commercial prototype multi-functional PSM instrument that can perform
PSM and fluorescence imaging. We will also collaborate with potential customers in biomedical research and
pharmaceutical industries to validate PSM performance and develop key applications.
 This project addresses the significant unmet need for acquiring more native biorelevant data sooner in the
early-stage drug development process, thereby mitigating costly missteps and false leads. PSM technology
enables sensitive label-free kinetic quantification of membrane protein behavior in their native cellular
microenvironment with high throughput while also permitting simultaneous fluorescence validation. PSM
addresses a great needed for expediting biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and drug screening."

 Gout, a common form of arthritis triggered by high uric acid levels, affects a considerable patient
population and the market for gout therapeutics is projected to grow significantly. A recombinant and pegylated
uricase, pegloticase (trade name Krystexxa), is administered by intravenous infusion to patients with chronic
refractory gout, but its usage is limited due to high immunogenicity and severe adverse effects. Our proposal
addresses these challenges by engineering uricase variants that are long-acting with reduced immunogenicity.
In preliminary experiments, we screened uricases from different organisms and chose a bacterial uricase for its
high expression, catalytic activity, and the presence of just a small number of antigenic epitopes presented on
human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) based on computational prediction algorithms and experimental
MAPPs analysis. Using high throughput activity screens at elevated temperatures, we identified mutations that
dramatically increase the enzyme's thermostability and improve activity in vivo. Computational modeling
assisted in the removal of free cysteines and their replacement by an intersubunit disulfide that further stabilizes
the enzyme for a final melting temperature of 75°C. In separate experiments, mutations predicted to decrease
affinity of uricase epitopes for HLA-II allotypes were validated by two methods that measure peptide binding to
HLA-II under acidic conditions in the presence of an HLA-II-specific chaperone, thus mimicking the antigen
presentation pathway within antigen-presenting cells. Finally, an AI-based protein design tool was used to create
de novo albumin-binding domains (ABDs) that were fused to the uricase for the purposes of improving
pharmacokinetics and shielding the protein surface from anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). (Aim 1.1) We propose to
combine each of these features into uricase variants, thus optimizing for stability, reduced immunogenicity, and
extended half-life in a single uricase sequence. (Aim 1.2) A set of uricase variants will then be administered
intravenously and subcutaneously to C57BL/6J inbred mice and serum exposures measured over time. Next,
the binding of serum albumin to ABDs localized on the outside of the uricase D2 symmetric tetramer is
hypothesized to shield underlying surface epitopes from ADA recognition. (Aim 1.3) We will determine whether
the binding of serum albumin to a uricase-ABD fusion protein reduces reactivity of polyclonal anti-uricase
antibodies in vitro and (Aim 1.4) reduces the generation of ADAs in vivo in mice. (Aim 2) Finally, taking the
mutations that were shown to reduce the affinity of peptide epitopes for HLA-II allotypes, we will assess the
impact of the mutations on peptide-mediated stimulation of T cells from healthy human donors. This research is
significant as it not only addresses the major liability (immunogenicity) of recombinant uricases as therapeutics
for gout, but also contributes to the broader development of technologies for the reduction of immunogenicity in
protein therapeutics generally. The outcome of this project has the potential to greatly expand treatment options
for patients with severe gout, offering a safer and more effective therapeutic alternative."
11008491,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching objective of this Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal is to create
the first Kerrison rongeur (KR) with an integrated optical sensor capable of detecting dura and nerve root during
spinal surgery. Dura and nerve roots are delicate structures critical to proper neural function, sensation, and
movement and are damaged in up to 17% and 25% of certain spinal procedures respectively. Incidental damage
to these structures can lead to major complications, longer surgery durations, and additional operations.
Currently, surgeons avoid incidental dural and nerve damage by attempting to maintain sufficient separation
between the critical and unwanted tissue during dissection but have no means of directly visualizing or identifying
these structures during critical points of dissection. KRs, a surgical instrument used to gouge out bone, are often
used at these critical points when dura and nerve roots are at the highest risk of being injured. To prevent these
unfortunate outcomes, the goal of Phase I of this proposal is to further establish the feasibility and performance
of a miniaturized optical sensor for dura and nerve root detection capable of integrating into a KR. In order to
physically incorporate an optical sensor into a KR, a custom optical subsystem will be designed consisting of an
optical sensor, a force transducer, and protective housing for the optoelectronic components. Once assembled,
a 3D printed, multispectral KR (MKR) prototype equipped with the miniaturized optical subsystem will be
constructed to validate dura and nerve root classification performance under known pressure conditions. The
goal of Phase II of this proposal is to incorporate the characterized optical subsystem from Phase I into a fully
functional MKR capable of bone gouging and in vivo detection of dura and nerve. To that end, the MKR prototype
will be constructed and evaluated in three areas: dura and nerve root detection, bone gouging performance, and
shielding of the optical subsystem. The bone gouging and the protective housing of the MKR will be determined
using biomechanical bone phantoms and fresh ovine bone samples. To demonstrate in vivo functionality, the
MKR will be evaluated during porcine laminectomy performed by a spinal surgeon. At the conclusion of this
proposal, Briteseed will be well positioned to initiate product development and commercialization of a MKR that
has the potential to reduce the incidence of iatrogenic damage to dura and nerve roots."
11008220,"Project Summary/Abstract: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also known as silastic, is commonly used for
medical implants. Despite advantages over earlier elastomers and plastics, PDMS surfaces elicit a significant
foreign body response (FBR). This response, triggered by adhesion of non-specific proteins, leads to a thick
fibrotic capsule post-implantation, impacting the functionality, safety, and longevity of various medical devices.
For neurostimulators such as cochlear implants (CIs), this fibrotic tissue increases the impedance of the nerve -
tissue interface and has other deleterious effects, e.g., reduced hearing quality in the case of CIs. Similarly, in
stents, catheters, and tubes, the FBR can permanently damage tissue, narrow passageways, and restrict flow
rates. A notable example is endotracheal (ET) tubes, which commonly induce subglottic stenosis in long-term
intubated patients, leading to life-long complications. Moreover, PDMS-based implanted biomaterials are prone
to bacterial biofilm formation, presenting a significant risk for infections. Hospital-acquired infections associated
with implanted devices incur ~30 billion dollars annually in healthcare costs in the U.S. alone. To address these
challenges, surface modifications to enhance the biocompatibility of PDMS have been a significant focus of
research. While impressive antifouling properties have been realized in a variety of coatings—and particularly
those based on zwitterionic polymers—these coatings have yet to be incorporated in commercial biomedical
devices due to weak grafting to the PDMS surface, inadequate mechanical durability, and complex processing
steps that aren’t easily transferable to existing manufacturing processes. Our company, ZwiCoat Materials
Innovations (ZCMI), has developed the first ever ultra-low-fouling thin film coating that forms a permanent,
covalent bond with PDMS surfaces in a simple one-step process. This patented technology combines several
properties crucial for commercial viability: strong covalent bonding to PDMS, high lubricity, mechanical durability,
and exceptional antifouling capabilities—all achieved through a straightforward, single-step photoinitiated
reaction that can be integrated with existing manufacturing protocols. This SBIR project aims to establish the
technical merit and feasibility of applying our innovative coating to two existing medical implants, CI electrode
arrays and ET tubes—both of which would benefit from greatly reduced fibrosis and are representative of large
classes of biomedical devices. The project aims to develop efficient coating technologies, validate coating
durability, while confirming their robust antifouling properties on these devices. Phase I success is expected to
enable industry partnerships and pave the way for regulatory approval. Concurrently, targeted interviews with
hospitals, physicians, patients, and industry leaders will be conducted to inform and refine subsequent Phase II
work as well as our commercialization strategy. This approach will position ZCMI to revolutionize the current
paradigm wherein fibrosis and moderate infection rates are viewed as inevitable consequences of implanted
medical devices, thereby establishing a new standard for patient safety and device efficacy."
11006231,"Background: VA implemented the Life Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI) to elicit, document,
and honor the values, goals, and preferences of Veterans with serious illness. The National Academy of
Medicine recommends, and patients and families prefer goals of care conversations (the foundation of the
LSTDI) occur when they are not acutely ill in the outpatient setting. However, across VA nationally, most goals
of care conversations occur in the inpatient setting close to death; only 39% occur in the outpatient setting.
Significance/Impact: This study will identify strategies to improve LSTDI implementation in the outpatient
setting. This is significant to Veterans because it ensures they can express their goals and preferences for life
sustaining treatments and have them honored. Two VA Secretary priorities are addressed: (1) the goal to
provide “clear information to make informed decisions” about life-sustaining treatments, and (2) the goal for
Veterans to receive “care and support… that emphasizes their well-being and independence throughout their
life journey.” This proposal addresses the R&D goal to increase real-world impact of VA research by
understanding how to improve implementation of a national VA policy. Alignment with HSR&D priorities is
described in the proposal.
Innovation: The proposal uses an innovative study design, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
(SMART). The combination of patient-facing and provider-facing implementation strategies, deemed important
in our preliminary studies, is also innovative. Finally, we take a population-based approach to understand the
implementation of goals of care conversations in seriously ill Veterans with serious non-cancer illnesses
including heart failure and chronic pulmonary, renal, and kidney diseases.
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Use a clinician-level SMART in three VA health systems to determine the effectiveness
of clinician and patient implementation strategies to improve the occurrence of documented goals of care
conversations in Veterans with serious medical illness. Aim 2a. Identify the sequence of implementation
strategies that leads to the overall greatest increase in documentation of goals of care conversations. Aim 2b
(exploratory). Identify patient and clinician characteristics that modify the effect of sequences of implementation
strategies on documentation of goals of care conversations. Aim 3. Understand clinician and patient
implementation strategy success or failure using a mixed method evaluation involving clinicians, leaders,
patients, and caregivers.
Methodology: Study sites include the VA Eastern Colorado, Greater Los Angeles, and Palo Alto Health Care
Systems. We will target clinicians with low rates of goals of care conversations among Veterans with medical
illness in the top 10th percentile of risk of hospitalization or death. We will first test less resource intensive
strategies, and subsequently randomize PACT teams with continued low rates of conversations to either an
increased intensity of the current strategy or more time with the current strategy. Data will be collected from
the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (Aims 1 and 2) and patient, caregiver, and clinician interviews or surveys
(Aims 2 and 3). Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods.
Next Steps/Implementation: Study findings will be disseminated in collaboration with our operations partners
(National Center for Ethics in Health Care, Primary Care, Palliative Care). Our partners can implement policies
based on study findings to increase early, outpatient implementation of the LSTDI."

The brain shows marked plasticity across a variety of learning and memory tasks as well as during
recovery after injury. Many have proposed to leverage this innate plasticity using brain stimulation
to treat neural disorders. Implementing such treatments requires advanced engineering tools as
well as a solid understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network
dynamics and connectivity at a large scale and across multiple brain areas. Here, I propose to
use our novel engineering tools to precisely manipulate neural activity in macaque sensorimotor
cortex to investigate and induce targeted cortical reorganization. I hypothesize that a closed-loop
optogenetic stimulation of somatosensory cortex based on the natural functional connectivity of
the sensorimotor system can drive cortical plasticity and induce functional recovery. The
functional connectivity maps of the somatosensory and motor cortical areas will be estimated as
a guide for targeted stimulation. In Aim 1 the effectiveness of volitional control of activity-
dependent stimulation will be investigated to both strengthen the natural existing connections and
to induce new connections. In Aim 2 the volitional control of activity-dependent stimulation will
be evaluated to induce new connections in the presence of an ischemic lesion. These aims are
designed to provide us with both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to assess the
targeted cortical reorganization. The combination of these measures can shed light on different
aspects of brain plasticity and functional recovery mechanisms. The results of these aims will be
a proof of concept for the power of refined stimulation patterns for targeted rehabilitation and
rewiring of the brain that not only can be used for neurorehabilitation but also can help understand
the circuits and connectivity in these cortical areas."
10987761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: The cellular events that cause adipocytes to accumulate excessive amounts of triglycerides
(hypertrophy), a key characteristic of obesity, remain largely unknown. We have discovered that mice with
targeted genetic deletion of adipose tissue diaphanous 1 are protected from diet-induced obesity and exhibit
reliably higher expression of the gene zinc finger protein 949 (Zfp949) in both brown and white adipose tissues.
The literature on the physiological role of Zfp949 is limited to its roles as a transcriptional suppressor of embryonic
development. Preliminary data from our laboratory demonstrate that lowering the expression of Zfp949 in
adipocytes prevents triglycerides accumulation when exposed to excess fatty acids. Thus, this novel model of
adipocyte hypertrophy will allow us to identify the genes, protein and lipids that contribute to adipocyte obesity.
Furthermore, the proposed studies aim to determine whether overexpression of Zfp949 represents a therapeutic
target for the treatments and/or prevention of obesity.
Hypothesis: In line with a common function of proteins in the zinc finger family, and based on a published report
supporting this role, we hypothesize that Zfp949 suppresses genes and proteins that promote lipid accumulation
in adipocytes and thus, overexpression will be protective from fatty acid-induced hypertrophy.
Approach: We will leverage RNA sequencing, proteomic and lipidomic studies for unbiased assessment of the
genes, proteins and lipids that underlie adipocyte hypertrophy. This multi-omic approach will identify the cellular
processes that promote lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Similarly, we will also harness those tools to assess
whether or not overexpressing Zfp949 represents a potential therapeutic approach to treat obesity.
Significance: One of the limitations to being able to study the cellular processes that take place in adipocytes
during hypertrophy is that it is not possible to isolate hypertrophied adipocytes from subjects in vivo thus
hindering our full understanding of the causes of obesity. The innovative question and cellular model will allow
us to unveil the underlying cellular processes that cause adiposity and obesity. In light of the lack of effective
and safe treatments for obesity, the fast growing prevalence of this disease, and its link as a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, if is of paramount importance to better understand the cellular processes
underlying obesity, which the proposed studies aim to address. The clinical significance rests on the notion that
the results of the proposed studies will identify key genes, proteins and metabolic pathways that promote lipid
accumulation in adipocytes as well as identify the specific lipid species that contribute to adipocyte hypertrophy,
which via established collaborations, can then be validated in future proposals in samples from obese human
subjects and may be targeted as potential therapeutic candidates to treat those disorders."

Hao-Fountain syndrome is a newly identified rare pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletions
and mutations of the USP7 gene. The molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of the disease remain poorly
understood, preventing the development of potential treatments for Hao-Fountain patients. USP7 is a
deubiquitinating enzyme implicated in the maintenance of protein homeostasis, stem cell identity, self-renewal,
and control of dendritic branching in primary neurons. A model system has not yet been created but is
indispensable for understanding the disease and for the evaluation of potential personalized therapies for Hao-
Fountain Syndrome. In this proposal, we will create the first human-based cellular model of Hao-Fountain to test
the effect of disease-linked mutations on the enzymatic function of USP7 (Aim 1), and on neuron differentiation
potential and morphology (Aim 2). The patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells will be differentiated into
cortical neurons to create the Hao-Fountain model system that will be shared with the greater community to
accelerate the understanding of this newly discovered and devastating disease."

 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition often co-occurs with drug use disorders (DUD),
particularly in the context of injected drug use. Individuals with DUD or those living with HIV/AIDS have been
found to commonly experience changes in the balance of gut microbiota (GM) in their gastrointestinal tract.
The gut, which is considered the body's largest immune organ, harbors trillions of microorganisms that
influence how our body responds to neurological and immune challenges or inflammation. Thus, DUD, HIV,
GM, and immune responses form a complex interplay, influencing each other.
 To elucidate the causal relationship of HIV acquisition, we will leverage genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) summary statistics and existing datasets. Our primary analytical strategy involves employing
Mendelian randomization (MR) combined with mediation analysis. Utilizing MR analysis, which relies on
GWAS summary statistics, we will deploy static GWAS-identified genetic markers as instrumental variables to
address confounding factors while inferring causal effects. We will examine four distinct DUDs, including use
disorders of cannabis, cocaine, tobacco, and opioids. Our investigation will analyze a large-scale human GM
GWAS, GWAS of target immune-related biomarkers, and our ongoing HIV GWAS. Within the MR framework,
our outcome trait is HIV acquisition, and DUDs are exposure variables. Through univariate MR and multivariate
MR, we aim to identify drug-specific causal effects on HIV risk and immune responses. We will also investigate
genetic correlations among these traits. Furthermore, we will infer the causal mediation relationship among
DUD, GM, and immune responses in HIV risk, providing insights through the assessment of causality and
mediation effects. In summary, finding causal effects between DUD and HIV acquisition is essential for
designing effective prevention and intervention strategies, guiding public health policies, understanding the
mechanisms involved, and ultimately reducing the burden of HIV in populations affected by drug use."

American Indians are at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia
(AD/ADRD) compared to the general population, yet dementia onset and frequency in this population are
understudied. American Indians have a disproportionate burden of diabetes and vascular brain injury along with
evidence of health disparities. Diabetes increases the risk of vascular disease, which accelerate Alzheimer’s
disease-related processes coexisting in mixed forms of dementia. Intraindividual cognitive variability (IICV), a
measure of variability in neuropsychological test performance within a person at a single timepoint, may be a
novel, low-cost, noninvasive biomarker of neurodegeneration and early dementia. We aim to characterize
associations between IICV, longitudinal changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures related to
AD/ADRD, and diabetes among older American Indians. For this we will use data from the Strong Heart Study
(SHS) and Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians (CDCAI) Study, calculating IICV
measures for memory, executive function and processing speed, and multidomain cognition for 403 American
Indians (age 70-95) who had diabetes assessments at three different timepoints over the course of ~27 years
(SHS Time 0, CDCAI time 1 and CDCAI time 2); neuropsychological and neuroimaging data at two time points,
with an interval of ~7 years (CDCAI time 1 and CDCAI time 2), and dementia adjudication at time 2. We will
accomplish this work through the following Specific Aims: (1) Examine (a) whether IICV at time 1 is associated
with neurodegenerative-related changes in MRI in critical brain regions (entorhinal, hippocampal, whole
brain atrophy), in American Indians, and (b) whether diabetes moderates this relationship. We expect (a)
that IICV will be positively associated with neurogenerative-related MRI changes, and (b) a stronger association
between IICV and MRI findings in those with diabetes at midlife (time 0) or later life (time 1 and 2); (2) Examine
(a) whether IICV at time 1 is associated with vascular brain injury in American Indians (WMH volume
progression), and (b) whether diabetes moderates this relationship. We expect (a) that IICV will be
positively associated with WMH progression, and (b) a stronger association between IICV and MRI findings in
those with diabetes; and (3) Examine whether (a) IICV at time 1 is associated with cognitive decline and
dementia adjudication at time 2, and (b) whether diabetes moderates these associations. We expect (a)
that increased IICV will be associated with an increased likelihood of cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia and
(b) a stronger association in those with diabetes. The validation of IICV as a marker of future AD/ADRD risk will
allow for earlier noninvasive identification and mitigation of risk in American Indians. Results from this study are
expected to advance the understanding of how IICV relates to neuropathology, dementia, and type 2 diabetes
among aging American Indians, and is expected to serve as preliminary data to optimize the design of a future
R01 dedicated to investigating the utility of IICV as early marker of AD in minority populations."

Migraine is a highly prevalent chronic pain disorder with sensory, affective, and cognitive symptoms. Many neural
systems contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine, and in particular the insula is known to play a major role
in integrating somatosensory and interoceptive signals that contribute to the experience of migraines. Despite
the insula being a hub for both interoceptive processing3 and migraine, however, little is known about the
specific role that the insula and interoceptive awareness (i.e., the capacity to attend to and regulate
internal sensations) play in the symptomology of migraines. Migraine symptoms are cyclical, with
sensitization to pain increasing throughout the interictal phase (i.e., between migraine attacks) and peaking just
before or during the attack. We propose that increased sensitivity to pain stimuli as the interictal phase
progresses might extend to interoceptive processing; our central hypothesis is that migraine is linked with
dysregulated interoceptive processing that builds over the interictal phase and peaks close to or during
the next migraine. The research project proposed in this Small Research Grant (R03) Award will use functional
magnetic resonance imaging, measures of interoceptive awareness, and daily tracking of migraine phase and
symptom severity to understand the role that interoceptive awareness plays in the time course of migraine. We
will measure brain response during interoceptive attention among both people with episodic migraine and healthy
control participants. Participants will focus on sensations from their heart or lungs, and brain response during
this condition will be contrasted with the response during external attention to sounds and visual patterns. We
will collect data about participants’ migraine phases and symptoms using daily electronic headache diaries, and
use this to time-lock each MRI scan relative to participants’ migraine cycles. The specific goals of this proposal
are to 1) Examine associations between insula response to interoceptive attention and migraine cycle phase
in people with episodic migraine; and to 2) Investigate differences in brain response to interoceptive attention
between people with episodic migraine and healthy control participants. This award will contribute to our
understanding of the pathophysiology and time course of episodic migraine, and may identify novel neural
mechanisms of interoceptive awareness that can be targeted in clinical interventions for migraine."
10986179,"Physical function in older age is among the best predictors of independence and disability. Social determinants
of health (SDOH) play a critical role in shaping physical function. Yet, the biologic mechanisms linking SDOH
to physical performance are poorly understood. Mitochondrial function (“bioenergetics”), defined by changes in
the capacity to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), becomes impaired with
advancing age. Mitochondrial bioenergetic decline represents a novel cellular mechanism by which social
experiences can become biologically embedded. Previous studies examining the biologic underpinnings of
how SDOH determinants influence physical functioning have focused on non-specific, global biologic
processes (i.e., allostatic load, whole-body inflammation). In contrast, blood-based measures of mitochondrial
bioenergetic capacity are easier to obtain and biologically specific. To date, there are no population-based
studies exploring whether mitochondrial function is related to measures of both physical function and SDOH,
specifically the role of socioeconomic position, in population health studies. Our understanding of the
contributions of mitochondrial bioenergetics to population health has been hampered by two major
methodological challenges. First, mitochondrial function is traditionally measured using invasive, labor
intensive, tissue-specific measures (i.e., skeletal muscle), thereby limiting its use in population-based studies.
Second, blood-based bioenergetic profiling requires the analysis of live samples, a limitation which precludes
harnessing longitudinal data from existing biorepositories from aging population studies. This proposal
overcomes these obstacles by leveraging blood-based markers of mitochondrial bioenergetics via the
innovative respirometry in frozen samples (RIFS) method, an emerging methodology that reconstitutes
maximal mitochondrial respiration in previously frozen samples, even those that have undergone multiple
freeze-thaw cycles. This approach is cost-effective and uses minimally invasive techniques from frozen blood,
laying the groundwork for larger-scale population health studies. We leverage data and stored samples from
the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a large, population-based study of adults
over age 50. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Test the reliability and validity of systemic markers of
mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity using the RIFS method in a field-collected, population health study; (2)
Examine the association between markers of mitochondrial systemic bioenergetic capacity and multiple
measures of physical performance and function, and; (3) Examine the association between socioeconomic
position and systemic markers of mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity. The results of this study will provide
important evidence that measures of mitochondrial function, obtained via the RIFS method, can be related to
social factors and other important aging-related outcomes and has broad potential to, for the first time, open
access to large-scale population-based aging studies with existing biorepositories."

Extrinsic factors are sources of variability that affect pre-clinical research study reproducibility and
outcomes. These factors are environmental variables from experimental and housing conditions. One
way to optimize research outcomes, enhance methodological reproducibility, and improve scientific
rigor of biomedical research is to monitor and better regulate the impact of housing and husbandry
conditions within animal facilities. The long-term goal of this project is to support and produce more
rigorous pre-clinical animal research in a shared animal facility housing a number of different species.
The objective in this particular application is to detect, monitor, and track extrinsic factors in individual
animal rooms by purchasing and using the advanced technology equipment called The Sensory
Sentinel. This state-of-the-art technology continuously tracks the extrinsic factors of temperature,
humidity, light, noise, and vibration in the microenvironment (e.g., cage) or macroenvironment (e.g.,
room), and it logs human activity. The expected outcomes of this project include improvement of
research outcomes, animal welfare, and facility operations in an institutionally-supported animal
facility for biomedical researchers across multiple colleges and departments. Under the first specific
aim, extrinsic factors will be monitored 24/7 in animal rooms with a capacity that does not currently
exist in this research core facility. Remote access to extrinsic factor data will be provided to the
Animal Facility Manager, Attending Veterinarian, and Principal Investigator for timely responsiveness
to deviations and alerts. This will enable the facility to maintain consistent and ideal conditions for
research animals, reducing stress and variations affecting research outcomes. Under the second aim,
data-based decisions will be used to promote optimal animal health and welfare, such as decisions
about housing and identification of disruptive sensory stimulation. Evaluation of records for extrinsic
factors by the Institutional Care and Use Committee can confirm compliance with regulatory
standards of animal welfare. Under the third specific aim, the equipment will be used to improve
record keeping and to modernize training for facility users. Overall, better monitoring of extrinsic
factors will lead to quickly correcting deviations and reducing environmental stressors for animal
subjects, yielding refinement of procedures and reductions in animal use. Purchasing and using this
advanced technology equipment will be significant, because in addition to improving the rigor of pre-
clinical animal research studies conducted in the facility, the competitiveness of grant applications,
the support for new faculty hires that conduct animal research, and the training environment for the
next generation of biomedical researchers across the university will be substantially enhanced and at
the forefront of technology and innovation due to resulting improvements."
10983515,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rapid development of ultrasensitive immunoassays has made it possible to measure biomarkers for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in blood with high accuracy, allowing for minimally invasive detection of disease
pathology. A major advantage of using easily repeated measures of AD, as available with minimally
invasive blood biomarkers, is the greater sensitivity and reliability for detecting within person change. In
clinical trials this can dramatically reduce sample sizes needed to detect effect and potentially shorten the
trial period by detecting treatment effects earlier. Collection of venous blood through phlebotomy is,
however, still a medical procedure performed by trained staff requiring scheduled in-person visits in-clinic,
or more rarely at-home, followed by sample processing in a timely manner. We will investigate and validate
the use of dried blood spot (DBS) samples obtained through self-administered fingerstick, which can be
collected at home by study participants themselves and be sent to the lab by mail, to measure blood-based
biomarkers of AD. DBS has successfully been used to measure many analytes including a wide variety of
proteins and peptides, but it is not established whether whole blood is a comparable matrix to plasma/serum
for AD biomarker measurements and how stable DBS measurements of such biomarkers are over time. Our
goals are to 1) optimize fingerstick collection methods for DBS samples and to perform fit-for-purpose
validation of assays and parameters of measurement for pTau217, GFAP, and NfL, three key biomarkers
reflecting AD pathology and neurodegeneration, in capillary DBS samples; 2) establish if DBS
concentrations of the three biomarkers correlate with concentrations in paired plasma samples, and 3)
evaluate the stability of measurements (precision) in repeated samples over a fourteen-week timeframe.
The overarching goal of our study is to understand if frequent repeated measures of blood biomarkers in
DBS samples can be incorporated as a sensitive measure for AD pathology in clinical trials of disease
modifiers as well as in longitudinal and epidemiological observational research. The accessibility of DBS
furthermore promises to increase diversity by being more inclusive, especially of ethnoracially, culturally,
and geographically under-represented groups that traditionally experience more barriers to participate in
clinical research."

Myelin has evolved to speed up, finely tune, and increase the metabolic efficiency of electrical signal transmission
in the brain. In numerous human diseases however, myelin degenerates, ultimately resulting in devastating
motor and cognitive impairment. Importantly, in order for tissue repair to proceed after myelin damage has
occurred, the many layers of compacted cell membrane that constitute the myelin sheath must be rapidly and
efficiently removed by resident phagocytic cells in the brain. Defective removal of these debris has been
implicated in a number of degenerative conditions, including but not limited to, multiple sclerosis and aging, yet
we know little about the cellular dynamics and molecular mechanisms governing these processes. In order to
study these critical cellular events and answer questions centered on which cell populations are involved and
what roles these different cell types play, we have developed advanced techniques for imaging and manipulating
these discrete events in the live animal over a wide range of temporal scales from seconds to months. These
techniques include intravital imaging of new combinations of fluorophore-based multicolor transgenic labels of
distinct populations of neurons and glia together with label-free imaging modalities specific for compact myelin.
In addition to these powerful labeling and optical imaging strategies, we have also developed a new technique
for targeted induction of single-cell death, which we have recently established as a model of on-demand and
titratable demyelination in the mouse cortical gray matter. Combining these techniques now allows dynamic
investigation of demyelination and remyelination in the context of targeted genetic manipulations and animal
models of human disease. Using these powerful tools this project will investigate three central aims. First, there
is increasing evidence that in addition to microglia, the primary phagocytes of the brain, other resident glial cell
types, namely astrocytes and NG2 glia, are also involved and play important roles in the phagocytosis and repair
process. We will determine the precise contribution of each glial cell type in the dynamic detection and clearance
of degenerating myelin debris. Next, we and others have shown the importance of phosphatidylserine receptors
in the efficient detection and clearance of dying neurons and other cells in different organs. We will determine
the role and consequences of both defective phagocytic receptors and debris digestion signaling on the dynamic
response by NG2 glia to cortical demyelination and the resulting remyelination success and myelin patterning.
Finally, there is evidence that neuronal activity and/or sensory experience can modify remyelination, but less is
known about the roles of neuronal activity on phagocytic function in the context of demyelination. We will
determine the consequences of bidirectional neuronal activity changes on the response by phagocytic cells to
single-cell demyelination. Ultimately, these studies will reveal which cells are involved in myelin debris clearance,
the role of major cell debris recognition pathways in successful clearance and repair, and how neuronal activity
and sensory experience modify the response of phagocytic glia to a demyelinating event."

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common, debilitating inflammatory disease characterized by unique
pathological features that includes epithelialized tunnel formation. Chronically draining, intradermal tunnels are
unique feature of HS pathology and contribute to robust inflammation significantly affecting patients’ quality of
life. Tragically, no consistently effective treatments exist for HS tunnels. In addition, the progress in the field is
hampered by the lack of clinically relevant HS models. We assembled a multidisciplinary collaborative team
with unique and complementary expertise in HS, 3D skin models, glucocorticoid synthesis and signaling. The
team generated preliminary data obtained from patients’ tissue specimens: samples from HS tunnel, lesional
skin above the tunnel, along with the age, gender, and location-matched healthy skin controls and found that
cortisol and steroid synthesis pathways are markedly suppressed in HS tunnels, leading to perpetual pro-
inflammatory keratinocyte activation. We also found lack of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation in HS
tunnels, which was supported by HS transcriptomics signature characterized by marked downregulation of
cortisol synthesis and GR signaling, again uniquely associated with the tunnels and not observed in lesional
keratinocytes. Importantly, we successfully developed the first 3D organotypic model from primary HS tunnel
keratinocytes and fibroblast that recapitulates tunnels structure in patients. Based on the robust preliminary
and published data, we propose a novel concept of HS tunnel as an intradermal perpetual cellular activation
process, in which its deregulation, in particular lack of cortisol synthesis, is a major contributor to
pathophysiology. Further, we hypothesize that inhibition of epidermal and dermal cortisol production coupled
with dysfunctional cellular activation play a central role in HS tunnel pathogenesis. To test this, we outlined
three Aims which will utilize a) tissue and b) primary cell obtained from HS patients in distinct locations: HS
tunnels, skin above the tunnel, perilesional skin (all from the same patient) and location, age, sex, ethnicity
matched controls; c) organotypic 3D HS tissue generated from these primary cells. HS tissue, cells and
organotypic cultures will be maintained under normoxia and hypoxic conditions and challenged by insult and
Aim 1 will determine the role of cortisol synthesis in HS tunnels and 3D organoids by using spatial
transcriptomics and measuring cortisol production, whereas the other two Aims will offer mechanistic insights
that can reveal potential new therapeutic avenues. Aim 2 will test if targeting cortisol synthesis can restore the
function of tunnel keratinocytes and fibroblasts and their activation, whereas Aim 3 will focus on how genomic
and non-genomic GR signaling contributes to pathophysiology of HS tunnels and HS in general. Better
understanding the mechanisms through which cortisol synthesis and GR signaling modulate tunnel biology and
inflammatory response in HS will offer mechanistic insights regarding HS pathophysiology and may lead to
novel tunnel-targeted therapeutics to modulate cortisol synthesis in HS and ameliorate disease progression."

 The current state of genomic diagnostics allows us to diagnose genetic disease early in life either by 1)
identifying carrier status for inherited diseases before conception or 2) diagnosing a genetic condition during
pregnancy. Genetic diagnosis at these two timepoints is inconsistently offered and without early diagnosis,
early treatment including new in utero therapies may not achieve their full potential. The central hypothesis of
this grant is that newly developed strategies can improve risk stratification and identify appropriate candidate
individuals for early genetic testing in order to achieve earlier diagnosis and allow for earlier treatment. Aim 1
will reevaluate which inherited genetic conditions warrant universal preconception carrier screening.
Preconception carrier screening guidelines for inherited diseases can be refined in such a way as to resolve
conflicting guidelines from various medical societies, add important actionable genes that have early treatment
available, and ultimately improve uptake of this available testing. In order to achieve this, two biobanks (that
improve upon prior work in their increased sample size and diversity) will be used to update carrier frequencies
for the genes previously recommended for universal carrier screening. Expert mentorship and didactic work in
genomic epidemiology and large biobank dataset utilization will accomplish this aim and work toward building a
genomic medicine public health research program. Aim 2 will use pregnancy health factors to identify fetuses
and neonates at higher risk for genetic disease. Pregnancy health factors such as preeclampsia, gestational
diabetes, and placental abnormalities, may serve as indicators that a pregnancy is high risk to be affected by a
fetal genetic disease. Utilizing these factors in a machine learning model will enable risk stratification of a
pregnancy into low, moderate, or high-risk for fetal genetic disease. The machine learning model will be built
using a prior studied cohort of 236 pregnancies affected by fetal genetic diseases and 472 unaffected
pregnancies. The model will be validated using a cohort of 325 mother-infant dyads with suspicion for genetic
disease; 20 dyads in the validation cohort will be consented for return of results. Expert mentorship and
didactics in statistical modeling and machine learning will accomplish this aim and work toward a research
program that utilizes machine learning with existing and available health data to advance the diagnosis of rare
disease on a public health scale. The aims of this proposal coupled with a mentorship and training plan will
establish an independent research program focused on genomic epidemiology and machine learning to launch
public health measures that advance the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disease in early life."
10980904,"Cell membrane (CellMem) coating has emerged as a biomimetic strategy to modify polymeric
nanoparticles for drug delivery applications. Compared to using individual ligands, CellMem
coating has unique advantages in biomimicry by borrowing the entire ligand repertoire contained
in the cell membrane. Our lab has recently explored combining CellMem coating with
macroporous scaffolds for enhancing tissue regeneration via immunomodulation. We
demonstrated that coating of macroporous gelatin microribbon (µRB) scaffolds with CellMem
from primed mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs) induced regenerative immune response and
enhanced bone healing in a mouse disease model. While our previous study demonstrates the
promise of CellMem-coated µRB scaffolds for regeneration, it was limited to using cells from
young donors and in a young disease model, yet patients needing therapies are mostly aged
population. Aging is known to be associated with excessive inflammation and delayed healing.
As such, the goal of this proposal is to determine optimal CellMem coating for enhancing bone
regeneration in aging via targeting immunomodulation and to elucidate how varying CellMem
coating modulates MSC/immune cell crosstalk. We propose to use allogeneic CellMem isolated
from young donors due to their more abundant supply and more potent functionality than
CellMem from aged donors. We choose CellMem from pMSCs and M1 Mφ due to their
immunomodulatory functions and ability to scavenge inflammatory cytokines, respectively. We
hypothesize that varying the ratio of MSC/ Mφ CellMem coating will modulate Mφ polarization
and MSC osteogenesis in vitro. We further hypothesize that cells from young and aged donors
would require a different optimal ratio of CellMem coating. To test these hypotheses, we will
assess the effects of varying ratios of CellMem coating on individual cell types and
MSC/immune cell crosstalk in vitro using cells from young and aged donors. We devised a tri-
culture model (MSC/ Mφ/T cells) to better mimic the complex cellular crosstalk in vivo. Lead
formulations that result in robust bone formation in the tri-culture model will be validated in vivo
using young and aged mouse critical-sized bone defect models. Our team has a long track
record of productive collaborations and this project will integrate our complementary expertise in
biomaterials, immunology, bone biology, aged animal models, tissue engineering, mass
cytometry, and single-cell sequencing. This project will pioneer the translation of CellMem-
coated scaffolds for enhanced regeneration in aging and elucidate the underlying mechanisms
through the use of a tri-culture model and high-dimensional assays."

The on-demand synthesis of microbe-specific PET radiotracers represents a significant challenge to their
clinical translation. To be useful, these tracers must be available to clinicians in the acute care setting, when
patients present with signs and symptoms of bacterial infection. In this proposal, we develop new
chemoenzymatic methods to synthesize infection-targeted PET tracers from the common oncologic tracer 2-
deoxy-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), using a simple phosphorylase-based approach designed to increase
access to new PET imaging tools in clinical practice. We will leverage these new methods for the detection of
S. aureus, a major culprit in vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis and other musculoskeletal infections. Perhaps
surprisingly, chemoenzymatic syntheses are infrequently applied to PET despite the advantages of
regioselective and stereoselective glycan construction. Based on reported microbe-specific disaccharides, we
developed a method to dimerize [18F]FDG to form positron-labeled disaccharides for detecting microorganisms
in vivo. As reported in our preliminary data, when [18F]FDG was reacted with D-glucose 1-phosphate (α/β
depending on the enzyme) in the presence of a disaccharide phosphorylase, the positron-labeled products 2-
deoxy-[18F]-fluoro-maltose (α-1,4 linked; [18F]FDM), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-sakebiose (α-1,3 linked; [18F]FSK) 2-
deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-trehalose (α-1,1 linked; [18F]FDT), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-laminaribiose (β-1,3 linked;
[18F]FDL), and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-cellobiose (β-1,4 linked; [18F]FDC) were separately obtained in 20 minutes.
Of the α-linked products, the sakebiose-derived tracer [18F]FSK showed the best performance in S. aureus,
based on high accumulation in vitro, stability in human serum, and specific detection of living bacteria in vivo.
Both synthetic ease, and high sensitivity of [18F]FSK to S. aureus including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains
strongly justify clinical translation of this tracer to infected patients. Initially the α-1,3 linked [18F]FSK was best
obtained as the minor product of maltose phosphorylase, but recently we were able to obtain [18F]FSK as the
sole product of reverse phosphorolysis using a L. phytofermentans-derived sakebiose phosphorylase, with
rapid purification via solid-phase extraction. In the proposed work, we will first expand methods for the
phosphorylase-mediated radiosynthesis of [18F]FSK (Specific Aim 1). We will improve techniques to make
[18F]FSK, including developing new tools to assist clinical production- for example via phosphorylase
immobilization and enzyme engineering to enhance thermal stability. We will then further validate these new
tools in preclinical models (Specific Aim 2), and study [18F]FSK in patients suffering from spinal infection
(Specific Aim 3). This project is focused on the on-demand radiosyntheses of S. aureus-targeted PET
sensors, but the methods developed will have wide applicability to other human pathogens and diseases."
10982126,"Breast reconstruction can help feminine-presenting individuals retain or regain quality of life by mitigating the
impacts of body image disruption due to appearance changes arising from mastectomy. Autologous
reconstruction is widely recognized as effective, with long term advantages over other techniques. However,
autologous reconstruction procedures are complex, lengthy operations requiring substantial skill and experience.
Moreover, a revision procedure is typically required to adequately restore the patient’s bodily form; in some
cases, multiple revisions are needed. Prior work investigated simple molds that merely copied the preoperative
shape and size of the patient's breasts, or a mirrored version of the contralateral breast in the case of unilateral
breast reconstruction. But many patients desire or require a different breast form after mastectomy and so simply
copying the preoperative ‘native’ breast form is inadequate. The proposed study would shift current clinical
practice paradigms by enabling patient-specific molds for patients whose reconstructive goals are not merely to
reproduce their preoperative breasts. Moreover, while a few proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of using patient-specific molds to shape tissue into a breast form, a critical barrier to progress in the
field is that no one has rigorously evaluated their impact. In contrast, the proposed study includes a randomized
controlled clinical trial for evaluation. The goal of this study is to develop clinical decision-support
algorithms for designing patient-specific breast molds for tissue shaping. We hypothesize that autologous
reconstruction will be more efficient when performed with patient-specific molds designed using our clinical
decision-support algorithms. The proposed project is significant because it has the potential to improve the
efficiency of autologous breast reconstruction, an important component of breast cancer rehabilitation. The
investigators are a multi-disciplinary team bringing complementary expertise in biomedical informatics,
biostatistics, engineering technology, and reconstructive procedures. This innovative project seeks to overcome
the limitations of prior studies by developing clinical decision-support algorithms to enable design of patient-
specific molds that are suitable for patients whose reconstructive goals are more complex than reproducing their
preoperative appearance. Our approach entails developing clinical decision-support algorithms informed by our
experience in image perception, machine learning, image processing, and shape modeling, and conducting a
thorough evaluation in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Our team will benefit from the extensive resources
available in the Multidisciplinary Breast Reconstruction Research Program. After successful completion of this
study, we will pursue a path to clinical translation analogous to existing products and services, such as current
systems for designing patient-specific molds used in mandible reconstruction."

This proposal details a 5-year plan to provide the candidate, Dr. Taha Gholipour, with the knowledge
and expertise to become an independent investigator. He is a board-certified neurologist and
epileptologist with research training in neuroimaging. The candidate's training will be guided by
established mentors with expertise in the field of epilepsy research, functional imaging, advanced
statistics and machine learning, and an advisory committee of scientists with collective expertise in
clinical neuroscience and image analysis across prominent institutions. Uncontrolled seizures from
epilepsy are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Current clinical and imaging predictors
of response to surgery are inadequate, and surgical treatment outcomes are mixed. Predicting
treatment outcome is critical for clinical decision making. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers noninvasive and
accessible means for assessment of brain networks and may complement current methods of surgical
planning to guide treatment. Statistical constraints from abundance of variables and data heterogeneity
in fMRI analysis can be addressed by application of novel statistical and machine learning methods.
The candidate will conduct a study with retrospective analysis of large multicenter datasets of resting
state fMRI studies from adult and pediatric focal epilepsy patients, and a prospective arm to identify
preliminary predictors of treatment response to guide future multi-site studies. The candidate will use
functional anomaly mapping method to identify associations of this method with commonly used
functional connectivity analysis and treatment outcomes 12 months after surgery. Post-surgical
resection masks, clinical outcomes of seizure control and cognitive decline from surgery are collected in
prospective arm. The goal is to identify common features in patients who become seizure-free following
surgery. This study will use innovative methods to improve non-invasive evaluation of patients with
refractory epilepsy, which can expand surgical candidacy for patients with or without apparent lesions
on MRI. This project aims to help overcome current barriers to personalized care for people with
epilepsy. The innovative use of advances statistics for solving clinical challenges in epilepsy imaging
will have a fundamental impact on designing future investigations focused on developing biomarkers,
predicting response to treatment, and understanding the disease mechanisms in epilepsy, as
advocated by the 2021 AES/NINDS Epilepsy Research Benchmarks."

 The majority of patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) report sleep problems such as insomnia. Sleep
disruption commonly occurs during opiate withdrawal and has been considered as a major factor that contributes
to relapse. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, and the circuits/neurons/genes that are
involved. One of major component of both the opioid withdrawal and arousal circuitry resides in the
monoaminergic nuclei—the locus coeruleus (LC), which is known to abundantly express µ-opioid receptors,
mediates opioid withdrawal symptoms, and promote wakefulness. In the proposed project, we will combine
activity-dependent labelling and intersectional strategies to specifically target the wake-active populations of LC
noradrenergic (LCNE-Wake) neurons and determine whether they are critical for morphine withdrawal-induced
sleep disturbances. In Aim 1, using cutting-edge systems neuroscience tools, we will determine whether
spontaneous withdrawal from chronic morphine administration disrupts the neuronal activity and membrane
properties of LCNE-Wake neurons, and functionally and molecularly characterize these dysfunctional neurons. In
Aim 2, we will further evaluate the functional role of major presynaptic inputs of LC, gigantocellular reticular
nucleus (Gi) of medulla in withdrawal-induced sleep disturbances, test whether activation of GABAergic neurons
in Gi can sufficiently mitigate the dysregulated sleep, and lastly map the spatial transcriptomic signatures of
Gi-LC neurobiological pathway during morphine withdrawal. Successful completion of these aims will advance
our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying OUD-associated sleep disturbances, potentially leading
to the development of effective therapies."

The Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford, a member site of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), works to improve the lives of patients with undiagnosed and rare diseases and their families. In a sustainable and inclusive manner, we offer cutting-edge diagnostic strategies and technologies to patients who continue a diagnostic odyssey after clinical options have been exhausted. In addition to pioneering innovative diagnostic methodology, we seek to deeply understand the needs and experience of the undiagnosed patient community to inform the design and implementation of best practices with regard to participant experience and the inclusion of underserved populations. The impacts of underinsurance and reduced access to subspecialty care and advanced diagnostics fall disproportionately on underserved populations, making it critical to build community partnerships in the conduct of rare disease studies. The Center for Undiagnosed Diseases (CUD) at Stanford will continue our efforts toward sustainability, refinement of methods, and collaboration with clinicians providing the standard of care. Here, we propose a program of study that will develop a deeper understanding of barriers to UDN enrollment faced by patients from underserved communities and implement mitigation strategies. To inform our work in studying barriers to participation and in building community partnerships, in Aim 1, we will establish an advisory board with representatives from the patient community as well as community health and social service providers. In Aim 2, we will work in collaboration with clinical partners in our region to identify, recruit, and diagnose a cohort of underserved, undiagnosed patients of diverse backgrounds, and empower community providers to participate in the UDN process through strategic partnering. In Aim 3, we will further enhance the diagnostic capabilities of the UDN by leveraging innovations in molecular diagnostics and advanced informatics. This work will include innovative approaches to transcriptomics, 2) long-read genome sequencing, 3) proteomics, and 4) the implementation of new strategies for the computational prioritization of candidate diagnosis and novel disease entities."

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (ANX) are genetically related traits that cause
very substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The large, diverse, and actively expanding Veterans Affairs
(VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) is an ideal setting for study of these problems. We have identified risk loci
for MDD and ANX in large genomewide association studies (GWAS), but the size and power of the MVP
dataset, and other datasets worldwide, continue to grow, and considerable work still needs to be done to
develop and maximize the scientific value of the MVP for these traits, and in relation to other datasets available
worldwide. The MVP sample (currently at >900,000 participants) is continuing to expand, and with more
subjects there will be increased power to map relevant traits, including constituent traits (i.e., social phobia).
Extensive phenotype data are available. MVP data releases for the coming year will include whole genome
sequence (WGS) data that will be available for novel analyses; and array data increasing marker density for
non-European populations. Together, availability of these data presents an enormous opportunity.
 We will make our GWAS data available via dbGAP and make further use of it for the present project
We will conduct gene-discovery analysis and leverage polygenicity to dissect the predisposition to MDD, ANX
(and specific anxiety and anxiety -related disorders and subphenotypes which may have distinct as well as
overlapping genetic risk). We will also study medication response genetics and traits phenotypically associated
with MDD and ANX in the MVP sample, e.g. cardiovascular disease, using approaches that permit testing of
likely causality among these correlated traits (e.g., Mendelian Randomization [MR]). We will use genomic
structural equation modeling (gSEM) to investigate the underlying genetic relationships of ANX, MDD, and
other related psychiatric and medical traits. We will complete polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis within MVP
and with respect to external samples using MVP data. WGS data will facilitate study of rare and structural
variants. As the VA has electronic health record (EHR) data going back to the 1990’s and the MVP has EHR
linkage, longitudinal and repeated measures can be constructed. We will replicate findings in collaboration with
other consortia such as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD (PGC-MDD) and anxiety (PGC-ANX)
working groups (we participate presently). Considering the MVP and other samples we will be able to access,
we predict that case numbers of both traits will increase 2-3 fold over the next five years, greatly increasing
power for locus discovery and thus for post-GWAS analyses. Finally, we will investigate these traits in non-
European populations including African Americans and Latinx – both particularly well-represented in the MVP
sample -- and other populations. Increased understanding of the underlying genetics of these traits should
ultimately lead to repositioning of currently-approved medications and identification of novel treatment targets."

Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents a growing threat to health equity. Continuously increasing in
incidence, T2D is up to 9-fold more common among racial-ethnic minoritized youth, and approximately half of
affected youth live in poverty. T2D diagnosis in childhood often results in severe complications by early
adulthood, as well as reduced life expectancy. Modification of diabetes-related health behaviors, including
nutrition and physical activity, is central to management, but several barriers exist for adolescents and young
adults (AYA) with T2D. These include hyperglycemia unawareness, delayed or burdensome glycemic feedback,
and the difficulty of attending intensive in-person interventions. Fortunately, wearable continuous glucose
monitors (CGMs) enable the development of remote just-in-time adaptive interventions that use real-time data
at the right time, in the right context to promote behavior change. With the transition to adult care, AYA with T2D
are particularly well suited to benefit from a CGM-supported intervention that supports development of diabetes
self-management skills and engagement in health behaviors. To lay the foundation for such an intervention, we
have developed Healthmine, a mobile app that integrates CGM, activity trackers, and diet logging for use by
individuals with diabetes. The objective for this R01 proposal, REFLECT2D, is to evaluate the time-dependent
glycemic impact of Healthmine app-based prompts. Aligned with the COM-B Model for Behavior Change,
Healthmine prompts are designed to foster motivation and actual engagement in health behaviors by providing
of an opportunity to review real-time data and by supporting the development of an improved capability to
interpret and act on such data. We will enroll 100 AYA ages 16-24 with T2D in a clinical trial, beginning with a
baseline study visit and educational session led by a certified diabetes education and care specialist and
registered dietitian. After a 10-day run-in with CGM to evaluate baseline glycemic control, we will conduct a 90-
day micro-randomized trial (MRT), in which each AYA will be randomized with equal (1/3) probability once daily
to receive a physical activity-focused prompt, a nutrition-focused prompt, or no prompt. In MRT, each participant
acts as their own control. After MRT, AYA will attend a second study visit to assess intermediate outcomes and
will continue to wear CGM for a 90-day observational period without app prompts, followed by final study visit,
to assess duration of effect on motivation and glycemic outcomes. Our approach will allow us to determine the
effects of prompts on short-term CGM-measured glycemia during MRT (Aim 1), characterize ongoing CGM and
app use and longer-term impact on glycemia during an observational period (Aim 2), and evaluate changes in
outcomes from baseline to follow-up, including glycemia and behavioral measures, as well as the role of
motivation as a mediator (Aim 3). Findings will inform the development of a CGM-based just-in-time adaptive
intervention, which will directly address barriers to in-person engagement in health behavior change, allowing
for scalability and ultimately reducing the widening health disparities caused by youth-onset T2D."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) rank prominently among age-associated
neurodegenerative disorders, with Parkinson’s disease trailing as the second most common. Contemporary
studies on AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have unveiled cognitive decline indicators mirrored in
nuances within gait and hand movements. These indications often emerge long before AD or MCI diagnoses
are confirmed. Consistently, research has correlated slowed gait with cognitive deterioration, elevated brain
amyloid levels, and an augmented AD risk. However, the interplay between systems influencing both cognition
and movement has largely been explored in separate studies. The depth of understanding around the cognitive
efforts required for gait initiation or motor planning remains scant. Though dementia screening traditionally
hinges on comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging biomarker studies, gait and
movement assessment offers a more direct approach. Crucially, motor features remain unaffected by
language, educational background, or cognitive capabilities, positioning them as unbiased and consistent
evaluative instruments. For example, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests can be easily
conducted at home and monitored, even using smartphone applications. In this project, we chart a course to
harness cutting-edge AI and computer vision (CV) tools to aid in distinguishing diverse dementia and MCI
subtypes, such as AD-related MCI versus MCI with PD pathologies. Our approach integrates multi-modal brain
imaging with gait and movement data from videos, aiming to extract nuanced markers for phenotyping
(pre)clinical AD. These markers can then serve as precise digital trackers for both the progression and
distinction of age-related degenerative disorders. Ultimately, we aspire to enhance the understanding of the
intricate links between gait, movement, and cognition in aging and AD/ADRD scenarios."

Mitochondria are centers of metabolism whose activities need to be calibrated to meet changing cellular needs.
General dysfunction of these organelles is implicated in many common human disorders, including metabolic
syndrome, type 2 diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, heart failure, various cancers and
neurodegenerative diseases, and general metabolic inflexibility, most often through unclear means. Defining the
pathogenic mitochondrial alterations that contribute to these metabolic disorders and devising new therapeutic
strategies to rectify them represent principal challenges in mitochondrial medicine. A potential contributor to this
dysfunction is aberrant intra-mitochondrial protein phosphorylation—a process recognized as critical for pyruvate
dehydrogenase regulation for more than 50 years, but relatively unexplored otherwise. Recent efforts from our
laboratory and others have now revealed that mitochondrial proteins are replete with dynamic phosphorylation
that changes reproducibly between healthy and diseased states, and that phosphorylation can alter the activities
of proteins involved in core metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we have connected select protein
dephosphorylation events to the poorly characterized matrix protein phosphatase PPTC7 and discovered that
PPTC7 disruption in mice causes profound metabolic defects and neonatal death. Given these emerging
findings, the premise of this project is that reversible phosphorylation may be widely important in calibrating
mitochondrial metabolism, and that its mismanagement could contribute to the pathophysiology of mitochondria-
related disorders. Rigorous new efforts to reveal how phosphorylation affects mitochondrial protein function and
to define the phosphatases that target each site may ultimately enable a new therapeutic strategy focused on
manipulation of the mitochondrial phosphorylation network. To this end, we have now extended our
phosphoproteomic analyses to 10 mitochondrial phosphatase knockdown lines using a CRISPRi system. This
rich dataset forges many unique connections between phosphatases and phosphoproteins and forms the
foundation for the further work proposed here. Based on these findings, we propose 1) to establish the functional
impact of phosphorylation on putative PPTC7 and HDHD5 substrates involved in core mitochondrial catabolic
pathways, including branched chain amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, and 2) to define the role of PGAM5 in
regulating mitochondrial cristae architecture by managing an extensive set of phosphorylation events on subunits
of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS). Altogether, through a comprehensive
approach that combines mammalian physiology, omics-level analyses, and rigorous biochemistry, we aim to
make definitive connections between mitochondrial phosphatases and their substrates, establish a broad
framework for understanding the role of this post-translation modification in calibrating mitochondrial activities,
and ultimately pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy to rectify mitochondrial dysfunction."

Our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of drug consumption and craving
has been greatly aided by the development of numerous computational models focused
on these behaviors. However, most of these models ignore the role of cost. To this end,
our proposal seeks to experimentally validate a novel computational neurobiological
model of costly drug-taking behavior centered on the striosomes of the dorsomedial
striatum (DMS). Notably, the striosomes lie at the center of the cortico-striatal-
dopaminergic circuit, which is critical for drug-seeking behavior and the evaluation of co-
occurring cost and reward. While DMS striosomes have been implicated in behaviors
such as locomotor sensitization to cocaine, no studies have investigated the
computational and experimental role of striosomes in a cost-drug tradeoff during self-
administration behavior. We recently developed a computational model of striosomal
state-switching in cost/benefit decision-making. Using this model, we have shown that
different neural ‘states’ such as stress and aging can, via striosomal circuitry, drive
distinct patterns of cost/benefit decision-making. Here, we seek to develop an expanded
version of this model to demonstrate a role for striosomal circuitry in driving drug-taking
in the face of cost. We hypothesize that the prelimbic-striosomal-substantia nigra pars
compacta circuit mediates the impact of craving on drug-cost tradeoffs and predicts
vulnerable drug-taking phenotypes associated with cost. We will assess drug-taking
using two distinct drug-taking paradigms that involve a cost: punished responding and
effortful responding. These two types of costs differentially impact drug-taking, and we
hypothesize that animals will form distinct patterns of vulnerability and resilience to
drug-taking paired with these costs. Furthermore, the neurocircuitry underlying these
two types of costs differs, and both sex and drug type (cocaine vs. opioids) differentially
interact with cost type. In total, our goal is to validate a computational model of costly
drug-taking during a craving state. Towards this goal, we will use electrophysiology,
optogenetics, and advanced modeling techniques to determine the role of the prelimbic-
striosomal (Aim 1) and striosomal-substantia nigra (Aim 2) circuits in vulnerability for
punished and effortful drug-taking behavior. Collectively, these studies will move us
towards our long-term goals of predicting individuals who are at-risk for relapse, and
providing new targets for intervention to prevent relapse."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of death despite the availability of lifesaving pharma-
cological and mechanical interventions. Complementary treatments are desperately needed, particularly for
individuals with advanced disease. Here, we propose foundational work toward realizing a hypothetical `medi-
cal revascularization' that could one day help patients with CAD by extending coronary arterial networks or in-
ducing natural bypasses through collateral arteries. An obstacle to `medical revascularization' is the lack of
known targetable pathways that can stimulate coronary artery growth and collateralization. Our principal ra-
tionale for overcoming this knowledge gap—based on our prior research individually and as a team—is that
studying coronary artery formation during embryonic and fetal development should identify pathways for re-
forming coronary arteries during disease. Since coronary development generates variations in anatomy, we
propose to identify regenerative pathways by studying the human population genetics of coronary artery ana-
tomical variation, or patterning, and then investigating the utility of identified genetic regulators using pre-clini-
cal experimentation. Our long-term goal is to use this information to develop new translational pathways. We
will first accurately classify three coronary patterning phenotypes routinely documented during coronary angi-
ography in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System, including anomalous coronary arteries, coronary domi-
nance, and coronary collateralization, and assess their impact on clinical cardiovascular outcomes nationwide
(Aim 1). Next, we will cross reference this dataset with the Million Veteran Program to identify the genetic de-
terminants through genome wide association studies (GWAS) in >90,000 participants of diverse ancestry, in-
cluding >16,000 African and >6,000 Hispanic American Veterans. Genetic discovery will be extended into the
multi-ancestry Penn Medicine Biobank through replication and meta-analysis. Downstream analyses on GWAS
summary statistics will identify the most compelling candidate causal genes at each susceptibility locus (Aim
2). The function of prioritized candidate genes will be comprehensively tested using mouse genetic manipula-
tions in developmental and injury models and a novel human iPSC-to-artery differentiation method (Aim 3).
The project is innovative because it leverages a combination of the nation's largest integrated health care sys-
tem, the oldest electronic health record system—including one of the most comprehensive registries of coro-
nary catheterization procedures—and the world's largest active biobank to conduct translational research. Ad-
ditionally, candidate genes will be experimentally validated in developmental and pre-clinical assays for coro-
nary artery and collateral formation. This research is significant because it will set the stage for the develop-
ment of novel therapies able to promote the growth of arteries that could substantially improve both the quality
and quantity of life in individuals suffering from CAD."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern worldwide with more than 1.4 million estimated
deaths in 2022. Despite recent declines in global TB incidence, the emergence and spread of drug-resistant
Mycobacterium tuberculosis have complicated the control of TB in many settings. Drug-resistant TB is
associated with higher mortality and morbidity and requires longer duration of treatment with multiple second-
line antibiotics that often have severe side effects. With the widespread adoption of Xpert MTB/RIF (a
molecular test for the rapid detection of TB and resistance to rifampicin) over the last 10 years, a growing
number of individuals with rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) are being detected and notified in many high-
burden settings. To determine an effective treatment regimen for a patient with RR-TB, the selection of
antibiotics would ideally be made based on the results of drug susceptibility tests (DSTs). However, because of
limited access to DSTs and lengthy delays in receiving DST results, the treatment of RR-TB in most settings
remains empiric (i.e., without the results of DSTs) and according to standardized second-line regimens, which
are endorsed at the global level. This results in many patients with RR-TB receiving suboptimal treatments,
which exposes them to a higher risk of treatment failure, increased toxicity, and the emergence of additional
resistance. To mitigate these issues, this project develops a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to optimize
medications for individuals with RR-TB, at the point of care, and based on the patient’s basic demographic and
clinical information (e.g., age, residence in urban or rural area, and history of TB treatment). The proposed tool
combines spatiotemporal machine learning and decision models to synthesize data from clinical trials of anti-
TB drugs, local surveillance systems of drug-resistant TB, and studies of cost and loss in quality of life due to
illness, treatment toxicity, treatment failure, and emergence of additional resistance. Employing a user-
centered design approach with direct input from stakeholders (e.g., TB practicing physicians, health services
researchers, laboratory specialist, and policymakers), this project develops a prototype of a user interface for
the proposed CDS tool with the potential to be implemented in routine clinical care and a follow-up randomized
clinical trials. This project also evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment
recommendations that are customized according to the local epidemiology of drug-resistant TB and/or
according to patients’ basic demographic and clinical information compared with the standardized treatment
regimens, which are determined at the global level. The proposed research is significant because it provides
TB clinicians in low-resource, high-burden settings with essential evidence and tools to improve the treatment
outcomes of patients with RR-TB while containing cost and slowing the spread of drug-resistant TB."
10980209,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common reportable sexually transmitted infection in the United States
that causes severe and costly morbidity. Black youth are disproportionately impacted, with Ct rates 7.5 times
higher than the rates among non-Black youth. In over two decades of Ct screening in young women,
population-based rates of Ct have declined for White youth but not for Black youth, and clinic-based Ct
screening is accessed less frequently than recommended by Black women, indicating that a different approach
is needed, particularly when considering structural racism and medical mistrust. We posit that a community-
based, seek, test, and treat approach is required. Check It (NICHD/NIAID R01HD086794) was a seek, test,
and treat bundled network approach to reducing chlamydia disparities that was designed for young Black men.
In 33.5 months of recruitment, we screened 1907 men and found a 10.6% Ct positivity rate. We found that
screening men reduced the rate in women by an average of 2.1 percentage points compared to synthetic
control sites; for every 5 men screened, 1 infection in women was averted; and that the program costs were
$5,468 per QALY gained. The study goal is to further adapt and refine Check It, a seek, test, and treat
community-based Ct prevention program aimed to reduce disparities among Black youth in the United
States. We will achieve this in three aims: Aim 1. To adapt and refine Check It – Using the ADAPT-ITT
framework47 and in collaboration with our intended population, content experts, and community partners, we
will make five adaptations to the program: inclusion of women, use of doxycycline, addition of a home
collection option, refinement of incentivized peer referral, and extragenital self-collection in the first year and
then readapt as needed in the third year. We will conduct interrupted time series analysis & hypothesize that
these adaptations will increase enrollment. Aim 2. To determine efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
adapted Check it– After adaptations and implementation among Black youth in New Orleans (N=2322), using
Medicaid data, we will compare New Orleans (intervention) to synthetic controls to examine the adapted
program's impact on women's Ct rates.48 We will also use time-motion analysis to examine the cost-
effectiveness,34 hypothesizing that inclusion of both men and women is cost effective and will logarithmically
reduce the rates of Ct infection in women. Aim 3. To examine the feasibility/utility of Ct/GC extragenital
and syphilis/HIV testing – Participants will be offered extragenital specimen self-collection & syphilis/HIV
testing. We hypothesize that >80% will accept to do extragenital testing and that syphilis/HIV rates will exceed
the national average. To break down health disparities, it is essential to go to the communities of those
impacted. If successful, Check It II can serve as a model for other sites ultimately reducing Ct disparities on a
broader basis. Check It II could also serve as a model for other STI interventions in this population such as
doxy PrEP or vaccines."
10980216,"Despite success of lipid lowering therapies, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading
cause of death worldwide. We use human genetics coupled to single cell profiling of atherosclerotic lesions to
provide insights into new molecular and cell-specific mechanisms of plaque vulnerability and CVD risk. Although
plaque histology classifications have identified key characteristics (e.g., thin fibrous caps) that relate to clinical
events, traditional histology may not capture the molecular complexity and full informativeness of lesion
histology. There is great need for evaluation and integration of new histomorphological (HM), cellular, genomic
and spatial features of plaque vulnerability in human lesions as well as in mouse models, which fail to recapitulate
key lesion hallmarks of clinical events in humans. Our preliminary data in human and mouse atherosclerotic
lesions suggest that advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms can identify novel HM and spatial transcriptomic
(ST) features of plaque vulnerability. We propose to: (1) in Aim 1, apply our novel hierarchical image feature ML
extraction approach to high-resolution histology image data from unstable (n=300) vs. stable (n=300) carotid as
well as 200 coronary and 200 peripheral lesions from the Munich Vascular Biobank (MVB) to detect novel lesion
features and regions that associate with unstable vs. stable plaque status and coronary plaque types as well as
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); (2) in Aim, 2 use the 10x Genomic Xenium platform, to perform
ST and histology in the same sections of a subset of MVB lesions (n=64), map ST data to HM features, and
deploy a novel super-resolution gene expression prediction algorithm to expand ST data to all 1000 MVB
plaques. We will then test whether gene expression and cell-subtype features associate with MACE and if this
is independent of HM features; (3) in Aim 3, integrate existing MVB SNP data, lesion bulk RNA-seq data and
scRNA-seq to perform cell deconvolution analysis and infer cell subtype proportions in bulk RNA-seq data. These
data will be used to identify SNPs for cell subtype-specific expression (eQTLs) and for HM (hmQTLs), and
through genetic colocalization analyses with CVD GWAS SNPs to infer causality for specific genes, cell subtypes
and HM features in CVD events. Each aim will also map mouse lesion HM and ST features to human data to
identify features in mouse lesion that are shared with clinically-relevant HM and ST features in human plaques.
This will advance greater translational fidelity of mouse models of atherosclerosis. Finally, because of emerging
prominence for smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived cells and their regulatory genes in plaque vulnerability and
GWAS loci for CVD, human and mouse models will incorporate SMC-lineage tracing to validate SMC-cell origin
in HM and ST features of plaque vulnerability and CVD. Our proposal provides a unique integrative platform,
supported by human genetics, to implicate novel genes, cell subtypes and HM features in lesion vulnerability
and CVD risk. This work will advance mechanism-based therapeutics for CVD in an era of residual CVD risk
despite aggressive LDL-C lowering in high-risk patients."
10980220,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this work is to develop a non-invasive imaging strategy for quantifying chemotherapy-
induced vascular toxicity to better understand the potential role of image-derived measures of venous
inflammation for predicting risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult
(AYA) patients undergoing cancer treatment. Chemotherapy is known to have off-target vascular effects that
increase the risk for VTE. In spite of this recognized risk, risk models are not regularly used to guide
preventative anticoagulation in young cancer patients and preventative thromboprophylaxis is traditionally
avoided due to a high risk of bleeding associated with cancer and concurrent chemotherapy. Therefore, there
is a need for biomarkers that can assess chemotherapy-induced toxicity, identify patients at highest risk for
VTE, and detect the potential anti-inflammatory vascular effects of thromboprophylaxis. In this proposal, we will
validate and test a molecular imaging approach for characterizing chemotherapy-induced venous toxicity from
PET/CT images acquired as part of routine care in pediatric and AYA patients undergoing treatment for
lymphoma. To accomplish this overarching goal, we will first pre-clinically validate 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging as
a non-invasive biomarker of chemotherapy-induced venous toxicity. We will then clinically evaluate the
prognostic value of our imaging approach for predicting risk for VTE by collecting whole-body PET/CT images
from a large multi-site cohort of pediatric and AYA patients with lymphoma and prospectively monitoring
occurrence of VTE events. Following pre-clinical validation and clinical testing of our approach, we will assess
the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging for detecting the anti-inflammatory actions of standard
thromboprophylaxis methods. Validation of PET/CT imaging for detecting venous toxicity, risk for VTE, and
responses to thromboprophylaxis could provide a non-invasive approach for enabling real-time monitoring of
adverse vascular effects associated with cancer treatment in pediatric and AYA patients and identifying those
at high risk for VTE."

The healthcare sector is undergoing a transformation driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning
(AI/ML) technologies, which offer potential for enhancing research, optimizing patient outcomes, and increasing
healthcare systems' efficiency. However, many researchers, especially from underrepresented communities,
face limited access to resources and opportunities in this field. We propose a multi-faceted approach to promote
diversity and inclusion, including online competitions and annual workshops catering to a wide range of
participants. We have a strong track record of engaging with Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) through AI-Campus and national competition organization experiences. We have organized events
such as the iDASH genomic privacy workshop and encouraged students to participate in the Dream challenge.
Partnering with HBCUs has increased interest in AI/ML and diversity in the field. Our proposed series of events,
""AI-Campus Workshops: Revolutionizing Healthcare with AI and Machine Learning to Promote Diversity and
Inclusion,"" will build upon this track record of success. Aim 1 focuses on creating annual competitions for
healthcare outcome improvements, designing datasets that represent real-world problems, and providing
opportunities to underrepresented participants. Aim 2 involves organizing annual workshops on the latest AI/ML
advances in healthcare, inviting diverse speakers, and offering experience with the latest tools and technologies.
Aim 3 centers on engaging with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), such as Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), to ensure diverse representation in our AI/ML
healthcare initiatives. Through these aims, we will empower participants with essential skills, knowledge, and
connections needed to excel in the healthcare AI/ML landscape. Our vision is to foster a vibrant and inclusive
community of researchers and practitioners committed to advancing AI/ML in healthcare. By facilitating diverse
participation, education, and collaboration, we aim to make a significant impact on AI/ML for healthcare and
nurture a diverse, inclusive community that propels progress and innovation in healthcare to benefit everyone."
10979790,"The overarching goal of this project is to improve our mechanistic understanding of
pregnancy complications in organ transplant recipients. By studying a patient population
with increased risks of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, this project fills critical
knowledge gaps in reproductive immunology and improves the health of all women.
Pregnancy in organ transplant recipients has historically been difficult to study because
reproductive age females represent a minority of transplant recipients and pregnancy has
been discouraged given concerns around maternal and fetal health. We overcome these
prior limitations by leveraging our access to a unique cohort of transplant recipients who
receive a uterus transplant for the express purpose of gestation and delivery. Notably,
uterus transplant recipients have high rates of pre-eclampsia and other disorders of
placentation, which may be due to perturbations in natural killer cell biology as these cells
play critical roles in spiral artery remodeling and placentation. Hence, defects in uNK
development, homeostasis, and function likely contribute to the pathogenesis of
pregnancy complications. Importantly, our prior studies suggest that immunosuppression
medications that transplant recipients receive may impact the survival, localization, and
function of uterine natural killer cells, thereby providing mechanistic insights into why
pregnancy complications in organ transplant recipients are frequent. Notably, the
alterations we have observed in uterine NK cells in uterus transplant recipients associate
with abnormal placental histology and have had clinical consequences. In this proposal,
we thus build upon these findings to better understand the molecular mechanisms
underpinning defects in uNK development, homeostasis and function using uterus
transplantation as a model system. We accomplish these goals by analyzing endometrial
biopsies from uterus transplant recipients as well as healthy controls using state-of-the-
art single-cell technologies (i.e., single cell RNA-sequencing, single-nuclear RNA-seq;
CITE-seq) alongside high dimensional, multi-parameter flow cytometry and imaging
studies (i.e., immunofluorescence microscopy and spatial transcriptomics). These
experiments using human samples are complemented by in vivo mouse studies where
placentation in the setting of immunosuppression can be better studied across all phases
of pregnancy."
10979855,"Sjögren's disease (SjD), a common systemic autoimmune disease characterized by severe oral and ocular
dryness and multi-organ involvement, has no disease modifying treatment available. Clinical trials to date have
failed due to the clinical and biologic heterogeneity of SjD. As a result, it is important to subset SjD patients into
pathobiologically similar groups, called endotypes. SjD patients who have a high number of lymphocytes in their
salivary gland (SG) represent one endotype. This biopsy positive (Bx+) endotype has high cytokines that signal
via Janus kinases (JAKs) and higher levels of autoantibodies. Another approach to generate biologically unique
endotypes is to stratify by hallmark symptoms of dryness, pain, and fatigue. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
are enriched in SjD compared to control SGs and have divergent signaling pathways preclinically, suggesting
that SG-MSCs might drive pathogenesis. The long-term goal is to mechanistically explain and generate therapies
that target SG-MSCs in SjD. The overall objective of this application is to define how SjD endotypes modify MSC
immunobiology, comparing mouse to human SG-MSCs. The central hypothesis is that MSCs are drivers of SjD
pathogenesis through their maladaptive response to the cytokines unique to certain endotypes. The rationale for
this project is based on new data that SG-MSCs treated with IFN become maladaptive and promote
CD4+CXCR3+ T-cell and B-cell chemotaxis. These new data identify targetable maladaptive MSC behavior;
however, the response to other inflammatory cytokines in endotype-specific SjD SG microenvironments is
unknown. This knowledge is critical to define and target the pathogenic contributions of SG-MSCs in SjD. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine the signaling pathways driving
maladaptive mouse MSCs and SjD using multiple JAK inhibitors as translational immunopharmacological probes
in Bx+ endotype; and 2) define pathologic responses and heterogeneity of human MSCs in SjD by endotype. In
aim 1, Bx+ phenotype SjD mice will be treated with JAK inhibitors as immunopharmacological probes. SG-MSC
transcript and protein profile, localization, and neighbors in situ will be determined using sequential FISH with
hybridization chain reaction (seqFISH-HCR) by each treatment. SG-MSC maladaptive phenotype and function
will be verified in vitro and SjD-like disease in mice will be measured. In aim 2, human MSC transcript and protein
profiles, localization, and neighbors will be determined, comparing endotypes. Maladaptive MSC behavior will
be mechanistically tested in vitro with aim 1 JAK inhibitors, identifying parallels between mice and humans. The
proposed research is innovative, because it focuses on SjD endotypes, critical to guiding future pharmacologic
MSC targeting and to deconvoluting SjD heterogeneity. Furthermore, it uses seqFISH-HCR technology for high
resolution insight into the MSC phenotype in situ. The proposal is significant because it clarifies the pathobiology
of a novel immunomodulatory cell, the SG-MSC, by SjD endotype, opening new horizons for MSC- and SjD
endotype-targeted therapies. It also performs highly translatable comparisons in vivo between JAK inhibitors."

 Alterations in brain circuits underlying defensive behavior are thought to substantially contribute to the
dysfunction present in anxiety disorders, which frequently emerge in adolescence, affect roughly one in three
individuals in their lifetime, and are a leading cause of health burden globally. Research in nonhuman animal
models shows that defensive responses to threats are mediated by multiple subcortical pathways involving the
superior colliculus, and human neuroimaging studies show that functional alterations in the colliculus-pulvinar-
amygdala pathway are present in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. However, it is
presently unclear how the human superior colliculus contributes to fear and anxiety, whether by participating in
subcortical circuits that coordinate defensive behavior, or via pathways to cortical systems involved in spatial
attention, emotional arousal, and emotional experience more broadly. The long-term goal of the proposed
research is to develop a mechanistic understanding of human superior colliculus pathways across domains of
function relevant to mental health. Here we aim to characterize its contribution to defensive behavior and
emotional experience across multiple tasks in a community-based functional magnetic resonance imaging
study and using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Aim 1 evaluates the
functional specificity of superior colliculus pathways, using machine learning techniques to model
pathway connectivity as individuals perform tasks involving probabilistic avoidance learning, spatial attention,
and naturalistic aversive experience concurrent with fMRI. The functional relevance of each pathway will be
established by examining correlations between pathway activation and task-relevant behavior. Aim 2
identifies how looming threat is encoded in the human superior colliculus, its connectivity with cortical
systems, and its relationship with subjective experience. We will use computational neuroimaging approaches
to evaluate whether fMRI signal in the superior colliculus is better explained by encoding models that capture
dynamic or static representations of threat and characterize how representations of threat encoded in the
superior colliculus covary with activity in cortical systems and self-reported experience. Aim 3 will determine
the relationship between individual differences in frontal-superior colliculus pathway activity and
anxiety symptoms during adolescence. We will test the hypothesis that cortical pathways to the superior
colliculus attenuate responses to threat cues and are negatively associated with individual differences in
anxiety using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Completing these aims will
provide foundational knowledge of how the superior colliculus is involved in defensive behavior, subjective
fear, and emotional arousal, and the degree to which alterations in specific pathways are related to anxiety. We
expect that findings from this research will provide insights into the brain mechanisms underlying anxiety
disorders and facilitate translational efforts across species and into clinical settings."
10979975,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Programmed axon degeneration (AxD), a.k.a. Wallerian degeneration, is a genetically encoded cellular
program akin to apoptosis by which neurons effect the orderly demolition of diseased or damaged axons. Our
prior work demonstrated that the chief executioner of AxD, SARM1, is an NAD+ hydrolase allosterically regulated
by NAD+ and its precursor NMN. SARM1 activation causes depletion of NAD+ that leads to local metabolic
catastrophe and axon dissolution. SARM1-dependent AxD was primarily elucidated in models of acute injury that
trigger all-or-none rapid axon loss, but we and others have also identified diverse conditions that provoke chronic
SARM1 activation below the threshold necessary to provoke rapid AxD. Such subliminal SARM1 activity likely
contributes to common neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, CMT2A and diabetic neuropathy. Our
evidence indicates that this activity involves upstream and downstream molecular mechanisms that may not be
engaged during canonical axotomy-induced Wallerian degeneration, mechanisms that impair axon resilience
and contribute to compromised axon integrity and function in progressive neurodegenerative disorders. To
enable the study of this subliminal SARM1 activity, we developed means to both manipulate and monitor the
AxD pathway via titrating SARM1 activation and quantitatively measuring cADPR, a SARM1 activity biomarker.
Here we use these tools to investigate the regulation of SARM1 by post-translational modification and the
mechanisms by which DNA damage induces SARM1-dependent AxD. Our preliminary data show that SARM1
binds to and is ubiquitinated by Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage. We propose experiments to
determine the unexplored impact of K63 regulatory ubiquitination on SARM1 activity. Such regulatory events are
likely to impact chronic SARM1 activation and progressive disease. We will use kinase inhibitor panels to identify
novel SARM1 regulators and employ a fluorescent SARM1 activity sensor and imaging-based screening
technologies we recently developed to identify molecular components regulating SARM1 function by performing
a CRISPR screen in models of subliminal SARM1 activation using gRNAs targeting all druggable genes including
most kinases. We also find that disrupted cellular DNA repair activates SARM1-dependent AxD. DNA damage
is associated with peripheral neuropathy in many neurodegenerative diseases including ALS and rare genetic
disorders, as well as after chemotherapy. We will define the mechanisms of SARM1 activation due to DNA
damage and how SARM1 promotes DNA damage-induced degeneration using human motor neuron models of
ALS. Finally, our previous work led directly to development of therapeutic SARM1 inhibitors that are now in
clinical development. Here we propose to develop therapeutic SARM1 activators as axon-specific neurolytics to
treat localized chronic pain. In total, these studies will define mechanisms that regulate subliminal SARM1
activation relevant to chronic disease, identify alternative therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders,
and directly generate novel non-opioid medicines to treat pain."

Rare diseases have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, who are left on the road of a psychologically challenging, expensive and uncertain diagnostic odyssey that sometimes lasts years. In many cases, patients receive multiple wrong diagnoses in the interim and may miss windows of intervention. Our proposal leverages the broad clinical, research and data science expertise at UC Irvine (UCI) and Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) in conjunction with Ambry Genetics’ expertise in clinical testing and infrastructure to provide affordable and comprehensive evaluations for patients with undiagnosed diseases as well as several Community Health Partners with access to medically underserved populations. The result will be an academic + non-profit + community + commercial partnership based in Orange County that will serve as a regional hub covering a large US Southwestern area within the national UDN. The Southern California UDN (SoCal UDN) site will be built on the foundation of the existing UCI/CHOC Diagnostic Center of Excellence, which is able to collect in-depth phenotype and genotype data in a sustainable fashion by performing studies on a clinical basis whenever possible and collaborating with existing translational research studies for genomics, research phenotyping, or functional evaluations. Our partnership with Ambry will further allow research genomic data to be generated from clinically covered exome sequencing. This proposal will promote rapid expansion of our program. Through partnerships with regional tertiary medical centers with whom we have a history of collaboration, we will bring UDN expertise and resources to patients throughout the American Southwest that would not otherwise have access to a local UDN clinical site, facilitate appropriate evaluation prior to acceptance, and avoid unnecessary travel for clinical phenotyping studies. We will work with community partners to improve equity for underserved populations in our region including the economically disadvantaged and Vietnamese Americans. To improve efficiency and promote sustainability, we will leverage the extensive machine learning and AI infrastructure at UCI to include machine-assisted subject identification, informed consent, record review, data management, and result disclosure into our workflow. By participating in the larger UDN, we will facilitate data and sample sharing in a way that will improve the understanding of rare diseases and advance the diagnostic process for patients with previously undiagnosed diseases."
10980260,"PROJECT SUMMARY
FOXP3 is a key transcription factor for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
amorphic mutations at this locus in humans and mice lead to systemic autoimmune diseases and allergic
symptoms. Human FOXP3 encodes two major isoforms, a full length (FOXP3 FL isoform) and an alternatively
spliced isoform lacking exon 2 (FOXP3 ∆E2 isoform), while mouse Foxp3 gene only produces the FOXP3 FL
isoform. The roles of these two isoforms in health and disease have not been clearly defined. We generated
mice with Foxp3 exon 2 deletion (Foxp3dE2) to study the functionality of FOXP3 ΔE2 isoform in vivo and
demonstrated that expression of FOXP3 ΔE2 isoform resulted in significantly more severe allergic airway
inflammation after repeated intranasal allergen (both OVA and HDM) challenge compared with wild type mice
expressing only the FOXP3 FL isoform. Despite having comparable suppressive function to FOXP3 FL Tregs,
FOXP3 ΔE2 Tregs are less stable and have greater propensity to transdifferentiate into T helper cells.
Furthermore, FOXP3 ΔE2 Tregs express higher levels of Il4 and Il9 than FOXP3 FL Tregs. We hypothesize
that dysregulated FOXP3 isoform expression in airway Tregs (i.e. elevated FOXP3 ΔE2 expression) is one of
the risk factors for asthma persistence and severity. We will test our hypothesis in the following three specific
aims using unique mouse strains developed in our lab: WT (Foxp3FL) mice expressing only the FOXP3 FL
isoform, Foxp3dE2 mice expressing only the FOXP3 ΔE2 isoform, and humanized Foxp3huE2 mice co-
expressing both isoforms through alternative splicing as in humans. (1) Define the role of the FOXP3 isoforms
in severity and persistence of allergic airway inflammation. We will determine the severity of airway
inflammation, Treg phenotypes, and FOXP3 isoform expression in Foxp3FL, Foxp3dE2 and Foxp3huE2 mice after
chronic exposure to allergens. (2) Elucidate the mechanism of FOXP3 isoform regulation of Th9 differentiation.
We will determine, at the molecular and cellular level, how FOXP3 affects Th9 differentiation and Treg to Th9
transdifferentiation. (3) Define the association of FOXP3 isoform expression with human asthma severity. We
will examine the expression of human FOXP3 isoforms in patients with asthma and test whether FOXP3
isoform expression correlates with disease severity and impacts Th9 and Th17 differentiation. The information
learned from these studies will provide novel insights into the physiological functions of these two naturally
existing human FOXP3 isoforms and would pave the way to develop efficient clinical protocols aimed at
prevention/treatment of allergic diseases."
10980981,"ABSTRACT.
In eukaryotic cells, the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) provide critical metabolic control by regulating
glucose uptake rate. In the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), comprising intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the GLUT2-
SGLT1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter 1) axis, which facilitates post-prandial luminal dietary glucose absorption,
has been conventionally assumed to be also responsible for their basal glucose uptake. Yet, transgenic mice
with Sglt1 or Glut2 ablation have not been reported to exhibit any perturbation on epithelial cell composition.
Moreover, the basolaterally localized GLUT2 has a very low affinity for glucose (Km=20 mM), which is
significantly higher than that of the basal blood glucose concentration (~7 mM). Thus, GLUT2 can only take up
glucose during high glycemic states (e.g., after feeding). These observations suggest that other glucose
transporters may be involved in ISC glucose uptake. Identifying such transporter would be significant as it would
also enable mechanistic investigations into the role of glucose in ISC homeostasis. Specifically, ISCs are known
to be susceptible to their metabolic milieu, rapidly adapting their proliferation and differentiation to various types
of metabolites, including ketone bodies, bile acids, and fatty acids. Surprisingly, despite constituting one of the
most prevalent metabolic substrates, the role of glucose and its derivatives in ISC homeostasis and regeneration
is poorly understood. Our recent findings indicate that contrary to the established paradigm, both small intestinal
and colonic ISCs express GLUT1. Importantly, GLUT1 is vital to ISC homeostasis, wherein its genetic ablation
specifically in Lgr5+ ISCs or across IECs profoundly compromises ISC glucose metabolism, proliferation, and
differentiation. Notably, we observed that ISC function is crucially dependent on a GLUT1-fueled generation of
nucleosides through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). As such, PPP inhibition also hampers organoid
growth, whereas supplementation with nucleosides, the key byproducts of PPP, recovers both Glut1-ablated
mice and PPP-inhibited organoids. Notably, nucleosides administration stimulates ISC and epithelial
regeneration following irradiation and DSS-induced injuries. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
ISCs vitally rely on the GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake, which they primarily use in the PPP. We will test our
hypothesis in three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the in vivo role of GLUT1 in intestinal epithelial
homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the metabolic dependency of ISCs on glucose in homeostasis. In Aim
3, we will identify the role of the GLUT1-PPP axis in intestinal epithelium regeneration. Successful achievement
of our objectives will reveal that GLUT1 plays a pivotal role in ISC function. We will also determine the functional
role and metabolic fate of glucose in ISC homeostasis and during regeneration. This information will set the
stage for follow-up mechanistic studies into the potential role of GLUT1-glucose-PPP in pathological conditions
such as diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease."

activities via our Operations Unit to ensure the collective is able to set, monitor and reach
programmatic goals. This will include supporting site communications, establishing oversight
committees, defining channels for NHGRI interaction, and facilitating network evolution. 2) We
will work with the CSs to select and optimize Network projects through our Design and Outcomes
Unit. This group will offer statistical, methodologic, and operations expertise to promote both
master protocol development and tailored local context modifications. We will cooperatively
determine how best to refine and redeploy interventions after evaluation to foster cycles of true

and Informatics Unit and CSs. This standardized approach will be essential to enabling effective
collaboration, monitoring, and evaluation across sites. 4) We will implement the Engagement Unit.
This group will promote bidirectional, longitudinal engagement from diverse communities; help
CSs build and sustain trust; ensure strengths of each CS are nurtured and shared; facilitate
dissemination of findings; and encourage engagement with payors, providers, and health

10981480,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The healing response within the myocardium after a myocardial infarction (MI) is complex and involves both
temporal and regional changes including inflammation, cardiac scar formation, and tissue remodeling. Within
minutes following ischemic injury neutrophils and monocytes are recruited to the damaged heart. As the
monocytes are activated, enter the myocardium and are stimulated by the cardiac environment, they mature into
a diverse population of macrophages. In the first days post-MI, inflammatory monocytes and macrophages
facilitate the removal of necrotic tissue by secreting proteases and inflammatory enzymes and cytokines. As
healing progresses, the reparative less inflammatory macrophages begin to dominate, secreting anti-
inflammatory cytokines and communicating with myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, parenchymal and local
progenitor cells to help coordinate remodeling and repair of the damaged tissue. Over the last decade the
importance of the spleen has been highlighted as a reservoir for the majority of monocytes trafficking to the heart
in response to ischemic damage. Upon infarction, increased angiotensin II levels promote the migration of
monocytes from the spleen to the heart where they differentiate into macrophages and partake in the
inflammatory phase of the insult. Further, the spleen is a major site of monocyte proliferation post MI and
contributes significate numbers or monocytes throughout the duration of acute inflammation. Days after the initial
injury, the phenotype of monocytes recruited from the spleen changes to one that is reparative, differentiating
into macrophages which suppress inflammation, inducing matrix deposition and angiogenesis. We have
demonstrated that the systemic inhibition of HDACs results in myocardial preservation after MI, and more
recently shown that the delivery of this pan-HDAC inhibitor specifically to the spleen is capable of producing a
comparable therapeutic effect, yet at a 33-fold reduced dose. This proposal thus aims to unearth the
mechanisms responsible for this observed efficacy, both within the spleen and the heart. As well, the advanced
nanomaterials with enhanced splenic retention will also be utilized to dissect the relevant contributions of each
HDAC to the therapeutic effect, ultimately resulting in an optimized therapeutic regime."

vaccines, their poor uptake in the US, their inaccessibility in many parts of the world where these cancers are
most frequent, and the fact they do not eliminate pre-existing persistent infections that can lead to cancer, and
they do not treat the resulting cancers, requires that we continue advancing studies on these important human
tumor viruses. During the current, highly productive funding period for this R35 (58 publications) we made many,
important, new insights that shed light on how papillomaviruses (PV) i) evade host immunity to establish
persistent infections that lead to cancer, ii) how this same mechanism contributes to resistance to immunotherapy
in mice and humans, iii) how estrogen alters systemic and host immunity to drive persistent PV infections and
PV-induced disease, iv) that PV-induced cancers arise from epithelial progenitor cells, v) that PVs alter the
microbiome, and vi) the role of host genes in PV-associated cancers. Many of these studies arose through our
broad study of a recently discovered mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) that we and others have demonstrated
induces the same range of cancers caused by HPVs in humans, is sexually transmitted as with HPVs that cause
cancer, and shows a similar propensity and mechanism of integration into the host genome, as seen with HPVs,
while other studies made use of our first and new, second-generation HPV transgenic mouse models. We also
made important new gains to our knowledge of Merkel cell polyomavirus and its role in human cancer, and we
contributed to numerous collaborative studies with other leading labs in the field of tumor virology. The
competitive renewal application of this R35 builds extensively on these important gains in knowledge. Broadly,
our proposed studies are focused on three general directions of study: 1) understanding the role of host immunity
in papillomaviral pathogenesis; 2) characterizing MmuPV1-induced cancers and their relevance to HPV-related
cancer; and 3) defining the interplay between the microbiome and papillomavirus-induced disease. The R35
mechanism has allowed my research program to pursue many new avenues of research that have yielded
significant, field-altering discoveries. We will apply and build upon these discoveries in our future research
directions of this competitive renewal. We will leverage our expertise in animal model development and
innovative, state-of-the-art approaches to pursue experiments aimed at answering many of the new questions
raised by our studies over the current funding period. In the process, I will continue to train the next generation
of scientists, as demonstrated by the fact that three trainees during the current funding period took faculty
positions at highly ranked universities across the US. I am excited to be nominated by the Dean of the University
of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health to submit this competitive renewal application."

Based Reconstruction
Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), despite its wide utility, is inherently limited due to its inability to measure
tissue properties quantitatively, which is critical for objective and scanner-independent diagnosis and treatment
monitoring. MR Fingerprinting (MRF) is a relatively new quantitative MRI framework for simultaneous
quantification of multiple tissue properties. While MRF outperforms most conventional methods in quantitative
imaging, existing MRF techniques are still handicapped by limited spatial resolution and coverage, long
acquisition times, suboptimal acquisition parameters, long data reconstruction times, and complicated post-
processing workflows, hindering large-scale clinical validation and translation.
In this project, we will leverage the expertise of our team in MRF, machine learning, and pulse sequence
optimization to develop and optimize a rapid and robust quantitative MR technique, applicable to high-resolution
volumetric brain imaging. Our team has recently developed a new B1-insensitive MRF method using low flip
angles and multiple magnetization preparations for improved accuracy and precision in tissue quantification
compared with existing MRF methods. We will first develop and optimize this new MRF method for 3D high-
resolution brain imaging, using our newly developed pulse sequence design framework. Novel fat navigator will
be incorporated to improve motion robustness (Aim 1). We will leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques
to accelerate both acquisition and post-processing (Aim 2). Finally, a complete MRF post-processing pipeline
empowered by GPU cloud computing will be developed to significantly simplify the post-processing workflow
and facilitate efficient clinical translation and validation of the proposed methods for patients with neurological
diseases (Aim 3)."
10980909,"Project Summary/Abstract
For almost 100 years, a large number of electrophysiology studies have reported on resting-state (RS)
neural activity in humans. This research often focuses on RS alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz in adults), as
RS alpha activity it is commonly interpreted as reflecting the brain's readiness to process information,
predicting task performance and processing speed, and being integral to coordinating local- and long-
range functional connectivity. Infant RS studies seek to understand infant RS neural processes and the
maturation of these processes, with the first two years of life a peak period of neural reorganization, and
with variation in the maturation of RS activity contributing to normal variation in development as well as
clinical disorders. In infants and toddlers, this line of research is constrained by difficulty obtaining
prototypical high SNR eyes-closed RS electrophysiology measures, with almost all infant studies
obtaining RS measures while infants view visual stimuli, and with an eyes-open condition not generating
a robust infant `alpha' response. During the current cycle of this R01 (locally referred to as Babies' Brains
Change (BBC)), we developed methods that overcome barriers that have to date limited progress. Our
intention is that findings from this continuation R01 will provide direct tests of theories of infant
maturation of brain function, structure, and chemistry and their relationship to each other and
behavior, change the way infant RS electrophysiology studies are conducted, and show the way
forward for further discoveries about those relationships. Progress will be made via (1) the use of an
eyes-open dark-room (DR) task advanced by the PI and which provides RS measures with a high-SNR
dominant oscillation response in awake infants, (2) using recently developed algorithms to parameterize
the RS power spectrum to obtain estimates of RS periodic activity (e.g., the canonical RS dominant
oscillation) and RS aperiodic activity (i.e., the `background' neural activity), (3) assessing RS activity in
brain space so that regional differences in RS neural activity can be identified, and so that hypothesized
associations between RS neural activity and brain structure (gray and white matter), brain chemistry
(glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)), and behavior can be optimally evaluated, and
(4) obtaining temporally dense brain measures as understanding brain development requires assessing
maturational processes. At Time 1, evaluable data (MEG measures of infant RS activity, MRI measures
of gray and white matter, MRS measures of Glu and GABA, and developmental milestone measures) will
be obtained from 70 infants, with a 4-month interval between visits, and with a total of 4 visits. It is
predicted that the project findings will identify regional differences in the maturation of RS neural activity,
show that brain structure and chemistry predict the structure of the RS activity, and that RS measures will
predict the time to developmental milestones (e.g., age when first walking)."

Light plays a vital role in regulating physiological processes and influences female reproductive success through
the circadian system. However, most modern Americans live the majority of their lives indoors where electrical
lighting is lower quality than natural light, resulting in exposure to lower intensities of light for an extended duration
past sunset, compared to outdoor lighting. Increased reproductive disorders found in nighttime shift workers and
seasonal reductions in assisted reproductive technology (ART) success provide compelling evidence that light
quality is linked with female fertility. Light exposure comprises various qualities, including photoperiod and
intensity, which play a role in resetting circadian rhythms. Although light affects ovarian function in both humans
and nocturnal rodents, it remains unclear how these light properties contribute to female reproductive success.
Additionally, trace elements (TE), such as zinc, are essential for follicle development, fertilization, and IVF
success. Serum TE exhibit circadian variations in humans and nocturnal rats, but the impact of light and circadian
variations on TE and female fertility is not well understood. Most research on photic and TE mechanisms that
control fertility relies on nocturnal rodents; however, given the opposing in timing in hormone release, ovulation,
light responses, and circadian TE levels between nocturnal and diurnal species, this approach leaves a critical
gap in our ability to understand how light influences fertility in diurnal species, including humans. I will address
this gap by using a diurnal rodent model, the Nile grass rat, to investigate how the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
axis adapts to changes in light quality. My preliminary data show that light quality modulates reproduction in
grass rats, where long and bright days (LD14:10, 1000 Lux) reduce time to first litter in grass rats compared to
standard conditions (LD12:12, 300 Lux). I also show that state-of-the-art laser ablation time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) can be used to generate quantitative maps of TE in the ovary and hypothalamus.
These data, coupled with work from my Co-Sponsor validating grass rat superovulation and embryo culture,
place me in an excellent position to complete the proposed studies. This proposal will determine how light quality
impacts oocyte quality and IVF success (Aim 1), the relationships between circulating TE and ovarian responses
in the context of circadian and photic adaptations (Aim 2) and how hypothalamic-pituitary pathways guiding
reproduction adapt to light quality (Aim 3). I hypothesize that light quality produces adaptations in hypothalamic
circuits guiding female fertility, altering TE distribution, in turn modulating ovarian function and IVF success.
These studies will establish a novel diurnal rodent model to provide key insights into the neuroendocrine
mechanisms by which light qualities modulate female fertility. The training from this proposal, with guidance from
my Co-Sponsors and mentoring committee, will prepare me for the transition to a successful career as an
independent academic researcher investigating the role of light and TE in reproductive success."

We identified an association between lipoic acid and neural epidermal growth-factor like 1 (NELL1)
membranous nephropathy (MN), an autoimmune kidney disease that causes urine protein loss (proteinuria),
diffuse body swelling, and blood clots. If the condition is not detected early, NELL1 MN can lead to kidney
failure. Lipoic acid is a widely available dietary supplement used for general wellness and a range of medical
conditions including neuropathy and chronic pain. We have observed that 1/3 of NELL1 patients, mostly
women (76%) with underlying autoimmunity (36%), report lipoic acid use. The long-term goal of our research is
to investigate how lipoic acid promotes pathogenic autoimmune dysregulation so that we can detect early-
stage disease in susceptible lipoic acid users, and deploy targeted treatment in those with NELL1 MN.
Research suggests that approximately 70% of NELL1 MN patients have detectable anti-NELL1 antibodies in
the blood, however we have an incomplete understanding about whether NELL1 antibodies can herald future
disease. Furthermore, it is unclear how lipoic acid induces NELL1 antibody and the role of T cells in disease
induction. Emerging data on T cell responses suggests a critical role for dysregulated CD4+ T regulatory cells
and TH17 cells in another form of membranous nephropathy, and whether this dysregulated T cell signature is
present in lipoic acid associated NELL1 MN is unknown. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we first
completed a study that demonstrates the feasibility of recruiting lipoic acid users, detecting circulating NELL1
antibody through Western blot, and examining peripheral T cell phenotype and function through flow cytometry.
The feasibility study informs the design of this K23 career development award that will test the central
hypothesis that circulating NELL1 antibodies and proinflammatory T cells predict proteinuria in susceptible
lipoic acid users. We will test this hypothesis through two aims, 1) to determine whether NELL1 antibodies
associate with proteinuria in lipoic acid users, and 2) to determine the phenotype and function of T cells in
lipoic acid users who develop proteinuria. We will do this through an observational and longitudinal study
where we will recruit 150 lipoic acid users at risk for NELL1 MN and measure circulating NELL1 antibodies
through Western Blot, and collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine T cell phenotype and function
through flow cytometry, at pre-specified intervals over 2 years. This research has the potential to establish
NELL1 antibody as a useful disease biomarker and demonstrate the role of T cells in disease induction,
thereby unmasking possible treatment targets. The mentorship team of clinical and translational researchers
with expertise in autoimmunity, lipoic acid, MN, and basic mechanisms of disease will support my training in
autoimmunity, rare disease research, and leadership in science. This, combined with the ample resources at
my institution for K awardees, will support my transition to research independence."
10985814,"1 Research: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as alectinib have transformed survival outcomes for patients
 2 newly diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For
 3 most patients, initial TKI therapy results in tumor response but with variable levels of disease shrinkage and
 4 control. Extrinsic factors for this variability, such as the immune system, have not been well studied as these
 5 tumors are considered immunologically “cold.” However, our data suggests immune cells within the tumor
 6 microenvironment (TME) shape the extent of TKI response. Patients with ALK+ NSCLC experience faster
 7 disease progression on TKI with increasing numbers of neutrophils in pre-treatment biopsies. Further, their
 8 overall survival is significantly shorter on TKI when cancer cells have increased transcriptional activity of
 9 CXCL5 and CXCL8, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils. We believe neutrophils within the ALK+ NSCLC
10 TME impair tumor reactive CD8+ T cells. Murine models of ALK+ NSCLC require CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+
11 T cells, for a sustained alectinib response and tumor clearance. Analogous to the patients, the ALK+ NSCLC
12 murine model that upregulates potent chemoattractants for neutrophils, contains 1) increased Ly6G+
13 neutrophils and 2) fewer activated CD8+ T cells in the TME, and 3) reduced responsiveness to alectinib. Our
14 central hypothesis is that the recruitment of neutrophils by tumor mediated cytokines decreases alectinib
15 responsiveness by impairing anti-tumor T cells. In this proposal, using orthotopic mouse models of ALK+
16 NSCLC, we will determine how neutrophils modulate the TME and CD8+ T cell responses in ALK+ NSCLC.
17 Candidate: Dr. Erin Schenk's career goal is to become a leading laboratory-based physician scientist
18 identifying critical TME immune cells that drive treatment response in ALK+ NSCLC. She will apply innovative
19 technologies and model systems to generate scientific rationale for clinical trials testing novel immunotherapies
20 in patients with NSCLC. To reach this goal, Dr. Schenk will master CRISPR to modify the immune TME
21 content in mouse models of ALK+ NSCLC, test for TKI response, and apply unbiased approaches to explore
22 the TME with scRNAseq, full spectral flow cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics. In parallel, she will acquire
23 the skill sets necessary for clinical trial development and implementation.
24 Environment: The University of Colorado is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Colorado and has an
25 international reputation in clinical and translational work in ALK+ NSCLC. Dr. Schenk has ready access to
26 multiple shared resources (cores) across the cancer center, on line and in person graduate level didactic
27 courses, institutional support from the Thoracic Oncology Program and the Division of Medical Oncology. She
28 has assembled a panel of accomplished mentors including TME expert Dr. Raphael Nemenoff, tumor
29 immunologists Drs. Eduardo Davila and Jill Slansky, neutrophil expert Dr. Sean Colgan, and international
30 ALK+ NSCLC expert and clinical trialist Dr. Ross Camidge.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a complex congenital anomaly where an early embryologic insult
disrupts diaphragmatic and pulmonary development, often resulting in severe, acute cardiopulmonary
dysfunction post-natally and affects 2-4 per 10,000 births in the US, amounting to approximately 1500 children
every year with an annual societal cost approaching $400 million. The CDH Study Group (CDHSG), established
in 1995, is a consortium of institutions dedicated to improving the lives of families/patients affected by CDH
through collaboration, data collation, investigation, and dissemination. Previous trials in CDH suffered limitations
common to many uncommon disease investigative efforts including limited enrollment, prolonged trial conduct,
inflated resource utilization, and suboptimal power, all for unconvincing evidence. The overarching goal of this
multi-institutional initiative is to leverage the strength of collaboration, experienced clinical investigator
leadership, and innovative trial design/analysis to address clinical questions in CDH. An important example is
the use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) in the postnatal stabilization phase of clinical care in CDH. Despite mounting
evidence concluding that, among patients with CDH, iNO is ineffective (and potentially harmful) and costly, most
clinicians maintain equipoise over its effectiveness, and use remains near universal. Our investigative approach,
a pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation trial, with a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized design, within the
construct of an established registry, will address the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iNO in CDH. Nineteen
participating centers will de-implement iNO - randomized at the center level. We will include 900 total neonates
with CDH. Our first specific aim is to determine if de-implementation of iNO in the post-natal resuscitation /
stabilization phase affects the composite outcome of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) use and/or mortality
(composite primary outcome), as well as ECLS use, mortality, and/or oxygenation in CDH (secondary outcomes).
Our second specific aim is to establish the cost-effectiveness of de-implementing iNO as a therapy in the post-
natal resuscitation / stabilization phase of CDH management, which will be assessed as the incremental health
system costs (savings) per prevented ECLS use and/or death. Our third specific aim is to evaluate factors that
influence iNO de-implementation at the individual physician and site level to inform strategies to improve de-
implementation throughout the trial. We believe this initiative, including an innovative design and collaborative
approach, will serve as a foundation for ongoing trials in CDH and will serve as pivotal example for advancing
the adoption of cost-effective, evidence-based strategies in neonatal and pediatric care."

positions of Investigator and Assistant Professor at The Lundquist Institute (TLI) and the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA), respectively. Over the past seven years at TLI, Dr. Singh has exhibited
remarkable productivity, published over 20 research articles, and has ascended from a postdoctoral
trainee to a faculty rank. This application outlines a project leveraging his existing expertise to fill gaps in his
training in the fungal field, with the ultimate goal of achieving full independence.
Mentors/Environment: Dr. Singh will be guided by a diverse team of accomplished scientists with
expertise in Fungal pathogenesis, immunology, vaccine development, animal modeling, and mRNA vaccine
technology. This team is well-positioned to provide hands-on experience and support, Dr. Singh, in
achieving the outlined training goals: 1) filling gaps in research expertise, 2) developing professional and

Research: C. auris is a recently discovered Candida species that causes life-threatening bloodstream
infections (BSI) in immunosuppressed patients and has a very high (~60%) mortality rate. C. auris easily
colonizes and spreads in healthcare settings and adheres and forms biofilms on medical devices. The majority
(~88%) of C. auris BSI cases can be attributed to the involvement of catheters and other invasive medical
devices. C. auris infections are hard to treat because C. auris can resist all classes of clinically available
antifungal drugs. Due to these reasons, the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Prevention and
Control (CDC) have categorized C. auris as a “Critical threat” and “Urgent Threat” pathogen, respectively. To
address this urgent public health challenge, we have identified three Hyr1/Iff family (CAU-HIL) proteins that
demonstrate universal presence across all clades of C. auris. Using a monoclonal antibody targeted against
an epitope in the C. albicans Hyr1 protein, conserved in CAU-HIL, we have ascertained these proteins as
potential therapeutic targets. However, CAU-HIL proteins exhibit only ~35% sequence identity with
characterized proteins in other Candida species, and their specific role in C. auris virulence remains
uncharacterized. We hypothesize that these CAU-HIL proteins would be superior vaccine candidates
against C. auris infection compared to C. albicans antigens, simply because of their C. auris origin.
Therefore, we propose to: 1. study the role of HIL proteins in C. auris virulence, 2. Study their potential as a
vaccine against C. auris using an innovative mRNA platform and clinically relevant animal models."

Persons with end-stage kidney disease are 16 times more likely to undergo surgery and have significantly
increased perioperative risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared to surgical patients with
normal or near normal kidney function. Despite this elevated surgical volume and risk profile, little is known
about how to best perform preoperative hemodialysis when these patients undergo surgical procedures. The
goal of this project is to improve perioperative health for this high-risk surgical population through optimizing
preoperative hemodialysis treatment. In Aims 1 and 2, we will evaluate the link between modifiable
preoperative dialysis parameters and postoperative complications underlying adverse outcomes. In Aim 3, we
will conduct a pilot randomized trial of a novel intervention to control preoperative hemodialysis timing.
Accomplishing these goals will help clinicians and policy makers identify optimal dialysis practices for patients
with end-stage kidney disease who need surgery. It will also lay the groundwork for future prospective
randomized clinical trials of interventions to reduce perioperative mortality and morbidity for these patients. It is
innovative in its use of a unique database linking Medicare claims to electronic health records of a major
dialysis provider, application of sophisticated statistical methods, and the creation of a multidisciplinary team
with clinicians and researchers from multiple disciplines. In addition to the research objectives outlined above,
this K23 proposal aims to provide Dr. Vikram Fielding-Singh, MD, JD, with the protected time, training, and
research experience to enable him to become an independent clinical investigator focused on perioperative
optimization of persons with end-stage kidney disease. Specifically, the proposal will aid Dr. Fielding-Singh’s
development through providing support for completion of a Master of Science in Epidemiology and Clinical

services researchers. With this training and experience, the candidate will be uniquely positioned to seek
further funding to evaluate additional approaches to improve the perioperative health of patients with end-stage

10988114,"Abstract
 The inclusion of music therapy into a total treatment modality can be used to improve the cognitive, physical,
emotional, and social outcomes of patients diagnosed with neurological aging disorders, such as Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD). Moreover, the healing benefits of music therapy and music-based interventions may be optimized
when the patient is actively engaged in the process of creating music (composing, singing, moving), as opposed
to sole reliance on receptive or passive music listening. The process of creating music has been shown to
enhance neuroplasticity, reduce pain, and promote mental wellness. AD, in particular, as a neurodegenerative
disease characterized by adverse neuropathological changes that impair neural connectivity and the brain’s
natural ability to repair itself, is a prime candidate for the therapeutic neurological benefits that arise from creating
music. Unfortunately, however, those who stand to gain the most from creating music often find the challenging
process of relearning, learning, and/or manipulating a musical instrument to be impractical.
 Outlier Technology (Outlier) seeks to address this issue by developing a novel, Neurologic Music Therapy
(NMT)-based software platform to help modernize the rehabilitation and habilitation of function & well-being
among people suffering from AD. This next-generation approach to NMT will offer the medical community an
innovative new way to enhance neuroplasticity and mitigate cognitive decline. The hallmark of this platform is a
proprietary algorithm which utilizes computer vision as an input modality to translate body movements into an
interactive, aesthetically pleasing musical experience integrated with a data-driven curriculum of NMT-based
puzzles and games designed in collaboration with Board-Certified Music Therapists (MT-BCs) to target
therapeutic objectives. This platform can be utilized by therapists to augment their traditional treatment regimens
or by patients who do not have regular access to therapy resources but seek the potential benefits of such use.
 This proposal describes the development of a gesture-powered “smart instrument” that combines an
interactive, adaptive, and therapeutic music creation experience with structured data analytics. Musical data from
studio musicians will be sampled, analyzed, and mapped onto an aesthetically refined decision matrix that
produces pleasing, software-generated music that may be customized to the user’s personal tastes. Computer
vision will be used to map physical movements onto sensible musical outcomes to develop a “smart instrument”
with intuitive, motion-powered haptic feedback. A curriculum of NMT-based games and puzzles that utilize this
instrument will be developed with neuroscientists and MT-BCs to stimulate neuroplasticity and prolong functional
independence. We will also integrate a data portal which allows the practitioner to record real-time patient events
and notes about session progress, and access organized displays of data from each session which identify
musical characteristics with strong associations to positive patient outcomes. The proposed development will
yield a prototype demonstrating proof-of-concept for a groundbreaking new approach to AD rehabilitation."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in Black men and women,
with mortality rates that are 44% and 31% higher in Black men and women compared to White
men and women respectively. Approximately 40% of the difference in incidence and 20% of the
difference in mortality are due to disparities in screening. Community health centers (CHCs) in
urban areas serve a large share of racial and ethnic minorities and have lower screening rates
(41.9%) compared to the general population (69.7%). Low screening rates, and rising incidence
and mortality from CRC in adults at younger ages also suggests that focusing on increasing
screening uptake from 45 to 54 is a critical target. This career development award leverages an
existing partnership with Codman Square Health Center, a predominantly Black CHC in inner-
city Boston, to develop implementation strategies with a focus on equity to initiate CRC
screening in previously unscreened individuals age 45 to 54 at CSHC. Dr. Adjoa Anyane-
Yeboa’s long-term career goal is to use equity-driven implementation science methods to
reduce CRC inequities among historically marginalized populations. The proposed project
blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda to facilitate Dr.
Anyane-Yeboa’s development into an independent investigator through three training goals: (1)
enhance quantitative and qualitative research skills, (2) design and conduct mixed methods
research to inform implementation of evidence-based interventions, and (3) learn equity-driven
implementation science methods. This proposal has three scientific aims: (1) identify system-
level determinants of CRC screening in individuals 45 to 54 using mixed methods; (2) identify
equity-driven implementation strategies to initiate CRC screening matched to systems-level
determinants; and (3) determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementation strategies for
CRC screening by conducting a pilot trial and using mixed methods. In addition to advanced
training through formal coursework, this award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship
team, including internationally-recognized experts in CRC prevention, implementation science,
health equity, community-engaged research, and mixed methods. Upon completion of the
proposed research and training, Dr. Anyane-Yeboa will expand her findings in an R01 to
rigorously test her findings in a trial across CHCs in Massachusetts. The combination of formal
training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr.
Anyane-Yeboa will emerge from this award as a nationally recognized independent investigator
with the skills and experience to reduce CRC inequities in marginalized patient populations."

By 2050, over 75% of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) cases are projected to occur in low-
and middle-income countries, such as South Africa. Government cash transfer programs as a form of social
protection may increase individual and household income, with implications for ADRD risk. In the original project
period of R01AG069128, we linked data from a cohort study of aging (HAALSI) and a randomized cash transfer
trial (HPTN 068) to their shared sampling frame, a longitudinal regional census (AHDSS) in rural South Africa.
We identified a protective causal effect of a randomized controlled cash transfer on later-life memory decline,
dementia probability, and mortality risk, and causal relationships between expansions of two South African
government cash transfer programs and the later-life cognitive health of their targeted recipients. Now, there is
a critical need to determine how to optimize cash transfer program design to most effectively leverage cash
transfer income to protect against ADRD. South Africa is an ideal setting for this research given its robust and
expanding government portfolio of cash transfer programs. Our overarching goal for the proposed renewal of
R01AG069128 is to expand our successful data linkage platform to identify the optimal amounts, durations,
target recipients, and adult life course periods whereby cash transfer income may protect against later-life ADRD.
Our central hypothesis is that greater accumulation of individual-level and household-level cash transfers across
the adult life course will result in slower memory decline, lower incidence of ADRD, and greater cognitive reserve,
and will also lead to investments in cognitively stimulating household resources. To test this hypothesis, we will
newly map historical eligibility for multiple sources of cash transfer income for all HAALSI participants and their
household members over a 23-year exposure period (1993-2014/15) and link these eligibility histories to new
follow-up data on memory decline and ADRD in HAALSI over 13 years (2014/15-2027). In addition, we will add
cognitive reserve as a new study outcome, operationalized from neuroimaging and neuropsychological data in
the HAALSI Dementia Study (n=700; 2024/25). We aim to 1) determine the role of access to cash transfers
accumulated across the adult life course at the individual- and household-levels in slowing later-life memory
decline, reducing ADRD risk, and promoting cognitive reserve; 2) determine the relative importance of adult life
course timing and trajectories of household access to cash transfers for memory decline, ADRD risk, and
cognitive reserve; and, 3) compare later-life asset ownership and expenditures on cognitively stimulating
resources across households according to their accumulated access to cash transfers. Over 130 countries use
cash transfers as a form of social protection, including the United States, and more are considering or piloting
cash transfer programs. The ADRD impacts of these programs are unknown, and actionable evidence is needed
for them to optimally support the health and longevity of the rapidly aging populations that they serve."
10985268,"Several dementia care management models have been developed to comprehensively meet the
needs of the growing number of Americans living with dementia and their caregivers. In 2018,
the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Institute on Aging funded the
Dementia Care Study (D-CARE), a 4-site pragmatic, comparative effectiveness randomized
clinical trial to compare clinical outcomes of a health system-based dementia care program
(HSDC), a community-based dementia care program (CBDC), and usual care. Final data
collection was completed for 2,176 D-CARE participants (persons living with dementia and their
family or friend caregivers) on August 21, 2023.
The proposed study seeks to leverage data collected in D-CARE to examine end-of-life care for
persons living with dementia (PLWD)—outcomes not included in the original trial. Little is known
about the effect of dementia care management on end-of-life care among community-dwelling
persons with dementia. This study aims to compare by intervention arm (HSDC vs. CBDC): 1)
documentation and content of PLWD advance care preferences (e.g., resuscitation, intubation,
artificial nutrition preferences); 2) overall end-of-life care quality in the last 30 days of life,
including symptom management, communication about treatment decisions, and receipt of care
aligned with PLWD’s goals; and 3) health care use in the last 6 months of life, specifically
hospice use, ED visits and hospitalizations, and total cost of care. This study will also consider
the effect of intervention group on location of death, time spent at home in the last 6 months of
life, and potentially burdensome care interventions or care transitions in the last 90 days of life.
The large number of decedents in the D-CARE trial (N=524, 24% of enrolled) provides a unique
opportunity to study how community-dwelling PLWD die and compare end-of-life outcomes
between the two dementia care management interventions. Completion of these new aims will
provide greater insight into how best to care for PLWD near the end of life, including information
about end-of-life care preferences, met or unmet care needs near death, and healthcare
utilization in the last 6 months of life."

a natural policy experiment to determine the program’s impact on health-related social needs, health, and
health care use and spending. In 2017, MassHealth received a 1115 demonstration waiver that included
funding for the Flexible Services program (Flex) to address enrollees’ food and housing insecurity. The Flex
pilot was implemented between March 2020 and March 2023, and the LiveWell study (R01 DK124145,
Thorndike) has been assessing Flex outcomes within a large accountable care organization (ACO). Although
LiveWell data will not be complete until 2024, early implementation evaluation findings suggest that contextual
and implementation factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may have hindered program implementation.
Nevertheless, preliminary survey data and qualitative interviews with study participants indicate that many of
those who received Flex services experienced improvements in food security, stress, diet, and health. A
renewed 1115 waiver will extend Flex through 2027, providing a timely opportunity to assess Flex after the 3-
year ramp-up pilot and beyond the acute phase of the pandemic. In the waiver extension, Flex nutrition
services are limited to 6 months per enrollee (vs. up to 24 months in the pilot), allowing for standardized
assessment of immediate and sustained program effects. The current project builds upon the research team’s
experience in the LiveWell study to answer critical questions about the impact of Flex as it moves beyond the
pilot phase in the 1115 waiver extension. First, we will leverage a target trial emulation framework using
electronic health record and claims data from the Mass General Brigham ACO to examine the impact of Flex
on acute health care utilization and medical spending among all ACO members and on medication adherence
and health outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (Aim 1). Second, we will prospectively
enroll 500 Flex enrollees and 500 matched non-Flex ACO members to examine the longitudinal impact of Flex
nutrition services on food security, diet, and psychological outcomes before, during, and after Flex (Aim 2).
Finally, we will continue our rigorous mixed methods implementation evaluation using the RE-AIM/PRISM
framework, expanding to examine maintenance of Flex as it becomes more established in the waiver extension
(Aim 3). Our rigorous evaluation of this natural experiment will provide essential data to guide other states and
health systems and inform national policy decisions. The research team’s deep knowledge and expertise about
Flex, ACOs, and health systems data will ensure efficient and successful execution of the study aims."

The US-Mexico migration corridor is one of the busiest in the modern era. In the United States, over 15 million
adults ages 50+ are foreign-born, most of Mexican origin. As immigration becomes more common, we urgently
need better evidence on its health effects, social contexts that may remediate or exacerbate the health risks of
immigrants, and biological mechanisms of these effects. Relatively little is known about the determinants of their
risk for Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD) among Mexican Americans. In addition to
socioeconomic disadvantage, Mexican Americans may be exposed to unique migration-related stressors and
discriminatory experiences (e.g., exposure to anti-immigration sentiments). Embodiment of migration-related
stressors may manifest through accelerated biological aging or increased inflammation which, in turn, may
elevate ADRD risk. Quantifying ADRD risk in Mexican Americans is not straightforward, however, due to the
methodological challenge of disentangling the effect of migration from the selection factors that predict migration
itself and ADRD. If unaccounted for, predictors of healthy in-migration and unhealthy out-migration (often offered
as reasons for the Latino paradox) may mask true health disadvantages due to immigration. Additionally,
research on the social epidemiology of migrant health, ADRD in particular, has underexamined complex concepts
such as the socio-political climate surrounding migration and its biosocial embodiment. Addressing these gaps
in the field and our knowledge demands methodological innovation and assessment of multilevel drivers of
migration and risk of ADRD, from policy to biology. Further, most data sources cannot disentangle
selection/confounding from causation because they include only migrants (i.e., they enroll US residents and
compare migrants to U.S.-born individuals). Often, the outcomes of those born in the communities of origin who
do not migrate are never represented. In this proposal, we will leverage our team’s previous infrastructural work
(under RF1AG055486) that built a binational dataset pooled across the US (from the Health and Retirement
Study or HRS) and Mexico (from the Mexican Health and Aging Study or MHAS) that spans the life course
(beginning from birth until age at migration or study entry). This dataset has built-in longitudinal propensity scores
(weights) capturing pre- and post-migration characteristics, which is a crucial step for correcting bias due to
selective migration, a major barrier to the effective study of migrant health. Using this unique dataset and
innovative life course models, we propose to (Aim 1) estimate the effect of migration, residence in the US, and
acculturation on cognitive function and dementia risk, (Aim 2) evaluate how different immigration policy climates
and social contexts modify the effects of migration, and (Aim 3) assess embodiment through biosocial pathways.
We will use the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) which will allow major improvements on
what was previously possible in this binational cohort. The study will provide novel insights into the multilevel
drivers and underlying mechanisms of migration’s effects on ADRD."

The -omics era has made it possible to identify several molecular markers involved in predicting survival and
response to therapies. We currently lack an easy way to obtain high content molecular information while
providing high resolution spatial profiling across a patient’s tissue. This proposal aims to provide physicians with
an entirely new multiplexed molecular imaging technology that has the potential to offer both high content
molecular expression and spatial profiling in a single histology image. Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs) is an optical imaging technique that can offer
unsurpassed sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities to the field of histology imaging with the potential to provide
rich molecular details on the microscopic level. Clinicians will be able to utilize the imaging strategy on the
same tissue sections prepared for histology. Incorporating it into the pathology workflow could enable
physicians to better understand the patient’s molecular profile and stratify patients to receive the most effective
therapeutic regimen possible. This unique histology imaging strategy also has the potential to identify new
molecular trends in patient’s tissue samples that could be used to predict how aggressive their disease is or
how well the patient is likely to respond to given therapies. This innovative ex-vivo diagnostic strategy has a high
likelihood for clinical translation, offering rapid whole tissue section imaging for multiple molecular biomarkers
simultaneously. Our approach begins by developing a new set of sensitive SERS NP batches, each designed with
a unique spectral barcode to enable simultaneous molecular interrogation of an entire tissue sample within a single
image. After fabrication and characterization of our newly developed multiplexed SERS NPs, we will test their
multiplexed imaging capabilities and targeting efficiency on various biomarkers in cell culture and on de-
identified human tissue sections. We will first test our new multiplexed imaging technology to target immune
cells. Recently, studies have shown that the immune system plays a key role in cancer development, and thus
the density, location, and type of immune cells found across a patient’s tumor can predict therapeutic
response. Failure to fully understand the immune profile and tumor heterogeneity across a patient’s tumor can
lead to administration of ineffective therapies that increase patient morbidity. Our NPs will actively target multiple
immune receptors through chemically conjugated antibodies. We will assess the targeting efficiency of our newly
developed NPs with microscopic Raman imaging tools and compare with gold standard immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining. These results will be an important step in the clinical translation of this new multiplexed Raman
imaging approach; to provide rapid spatial molecular profiling while enabling improved personalized therapy. It’s
important to note that we are not limited to interrogating cancer and intend to investigate other relevant clinical
applications (ie. wound healing, neurological diseases, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases) that could
benefit from a new multiplexed imaging strategy that offers improved sensitivity and molecular specificity."

Natural products are indisputably the most productive source of chemical matter for antibiotic development.
Unfortunately, the pharmacological deployment of new natural products has been outpaced by the waning utility
of approved antibiotics, especially those active against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, Genomic
technologies and synthetic biology are uniquely positioned to address this shortfall, and towards that critical goal,
the previous project period developed a fully 6utomated, §,calable, and high-Ihroughput (FAST) pipeline for the
discovery of Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs), RiPPs are a class of
natural product covering nearly 50 known structural families. Despite their impressive structural and functional
diversity, RiPPs are united by a common biosynthetic strategy. A gene-encoded precursor peptide is comprised
of an N-terminal leader region, providing a binding site for the modification enzymes, and a C-terminal core
region, which receives all of the post-translational modifications.
This renewal project builds on our previous success in unlocking the potential of RiPPs as a source of new
antibacterials. For this project, we propose three interrelated but independently achievable specific aims. Aim 1
addresses pitfalls of the FAST-RiPPs procedure uncovered during the previous project period. Here, we will
enhance our ability to achieve high titers of any desired RiPP structural class. Among others, solutions to the
challenge of obtaining mature products involving radical S-adenosylmethionine-dependent enzymes are
proposed. Aim 2 develops the ways and means to prioritize RiPPs with a high probability of displaying
antibacterial activity. Lastly, Aim 3 addresses the grand challenge of predicting ring patterns directly from primary
sequence for multicyclic RiPPs. With several RiPP classes associated with multimacrocyclic scaffolds and often
encoding numerous macrocycle donor and acceptor residues in the core region, determining the structural
outcome of the enzymatic pathways has been impossible. However, with advances in bioinformatics, artificial
intelligence (Al), and new ring patterns discovered as a consequence of a functional FAST-RiPPs pipeline, a
solution to this problem becomes feasible. Given their proven success rates from the previous project period,
including the discovery of a potent anti-Klebsiella compound, lanthipeptides serve as our testbed for Al
algorithmic development.
This project blends cutting-edge Al, synthetic biology, biofoundry, and analytical chemistry techniques with
innovative solutions to heterologous expression deficiencies. We further will engineer broad host range plasmid
compatibility to overcome the need to reclone pathways when a heterologous host is deemed insufficient.
Success on this project will have a profound impact on the synthetic biology community and pharmaceutical
industry."
10980212,"Project Summary/Abstract
The extraordinarily rapid aging of the developing world represents one of the most significant demographic
transformations in history, with profound consequences for disease and disability, intergenerational relations,
work and retirement, geographic mobility, and other economic and demographic processes. The United Nations
projects that the population aged 60 and older will grow by over 50% over the next 15 years. Most of the growth
of the older population will take place in the Global South, which will include 80% of the older population by 2050.
The growth of the older population in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia is occurring far more rapidly than it
did in the developed countries of Europe and North America. Despite its manifest significance, population aging
in the Global South is understudied, partly because of a dearth of suitable data. To grapple with processes of
population aging across the Global South over multiple decades, researchers must have access to big microdata.
Over the past two decades, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) has created a vast database
of census and survey microdata covering most of the globe from the 1960s to the present. These data include
detailed information about each person's geographic location, demographic characteristics, and economic
activities. The data also cover education and literacy, fertility history, migration and place of former residence,
marital status and consensual unions, disabilities, water supply, sewage, housing features (e.g., floor and roof
material), and a host of other characteristics. This competing continuation proposal requests funding to expand
and adapt the world’s most comprehensive collection of census microdata to meet the needs of research on
aging in the Global South. We have four specific aims: (1) Data acquisition and long-run preservation. We will
obtain and preserve census and survey microdata from the Global South, including the newest microdata from
household surveys and older data at risk of destruction. (2) Data processing. We plan to expand the IPUMS
database by adding data for approximately 100 million individuals included in 40 censuses and surveys, focusing
on recent data from Africa and Latin America. This expansion will require data cleaning, development of
comprehensive machine-processable metadata, spatial data ingest and harmonization, and variable
harmonization. (3) Innovations in data, metadata, and technical infrastructure. We will make major improvements
to IPUMS data and metadata while adding new capabilities to IPUMS data processing and dissemination
systems. (4) Dissemination and outreach. We will provide user support, training, and outreach and will develop
new online training capabilities. We will harness the expertise of the user community and promote collaboration
and scientific discovery through surveys of users, workshops, and online interaction. Most critically, we will
maintain our network of collaboration with the national statistical agencies that provide the source data."
10980283,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial (ER-Mito) microdomains play significant roles in the maintenance of
bioenergetics and basal cell functions via the exchange of lipids, Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genetic
inhibition of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), one of the key components of ER-Mito tethering, in cardiomyocytes (CMs) revealed
the importance of the microdomains between mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a differentiated form
of ER in muscle cells, for maintaining normal mitochondrial Ca2+ (mtCa2+) handling and bioenergetics in the heart.
However, it is still unclear which cellular signaling mechanism modulates Ca2+ handling at the ER/SR-Mito
microdomains in the heart during cardiac stress, and how this alters mtCa2+ and mitochondrial ROS (mROS) levels
in cardiac pathology. Our preliminary studies show that 1) Mfn2 is likely a c-Src substrate in mitochondria; 2) c-Src
can phosphorylate the C-terminal tail of Mfn2 at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), a domain critical for
Mfn2 dimerization and redox sensing; and 3) c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (P-Tyr) of Mfn2 decreases
the ER-Mito distance and facilitates ER-to-Mito Ca2+ transfer, followed by increases in mROS. Importantly, using a
preclinical rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, fibrosis, and
failure, we found significant c-Src activation occurs only in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) but not in CMs in the RV under
PAH, which subsequently causes a c-Src-dependent P-Tyr of Mfn2, decreased ER-Mito distance, increased mtCa2+
uptake and mROS, CF activation, and RV fibrosis. Similar preliminary results were obtained in RV tissue samples
from a pulmonary hypertension patient. Lastly, we found that mtCa2+ uptake via mtCa2+ uniporter (MCU) is required
for mROS elevation and subsequent activation of proliferative signaling in CFs. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that 1) c-Src-dependent P-Tyr of Mfn2 alters the ER-Mito tethering structure and causes increases in
mtCa2+ and mROS that promote CF activation, thereby acting as a molecular “switch” for the activation of RV-CFs in
PAH; and 2) CF-specific inhibition of c-Src at the OMM in vivo can be leveraged as a novel therapeutic strategy to
attenuate cardiac fibrosis in response to stress/injury such as PAH. The long-term goals of our study are to precisely
understand 1) the molecular basis of ER-Mito microdomain-mediated regulation of CF functions under pathological
conditions including PAH; and 2) develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting cardiac fibrosis-specific molecular
mechanisms.
In Aim 1, we
will establish Mfn2 as a novel c-Src substrate in mitochondria and assess the impact of
c-Src-dependent P-Tyr of Mfn2 on ER-mitochondria tethering, Ca2+ transport to mitochondria, mROS generation,
and downstream CF signaling activation using cellular systems. In Aim 2, we will specifically inhibit mitochondrial c-
Src only in the quiescent CFs by CF-specifically expressing OMM-targeted dominant-negative c-Src (mt-c-Src-DN)
in a preclinical rat PAH to evaluate the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial c-Src inhibition in vivo. The expected
outcomes of this project will provide fundamental new insights into the molecular interaction between ER-Mito
association, mtCa2+ uptake, and mROS and its functional relevance in CF activation and fibrosis."

This study will develop a process to return Alzheimer Disease (AD) biomarker research results and will
evaluate whether the results can be sent directly to participants in a safe and understandable way. The brain
changes associated with AD begin decades before symptom onset during a stage called preclinical AD. Until
recently, obtaining a diagnosis of preclinical AD was based on invasive biomarker tests (PET scans and
lumbar punctures) only available at specialty research centers and not recommended for clinical use due to the
lack of actionability and ethical concerns about the harms of disclosure. This landscape has dramatically
changed with two new developments: a blood-based biomarker test is now available that can identify
preclinical AD, and the first drug treatment directly targeting AD brain pathology received FDA approval in July
2023 for those with AD brain pathology and very mild symptoms. Medications targeting AD brain pathology are
now being tested in individuals with preclinical AD because data suggest this is when they are most effective,
signaling a future where asymptomatic individuals undergo AD biomarker testing prior to obtaining treatment,
dramatically increasing the number of individuals who would be clinically tested and treated. Further, new
regulatory requirements of the 21st Century Cures Act require immediate electronic release of clinical results,
bypassing traditional clinician-mediated disclosure of AD biomarker results.
Despite a current lack of clinical actionability for returning results related to preclinical AD, a recent participant
Bill of Rights advocates returning AD biomarker research results to respect autonomy and because research
results have personal value. Studies suggest that disclosure of AD biomarker results has no major
psychosocial harms but have been limited to highly selected research participants in controlled research
settings with in-person disclosure by specialized clinicians. This leaves significant gaps in knowledge and a
lack of generalizability – a challenge for AD research more broadly that must be rectified.
In a large, community-dwelling cohort of cognitively normal older adults, this study will develop a culturally-
appropriate process for return of AD biomarker research results (Aim 1) and will evaluate whether the results
can be sent directly to participants in a safe and understandable way using a randomized non-inferiority trial
(Aim 2) with a sequential explanatory qualitative evaluation of experiences (Aim 3). This project responds to
the rapidly evolving landscape where a readily available AD diagnostic blood test followed by a treatment is
becoming a reality. The data produced will inform whether sending AD biomarker results directly to older adults
can effectively communicate the results in a safe way, which will be necessary for widespread AD diagnostic
testing."
10983287,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common mental health diagnoses
among Veterans. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure therapy (PE) were widely
disseminated in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as recommended PTSD treatments. Despite these
efforts, few post-9/11 Veterans diagnosed with PTSD initiate CPT or PE. In the small percentage of Veterans
who receive these therapies, CPT and PE are rarely the first treatment a Veteran receives. A common
treatment sequence identified in implementation research, begins with “stabilization treatment,” combinations
of psychosocial and medication treatments that prepare Veterans for CPT or PE. A gap in existing research is
how treatment sequences, particularly stabilization treatment, influence initiation of CPT or PE.
Significance/Impact: PTSD is an HSR&D priority condition due to its substantial negative biopsychosocial
impact on Veterans lives. Novel strategies are needed to increase engagement, retention, and improve
outcomes from recommended PTSD treatments, and to reduce disparities in access to this care.
Understanding how to most effectively combine and sequence PTSD treatment is an HSR&D identified area of
interest, and a research gap identified in the VHA PTSD clinical practice guideline.
Innovation: Despite consistently identifying stabilization treatment as a common VHA practice, little research
has investigated this treatment sequence. A novel approach to solving existing limitations in PTSD treatment
delivery involves developing an intervention that both acknowledges the ubiquitous presence and benefits of
stabilization treatment, while facilitating timely transition from stabilization treatment to CPT or PE.
Specific Aims: This CDA-2 aims to improve delivery of PTSD services in the VHA, while simultaneously
providing me with training in health services research methods to support my development into an independent
VHA researcher. The proposed research aims are: (1) To qualitatively understand Veterans’ and clinicians’
perspectives on selecting stabilization treatments and how stabilization treatment serves as a barrier or
facilitator of transition to CPT or PE; (2) To develop and conduct a randomized, pragmatic pilot trial of a brief,
Veteran-centered intervention to support transition from stabilization treatment to CPT or PE; and (3) To
identify sociodemographic disparities in treatment sequences and to determine how treatment sequences
influence time to CPT or PE initiation across the VHA.
Methodology: I will then conduct qualitative interviews with a national sample of Veterans (n=30) and
clinicians (n=20; Aim 1). Using rapid qualitative analysis procedures, I will evaluate how treatment sequences,
particularly stabilization treatment, are chosen and how they serve as a barrier or facilitator of transition to CPT
and PE. I will then use knowledge gained from Aim 1 to develop a health services intervention that facilitates
timely transition to CPT or PE. I will test this intervention in a randomized, pragmatic, pilot trial comparing the
intervention (n=20) to treatment as usual (n=20; Aim 2). I will assess the proportion of Veterans who initiate
CPT or PE within a year after beginning the intervention as a primary outcome and feasibility as a secondary
outcome. Using electronic health record data from a national, longitudinal cohort of post-9/11 Veterans who
received VHA PTSD treatment (anticipated n=400,000) from 10/05-12/23, I will identify treatment sequences;
understand how treatment sequence impacts time to CPT or PE initiation using Cox proportional hazard
regression; and identify disparities in treatment sequences based on sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 3).
Implementation/Next Steps: I will apply the knowledge and training gained through this proposal to an
HSR&D Merit application to test the benefits of the developed intervention on a large scale through a multisite
hybrid type-II pragmatic trial. I will collaborate with organizational partners at the Office of Mental Health and
Suicide Prevention to ensure that work supports efforts to promote clinical practice guideline-consistent care."
10980441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are at high risk for social disconnection (such as
isolation and loneliness) as their impairments progressively limit critical functions such as speaking and
walking. Despite being critically important to health and quality of life, the social connectedness of
individuals with progressive motor speech impairments has been underappreciated and understudied.
Consequently, patients suffering from social disconnection are vastly underserved, resulting in
underdeveloped best practices for assessing and remediating social isolation and loneliness in ALS.
The overarching objectives of this research are to identify the root causes of social disconnection in
persons with speech-motor deficits due to ALS, and to use this information to develop targeted
strategies to enhance social connectedness and mitigate the isolating impact of these speech
disorders. To achieve these goals, we plan to conduct a longitudinal study involving a cohort of 200
ALS patients over a span of six months. This study will employ an innovative mobile health approach,
leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones and the availability of existing mobile
technologies designed for medical research. Participants will use their own smartphone to acquire
actively (surveys and speech recordings) and passively (GPS) generated data. This remote approach is
uniquely suited to the research questions and to people with ALS, given that it is convenient and
minimally invasive, thereby facilitating frequent data collection and addressing barriers to access.
Furthermore, we employ a novel social network mapping approach, along with self-reported
perceptions of loneliness, to quantify social connectedness. We use these approaches to determine the
effects of ALS severity on social connectedness (Aim 1), and to determine the contribution of declining
speech and mobility function due to ALS to communicative participation, community mobility, and social
connectedness (Aim 2). Additionally, we seek to identify psychosocial risk and protective factors of
communicative participation, community mobility, and social connectedness (Aim 3). The knowledge
gained from these studies is critically needed to (1) help patients, families, and service providers make
informed decisions regarding social and communication management priorities and (2) develop more
targeted assessments and interventions designed to mitigate the negative effects of social
disconnection in persons with progressive neurologic diseases that affect speech."
10980445,"Abstract
Memory retrieval requires optimal functioning for an organism’s survival and varies with the time of day. The
biological clock biases output of brain circuitry to coordinate behaviors across the light/dark cycle. GABAergic
neurons align circuit activity to gate daily rhythms through expression of local circadian-associated clock
genes. Parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic neurons powerfully modify circuits needed for memory retrieval, but the
extent to which PV neurons regulate daily rhythms in retrieval is unknown. This information is important
because desynchrony between the 24 hr light cycle and endogenous circadian rhythms leads to cognitive
deficits in shift workers, those with jet lag, aged individuals, and in those with neurological disorders in which
circadian regulation of the biological clock is impaired. In the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the focus of
these studies, most PV neurons are enwrapped in structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs), which restrict
plasticity in adulthood and are vital for precise firing of PV neurons. We discovered that the expression of
PNNs and PV exhibit a diurnal pattern in the rat mPFC, and propose that this diurnal pattern is a major factor
driving diurnal differences in memory retrieval. Moreover, we propose that the diurnal pattern in PNNs is
coordinated by orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2), which maintains PNNs and exhibits a similar diurnal pattern
as PNNs. OTX2 appears to bind to promoter-proximal regions of the clock genes Clock, Per1, and Per2 and
thus may serve as a major integrator of activity-dependent rhythms that coordinate with these clock proteins.
Consistent with this, we show that PNN removal disrupts the diurnal rhythm of PER1 protein levels in PV
neurons. Together, prior work and our studies show that PNNs influence the core clock, which can potently
influence circuit function during memory retrieval. We hypothesize that PNNs surrounding PV neurons in the
mPFC are a major contributor to diurnal patterns of memory retrieval through regulation of clock genes. Our
studies will define how diurnal fluctuations in PNNs around PV neurons alter circadian genes and PV neuron
function in the mPFC, and whether these diurnal fluctuations underlie diurnal differences in memory retrieval.
Conversely, we will determine how manipulation of the clock gene Bmal1 alters PNNs, PV neuron function,
and memory retrieval. We will use behavior, innovative molecular approaches, and in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiology to address the following three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Determine how PNNs in the mPFC
modulate rhythmicity of PV neuron clock genes, PV neuron function, and memory retrieval.; Aim 2)
Determine whether the core clock in mPFC PV neurons regulates rhythmicity of PNN, PV neuron
function, and memory retrieval; and Aim 3) Define diurnal changes in oscillatory communication
between the mPFC, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus. Understanding how endogenous daily
rhythms in PNNs and their PV interneurons contribute to memory retrieval is expected to facilitate treatment of
cognitive impairments in those with circadian rhythm desynchrony."
10982170,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Finite element analysis has become an indispensable tool for research and discovery in the biomedical sciences.
Historically, the lack of an open software environment that was tailored to the needs of the field hampered
research progress, dissemination of research and sharing of models and results. To address these issues, we
developed the FEBio software suite, a FE framework designed specifically for analysis in biomechanics and
biophysics, during our first funding period (FY 2008-2011). FEBio employs mixture theory to account for the
multi-constituent nature of biological tissues and fluids, unifying the classical fields of irreversible
thermodynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, mass transport, chemical reactions and electrokinetics.
During the second funding period (FY 2012-2015), we implemented chemical reactions between constituents of
a mixture and we broadened the target audience for FEBio by developing a plugin environment that made it easy
to add features or interface other software with FEBio. During our third funding period (FY 2016-2019), we
developed a novel FE framework for simulation of compressible and incompressible CFD, extended this
framework to enable analysis of FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) problems, and we enhanced algorithmic,
analysis and numerical capabilities in FEBio by implementing efficient iterative linear solvers and
preconditioners, new nonlinear solution strategies, and adaptive meshing. During our fourth funding period (FY
2020-2023), we introduced significant advances in the modeling of damage mechanics and fatigue failure in
biological tissues, as well as the modeling of solute transport in fluid mechanics, fluid-structure interactions, and
reactive multiphasic media. We developed a powerful graphical user interface and merged the pre-processing,
finite element analysis, and post-processing packages into a single user environment called FEBio Studio. We
also integrated the use of image data with the simulation pipeline, from model setup to model validation. In the
current application we propose to advance our modeling techniques by (1) developing a modeling framework for
thermomechanics in solids, fluids, and mixtures; (2) incorporating experimental data to constrain finite element
solutions; (3) modeling immersed solid, biphasic, or multiphasic bodies in fluid domains, accounting for FSI and
resolving the fluid shear stress in boundary layers surrounding the body; and (4) facilitating software
development by the user community. These new capabilities will expand the applicability of FEBio to new fields
of biomedical research, increasing our user base and facilitating scientific advancement."

Tumor vascular networks are highly abnormal and complex, vary significantly by tumor type and on a patient-
by-patient basis. More importantly, patient-specific tumor vascular properties are known to regulate cancer
progression and treatment response in patients with primary or metastatic liver cancers. Non-invasive rapid
diagnostic methods to characterize unique tumor vascular properties in liver malignancies, and to provide
clinical decision-support, are currently not available. Our goal is to introduce computational approaches to
characterize complex attributes of vascular networks by considering the interconnected nature of
voxels in 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D DCE-US), and to validate these as biomarkers
for diagnostics or treatment monitoring. We have already contributed to pioneering 3D DCE-US liver
imaging in the clinic and have demonstrated its ability to minimize 2D-based sampling errors and improved
prediction of treatment response longitudinally. However, current quantification approaches are designed for
2D imaging and do not take into account vascular heterogeneity and the contrast flow field. In addition,
conventional parameters that are typically extracted from averaged intensities in large regions of interest fail to
account for spatial variations of perfusion common in complex tumor tissues. The exclusive volumetric nature
of our data along with the intravascular nature of ultrasound contrast agents, has allowed us to demonstrate
that additional information is encoded in spatial flow maps beyond convention, and that this information is
sensitive to treatment response and representative of the underlying true vascular network. Thus, our
hypothesis is that characterizing the interconnected nature of voxels in 3D DCE-US can capture new
information from volumetric tissues for cancer applications, and beyond cancer. Therefore, we propose a set of
specific aims designed to test this hypothesis by: i) further developing and ii) extensively validating new
perfusion measurements to characterize different tumor vascular properties and detect subtle microvascular
changes following therapy, and iii) clinically validating their clinical utility for diagnostics and treatment
monitoring in real patients imaged with 3D DCE-US. Our proposal takes advantage of the recent clinical
introduction of commercial ultrasound contrast agents and 3D imaging probes to advance non-invasive
bedside liver imaging for capturing complex flow beyond convention."

 The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by pulmonary vascular leak and
flooding of the normally air-filled alveolar space with protein rich edema fluid and causes severe hypoxemia,
respiratory failure and death among critically ill patients. Identification of genetic factors which modify the risk of
developing ARDS or influence clinical outcomes may improve our pathologic understanding of this disease.
Human variants in the gene LRRC16A are implicated in improved ARDS outcomes but the mechanism
remains unknown. LRRC16A encodes capping protein, Arp 2/3 and myosin-I linker (CARMIL1), a cytoskeletal
regulatory protein which has been studied primarily in cell motility. CARMIL contributes to peripheral actin
polymerization by antagonizing capping protein at the end of growing actin strands. Decreased CARMIL
expression slows cell migration by attenuating protrusion of the cell membrane. Maintenance of pulmonary
endothelial cell (EC) barrier function is critical to prevent lung vascular leak. Cytoskeletal rearrangement and
force generation determine barrier integrity through dynamic changes to the plasma membrane and cell shape.
Peripheral actin polymerization protrudes the endothelial cell membrane to increase contact with neighboring
cells, reduce intercellular gaps and increase barrier function. We hypothesize that CARMIL1 is a key regulator
of peripheral actin structure and branched actin polymerization which facilitate membrane protrusion to
determine EC barrier function. This proposal will use complementary biochemical, imaging and functional
studies to characterize the role of CARMIL1 in EC barrier function. We will investigate CARMIL1 in the context
of known regulators of endothelial cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics to improve our understanding of the
mechanisms responsible for pulmonary vascular leak. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the role of CARMIL1 in
EC peripheral actin structures and dynamics by employing biochemical and advanced imaging techniques after
CARMIL1 silencing and/or overexpression of wild-type or variant constructs. Specific Aim 2 will determine the
effect of modified CARMIL1 expression on EC barrier integrity using multiple assays of local and global
permeability. Specific Aim 3 will characterize the function of endothelial CARMIL1 in murine lung injury.
Endothelial specific delivery of siRNA and lentiviral constructs will investigate the effect of CARMIL1 manipulation
on the intact lung vasculature following inflammatory or infectious insults. These studies will provide novel
mechanistic insights into the cellular mechanisms of ARDS and provide a link between CARMIL1 variants and
clinical outcomes. This knowledge has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and improve the care of
future patients."

Vaccinations are one of the most beneficial and cost-effective public health programs. Unfortunately,
many vaccines need repeated boosting to maintain antibody levels. In particular, humoral responses are
weaker in older adults for a number of reasons. For example, immunization with live measles virus
produces antibody titers that are maintained for 50 years, while protein vaccines, such as tetanus or
anthrax toxin, require routine booster shots every five years to maintain antibody titer. The reasons for
this variability are poorly understood, but as steady-state antibody titers are directly dependent on long-
lived antibody secreting cells (LLASCs), these cells may be dying over time. The factors that control
LLASC survival in the are poorly understood, but are critically important for all humoral-based vaccines.
Survival of LLASCs is chiefly mediated by soluble cytokines, such as APRIL, CXCL12 in the BM by resident
cells. The presentation of these factors and the organization of the niche that supports these cells is
unclear. In this proposal, we explore how LLASC retention in clusters or niches, their cellular dynamics
controls their survival and competition, and how the niche is organized and maintained. These pathways
can regulate longevity of humoral responses."

Indigenous populations in the United States (American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian) face
significant substance use disorder inequities. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has increased efforts to
address these inequities through investing in research to understand the root causes and studies focused on
prevention and intervention in these populations. These efforts have included the launch of the Intervention
Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) Initiative in 2012, the establishment of the NIH Tribal
Health Research Office (THRO) in 2015, and the Native Collective Research Effort to Enhance Wellness (N
CREW) in 2023. The advances resulting from these efforts are significant, but they are also incremental,
slowed by many complexities encountered in research with diverse Indigenous populations. One particular
challenge is the continued underrepresentation of Indigenous Principal Investigators (PIs), leaders who have
unique potential to fully integrate scientific and cultural knowledge throughout study design, measurement,
analysis, interpretation and dissemination. The NCRE Scholars Program works to address this gap by fostering
the development of early career Indigenous substance use and disorder researchers, particularly those whose
work focuses on the impacts and developmental course of problematic substance use in childhood and
adolescence. NCRE Scholars began in 2012 on the foundation of the Native Children’s Research Exchange
(NCRE) network of researchers partnering with communities to understand Indigenous children’s development
(prenatal through early adulthood). The NCRE network and biennial conferences provide a platform for
connecting graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to senior research mentors who provide
substantive mentoring and career development support. The NCRE Scholars Program leverages this network
to support the development of the next generation of Indigenous substance use and disorder scientists by: (1)
providing supplemental opportunities for developing (1) substantive expertise, (2) methodological expertise, (3)
technical expertise, and (3) connections with peers, mentors, and communities. NCRE Scholars V will support
20 graduate students and early career researchers in five new cohorts of four Scholars each, providing tailored
mentoring and training opportunities, coursework, writing support, and opportunities for connection and
collaboration."

Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells in particular have
shown dramatic successes in some liquid tumors, with multiple FDA approved products in overlapping heme
indications. Yet patient responses to engineered cell therapies are highly variable and unpredictable. Given both
the extraordinary cost and extraordinary curative potential of engineered T cell therapies, matching the right cell
to the right patient remains a large unmet clinical need. Yet how patient T cells variably respond to the wealth of
different potential synthetic genetic alterations remains unexplored. Our long term goal is to develop personalized
cellular immunotherapies and the diagnostic tests necessary to nominate the optimal engineered cell for a
specific cancer patient. As a first step towards this goal, we will develop scalable pooled screening
methodologies to rapidly assay approved and proposed cellular immunotherapy constructs at scale across large
numbers of patients (Specific Aim 1). In cohorts of liquid and solid tumor patients, we will dissect the intrinsic
variability of patient T cells synthetically engineered with CARs in repetitive stimulation assay models (Specific
Aim 2). Finally, we will determine predictive correlates of patient specific engineered T cell function using high
dimensional immune cell profiling and patient clinical metadata (Specific Aim 3). We hypothesize that engineered
immune cell performance is highly variable and patient specific, and measurements of this variability across
cancer patient’s T cells will nominate future predictive diagnostic strategies for personalized cellular
immunotherapy choice. In this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award application,
the applicant, Dr. Theodore Roth, MD, PhD is a Clinical Pathologist in the Stanford University Department of
Pathology. In addition to the enclosed Research Plan, this proposal encompasses a five-year Training Plan to
complete his mentored career development with the primary goal of becoming and independent academic
physician scientist running a research group devoted to developing personalized cellular immunotherapies. Dr.
Roth will undergo training in diagnostic assay development (Training Aim 1), high dimensional immune profiling
technologies (Training Aim 2), and successful assumption of research independence (Training Aim 3). Dr. Roth’s
remaining mentored training will be overseen by a multidisciplinary group of distinguished physician scientists,
including his primary mentor Dr. Ansuman Satpathy and co-mentor Dr. Crystal Mackall, along with a senior
Advisory Committee composed of Drs. Ed Engleman, Howard Chang, and David Miklos. Stanford University
provides an outstanding environment to complete Dr. Roth’s transition to research independence, with a highly
active clinical cell therapy program overseen by his co-mentor, Dr. Crystal Mackall, and vibrant research
communities in immunotherapy, genetics, diagnostic assay development, and high dimensional molecular
technologies. Completion of the Research and Training Plans will propel Dr. Roth’s independent research career
as an academic physician scientist."

Adults who are socioeconomically disadvantaged (“Low-SES”) are at increased risk of heavy smoking, face
reduced cessation success, and bear a disproportionate burden of smoking-attributable morbidity and
mortality. Encouraging smokers who are not able or ready to quit smoking to switch to lower harm non-
combustible products could reduce this burden. However, the success of these efforts relies upon smokers
understanding that the health risks of nicotine-containing products are not identical but lie along a continuum,
with combustible products being the most harmful and noncombustible products being significantly less
harmful. Studies have identified a general lack of knowledge about the relative risks of nicotine-containing
products across the population, and evidence suggests that low-SES adults may be less knowledgeable than
higher-SES adults about the continuum of risk (COR). There is still a lack of evidence about COR perceptions
among low-SES smokers, the effectiveness of educational messages designed to boost COR knowledge, and
whether increasing COR knowledge increases intentions to switch products and reduces combustible product
use. This proposal aims to 1) use qualitative methods to assess COR perceptions among low-SES smokers, 2)
design and test candidate COR educational messages, and 3) investigate the effects of exposure to COR
educational messages on COR knowledge, intentions to switch from combustible to noncombustible products,
and reductions in combustible product use among low-SES smokers. A comprehensive training plan will
ensure successful execution of these aims, with four overall goals for the PI during the training period: 1)
proficiency in qualitative research methodology, 2) acquire expertise in clinical trial administration, leadership,
and methodology, 3) acquire expertise in advanced statistical methods to evaluate the effects of interventions,
and 4) develop expertise in designing, optimizing, and testing health communications. Training will be guided
by a team of expert mentors with complementary areas of expertise and current, strong collaborative
relationships with one another. The research and associated training will also be supported by the strong
training environment at Virginia Commonwealth University. This K01 will prepare the PI to successfully lead
future independent studies focused on reducing the burden of tobacco and other substance use among
vulnerable populations."

Despite the observation of microbial dysbiosis in the intestines of individuals at risk for and with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA), the mechanisms by which dysbiosis promotes inflammatory arthritis
remain unknown. Our group has made the following key discoveries: (1) In patients with axial SpA, paired
bacterial metagenomics with intestinal tissue metabolomics screening connected bacterial dysbiosis to
tryptophan catabolism into indoles. (2) We identified a novel indole-producing bacterium Subdoligranulum
didolesgii present in and targeted by autoantibodies and T cells from individuals at risk for and with RA that can
stimulate joint swelling when transferred into mice, whereas a non-indole producing isogenic strain does not. (3)
Using the CIA model, we demonstrated that a tryptophan low diet or microbiome depletion with antibiotics results
in protection from arthritis, and supplementation with indole is sufficient for disease by modulating both Th17 cell
differentiation and autoantibody pathogenicity. The goal of this proposal is to connect these observations and
demonstrate the immunologic pathway of indole from its generation by dysbiosis in RA to pathogenic immune
functions. Based on ongoing studies, we hypothesize that bacterial dysbiosis associated with RA results in
increased tryptophan catabolism into indole, which signals in intestinal dendritic cells to produce cytokines
leading to Th17 cell differentiation required for pathogenic autoantibody generation. In Aim 1, we will use paired
stool and plasma samples from an established cohort of controls, individuals with RA, and individuals at risk for
RA with some of whom transition to disease, to perform bacterial metagenomics of the stool and targeted
metabolomics of the plasma for the tryptophan pathway. We hypothesize that bacterial metagenomics will reveal
a pattern of tryptophan catabolism to indoles with increased plasma indole metabolites that correspond with the
development of RA. Aim 2 will then identify the cellular target of indole in vivo using dual single cell ATAC and
RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes harvested from mice fed a tryptophan low diet ± indole and induced
for CIA. Traditional immunologic and molecular biology techniques will then be performed to confirm the signaling
pathway and immune effects imparted by indole in human cells. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the requirement of
indole-stimulated Th17 differentiation for pathogenic autoantibody formation. We hypothesize that indole-
stimulated Th17 differentiation results in IL-21 that is necessary for B cell isotype switching and expression of
key glycosylation enzymes. We will block IL-23 and IL-21 in our indole-CIA model and human primary B cells to
dissect B cell functions associated with Th17 cell differentiation. Successful completion of these studies will
reveal a targetable pathway and disease population for potential therapeutic development by blocking indole in
treating RA and SpA."
10979637,"Psychiatric disorders affect up to 30% of all youth prior to age 18, can be highly impairing, and up to 50% of
affected children remain symptomatic despite the best available treatments. Part of the challenge is that the
altered brain development associated with developing a psychiatric disorder may begin at birth or earlier. Thus,
interventions may need to be implemented early in infancy, at a time when the brain is most plastic
(susceptible to external manipulations). One preventative strategy would be to target interventions to specific
brain networks when they are most plastic in high-risk individuals. Before we can enact this vision, however,
we need to learn substantially more about mechanisms of plasticity in neonates. The neonatal period is a time
of rapid development, with week-to-week brain changes, and individual neonates vary in their brain
organization and in their specific stage of development. Thus, examination of mechanisms of plasticity in
neonates will require measurement of week-to-week changes and personalized measures of plasticity and
brain organization. This proposal tests the hypothesis that high regional spontaneous activity in individual
neonates reflects their personalized brain regions that currently have high plasticity and thus are most
responsive to interventions. This hypothesis is evaluated by testing whether spontaneous activity is highest in
the personalized brain networks known to be rapidly developing during the neonatal period, predicts which
brain regions will have the most week-to-week developmental changes in their connections, and predicts which
brain regions will have the most change in response to an intervention directed at sensory networks (massage)
in individual neonates. We test these hypotheses using precision functional mapping (PFM) in 80 neonates at
two timepoints one week apart. Between timepoints, half undergo 45 minutes of daily massage, an established
neonatal intervention. Massage is used as a proof-of-concept to study impact on sensory systems when they
are highly plastic. PFM collects 1+ hours of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 2 days to derive reliable
measures permitting highly powered within-subject analyses. PFM also permits brain activity and brain
connections to be measured within personalized networks, which is required for neonates because of high
variability in the specific stage of development. Results are expected to characterize mechanisms of plasticity
and provide a model for how to target specific interventions to specific brain networks when they are most
plastic, optimizing neurodevelopmental trajectories and reducing psychiatric risk. While this proposal uses
massage as a model to influence sensory networks when most plastic, this blueprint can be extended to other
brain networks and interventions, reducing risk for psychiatric illness. Results could ultimately have high public
health impact by highlighting a guide to optimally time and target interventions to prevent psychiatric illnesses
in high-risk infants."

There are currently limited treatment options for improving endothelial dysfunction in vascular diseases such as
sepsis, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction results in endothelial cell activation,
disruption of endothelial barrier function and sensitivity to apoptosis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
delineate the pathways by which the endothelium can resist injury and disruption to facilitate the advancement
of new targets for therapeutic development. Activated protein C (APC) is a promising therapeutic and exhibits
multiple beneficial effects including stabilization of endothelial barriers and anti-apoptotic activities. Protease-
activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is the central mediator of APC cellular
signaling, which requires caveolin-1 (Cav1) and compartmentalization in caveolae. We discovered that APC-
activated PAR1 signals primarily through b-arrestin-2 (b-arr2) to promote endothelial barrier protection, and not
heterotrimeric G proteins like thrombin (Th)-activated PAR1. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop
a mechanistic understanding of how APC/PAR1 generates b-arr2 transducer bias to promote endothelial
cytoprotection. We hypothesize that distinct GRK5 determinants and co-receptors facilitate APC/PAR1-induced
b-arr2 transducer bias to promote endothelial cytoprotection through pathways enabled by Cav1
phosphorylation. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1: To delineate the mechanisms that enable GRK5 to
distinctly regulate APC- vs. Th-induced biased signaling. GRK5 is required for APC-stimulated signaling and
desensitization of Th-induced signaling. However, the mechanisms that enable distinct GRK5 functions is not
known. We will determine if distinct GRK5 functions are regulated by localization to discrete plasma membrane
microdomains such as caveolae using human cultured endothelial cells, a native system that permits the study
of endogenous PAR1 and GRK5 and HEK293 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells. Aim 2: To determine the
mechanisms by which APC vs. thrombin control b-arrestin transducer bias. It is not known how b-arrestin
transducer bias (signaling vs. desensitization) is induced by APC- vs. Th-activated PAR1 nor how APC/PAR1
promotes two distinct b-arr2-mediated cytoprotective signaling pathways: dishevelled2 (Dvl2)-Rac1 controls
endothelial barrier protection whereas sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)-Akt regulates anti-apoptotic activities. We
will determine if distinct determinants of b-arrestin and GPCR co-receptors control different b-arr2 binding modes
and functions induced by APC vs. thrombin. Aim 3: To define the mechanisms by which APC/PAR1 regulates
Cav1 function to promote cytoprotection. APC/PAR1 stimulates Cav1 phosphorylation but how this modulates
Cav1 function and is integrated into the cytoprotective pathway is not known and will be determined. The
proposed research is innovative because it will test novel hypotheses to explain how GRK5, b-arr2 and Cav1
drive APC/PAR1 endothelial cytoprotective responses in a physiologically relevant context and will help advance
the status of new targets as a future therapeutics for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction."

10980009,"Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affects 5 out of 10 patients hospitalized for the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and ~11% of all adults infected by SARS-CoV-2, which makes this
condition a growing public health concern. It is associated with important disabilities, cognitive dysfunction, and
increased risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Although exercise-based intervention is a promising
rehabilitation strategy, participation rates are commonly low in clinical population. In addition, post-exertional
malaise, a common symptom with PASC, is a major safety concern in these patients, which may prevent a
significant proportion of these individuals to receive adequate rehabilitation. In this context, there is a critical
need to develop well-tolerated and effective strategies at home that ameliorates health and functional capacity
in individuals with PASC. One promising approach that offers numerous health benefits is whole-body heat
therapy. Whether this intervention is effective when confined to the lower body and well tolerated at home in
people with PASC is, however, unknown. The overall objective of this project is to determine the safety,
tolerability, and efficacy of home-based lower body heat therapy in late middle-age and older adults with
PASC. We will test the central hypothesis that home-based lower body heat therapy is safe, well adhered, and
can improve functional capacity and several surrogate markers for metabolic and vascular health in late-middle
age and older adults with PASC. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that lower body heat therapy at home is
safe, well adhered, and improve both cognitive and physical function in middle-age and older adults with
PASC. Selected participants will be randomly allocated to perform 8 weeks of home-based lower body heat
therapy (HT, skin temperature 38-40˚C, 40-55 min, 5 per week at home), a thermoneutral condition (CT, skin
temperature 33˚C, same duration and frequency), or a walking intervention using wearable technology (WT,
1,500-3,000 additional steps from baseline, 3-5 days per week). We will compare the 6 min walking distance,
the short physical performance battery test score, gait speed, cognitive function, incidence of adverse events,
and participant’s adherence to intervention between groups. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that heat
therapy will attenuate inflammation, which will then decrease arterial stiffness, and improve both vascular
endothelial function and muscle intracellular O2 availability in individuals with PASC. We will use in vitro assays
on blood samples and Doppler ultrasound techniques to assess changes in inflammation, redox status, pulse-
wave velocity, and flow-mediated dilation. Muscle intracellular O2 availability will be measured by magnetic
resonance spectroscopy in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that lower body heat therapy will
improve glucose control as a result of enhanced mitochondrial function. All these effects will not be statistically
inferior to the WT group. The proposed research is highly significant as it is easily translatable and is expected
to guide future rehabilitation strategies to mitigate long-term disabilities in patients with PASC."

 JC virus (JCV) is a human polyomavirus which infects most of the human population worldwide during
early childhood with 50-70% of the adult population being seropositive for the virus. JCV is thought to be
transmitted by the oral/fecal route however the primary site of infection has not been identified. Following an
initial infection, JCV transits into the kidneys where it establishes a lifelong infection. For most people this
infection is latent and no new virus particles are detected, however about 8-20% of people have a low-level virus
production leading to the excretion of virus into the urine. For immune-competent individuals these lifelong
infections will be asymptomatic. However, for immune-suppressed patients, these viruses can reactivate leading
to fatal disorders. Upon immunosuppression, JCV will leave the kidney and move to the brain where it will infect
the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. Infection of the oligodendrocytes will lead to their lytic destruction
causing the fatal disorder Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). JCV genomes have been found
in both upper and lower gastrointestinal tissues and in feces suggesting that human intestinal cells can support
JCV infection. While the consensus view is that initial infection of the human population by JCV is by ingestion,
direct evidence of infection of the intestine is lacking. Most importantly, how JCV passes the intestinal epithelial
cell barrier en route to the kidney remains unknown. We plan to fill these gaps in knowledge and study how JCV
infects, replicates, and spreads in human intestinal epithelial cells. Understanding the enteric phase of JCV is of
major significance to understand JCV pathogenesis as it is believed to constitute the entry site from which 70%
of the population becomes infected. In a set of preliminary data using human intestinal organoids, as a surrogate
system to study JCV infection in human primary intestinal cells, we could show that JCV can replicate in human
intestinal cells and produce de novo infectious virus particles. In this proposal, we will build on our preliminary
data and address the cellular tropism of JCV by evaluating the susceptibility of different human intestinal cell
types to JCV infection. Additionally, we will test whether all sections of the gastrointestinal tract (duodenum,
jejunum, ileum, and colon) can support JCV infection. Finally, we will determine how JCV passes the intestinal
epithelial barrier en route to the kidney to establish its chronic infection. We anticipate that this work will provide
us with unique opportunities to identify novel therapeutic to prevent infection/transmission from the intestinal
mucosa. Importantly this work, will constitute the building block for future research that will integrate the natural
gut/kidney axis that is likely to play an important role in JCV infection and pathogenesis."

Many cancer drugs increase cardiovascular (CV) events, including hypertension, thrombosis, and
cardiomyopathy. Damaged endothelial cells (ECs) caused by chemotherapy can trigger the development and
progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). ECs represent a critical target for improving the management of
chemotherapy-induced CV toxicity. The lysosomal pathway is critical to maintaining EC homeostasis.
However, the role of lysosomes in chemotherapy-induced EC dysfunction and whether rescuing lysosomal
function is a potential strategy to treat CV toxicity remain to be fully explored. Our preliminary data suggest that
the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) impairs lysosomal function in ECs. TFEB is a master regulator
of autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. Our previous studies demonstrated that endothelial TFEB protects
against atherosclerosis, increases glucose uptake, and improves blood flow recovery after ischemic injury,
underscoring the critical role of EC TFEB in regulating CV hemostasis. Our preliminary data suggest that EC-
TFEB transgene regulates DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. TFEB controls lysosomal malfunction,
apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation induced by DOX in human ECs. Our RNA-seq data identified
multiple lysosomal-associated pathways in ECs treated with DOX. Based on the solid rationale and preliminary
data, we will define the role of endothelial TFEB in CV dysfunction induced by cancer treatment. By taking
advantage of our EC-specific transgenic (Tg) and knockout (KO) mouse models and the combined expertise of
the assembled team, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: Define the role of endothelial TFEB in
cancer therapy-induced EC dysfunction and EC-cardiomyocyte interaction in vitro; Specific Aim 2: Define the
role of EC TFEB in cancer therapy-induced CV toxicity in vivo; Specific Aim 3: Elucidate the mechanisms
mediating the effects of EC TFEB on cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Understanding
endothelial TFEB’s role and underlying mechanisms in cancer therapy-induced CV toxicity would set a
profound foundation to define endothelial TFEB as a potential therapeutic target to treat CV complications
caused by cancer therapy."
10979568,"Project Summary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating disease for which new,
disease-modifying treatments are desperately needed. Since drug targets supported by human genetic
evidence are more likely to lead to FDA-approved treatments, functional characterization of genome-wide
association study (GWAS) loci is a translational research priority. COPD GWAS led by our group and others
have identified more than 80 significant loci. We have identified the target genes for some loci, including
FAM13A, ACRV1B, and TGFB2, using integration of GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to
guide functional studies. However, most COPD GWAS loci remain uncharacterized due to 1) lack of QTL
maps in appropriate cell types and 2) genetic effects other than eQTLs, such as alternative splicing. Splicing
QTL (sQTLs) have been shown to be as important as eQTL for functional characterization of GWAS loci, and
we have used sQTLs from blood and lung to identify FBXO38 and NPNT as COPD GWAS splicing genes. In
this proposal, we will use a new resource of 185 primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC-185)
cultured and exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) or Air with associated genome-wide genotyping and
RNA-seq measurements. HAEC-185 data will be used to identify alternative splicing related to COPD and/or
CS exposure in HAECs, a highly relevant COPD cell type. In Aim 1, we will generate the first HAEC genome-
wide sQTL maps for fully differentiated HAECs exposed to CS or Air. We will perform multiple colocalization
analysis between COPD GWAS and these sQTL maps to identify genes whose splicing is altered by COPD
GWAS variants. For two loci, genetic effects on splicing will be confirmed via long read RNA sequencing
and isoform-specific protein mass spectrometry in genotype-selected HAECs. In Aim 2, we will perform
state-of-the-art fine mapping of COPD GWAS sQTLs that integrates deep learning splicing model variant
predictions with Bayesian fine mapping methods. We will train new, cell-type specific deep learning
splicing models using data from HAEC-185 and 1,376 lung tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research
Consortium. In Aim 3, we will extend our previous work in gene regulatory network modeling to develop new
methods to identify splicing regulatory networks. These methods will be applied to CS exposure data in
HAEC-185 to provide a holistic view of CS-associated alternative splicing and its impact on gene expression
pathways and cellular phenotypes. The network analysis will identify key splicing regulators, i.e. RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), whose effects will be studied using shRNA knockdown of selected RBPs in HAECs. Our
multi-disciplinary research team has the requisite expertise in COPD genomics, airway epithelial biology,
computer science, gene network inference, long read sequencing, and proteomics to complete this important
project to characterize COPD and CS-related alternative splicing in HAECs."
10980778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding vaso-proliferative disease frequently seen in
prematurely born infants with lifelong consequences for both the infant and society. The c-type lectin,
Surfactant Protein A (SP-A), is an immunomodulatory protein, found to be deficient in prematurely born infants.
Lack of SP-A is associated with lung disease of prematurity and a temporal association with pulmonary
vascular growth factors has been previously reported. We previously discovered that SP-A is expressed in the
Müller retina and plays an important role in neovascular disease (NV) with a pro-angiogenic phenotype. Our
preliminary data now shows SP-A promotes early retinal vascular development, and conversely, lack of SP-A
is seen in response to hyperoxia in rodent models. SP-A has a positive association with expression of retinal
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cytoskeleton proteins and associated chaperones necessary for
both cytoskeleton and VEGF folding. Our results suggest that deficiency of SP-A leads to reduced vascular
growth in endothelial cells both in the rodent retina and in vitro impacting retinal angiogenesis. Conversely, in
the second stage, SP-A acts in a proangiogenic fashion to drive NV. Given that current anti-VEGF therapies for
ROP may result in delayed re-appearance of NV and may also depress systemic VEGF levels with
consequences for the growing preterm infant, there is a critical need to develop safe and targeted therapies for
ROP and most importantly- to prevent it. We hypothesize that the SP-A protein and associated pathways
represent novel therapeutic targets to rescue early hyperoxia and prematurity related vascular arrest. It is
imperative to understand the mechanisms for these complex cell-intrinsic properties. In this proposal we will
examine cytoskeleton, chaperone and S-A receptor molecules using transgenic strains with targeted deletion
of SP-A and Myo18A receptor in Müller and endothelial cells. We will examine the association between SP-A
and the chaperone aCrystallinB which drive post-translational modification of cytoskeleton and vascular growth
factors. The goals of this proposal are to characterize the SP-A/chaperone/VEGF axis, to confirm Myo18A as
the SP-A receptor and study the impact of SP-A on endothelial cell cytoskeleton and endothelial cell function.
Finally, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting SP-A protein in early disease in a rodent ROP model.

10980780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glutamine (Gln) is a multifaceted amino acid that serves as important carbon and nitrogen sources. In a
situation where circulatory supply of Gln is limited, such as in poorly vascularized tumors, cell autonomous Gln
synthesis is turned on to assimilate the inorganic ammonia into Gln to support the nitrogen anabolic processes.
In mammals, Gln synthesis is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase (GS) that condenses ammonium with
glutamate to produce Gln. GS has been shown to enhance cell survival/growth/repairs in various cancers by
promoting de novo glutamine synthesis and subsequent nitrogen anabolism. In the liver, where blood supply of
Gln is abundant, GS-mediated Gln synthesis serves as a mechanism for ammonia detoxification next to the
urea cycle. Interestingly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the major histological subtype of liver malignancy,
GS expression is frequently elevated whereas urea cycle enzymes (UCEs) down-regulated. Both elevated GS
and decreased UCEs correlate well with -catenin activation, a prevalent oncogenic driving event in HCC.
While this seems to be consistent with the common thought that GS promotes tumor growth, surprisingly, using
the Glulflox/flox mouse, we recently reported that genetic ablation of hepatic GS accelerated tumor growth in
several HCC models that involve -catenin6. Echoing the scenario in clinic, oncogenic -catenin suppressed
the expression of the UCEs while induced the expression of GS. It was then speculated that the suppression of
UCEs led to defective ammonia clearance, and GS was upregulated to help alleviate the hyperammonemia
situation. GS ablation exacerbated the ammonia burden and facilitated the production of Glu-derived non-
essential amino acids (NEAAs) that subsequently stimulated mTORC1. These findings prompt us to form the
hypothesis that GS-mediated ammonia clearance functions to suppress tumor growth in -catenin-driven HCC.
We propose two Specific Aims: 1) Study the theory that defective ammonia clearance promotes HCC. We will
first determine whether GS suppresses HCC growth in a cell-intrinsic fashion, study how hyperammonemia
promotes HCC, and take unbiased approach to uncover other mechanisms that may be responsible for
enhanced HCC growth resulting from hyperammonemia. 2) Study how -catenin regulates GS expression in
the liver. GS transcription is activated by Wnt/-catenin during liver zonal development and upon oncogenic
transformation of hepatocytes. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Our preliminary data
suggest that GS expression is regulated by a liver-specific cis-acting distal enhancer. We will identify and
characterize the liver-specific distal enhancer and study the underlying mechanism for GS expression
regulated by the novel transcription factors that are associated with the enhancer. Accomplishing these Aims
will help establish a novel theory that GS-mediated ammonia clearance is a tumor-suppressing mechanism in
HCC, and will uncover the molecular basis for liver-specific regulation of GS expression driven by -catenin."
10981551,"Our long-term goal is to advance our neuromechanical understanding of balance impairments in Parkinson’s
disease (PD) to enable mechanistic, personalized treatments to improve balance and reduce falls. In this
renewal, we seek to identify cortical activity metrics related to perceptual, cognitive, and muscle activity
impairments in PD, all of which we showed in the prior funding period to be associated with balance
impairments and/or fall history. Here we seek to understand neural circuit dysfunction underlying interactions
between non-motor and motor symptoms of PD that lead to balance impairments. We build on MPI Ting’s
expertise in the neuromechanics of reactive balance control, adding MPI Borich’s expertise in high-density
electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and neuroimaging. An innovation of the proposal is the use of a series of
support-surface perturbations during standing as a balance probe to identify potential electrophysiological
biomarkers of neural circuit dysfunction relevant to balance and mobility impairments in PD. Our recent and
preliminary studies demonstrate that the balance probe elicits large, wide-spread cortical activity patterns time-
locked to the loss and recovery of balance responses that can be compared within and across individuals on a
millisecond time scale. We hypothesize that increased cortical contributions to balance underlie perceptual-
motor and cognitive-motor interactions that impair mobility. Our objective is to identify precise spatiotemporal
cortical activity patterns underlying perceptual-motor (Aim 1) and cognitive-motor (Aim 2) interactions in PD
cortical contributions to muscle activity during balance control (Aim 3). We will use a whole-body perceptual
paradigm that enables us to concurrently assess cortical activity related to whole-body motion perception,
cognitive and motor set-shifting, as well as cortical drive to balance-correcting muscle activity. We predict
greater pre-perturbation beta (13-30 Hz) power during a perceptual task will be correlated with worse
perception in PD but not older adults OA without PD (Aim 1), less attenuation of cortical responses will be
associated with worse cognitive set-shifting in OA and PD (Aim 2), and that OA and PD will have different
cortically-driven antagonist muscle activity (Aim 3). Across Aims, we predict that these poorer functional
outcomes will also be associated with increased engagement of cortical areas during the balance probe and
lower clinical balance scores. Based on preliminary data, we predict dopamine medications in PD will increase
cortical engagement during the balance probe, and in support of our hypothesis, will further impair perceptual-
motor, cognitive-motor, and muscle activity outcomes. Finally, we will perform exploratory analyses of
electrophysiological outcomes with respect to fall history, prospective falls, and structural and functional
neuroimaging data. If successful, we will significantly advance the scientific framework and
electrophysiological approaches to enable precision-medicine strategies for personalized, mechanistic
assessments and interventions to improve the quality of life of those living with PD."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have regenerative, immunosuppressive properties, but using MSCs to treat
autoimmunity has resulted in mixed clinical results at best. Lackluster therapeutic efficacy has been attributed to
insufficient trafficking to the tissue of interest and suboptimal immunosuppression. Our preliminary data indicate
that using lentiviruses with specific enhancers, we can successfully engineer MSCs to express chimeric antigen
receptors (CARs) and become CAR-MSC. We also have demonstrated that incorporating specifically designed
CARs targeting gut integrins into MSCs results in their enhanced immunosuppression and trafficking to the colon
in preclinical models. Engineering MSCs maintain their stemness and CAR-MSCs are safe in canine models.
This led to our central hypothesis that engineering MSCs with a CAR enhances their efficacy in graft versus host
disease (GVHD) and autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis. In this project, we will leverage
our available tools of viral vectors, CRISPR constructs, mouse models, and established biobanks to develop
CAR-MSCs that demonstrate enhanced therapeutic efficacy over unmodified MSCs in the treatment of GVHD.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will determine the mechanisms by which CAR-MSCs exert their enhanced
immunosuppression. In Aim 2 of this proposal, we will study cellular trafficking in preclinical models. In Aim 3 of
this proposal, we will optimize signaling of CAR-MSCs. At the conclusion of this project, we will have developed
a new, translatable cellular therapeutic strategy to treat GVHD and IBD by engineering CAR-MSCs to have
improved targeting and immunosuppression over unmodified MSCs. This platform can be applicable in different
autoimmune diseases."
10981065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation occurs through the binding of RNA
transcripts with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), a large class of cellular proteins consisting of over 1500 members.
Identifying the native substrates of RBPs and characterizing the function of these interactions remains a
significant challenge in biology. Further, oligonucleotides and small molecules that target RNA-protein
interactions and modulate protein expression have been recently deployed in the clinic and promise to provide
a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of human diseases.
We have developed TRIBE-ID, an RNA editing approach to interrogate dynamic RNA-protein interactions in a
small molecule-dependent manner. We applied our approach to profile the RNA substrates of the RBP G3BP1,
a central component of stress granule condensates. Here, we propose to further develop and apply TRIBE-ID
as a general platform to investigate RNA-binding events in cells. We will advance the efficiency and generality
of RNA editing for interactomic studies and investigate the trafficking and post-transcriptional regulation of RNA
stability/translation by cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates. Further, we will develop RNA editing approaches
to investigate small-molecule RNA interactions. Our project has the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Develop an RNA editing platform with improved generality, efficiency, and molecular resolution.
Aim 2: Characterize regulation of RNA stability/translation by biomolecular condensate-forming RBPs.
Aim 3: Develop an RNA editing approach to investigate RNA-binding small molecule therapeutics.
Our findings will provide new approaches for studying dynamic RNA-protein interactions and RNA-binding small
molecules and reveal new insights into the formation and function of phase-separated biomolecular
condensates. These studies should advance our understanding of fundamental RNA regulatory mechanisms
and accelerate the development and characterization of RNA-targeted therapeutics."

The overall objective of the research proposal is to explore the impact of leptin modulation on healthspan and
lifespan. Aging is associated with a dramatic increase in visceral adiposity that contributes to elevated circulating
leptin and leptin resistance. Our recent publications in Science Translational Medicine, Diabetes, Cell
Metabolism and Molecular Metabolism have clearly indicated hyperleptinemia is a driving force for diet or
antipsychotic drug-induced obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, and partial leptin reduction protects
the mice from obesity and tissue dysfunction. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that chronic
hyperleptinemia drives cellular senescence in cultured preadipocytes, proving a potential mechanism for
increased inflammation and reduced capacity to differentiate into mature adipocytes. In addition, reducing
circulating leptin, achieved by a genetic approach, significantly extend both median and maximum lifespan.
Based on these observations, we proposed our central hypothesis that leptin modulation is a new means to
regulate both healthspan and lifespan via leptin-driven cellular senescence. With our newly generated mouse
models and customized leptin neutralizing antibody, along with numerous resources at San Antonio Nathan
Shock Center, we will assess the effect of leptin modulation in healthspan and lifespan with three Specific Aims.
Aim 1 is to test whether aging-associated hyperleptinemia accelerates cellular senescence and impairs
healthspan and lifespan; Aim 2 is to access the effects of reducing leptin on cellular senescence, healthspan,
and lifespan; Aim 3 will elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) mediating leptin-driven cellular senescence. All
three Specific Aims work together to establish
a novel mechanism for metabolic aging and set the stage for trials
of leptin-based therapeutics in humans to reduce age-related diseases and extend healthspan and lifespan."
10985435,"Although the majority of AD patients are sporadic (SAD), numerous studies have implicated biological sex and
variation in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene as two of the strongest factors that modulate risk of AD onset and
age-related progression. Specifically, compared to the APOE3 allele, individuals carrying one copy of APOE4
have an increased AD risk by 4-fold and individuals carrying two copies have up to 15-fold higher probability of
developing AD. Conversely, individuals with the APOE2 allele are 40 percent less likely to develop AD. Moreover,
the risk-inducing effects of APOE4 have been shown to be augmented in female patients. Despite these
interactions, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sex-based differences in APOE-related AD risk have not
been precisely determined. Previously, we used isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to
investigate the mechanisms by which APOE genotypes influences AD risk. In this proposal, we will build upon
this work to dissect the role sex plays as it relates to these APOE genotype-dependent effects. To that end, in
the first aim of this proposal will use our highly efficient gene editing technology to introduce various APOE
genotypes into isogenic hiPSC lines with different sex chromosome complements derived from the same genetic
background. In the second aim, we will employ these isogenic hiPSC lines in the context of neuronal, astrocytic,
and microglia culture systems to determine the manner in which APOE and sex interact to (i) influence Aβ
processing, secretion, and uptake, (ii) alter tau hyperphosphorylation, and (iii) regulate global transcriptional
changes that would influence AD risk. Overall, a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which
APOE and biological sex interact to modulate likelihood of AD onset will have a significant impact on the design
of therapeutic interventions."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) presents a striking example of the selective cell tropism common to most
neurodegenerative diseases. Early clinical symptoms (such as memory loss) are caused by the selective
buildup of tau pathology and by the degeneration of principal neurons of the entorhinal cortex layer II (ECII).
Understanding pathological lesion formation in ECII might be key to design disease-modifying therapeutics,
since pathological tau seeds spread from ECII to other brain regions in later stages of AD. Additionally,
investigating the most AD-vulnerable neurons of the brain could reveal crucial steps in the molecular events
that lead to degeneration. In previous work, we molecularly profiled ECII neurons and compared them to
neurons more resistant to the disease using a systems-level framework. We identified novel genes and
pathways predicted to drive neuronal pathology. But we are still missing an in-depth understanding of both the
particular proteoforms of tau accumulating in the EC, and the concomitant gene expression changes occurring
in ECII neurons and surrounding glial and neuronal cells. We propose here to study postmortem TEC
(transentorhinal cortex – the subarea of the EC where the very first neurofibrillary tangles appear), EC, and
prefrontal cortex (PFC) from asymptomatic individuals with either no amyloid and tau pathology (Braak stage
0), or with amyloid and early stage neurofibrillary tangle pathology (Braak stage I/II). With these samples, we
will perform single-nucleus combinatorial indexing RNA-sequencing, in order to profile all cell types and
subtypes. Cross-referencing the single-nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset with a fully annotated mouse single-
nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset of EC will allow to identify nuclei from vulnerable ECII neurons. Performing
cell type abundance and differential expression analysis in three regions with increasing vulnerability to the
disease (TEC – EC – PFC) will yield a picture of the sequential changes occurring during early disease.
Samples will also be subjected to targeted mass spectrometry analysis to detect Aβ peptides and a number of
tau phosphorylation sites, cleavage and splice isoforms to identify potential pathological proteoforms specific to
early AD. Jointly analyzing the proteomics and transcriptomics dataset will allow us to find specific genes
correlated with the most salient proteoforms. This multimodal catalog will also be analyzed jointly with our
previously described ECII functional network, and altogether should yield exciting insight into the earliest
events occurring in vulnerable neurons as AD-type neuropathology unfolds, uncovering genes both
dysregulated and predicted to drive downstream tau pathology."

There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how best to care for persons living with dementia (PLWD)
and urinary incontinence (UI), many of whom are being cared for in their homes by family members with no
prior caregiving experience (i.e., spouses and children). While many of these family caregivers are highly
motivated and dedicated to caring for their loved ones and to preserving their dignity, many are also burdened
by the stigmatized nature of UI and the associated complexities of providing such intimate care to their spouse
or parent. Further, a lack support, tools, and resources necessary to provide the type of continence care
required to maintain their loved one in the home is often a final deciding factor for institutionalization.
Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand and support these caregivers, starting with a better
understanding of their experience, challenges, and perspectives, aligned with those of the PLWD and UI, on
this important problem to inform possible solutions. Our overarching research objective is to support these
caregivers to more effectively care for their PLWD and UI with safety and dignity, ultimately keeping them in
their home for as long as possible. The objective of the proposed study is to better understand the unique UI
support needs, preferences, and priorities of family caregivers of PLWD and the PLWD in the community to lay
the groundwork for potential future interventions in the home environment. The central hypothesis is that there
are identifiable and actionable caregiver needs in caring for PWLD and UI in the home that can be used to
develop future interventions. This study will utilize a total of 6 focus groups consisting of 3 types of family
caregivers (2 with women spouses, 2 with men spouses, and 2 with daughters/sons) from both rural and urban
communities to understand their UI support needs, 12 individual interviews with care dyads (caregivers, early
stage PWLD) to understand their current interpersonal dynamics and future priorities for management of UI,
and a participatory photography methodology of with 12 caregivers to illuminate unique opportunities for
intervention for UI care in the home. This study is innovative in terms of both content (the focus on different
caregiver groups for PLWD and UI) and methodology (the use of participatory photography methodology to
capture novel, feasible, and acceptable areas for future innovation and intervention). The proposed research
is significant because there are limited data on caregivers for PLWD with regards to in home UI care, which is
an extremely common, understudied, and underserved area of research in this already vulnerable population.
Findings from this study will inform a future R01 designed to create and implement an intervention to assist
family caregivers of PLWD and UI to help serve them to care for their loved ones with dignity and to keep them
in the home for as long as possible."
10985282,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Weight regain after behavioral weight loss (BWL) treatment is extremely common and a major barrier to
healthy weight control. Following BWL treatment, participants are encouraged to self-weigh daily and
immediately take action to reverse small weight regains before they can escalate. However, research
continually shows that, when participants notice a small weight regain, they rarely attempt to actively address
it; instead, they tend to avoid the behaviors necessary to reverse the gain. Existing weight loss maintenance
programs attempt to provide greater support for reversing small weight gains, typically by deploying standard
BWL strategies (e.g., goal setting, problem solving) whenever participants hit a certain “red zone” weight (>5
pounds above their current weight). Yet, these programs achieve minimal or no success. Research suggests
that standard BWL strategies are insufficient for helping participants reverse small weight regains because
regain is demoralizing and distressing for participants, causing them to disengage from their weight control
goals. My own ecological momentary assessment (EMA) research shows that participants enrolled in BWL
treatment experienced greater frustration, greater shame, and lower confidence in controlling their weight on
days that they gained weight, which led to poorer adherence to their weight control behaviors that day. To
prevent goal disengagement, interventions must help participants cope with the distress and demoralization of
weight regain. Psychological strategies of mindfulness, acceptance, and self-compassion (MASC) are
commonly used in therapeutic frameworks designed to help people cope with distress (e.g., Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy), and may be an especially good fit for promoting adaptive responses to weight regain.
To maximize their effectiveness, these strategies must be administered immediately after the participant
experiences weight regain, before the cycle of weight regain and disengagement becomes entrenched. Just-in-
time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) can deploy these interventions in the moments after a weigh-in, as soon as
the participant starts to disengage. The proposed study tests the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of
JITAIs that use both standard behavioral weight loss strategies and MASC strategies to promote adaptive
responses to weight regain. Adults (N=120) who have lost at least 5% of their weight during BWL treatment will
be randomly assigned to a JITAI condition or an active control (AC) condition. All participants will be asked to
weigh themselves daily. Those in the JITAI condition will receive JITAIs immediately after weigh-ins that show
weight gain, or on mornings they skip the weigh-in. It expected that, compared to the AC condition, participants
in the JITAI condition will have improved immediate psychological and behavioral responses to weight regain
(or a missed weigh-in) and ultimately, improved weight loss maintenance in the six months following BWL
treatment."
10987109,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infectious disease is a major threat to human health worldwide. The emergence of
antibiotic resistance pathogens necessitates the development of new drugs to treat infections. A
fundamental challenge in developing antibiotics is that many pathogens replicate inside host
cells rendering them inaccessible to antimicrobial agents. The critical processes that govern
pathogen growth within host cells represent promising new targets for therapeutic intervention.
 Pathogens encounter a broad assortment of challenges within the host. The ability to
perceive and adapt to these challenges is a critical determinant of virulence. These adaptations
are mediated by sensory systems that detect host-imposed insult or alterations in their local
environment and drive an appropriate response. Many bacterial pathogens that grow inside host
cells do so in specialized compartments called replication vacuoles. Maintaining the integrity of
the replication vacuole is paramount to bacterial survival and growth as it provides protection
against host surveillance systems that detect and eliminate pathogens. Disrupting this process
would thus limit bacterial burden and enable pathogen killing by the host. Despite vacuole
integrity being paramount for pathogenesis, the mechanisms responsible and how bacteria
sense and respond to defects in this process are poorly understood.
 We have identified a cell-surface signaling system employed by the bacterial pathogen
Legionella that plays a central role in promoting vacuole integrity. Legionella is the causative
agent of a life-threatening pneumonia called Legionnaire’s disease and a world-wide health
problem. The goal of this research is to characterize how signals are propagated and the
response pathway that compensates ensures vacuole stability. This work will define an
unprecedented molecular surveillance system employed by a vacuolar pathogen to sustain its
replication compartment and thus, a new paradigm in microbial pathogenesis. As vacuole
integrity plays is a central role in defining the virulence of numerous intracellular pathogens, this
work will have broad implications across the field of microbial pathogenesis. This work will
provide unprecedented insight into a critical event that determines the outcome of an infection
and a means to develop new strategies to treat disease."

Candida commonly adhere to medical devices, flourishing as a biofilm. A clinical hallmark of biofilm infection is
profound antifungal resistance. As effective therapies are not available for these life-threatening infections,
understanding how the cells survive existing drug therapies is desperately needed. The extracellular matrix, a
distinguishing feature of biofilms, has been linked to drug resistance. This proposed investigation builds logically
upon progress in the last funding period, including; the discoveries that 1] key matrix components are delivered
via biofilm distinct extracellular vesicle (EVs) as cargo components, 2] exogenous EV add-back assays allow
delineation of vesicle cargo constituent roles, 3] ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport)
pathway components partially impact biofilm EV production and cargo, and 4] a novel antifungal, turbinmicin,
inhibits biofilm EV production and matrix production, rendering the cellular community susceptible to antifungals.
5] We further identified a few genetic components necessary for production of these EV and biofilm roles for
select vesicle cargo components. However, the functions of the majority of vesicle cargo constituents and the
regulatory components of these biofilm pathways remain undefined. Our recent progress helps to solve this
mystery. We recently discovered TF mutants with three distinct EV and biofilm resistance and matrix phenotypes.
We hypothesize that investigation of these loss of function TFs mutants and their effectors will 1] identify the
regulatory network for biofilm EV production and cargo packaging of EVs and 2] uncover roles for EV cargo in
biofilm biology, including drug-resistance. Our hypothesis is based upon five main findings. First, we identified a
group of TF mutants exhibiting both antifungal susceptibility and extracellular matrix defects, consistent with a
matrix protection resistance mechanism. Second, we discovered a subset of drug-susceptible mutants displaying
a profound reduction in biofilm EV production. Importantly, the matrix resistance phenotype of these TF mutants
is restored via administration of WT EVs. Third, another group of drug-susceptible TF mutants exhibit changes
in vesicle cargo but preserved vesicle production. The drug-susceptible phenotype is also reversed for these
mutants by addition of WT EVs. Fourth, we find a group of TF mutants that produced elevated quantities of
biofilm extracellular vesicles. And fifth¸ exposure of biofilms to turbinmicin reduces not only EV quantity but EV
cargo constituents. Our immediate objectives are 1] to define the Candida regulatory pathways that govern
vesicle delivery and maturation of the matrix-resistance mechanism and 2] to discern the genetic effectors
responsible for production and delivery of these virulence constituents. We seek to test our EV biofilm
hypotheses utilizing these three distinct functional TF mutant groups, turbinmicin as a novel pharmacologic tool,
and our EV and biofilm assays."
10980152,"Personality characteristics are important predictors of dementia risk and progression. Additionally, there is a
burgeoning interest in the role of personality in the cognitive healthspan and cognitive resilience, both of which
are related to the development and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease & Related Dementias (ADRD). In this
application, we describe a novel and translational turn in our line of research on personality and ADRD. In Aim
1, we will focus on the direct and indirect role of both personality traits and social support in the cognitive
healthspan across 10 studies within 4 countries. We define cognitive healthspan as the slower overall cognitive
decline observed 1) prior to clinical diagnosis (dx) of ADRD, 2) a later diagnosis of ADRD, and 3), as a steeper
post-ADRD dx decline in cognition. This third definition will be a test of the compression of cognitive morbidity.
We will examine the associations between personality traits and these three definitions of cognitive health
span, and then further explore the extent to which the associations between personality traits, social support,
and cognitive healthspan operate through inflammatory or cardiometabolic pathways. In Aim 2, we will extend
our previous work on personality and cognitive resilience (defined as having better than expected cognitive
function given post-mortem neuropathology) by testing the direct associations between personality traits, social
support, and cognitive resilience and their indirect associations via inflammatory/cardiometabolic markers (as
obtain from 5 longitudinal datasets that containing post-mortem tissues samples). In Aim 3, we will address
social disadvantage as a moderator of the associations between personality traits, social support, and
cognitive healthspan, cognitive resilience, and ADRD. We will test the theory of resource substitution, which
predicts that the associations among personality traits, social support, cognitive health span, and ADRD
outcomes may be amplified among individuals with lower SES or from under-represented backgrounds. Our
use of up to 10 large longitudinal studies for our main research questions will enhance both the replicability and
generalizability of our findings. These aims are highly significant and have potential for high impact as they will
provide a better understanding of successful aging while tolerating dementia related neuropathology. The
results from this work will provide potentially useful targets for prevention, and the knowledge gained will help
researchers, health practitioners and policy makers make decisions about preventive medicine approaches to
optimizing cognitive healthspan."

AIM1 studies how a therapeutic sugar is mobilized for glycosylation. Sugars taken up from outside the cell are
handled differently than those produced inside the cell. We found that activated fucose (GDP-Fuc) exists in
multiple cytoplasmic pools that differentially contribute to glycosylation., There is no homogenous, feely mixing
pool of sugars. This segregation requires a previously unimagined level of cellular organization to distinguish
fucose from different origins. We measured simultaneous contributions of the de novo, exogenous, and recycled
(salvaged) fucose into multiple glycoproteins. Their contributions varied based on the fucose origin, glycoprotein
acceptor, cellular compartment (ER or Golgi), and fucosyltransferase. These multiple, separate, yet conversant,
GDP-fucose pools require regulation, since their combined amount remains constant. We will use multiple 13C-
sugar labeling and quantitative lectin binding as functional readouts to probe this cellular organization and
control. Now we will determine 1.) how the metabolic origin of fucose affects its ultimate incorporation into
different glycoproteins. 2.) basis of fucose segregation 3). the effect of relocating fucosyltransferses from the ER
to the Golgi. 4.) the genes and transporters involved in fucose segregation, degradation, and recycling. 5.) Use
lectin-based siRNA knockdown and whole genome CRISPR screens to search for genes that impact GDP-Fuc
pool utilization. Discovery of multiple GDP-Fucose pools led us to find evidence for separate GDP-Mannose
pools. We will measure functional effects using 13C-monosaccharide incorporation into bulk N- and O-linked
glycans or into single glycoproteins using lectin binding. Finding the players and mechanisms that segregate
pools will likely apply to other monosaccharides and precursors for other macromolecules.
In AIM 2, we will continue to identify and validate new CDGs linking clinical medicine to cell biology and
glycosylation. We already identified 25 types of CDG. Each candidate requires individualized biochemical and
functional validation. Our decades-long clinical pipeline provides a steady stream of potential candidate genes.
We prioritize them based on inheritance pedigrees, nature of the variants, interactome and structural analysis of
the protein. UGGT1, GOLG2A, MGAT1, and GET1 are currently in our pipeline. We design functional assays to
test pathogenicity of variants using patient-derived cells or by functional complementation of KO lines with
patient-variant constructs. Pathogenic variants do not complement, showing they are legitimate CDGs. Assays
include intracellular protein trafficking, Golgi morphology and dynamics, glycomic analysis and lectin binding.
The clinical discoveries enhance our insights into basic science and sometimes provide therapy for patients."
10980335,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly heritable trait, where much of the phenotypic variation is explained
by genetic variation. A significant proportion of AD risk is explained by ancestry and APOE genotype. We and
others have shown that ancestry differences across the genome (global ancestry) and at the APOE locus (local
ancestry) are significantly associated with risk of AD in admixed populations. African-derived APOE alleles
are associated with reduced risk of AD after controlling for global ancestry and APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 genotype in
African American, Caribbean Hispanic, and Puerto Rican samples. This local ancestry effect may be driven by
variants on African-derived haplotypes, European-derived haplotypes, or both. The focus of this study is to
determine which variants on these haplotypes may explain the association between African-derived APOE
alleles and reduced risk of AD and to characterize their potential consequences at the cellular level.
 APOE is involved in many pathways relevant to AD, including lipid biosynthesis and two ends of the
efferocytosis pathway: recognition/engulfment and adaptation. This may explain why the ε2 and ε4 alleles
associated with AD risk are associated with many phenotypes, including peripheral lipid traits (lipids) and
inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP). Both ε2 and ε4 are associated with unfavorable lipid and
CRP profiles that are themselves associated with AD risk, AD biomarkers, and other causes of morbidity and
mortality. As with AD, the strength of association between ε2 and ε4 and both lipids and CRP vary with
ancestry. Joint consideration of AD with lipid and inflammation-related traits is expected to reveal additional
pathophysiological information not identifiable in separate analyses.
 Therefore, we propose to investigate local ancestry effects at APOE and AD risk within the Alzheimer’s
Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) whole genome sequence (WGS) data, along with their effects on
harmonized lipid traits and CRP levels paired with WGS data from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine
(TOPMed) project among admixed participants who were not ascertained for AD. We will estimate local
ancestry probabilities, then test for association between global (across the genome) and local (at APOE)
ancestry using two alternative approaches. Contrasting ancestry-specific APOE haplotypes within and
between these studies will allow us to nominate variants with pleiotropic vs. trait-specific effects. Our
bioinformatics pipeline will link variants to their potential consequences using gene expression and regulatory
data tailored to AD, prioritizing the appropriate model systems for future studies. This work will facilitate
therapeutic target selection that avoids negative effects on lipid and inflammatory phenotypes associated with
significant morbidity and mortality."
10980047,"SUMMARY
A rare disease is a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or 1 in 2,000 individuals in the general population. There are approximately 7000 distinct rare diseases, creating a substantial collective public health burden. Approximately 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and molecular diagnosis is essential for the management, treatment, and development of therapy. In Indiana there are several barriers to identification of rare disease and access to care: Indiana is a state that has a longstanding history of being underserved for genetics services; there is a large rural population; the education level is in the bottom quartile among states and the median income level is also in the bottom echelon. We have outstanding expertise in rare disease within the state, but it is geographically concentrated. For all these reasons, we recognize that while genetics holds the promise of improving health outcomes, it also may serve to widen health inequity. Our development of the Indiana Collaborative for Undiagnosed Rare Disease is based on the concept that we must be inclusive in our approach to rare disease to implement access to care and diagnostics that will significantly impact statewide health. Our collaborative team also includes experts in urban medicine, community-based participation in research, and health inequity. Our central goal is to improve the health of Indiana by improving recognition, access, and diagnostic evaluation for patients at risk for rare diseases. Using a multi-omics approach that combines genome sequencing (GS), transcriptomics, metabolic testing, and proteomics with deep phenotyping, we will leverage the resources and expertise of our collaborative network. We propose to overcome the barriers/challenges to improving undiagnosed rare disease by 1) consolidating statewide rare disease expertise, leveraging our UDN Diagnostic center of excellence; 2) partnering with communities and experts in health care disparity to develop a novel toolkit to screen patients at risk for rare disease and to implement telehealth NICU genomics screening using a toolkit already piloted at IU and found to have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of genetic disease; and 3) developing innovative approaches to rare disease discovery and training including technologies aimed at improving the post-exome/genome diagnosis rate. We will use Long-Read Sequencing, proteomics, Massively Parallel Reporter Assays, and collaborations with internal and external resources to accomplish this."

Syphilis rates in the United States (US) have reached their highest levels in decades, doubling in the past five
years alone. In 2021, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for nearly half (46.5%) of all male primary
and secondary (P&S) cases. The rate of congenital syphilis has increased by eight-fold since 2011 – reaching
one in every 1,300 US births in 2021. The surge in syphilis cases is evident across the US, with highest
concentration in urban areas. Amidst declining public health budgets, local policymakers face the challenge of
identifying the most efficient and cost-effective ways to invest in these existing tools to alter the trajectory of the
US syphilis epidemic. Innovations in syphilis prevention and diagnoses, such as doxycycline for post-exposure
prophylaxis (""doxy-PEP"") and new diagnostics like point-of-care (POC) or at-home testing, hold promise in
reducing syphilis incidence. Efforts to curb new infections require multifactorial approaches addressing
underlying transmission drivers and health disparities. To reverse syphilis trends, it is critical to identify the
most efficient use of limited public health resources, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all solution may not be
suitable for all US cities. Mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics serve as powerful tools for
forecasting the impact of infection control strategies. Despite extensive applications in studying HIV and other
sexually transmitted infections, there is a marked lack of modeling of US syphilis over the last decade. The
absence of representative models for the US syphilis epidemic hinders the effective formulation of
evidence-based policy to control further spread of infections. In this proposal, we plan to develop a novel
suite of local-level syphilis epidemiologic and economic models (LSEEM) across 40 US cities with the highest
syphilis diagnosis rates. The model will consider syphilis transmission, progression, HIV co-infection, STI care
engagement dynamics, and demographic factors such as age, racial and ethnic disparities, risk profiles, and
social determinants of health. In Aim 1, we will assess the potential impact of scaling up ""existing"" syphilis
control interventions, focusing on increased testing, expanded partner tracing, and faster treatment initiation.
Our objective is to provide achievable, cost-effective, and practical suggestions applicable to local jurisdictions.
Aim 2 involves evaluating the scale-up of ""emerging"" diagnostics and biomedical interventions under various
assumptions concerning population coverage and costs. Our goal is to determine the conditions under which
these interventions would be cost-effective when entering the market. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a user-
friendly online toolkit to enable decision-makers at local, state, and national levels to obtain customized
projections of the impact from diagnostic or biomedical prevention interventions. This tool will aid in translating
data into evidence-based policy-making, bridging a critical gap and providing a roadmap for informing future
syphilis control interventions. Collaborating with the health departments of New York City, Baltimore City, and
New York State will further facilitate translation of the results into actionable policies."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with limited treatment options. We have developed a promising new
treatment for GBM using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. CAR-T cells are derived from the patient’s
own T cells and genetically modified to express a receptor that will target the cancer cells through a specific
antigen. We first developed CAR-T cells targeting epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a
mutated form of EGFR that is uniquely expressed in GBM. Treating patients with EGFRvIII-CAR-T cells resulted
in decreased EGFRvIII-expressing cells, while EGFR expression remained the same or increased. With
EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell treatment, there was also infiltration of T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are known to
suppress T cell function and may have limited CAR-T cell killing of tumor cells. To improve this therapy, we
engineered the EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell to secrete a T cell-engaging antibody molecule (TEAM) that binds to EGFR
and CD3 (CARv3.TEAM-E cells). The TEAM allows the CAR-T cell to target more than one antigen while also
activating other (non-CAR) T cells within the tumor, including converting Tregs to killer cells. We tested
CARv3.TEAM-E cells in vitro and in mouse xenograft models and found they safely and effectively target
EGFRvIII+EGFR+ and EGFRvIII–EGFR+ GBM. When these cells were injected into the mouse brain for direct
access to the tumor, very few escaped into the peripheral circulation, which protected normal tissues with EGFR
expression from being targeted by the TEAM. Based on these preclinical results, we are initiating a phase I
clinical trial of the CARv3.TEAM-E cells for the treatment of primary or recurrent GBM. The CARv3.TEAM-E cells
will be injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an Ommaya reservoir. We will measure the safety of this
treatment by monitoring patients for adverse events related to CAR-T treatment and EGFR targeting.
Additionally, we will perform correlative studies to monitor CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and phenotype in
the CSF and peripheral blood as well as infiltration into the tumor. We will examine the tumor for changes in
antigen expression (EGFRvIII, EGFR, etc.) with CARv3.TEAM-E cell infiltration and changes in other immune
cells that could be influencing CARv3.TEAM-E cell function, including Tregs and myeloid cells. We will correlate
these parameters with responses to treatment or toxicities that we observe in each patient. Overall, these studies
will inform us about the safety and feasibility of CARv3.TEAM-E cells for treating GBM, as well as provide insights
into future modifications that could improve the efficacy of these CAR-T cells or lessen their side effects.
CARv3.TEAM-E cells hold promise for improving the outcome of this dismal disease."
10979237,"There are more than 600,000 adolescent and young adult (AYA; age 15-39 at diagnosis) cancer survivors in the
U.S. The number of AYA survivors continues to grow due to both an increased cancer incidence and treatment
advances (i.e., five-year survival rates > 80%). For AYA survivors, the impacts of treatment are significant and
long-lasting, including difficult physical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue), emotional distress (e.g., anxiety,
depression), and an increased risk of long-term health problems (e.g., second cancers, early-onset
cardiovascular disease). Persistent physical symptoms and emotional distress contribute to significant social,
economic, and health burden, disrupting AYA survivors’ abilities to complete their education, achieve autonomy,
build a career, establish peer and romantic relationships, and build a family. AYA survivors report symptom
management to be a critical, unmet healthcare need; yet, there is a paucity of interventions to address their
unique needs. Following completion of cancer therapy, many AYA survivors are gradually lost to follow-up with
their oncology team while concurrently failing to establish care with health care providers who are aware of their
risks and health care needs. Barriers to follow-up care for AYAs are multifaceted, and may include survivors’
beliefs about transitioning care to and navigating health care models centered around older adults due in part to
age-specific competing demands (e.g., childcare, work, school) and the financial costs associated with care (e.g.,
being uninsured or underinsured). As a consequence, AYAs experience inadequate surveillance for late effects
and missed opportunities for symptom management and psychological support, which further perpetuates their
unmet needs. We have developed an accessible digital health intervention, AYA STEPS (Symptom Management
and Transitioning to Engagement with Post-Treatment Care for AYA Survivors), designed to enhance AYA
survivors’ abilities to manage their high symptom burden and engage in follow-up health care. Informed by the
ORBIT Model of intervention development, AYA STEPS has been systematically and rigorously developed and
refined through the PI’s prior work (K08CA245107). AYA STEPS is organized into six remotely delivered
sessions providing cognitive-behavioral and patient activation theory-based skills expected to lead to lower
symptom burden and increased health care engagement by improving AYAs’ self-efficacy for symptom
management and activation. We propose a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of AYA STEPS
compared to AYA educational information for improving symptom burden and health care engagement for AYA
survivors (N=260) who received cancer care in diverse health care settings (i.e., rural, urban, medically
underserved areas) across North Carolina. Self-efficacy and patient activation will be examined as mediators of
intervention effects. The planned study has the potential to produce clinically impactful health benefits for an
underserved and understudied group of cancer survivors who have significant symptom burden, experience
barriers to care engagement, and have limited access to AYA-specific behavioral interventions."
10981223,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR)—which involves exercise training, patient education, and health behavior
modification—is a comprehensive intervention traditionally delivered in clinic-based settings, with the highest
recommendation and level of evidence classification (i.e., Class I, Level A) for secondary prevention. Traditional
CR significantly reduces rates of reinfarction (by 47%) and both cardiac (36%) and all-cause mortality (26%) in
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) survivors, an extremely sedentary population whose functional status and
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) improve after CR participation. Despite the well-established effectiveness
of traditional CR—benefits achieved through continued program participation (i.e., adherence), fewer than 10%
of eligible ACS patients in the US who initiate CR (<30%) attend all prescribed CR sessions, with even lower
rates among racial and ethnic minoritized groups. Dismal participation in traditional CR programs and stark
utilization disparities that have endured for decades highlight the need to design nontraditional CR models (e.g.,
virtual, hybrid) and rigorously test whether such models can deliver the same quality of traditional CR while
equitably improving patient participation among diverse groups of cardiac patients. To address this need, our
group combined user-centered design (UCD) and implementation science (ImS) principles and methods to
design and test the feasibility of a telehealth-enhanced hybrid CR program (TeleheartCR; mixture of in-person,
clinic and virtual, home sessions with a telehealth platform that supports real-time monitoring and electronic
health record [EHR] data integration). This program targets patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers in a
large hospital setting that serves diverse patients. Now, we propose to conduct a single-site, single-blind, two-
arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to determine the degree to which TeleheartCR equitably improves
CR participation and clinical outcomes relative to traditional CR among ACS patients. We hypothesize that
participants allocated to TeleheartCR will demonstrate greater program adherence (% of CR sessions
completed) and non-inferior functional capacity (pre-to-post program change in six-minute walk test [6MWT]
distance) vs participants allocated to traditional CR. Both CR programs include 24 CR sessions over 3 months.
Program attendance, and a 6MWT at baseline and program completion, will be collected and extracted from the
EHR. Self-reported program acceptability, appropriateness, and HRQOL will be secondary outcomes. We will
also explore the comparative costs and cost-effectiveness (TeleheartCR vs. traditional CR), as well as whether
racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically minoritized groups particularly benefit. Findings will inform the design
and implementation of innovative hybrid delivery models to achieve equitable utilization of established
interventions in hospital settings that serve diverse patients. More broadly, if our hypotheses are supported, this
study will illustrate the power of UCD and ImS to deploy technology in the service of closing evidence-to-practice
gaps and reducing disparities in healthcare access and persistence."
10981676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this study is to identify the pathways through which poverty conditions and the early family context
contribute to persistent language disorder at age 9 years among young, low-income children. This renewal
seeks to continue to follow a sample of 311 children ascertained in the first year of life and followed to age 4
years to determine pathways through which the early family context increase susceptibility to developmental
language disorder at school entry. The study is designed to address disparities in the rate of DLD among
young children, with low-income children disproportionately affected (Norbury et al., 2017). The proposed
longitudinal study addresses three specific aims regarding low-income dyads: (1) to model the language
trajectories from ~2 to ~9 years and reading trajectories from ~5 to ~9 years for children from low-income
homes as a function of DLD status at school entry; (2) to test the Family Stress Model's applicability for
specifying the pathways through which the early home context is associated with persistent language disorder
at age 9; and (3) to test the Differential Susceptibility Theory for representing how early environmental
adversities can contribute to risk for persistent language disorder among young children with DLD. We theorize
that low-income children with DLD have heightened risk for persistent language disorder when they experience
significant adversities imposed by poverty, in particular parent psychological distress and disrupted parenting.
In our longitudinal research design, 12 assessment sessions conducted in four windows over a 5-year period
are used to comprehensively measure children's language and reading skills from 5 to 9 years. We couple
these data with robust measurement of children's early family context across five dimensions (economic
hardship, economic pressure, caregiver psychological distress, interrelationship conflict, disrupted parenting)
and children's linguistic trajectories until 54 months. The study aims are addressed using multi-level growth
models (including nonparametric modeling) and multilevel path analyses to examine the interplay among
children's language and reading trajectories, DLD status at 54 months and persistent language disorder to age
9, and the early family context."
10981148,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The US tobacco market has evolved over the past decade with declines in cigarette use coupled with increases
in the use of other tobacco products (e.g., e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, smokeless tobacco), particularly among
young adults (YAs). Sexual minority young adults (SMYAs) are a growing population disproportionately impacted
by tobacco use, as they report higher rates of current use, initiation of use, escalations in use, and fewer
successful quit attempts relative to heterosexual YAs. However, this research has historically focused on SMYAs
residing in urban areas, despite that 20% of US SMYAs reside in rural areas. This is a significant limitation, as:
1) rural YAs exhibit higher rates of tobacco use and related disease; and 2) SMYAs face unique challenges (e.g.,
mental health problems, family stress, less peer support, discrimination) that are likely amplified among those
living in rural areas due to greater community-based stigma toward SM individuals. This proposal is informed by
minority stress theory and leverages our team’s expertise in tobacco-related disparities among SMYA and
rural populations independently, as well as multiple methods, including longitudinal survey and ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) studies. The overall goal of this work is to address knowledge gaps in
prevention and cessation efforts targeting SMYAs, by assessing the intersection of rurality and sexual orientation
on use and escalations in use across a range of tobacco products, and the minority stress factors that contribute
to use disparities. The proposed study will involve a 2-year, 5-wave longitudinal survey study among 2,000
SMYAs representing rural and urban residence, as well as tobacco users, susceptible nonusers, and non-
susceptible nonusers. A subset of 150 rural and urban SMYA tobacco users will complete a 21-day EMA study
following wave 2, where they will track tobacco use and daily minority stressors to elucidate context-specific
fluctuations in tobacco use and related mechanisms in real time. We will address 2 specific aims: 1) Examine
minority stress factors (i.e., mental health problems, family stress, less peer support, discrimination) as mediators
of the associations between rural versus urban status and tobacco use outcomes (i.e., any current use, specific
product use, changes in use status/level) among SMYAs over time; and 2) Among tobacco users, examine day-
to-day and within-day fluctuations in the aforementioned minority stress factors and tobacco use outcomes, as
they occur in real time and in naturalistic settings among rural versus urban SMYAs. Led by a uniquely-poised
research team, this proposal is responsive to NIDA’s NOT-MD-22-012: Research on the Health of Sexual and
Gender Minority Populations and will be the first to elucidate mechanisms contributing to tobacco onset,
cessation, and escalations, as well as real-time influences on tobacco use at the intersection of sexual orientation
and rurality. Findings will lead to the development of targeted and culturally congruent prevention and cessation
efforts to reduce disparities among this population at disparate risk for tobacco use and related disease."

Rearrangements of genomic segments or structural variation (SVs), include changes (increase/decrease)
of copy number, inversions, translocations, and other mechanisms that change or rearrange the DNA
content of a cell. Complex SVs can mediate many constitutional diseases; highly pathological germline
rearrangements can damage the viability of the embryo; and somatic rearrangements can increase the
pathology of many diseases, including cancer.
 The genomic footprint of complex SVs is a changed karyotype, deﬁned by a collection of sequences of
oriented genomic intervals whose coordinates are drawn from a reference genome, so that every sequence
corresponds to a haploid or marker chromosome. The goal of this renewal proposal is to develop tools to
elucidate the karyotype of a donor. In Aim 1, we will develop methods to reconstruct focal ampliﬁcations
using long-read technology. In Aim 2, we will develop methods to elucidate genome scale karyotypes for
constitutional disorders using optical genome maps. Highly rearranged regions will be clariﬁed using a mix
of experiments and computation in Aim 3. Finally, in Aim 4, we will extend the notion of a karyotype to
predict the 3-dimensional conformation of ecDNA using Hi-C. The development of our aims will require
novel graph theoretic and combinatorial optimization methods applied to new sequencing technologies.
Their successful implementation will provide novel algorithms and software tools for improved karyotyping,
deeper insights into gene regulation and DNA repair for focal ampliﬁcations, and better understanding of
disease pathology mediated by complex variations."
10985723,"A preclinical therapeutic platform to develop GABAA α5 receptor positive allosteric modulators to
improve cognitive function in schizophrenia.
Cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia predicts long-term disability and
poor patient outcome and is not effectively treated with existing standard-of-care medications. Converging
evidence indicates that a primary source of this cognitive impairment is an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory
(E/I) neural responses in critical circuitry for episodic memory. In the medial temporal lobe, weakened inhibition
induces an aberrant condition of increased excitation in the hippocampus of individuals with schizophrenia.
The aim of this proposal is to develop novel therapeutics to remediate E/I imbalances to improve cognitive
function. Using a preclinical platform for drug development, the proposed research is focused on GABAA α5
receptor positive allosteric modulation (PAM) for the treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by
heightened excitation in the hippocampus. The high expression of α5-containing GABAA receptors in the
hippocampus, which mediate tonic inhibition, could be ideal for controlling excitation in this circuitry. We will
use a series of small molecules with high potency and selectivity for GABAA α5 receptors and PAM activity at
the α5 subunit that have met preclinical in vitro and in vivo drug discovery criteria with potential for translational
development as therapeutic agents. The current proposed studies will advance this drug development platform
to test the efficacy of two GABAA α5 receptor PAMs to improve hippocampal-dependent cognition in a
preparation of hippocampal overactivity in rodents. The studies will also assess efficacy by using fiber
photometry to monitor neural hyperexcitation in the hippocampal formation during in vivo testing. Together,
these studies establish a foundation for a preclinical small molecule drug development program to remediate
E/I imbalances underlying cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatry."
10985482,"Project Summary/Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disorder
characterized by narrowing and remodeling of the distal arterioles. Current treatment options are unable to
prevent disease progression, leading to a median survival time of five years after diagnosis. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to develop new disease-modifying therapies. Increased pulmonary blood flow is known to
stimulate vascular remodeling in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and after major lung resection,
although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Patients with left-to-right shunts such as ventricular septal defects
and atrioventricular canal defects are at high risk for PAH. A “second hit” in the context of pulmonary
overcirculation, such as hypoxia, may lead to irreversible vascular remodeling and disease progression. Current
rodent models of flow-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) such as the left pneumonectomy and SUGEN rat
do not fully recapitulate patients' physiological conditions. To improve patient outcomes, animal models more
representative of patients are needed, along with a better understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms.
 My goal is to generate a novel animal model to study flow-induced PH. Establishing a murine model of
PH that mimics patients with CHD will enable the development of therapeutics capable of reversing flow-induced
vascular remodeling. The second goal of this proposal is to discover key insights into the response of smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) to vascular remodeling from increased pulmonary blood flow. Specifically, the aims of this
proposal are to 1. Develop a new mouse model of flow-induced PH that better represents patients' physiological
conditions, 2. Describe the contribution and underlying mechanisms in which SMCs contribute to shear stress-
induced vascular remodeling, and 3. Discover novel therapeutic approaches for patients with PAH-CHD."
10985437,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
To improve outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the genetic propensities for developing
post-operative atrial fibrillation (poAF) will be assessed utilizing atrial tissue acquired during the
surgical procedure. Roughly 30% of patients who present for cardiac surgery in normal sinus rhythm
will experience poAF, making it the most common complication after cardiac surgery. Patients that
experience poAF are more likely to suffer a number of adverse outcomes, including additional time in
the ICU, increased risk of stroke, and increased all-cause 30-day and 6-month mortality. Thus,
evidence suggests that poAF itself contributes to poor patient outcomes following cardiac surgery.
A number of labs have identified genetic variants associated with both ambulatory AF and poAF, but
despite these genetic insights, the biological mechanisms underlying its development have not been
established. This is largely because human left atrial tissue has not been comprehensively
characterized in this context. Previous work has demonstrated that gene transcription in atrial tissue
is altered in patients with poAF, relative to those without, and that genetic variants markedly influence
transcriptional responses in this tissue. Proposed experiments build upon this work, examining both
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of poAF using left atrial samples collected from a carefully
selected cohort of 200 patients primarily of European origin who are in normal sinus rhythm as they
undergo cardiac surgery. Molecular comparisons of tissue-specific RNA expression and DNA
methylation (Aim 1), analysis of quantitative trait loci of poAF (Aim 2), and functional validation in
cardiomyocytes (Aim 3) will then be made between patients who subsequently do and do not develop
poAF, testing the global hypothesis that DNA, RNA, and methylation changes in the human left atrium
contribute to the development of poAF. By characterizing the transcriptome and methylome of left
atrial tissue from cardiac surgery patients and using whole-genome genotyping, we will be able to
identify both the gene expression differences that predispose individuals to poAF, and the genetic
variants that underlie this predisposition.
Successful completion of this study will advance biological knowledge of poAF by validating existing
targets, identifying novel predictors and novel pathways, describing the tissue-specific expression and
methylation pattern in the human left atrium and its association with poAF, and identifying new
pharmacological targets for the prevention and treatment of poAF. Resulting insights could potentially
benefit both surgery and non-surgery AF patients, thereby improving the lives of millions of patients."
10986882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts millions of Americans each year and can lead to cognitive dysfunction,
difficulty with sensory processing, sleep disruption, and the development of epilepsy. One common neural
outcome of TBI is the development of electrophysiological abnormalities that can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy
(PTE) or disruptions in sleep architecture. However, the mechanisms by which these neurological deficits arise
as a consequence of TBI remain poorly understood.
Preliminary evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to the electrophysiological abnormalities that
underlie PTE and sleep disruption in a mouse model of moderate TBI. Indeed, TBI is characterized by both the
activation of glial cells like astrocytes and microglia and by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells like
monocyte-derived macrophages and T-cells. While neuroinflammation occurs immediately in the cortical region
of acute injury, secondary neuroinflammation develops slowly in the ipsilateral thalamus, presumably as a result
of loss of intimate reciprocal connections between cortex and thalamus. Because the cortico-thalamo- cortical
(CTC) circuit plays a key role in cognition, sleep, and seizures, which are all impacted by TBI, the delayed neural
plasticity in this circuit is a good model for teasing apart the interaction between the immune cells and neural
circuits after TBI.
The role of peripheral immune cells is particularly understudied in the context of TBI-derived electrophysiological
deficits like PTE and sleep disruption. Here we use a controlled-cortical impact mouse model of moderate TBI
to determine the role of delayed infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and CD4+ T cells in secondary
neuronal loss (Aim 1), excitation/inhibition imbalance in the cortico-thalamic circuit (Aim 2), and the development
of electrographic abnormalities such as sleep disruption and PTE (Aim 3). To do so, we combine cutting-edge
tools from both neuroscience and immunology, including genetic manipulations, flow cytometry, 3D imaging of
immune-neural interactions, synaptic physiology in brain slices, and chronic wireless EEG recordings.
This study will enable us to understand how the immune system interacts with neural circuits after TBI to cause
the development of neurological deficits.
During the work proposed in this supplement request, Ms. Chatterjee will be involved in a team project that
focuses on the neurobiology of TBI, and will study the role of CD4+ T cells in cognitive, motor and sensory
behavioral deficits using a cutting-edge deep learning approach. Ms. Chatterjee will also participate in the
Post-Bac Program for Equity and Learning (PROPEL) curriculum activities, on which PI Jeanne Paz serves as
a mentor. Through PROPEL, Ms. Chatterjee will participate in career development programs."
10987840,"Co-occurring anxiety is prevalent in more than 50% of individuals with Opioid use disorder (OUD). This is of
major concern as safe and effective treatment options are lacking for this high-risk population. Anxiety in those
with OUD is linked to earlier and more rapid progression of OUD, and high probability of co-use of other
substances, particularly GABAA receptor positive modulators, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are
currently the standard of care treatment for fast-acting relief for general anxiety and panic disorder. Although
highly effective in the short-term, BZDs represent amajor, but often overlookedcontributorto the opioid overdose
epidemic. BZDs are involved in an estimated 12,000 overdose fatalities each year in the US, largely due to the
concomitant use with other CNS depressants, such as opioids. In fact, more than 90%of BZD overdose fatalities
involve opioids and up to 30% opioid overdoses involve BZDs. Additionally, BZD prescription rates are directly
linked to opioid overdose rates per state. With a lack of safe alternatives that can offer comparable efficacy, BZD
market predictions indicate their use will remain steady or increase globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop safe and comparably effective alternatives to BZDs for those with OUD. We have discovered a novel
series of promising synthetic GABAAR active molecules Our lead molecule, RU-EC2-118, is a partial GABAAR
PAM with nanomolar potency at GABAAR subtypes and high oral bioavailability. Our in vivo studies in rodent

Sexual minority youth report significantly higher rates of past year suicidal ideation (19.4%-30.3%) and suicide
attempts (6.6%-22.7%), as compared with heterosexual students (9.3% and 3.8%, respectively). Theoretical
models of suicide and the interventions they inform have been developed with limited representation of sexual
minority populations, thereby limiting their relevance for sexual minority youth. We will be the first to make use
of a rigorous, multi-method, ethnographic approach, called Cultural Consensus Modeling (CCM), to leverage
rich qualitative data on sexual minority youth (ages 15-25 years) and their motivations for suicide, to develop
models and assessment tools generated specifically from these motivations. We will then evaluate cultural
models for their association with more traditional suicide predictors derived from IPTS (perceived
burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, acquired capability). Guided by a conceptual framework that
integrates the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) and minority stress theory, our central
hypothesis is that derived cultural models will point to the importance of redefining IPTS variables through the
lens of minority stress. The CCM methodology is iterative in nature with initial study phases informing
subsequent phases, verifying and further testing derived cultural models. Aim 1 will recruit 50 sexual minority
youth (ages 15-25 years) with a past-year history of suicidal ideation. Making use of “free listing” CCM
methodology, youth will be asked to identify risk factors (common reasons) for suicidal thoughts and behaviors
among peer sexual minority youth. We hypothesize that sexual minority youth will generate IPTS-related
motivations for suicide as well as motivations related to minority stress. Aim 2 will recruit a new sample of 100
at-risk sexual minority youth who will rate the culture-relevance of factors generated in Aim 1 on a 5-point
Likert scale. This process identifies unique clusters of individuals (cultural consensus models) who place
greater importance on particular factors and we hypothesize that more than one cultural consensus model will
emerge. Aim 3 will utilize a subset of participants (N=30) who completed Aim 2 to represent each identified
cultural model. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to gather in-depth information on each cultural model.
Informed by the results of Aims 1-3, Aim 4 will recruit a new sample of 200 at-risk sexual minority youth,
alongside measures of IPTS and minority stress/discrimination to test the hypotheses that (1) cultural models
will map well onto own reasons for suicidal thoughts and behaviors; (2) cultural models will align with individual
differences in IPTS and minority stress/discrimination, and that (3) models that align with minority
stress/discrimination will most strongly predict suicide severity, pointing to the importance of redefining IPTS
variables through the lens of minority stress theory. The proposed work responds to urgent calls for research
on the risk factors for suicidal behaviors in sexual minority youth and will, for the first time, provide empirically
derived treatment targets for culturally relevant treatment adaptation of suicide prevention programs"

Deciding to self-initiate social interaction (i.e., proactive social behavior) depends on many variables: the social
context, our social partner, and our hormonal state. Gonadal hormones impact social behavior primarily by
regulating neural gene expression across a network of interconnected, subcortical brain regions. Further,
behavior itself can lead to changes in hormone levels, indicating behavior and hormonal state exist in an ongoing
feedback loop. Many mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, exhibit profound sex differences, which
relate to hormonal state and interact with social behavior dysfunction. Critically, proactive social behavior can
increase resiliency to these disorders. Unraveling the neuroendocrine mechanisms that promote proactive social
behavior is a critical step toward identifying the etiology of mood disorder-associated social dysfunction.
Recent work by the candidate demonstrates two neural populations of this subcortical network interact to
regulate the proactive seeking of social interaction. However, we do not know how hormone-sensitive
populations across this distributed network interact to encode proactive social behavior and related social
variables (context, partner), nor do we understand the impact of hormonal change on this encoding. The goal
of this proposal is to comprehensively map the influence of gonadal hormones on network-level coding of
proactive social behavior and related variables (context, partner), and identify sites of in vivo hormonal action.
Here, the candidate develops new methods for computational analysis of social behavior and new optical tools
for recording neural activity across multiple brain regions in socially interacting mice. The candidate leverages
these tools to map mouse social behavior (Aim 1) and network-wide neural coding across a change in hormonal
state (Aim 2). In the independent phase of the project, the candidate combines the tools developed in this
proposal with a novel fluorescent reporter to “close” the feedback loop by recording the dynamics of social
experience-dependent, hormone-mediated neural gene transcription across a hormone-sensitive brain network
(Aim 3). This project will provide a new mechanistic understanding of how hormonal changes, neural function,
and social behavior interact and provide key insights into how these behaviors go awry in mood disorders.
This proposal brings together an experienced team of mentors and collaborators with ideal expertise for the
work. This team will provide critical training for the candidates short- and long-term success, including in systems
and computational neuroscience, behavior quantification, and neuroendocrinology. This diverse expertise will
allow the candidate to develop a computational neuroendocrinology research program that applies systems
neuroscience techniques to pressing questions in neuroendocrinology. The proposed training program combines
technical research training with formal mentorship and professional development. The goals outlined in the
proposal build on the candidate’s existing skillset and interests to assist the candidate in a successful transition
to independence leading a laboratory with a novel computational neuroendocrinology focus."
10985546,"Project Summary/Abstract
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was developed in the 1950’s as a treatment option for life-
threatening malignant and non-malignant diseases. The process involves high dose chemoradiotherapy followed
by intravenous infusion of a donor allograft with the intention of correcting hematopoietic defects or achieving a
graft-versus-malignancy effect. While overall survival has improved, HCT can lead to severe pulmonary injury
due to infection, alloreactivity, or direct chemotherapy toxicity to the lung. Excessive or chronic injury can lead to
pulmonary fibrosis (PF), which is associated with morbidity and premature mortality. The biology of PF involves
inflammation, TGFβ signaling, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but additional mechanisms may contribute
in the setting of HCT. An expanding array of molecules are being developed to target PF, thus opening the door
to clinical testing in the pediatric HCT population. However, strategies to select ideal candidates for specific
therapies are currently lacking, precluding children from advances in the field. Therefore, the goal of this R03
proposal is to enhance our ability to identify and treat pediatric HCT patients with or at-risk for PF. To do this, we
will leverage bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and paired blood samples obtained from pediatric HCT patients.
In Specific Aim 1, we will determine which patients have PF at the time of BAL based on biopsy, pulmonary
function tests, and chest imaging. We will then identify BAL transcriptomic and proteomic signatures that differ
among patients with vs without PF while accounting for important clinical differences. We will repeat these
comparisons using paired blood samples to see if BAL signatures can be identified using a more readily testable
sample type. In Specific Aim 2, we will follow patients without PF at the time of BAL for 12 months. We will
determine which patients go on to develop PF. We will then compare transcriptomic and proteomic signatures
from the original BAL and blood samples to identify predictors of the future development of PF. Through these
aims, we will gain insight into PF pathobiology in this high risk population. These data will then facilitate early
identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from the rapidly growing pipeline of novel anti-fibrotic
therapies. Overall, this work may increase the safety and accessibility of allogeneic HCT as a treatment for
numerous life-threatening pediatric diseases."

Contraceptive autonomy – people’s ability to decide for themselves what they want in regard to contraceptive
use, and to realize that decision – is essential for reproductive health and wellbeing. The primary goal of this
proposal is to develop, refine, and test a contraceptive autonomy indicator that measures the extent to which
family planning programs respect and promote free, full, and informed contraceptive decision-making. The
longer-term objective of this research is to incorporate a concise survey module for this indicator into existing
population-based surveys for routine, standardized, and comparable monitoring across time and place.
Improved measurement of contraceptive autonomy can create new health systems incentives for respectful,
rights-based family planning.
Specific aims of this project include 1) Developing a novel contraceptive autonomy indicator that maximizes
information and minimizes respondent burden via formal psychometric analysis of novel survey data from
Burkina Faso; 2) Assessing the transportability of “contraceptive autonomy” across diverse sociocultural
contexts; and 3) Test and refine the updated autonomy indicator in Nepal and Kenya with cognitive interviews.
To meet Aim 1, the PI will use a first-of-its-kind dataset from Burkina Faso with novel survey questions on
informed contraceptive decision-making, full access to a broad contraceptive method mix, and free
contraceptive choice. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, the PI will collaborate with leading researchers in Nepal and
Kenya to collect new data, using semi-structured in-depth and cognitive interviews with a diverse sample of
women to understand how notions of autonomy differ across context, and gather pilot data to inform a future
multi-site validation study.
The goal of the training and career development portion of this grant is to foster the independent research
career of Dr. Leigh Senderowicz. Dr. Senderowicz is an emerging scholar of patient-centered family planning
and global health metrics. With the guidance of mentors Dr. Daniel Bolt, Dr. Jenny Higgins, Dr. Corinne Rocca
and Dr. Claire Wendland, Dr. Senderowicz will pursue a program of training in latent variable modeling,
transnational comparative qualitative analysis, survey scale-up and research translation, and professional
development at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These training activities will grow her methodological
repertoire and enhance her career as an independent reproductive health scholar. The proposed research is
poised to make a substantial impact on global reproductive health, helping to expose reproductive health
disparities, and provide new data to inform equitable, person-centered reproductive health programs."

The development of vaccines is one of the greatest success stories of biomedical research. Vaccines exploit the
remarkable capability of the immune system to recognize pathogens, develop memory and upon re-exposure
quickly mount an immune response that culminates with elimination of the pathogen. Vaccines are typically
injected intramuscularly and provide long-term systemic immunity. However, they are less efficient at generating
immunity at the site of infection: mucosal surfaces. With poor mucosal immunity, vaccinated individuals can still
become infected and transmit disease, thereby reducing the herd immunity benefits of a vaccine program. The
microbial communities that inhabit our mucosal surfaces elicit precise immune responses upon colonization –
without inflammation, and across an intact tissue barrier. I propose to develop a novel and unconventional
mucosal vaccine strategy that leverages the extraordinary capability of the commensal microbiota to induce
precise and long-term immunity at mucosal surfaces. In addition to their efficacy, commensal vaccines promise
to be inexpensive and lend themselves to needle-free and cold-chain-free formulations that enable deployment
in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, this project will uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning
the intimate relationship established between commensal microbes and their host over millions of years of
coevolution and harness this knowledge to develop new vaccine strategies against pathogens.
To achieve this goal, I will exploit commensal microbes that colonize the skin, where microbiome intervention is
much more accessible. To gain a broad understanding of the immune responses elicited by the microbiota in the
skin, I will study the B cell response to prevalent skin commensal microbes (Aim 1). I will profile the B cell
response to a newly identified B cell antigen derived from a ubiquitous skin commensal and generate a new
monoclonal mouse model to study the molecular interplay between the skin microbiota and B cells (Aim 2). I will
engineer skin commensal microbes to elicit potent B cell responses against pathogens (Aim 3). Overall, this
project will 1) uncover the B cell response to skin commensal microbes, 2) generate new technologies to probe
commensal-specific immunity at the skin barrier and 3) develop a new mucosal vaccination strategy.
To achieve my long-term career goal of developing novel technologies to study commensal-immune interactions
and creating commensal-based therapies, I have assembled an outstanding group of mentors who complement
my training in mucosal immunology and biochemistry: Dr. Michael Fischbach (primary mentor, microbiology and
bacterial genetics), Dr. Yasmine Belkaid (co-mentor, skin immunology and bacterial models of infection), Dr.
Gabriel Victora (advisor/collaborator, B cell biology and viral models of infection) and Dr. Christopher Barnes
(advisor/collaborator, vaccinology). The training I will receive during the K99/R00 award will accelerate my
transition into an independent position and allow me to establish a cutting-edge research group of my own."

Candidate: Sriram Ramgopal, MD is a pediatric emergency medicine physician and early career clinical
investigator focused on improving the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among children in
the acute care setting. Dr. Ramgopal’s long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-
investigator focused on improving the health outcomes of children with common infectious emergencies using
predictive analytics, informatics, and implementation science approaches. Research Context/Objective: CAP
is the second most common reason for hospitalization and the second most costly pediatric condition to treat
among children in the United States. The diagnosis of CAP is complicated by a lack of data driven tools and
overlapping presenting features with other common respiratory conditions, resulting in overuse, and
occasionally underuse, of chest radiographs (CXR) and antibiotics. There are a paucity of validated tools to
guide the diagnosis of children with suspected CAP. To address this knowledge and practice gap, the
objectives of this proposal are to develop a clinical prediction model for CAP using electronic health record
(EHR) data, validate a prediction model for CAP, and develop a prototype clinical decision support (CDS)
system for CAP. Specific Aims: 1) Derive and internally validate a prediction model for the diagnosis of CAP
using an EHR registry; 2) determine how a prediction model for pediatric CAP will be implemented as a CDS
system in routine clinical practice using implementation science and human-centered design methods; and 3)
prospectively evaluate the performance of clinical and EHR-based prediction models for CAP. Research Plan:
Dr. Ramgopal will perform a retrospective cohort study using data from a harmonized, high-resolution pediatric
emergency department registry to develop a prediction model to identify the risk of CAP in children. He will
lead co-design sessions to develop a CDS system prototype using implementation science approaches, and
externally validate three clinical prediction rules for CAP within a pediatric emergency department. Career
Development Plan/Environment: Through a combination of local and national didactic activities, experiential
learning, workshops, seminars, professional activities, and coursework, Dr. Ramgopal will acquire expertise in
clinical informatics, predictive analytics, and implementation science methodology. Dr. Ramgopal is supported
by an experienced, multidisciplinary team of NIH-funded mentors, advisors, and collaborators with expertise in
lower respiratory tract infections, prediction modeling, machine learning, and implementation science. Dr.
Ramgopal will meet regularly with his mentors individually, and quarterly as a full committee, to ensure
completion of all research and training benchmarks. The institutional commitment to researchers at
Northwestern University and Lurie Children’s Hospital provide an outstanding infrastructure to enable a
successful award and ensure Dr. Ramgopal’s development into an independent clinician-scientist."
10986782,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 2 million people in the United States who have intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) engage in
some form of problem behavior such as self-injury and aggression. Problem behavior is a major cause of
suffering for these individuals and their caregivers, and adversely impacts society as a whole. Problem behavior
increases caregivers' burden and strains healthcare and other service systems, as individuals who engage in
problem behavior can require prolonged separation from caregivers and community through residential or
hospital treatment. Behavioral treatments can be an effective means to treat problem behavior. One of the most
common behavioral treatments is differential reinforcement of alternative behavior, frequently implemented as
functional communication training. Most demonstrations of behavioral treatments, including functional
communication training, are conducted in highly controlled settings by trained therapists. When these treatments
are implemented in community settings (e.g., an individual's home) by caregivers, they will be challenged, which
can lead to the recurrence and sustained relapse of problem behavior. Recurrence and relapse can be the first
steps in a chain that leads to treatment failure. Fortunately, some tactics have been designed to sustain treatment
effectiveness and mitigate two forms of relapse (resurgence and renewal) that result from two of three primary
treatment challenges. These tactics function as inoculation (i.e., make problem behavior less likely to return).
However, there are no tactics designed to specifically mitigate a third form of relapse: reinstatement
This project involves a novel inoculation tactic to mitigate reinstatement and protect against the third common
treatment challenge: extinction errors. The tactic in question is based on substantial conceptual and empirical
evidence from behavioral economics, as well as our pilot work. The project uses an innovative translational-
treatment model to better understand which of the proposed tactics (our novel tactic or the default standard-of-
care approach) better inoculates against extinction errors through real-world analogues. The use of a
translational-treatment model is consistent with other research examining the role of basic processes in
behavioral treatment when collateral effects are unknown, and will also engender a thorough examination of the
proposed tactics.
In Aim 1, we will establish a proxy response, apply treatment to that proxy response, and examine the
effectiveness of progressive ratio training in inoculating against extinction errors and mitigating response-
dependent reinstatement. In Aim 2, we will establish a proxy response, apply treatment to that proxy response,
and examine the effectiveness of progressive ratio training in inoculating against extinction errors and mitigating
response-independent reinstatement. Outcomes of this research could improve the current standard of care for
behavioral treatments to make them more effective in community application, result in the development and
validation of novel inoculation tactics, and significantly improve the lives of individuals with IDD."

Project Summary/Abstract
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US; there were 43
million HPV infections in the US in 2018 and most of those infections were in teens and young adults. Though
many infections may resolve on their own, persistent infection with HPV can cause cervical cancer and other
types of cancers. The HPV vaccine is a critical tool for preventing HPV infection but has been underutilized in
the US to date. HPV Vaccine completion remains well below the Healthy People 2030 targets of 80% vaccine
completion for adolescents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccinating children ages 11-12 with two doses of HPV vaccine
6-12 months apart; the ACIP also recommends catch-up vaccination for unvaccinated adolescents and adults
up to age 26, with three doses of vaccine. The college student population represents an important group for
catch-up vaccination as many students have insurance coverage, have access to student health services, and
are beginning to make their own health decisions. However, recent surveys indicate that only about half of
college students report they have completed HPV vaccination. College health centers are an ideal setting in
which to identify teens and young adults who have not yet completed HPV vaccination. Offering HPV vaccine
to unvaccinated or under-vaccinated students is an important public health intervention to reduce the burden of
HPV infection and its future health consequences. The aim of the proposed mixed methods study is to better
understand college healthcare providers' attitudes, beliefs and practices related to HPV vaccination and
identify their barriers and facilitators to vaccinating college students. There is limited information about college
healthcare provider practices related to HPV vaccine (assessing HPV vaccination history, recommending and
offering vaccine). We propose a sequential explanatory mixed methods study that will examine healthcare
provider attitudes and beliefs and the multi-level influences of healthcare provider practices related to HPV
vaccine. The study utilizes quantitative data regarding college healthcare providers' HPV vaccine-related
attitudes and behaviors/practices from a national study of college healthcare providers from 480 colleges
across the US. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we will conduct
follow-up interviews with a subsample of college healthcare providers who participated in the national survey to
explore individual provider-level (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, beliefs) and multisystem-level factors (e.g., college
type, state policies, organizational climate, relative priority, change capacity) influencing HPV vaccine uptake in
the college health setting. The long-term goal of this research is to generate new knowledge regarding factors
affecting HPV vaccine uptake in college health settings and to inform future interventions to improve HPV
vaccination rates in the college student population.

It is well established that racial disparities in HIV care outcomes and use of substances among sexual minority
men (SMM) of color persist because of structural racism in Los Angeles County (LAC). Furthermore, we know
accessible, comprehensive, and culturally congruent healthcare is key to achieving racial equity in HIV and
substance use (SU) outcomes. Preliminary research, including our own studies, indicate major barriers to care
include hard to reach locations of HIV and SU care, transportation challenges across large urban settings such
as LAC, and lack of congruence with HIV care staff. While research shows that healthcare access is important,
there are mixed responses of where Black and Latinx SMM (BLSMM) prefer to receive care. These findings
underscore the need for healthcare experiences that address geographic challenges and are culturally
appropriate. Understanding how structural racism influences how BLSMM navigate the geography of LAC to
receive SU and HIV care and how peer case managers, with racial and SU congruence, may enhance access
to care will provide novel insights into the relationship between racism and HIV and SU treatment. We propose
research and adaptation of an evidence-based intervention LINK-LA built on an established NIDA-funded
cohort of BLSMM, The mSTUDY (U01DA036267), and preliminary findings of an R21 on spatial connections
conducted by this multi-disciplinary research team (DA049643). Using intersectional anti-racism frameworks
the Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCR) and the socio-ecological model of health and mixed methods,
we will interrogate how 1) historical racist practices influence unequal spatial patterns and how such unequal
structural factors are associated with distinct patterns of movement across social and geographic space among
BLSMM in LAC and how these patterns influence where people with HIV (PWH) elect to receive care; (2) and
how peer case managers who bring access to services and support to participants in the neighborhoods of
their choice in LAC enhances use of services, their contextual outcomes, and HIV and SU outcomes by
adapting an EBI Link-LA. Our proposed study directly fits with NIDA’s Racial Equity Initiative (REI). The
proposed study will extend ongoing collaborations between the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA),
the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) team, and will be co-led by the Los Angeles LGBT Center
resulting in a community-based research program design that is directly informed by and responsive to
community needs. This collaborative team of scientists includes MPIs across all three career levels and
community-based practitioners that represent an intentionally interdisciplinary and comprehensive response to
RFA-DA-23-061. Findings will be used to establish enhanced healthcare delivery models that improve racial

The proposed HIV Comorbidities Research Training (HIV-ComRT) in Ghana builds and expands on our
ongoing successful short-term (8 weeks) summer intensive mentored-research training—the Ghana Research
Scholar Program—at Yale for trainees from Ghana since 2007. The aim of the Ghana Research Scholar
Program is to build and strengthen biomedical research capacity in Ghana; this aim dovetails with the
overarching aim of the Funding Opportunity Announcement (PAR-19-283; Fogarty HIV Research Training
Program for LMIC Institutions). The components and content of the training program were informed by a
consultative need assessment with faculty and leadership at the University of Ghana (UG) and other
stakeholders in Ghana (Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, and National AIDS Control Program). We
will recruit trainees with MD, Master's, or PhD degrees and equip them with theoretical and applied knowledge
in research methods, skills in designing and conducting research studies, and life-long career coaching to be
successful investigators in HIV-associated comorbidities and coinfections in Ghana. The formal program of
each trainee will vary, depending on his/her prior training and current career plans. The predominant site for
training, either at UG or Yale, will depend on the needs of the trainee, however, all trainees will be exposed to
resources at both institutions. We will provide trainees with: (1) a strong foundation in both research design
and analytic techniques appropriate for clinical, translational, and laboratory-based research; (2) the ability to
conceptualize and analyze research problems critically and with increasing independence; (3) experience in
scientific writing, presenting and publishing research findings; (4) instruction in management of laboratory and
clinical projects; and (5) mentorship in research and career development. These will be achieved through three
Specific Aims: (1) to provide trainees and other junior faculty at UG with theoretical and applied knowledge in
research methods; (2) to equip trainees with research skills through a two-year intensive and mentored
postdoctoral research training in HIV; and (3) to establish and maintain a mentorship plan for trainees at UG to
become independently funded investigators. During the 5-year grant period, we expect to enroll 14 trainees in
advanced degrees (four PhDs and ten Master's (MSc or MPH)) and provide a two-year intensive postdoctoral
research training for five postdocs/junior faculty. In addition, about 200 graduate students, postdoc fellows,
junior faculty, and research scientists at UG will benefit from the research and career development workshops.
The cohort of trainees will have diverse research interests to ensure that we build capacity in team science in
executing cross- and inter-disciplinary research in HIV-associated comorbidities and coinfections. The skills
that they gain through our program of focused didactic training, interactions with a diverse group of scholars in
a multidisciplinary academic community, and a mentored research experience with outstanding scientists (at

10987922,"Abstract
The overall goal of this line of research is to examine the psychosocial, ethical, and clinical implications of
incidental medical findings of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in healthy volunteer hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
donors. The proposed project focuses on feasibility. CH refers to the presence of mutations acquired during a
person's lifetime in the hematopoietic stem cells. CH in healthy individuals is not considered a disease state,
although it is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, increased risk for hematologic
malignancies, and lower survival rates. Currently, most people become aware of CH as an incidental finding
during workup for another disease. Many clinical questions about CH remain, including whether (1) different
CH mutations are associated with different long-term health outcomes, (2) there is mutation frequency
threshold associated with increased risks, and (3) there are any modifiable/lifestyle factors that alter the risks
associated with CH. This proposal presents a unique opportunity to assess the psychosocial, clinical, and
ethical implications of identifying incidental CH findings among healthy hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors
at the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), which manages the largest worldwide registry of individuals
who have volunteered to donate to unrelated patients in need of HSC transplants. After stem cell transplant,
CH that originated from the donor may be identified in recipients. The NMDP recently formalized a process for
notifying donors with potential CH. This investigation will evaluate the feasibility of tracking the psychosocial
impact and clinical markers among this otherwise healthy group of donors. Specifically, we will (1) qualitatively
examine the psychosocial impact of receiving information about incidental medical findings in a group of
recent HSC donors by conducting a series of focus groups (N=30-40; Aim 1), (2) demonstrate the feasibility of
conducting longitudinal structured health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) telephone interviews with HSC
donors diagnosed with CH (N=30; Aim 2), and (3) demonstrate the feasibility of prospectively tracking clinical
markers (in blood, stool, and calcium scores) in HSC donors diagnosed with CH (N=30; Aim 3). This
investigation is significant because it will lay the groundwork for a larger investigation of incidental findings of
CH and will have implications for how such findings are communicated to individuals receiving this
information through standard health screenings. The investigation is innovative because it (1) will be the first
to investigate CH in a healthy donor population, (2) presents a unique, low-resource, low-burden opportunity
to identify individuals with CH, (3) focuses on potential psychosocial issues in the delivery of incidental
findings to healthy donors, and (4) demonstrates our ability to collect longitudinal clinical marker information
from a young, healthy cohort. Findings from this study will lead directly to a larger investigation of incidental
findings in this healthy donor group, which will have implications not only for HSC donors, but for a broad
range of healthy and ill individuals in whom incidental medical findings are discovered."

Post-Partum Women with OUD
ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
From 2010 to 2017, opioid-related maternal deaths increased by 220%. Drug overdose deaths,
par�cularly deaths involving synthe�c opioids like fentanyl, reached record highs in 2020 and 2021; drug
overdose is now a leading cause of pregnancy-associated mortality in the United States, especially
among women of color and those living in rural areas. During pregnancy, u�liza�on of medica�ons for
the treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) (buprenorphine or methadone) have been associated with
improvements in prenatal care adherence and pregnancy outcomes, including lower rates of preterm
birth and low birth weight and reduc�ons in maternal relapse and overdose. Prior research has iden�ﬁed
health dispari�es in MOUD ini�a�on, consistent u�liza�on, and treatment adherence among
underserved pregnant and postpartum people with OUD. However, recent na�onal trends in pregnancy-
associated overdose mortality are under-characterized, and there is a need to beter understand key
facilitators and barriers to treatment engagement for these under-served women with OUD.
This proposal seeks supplemental funds to u�lize the inves�gators and resources of the CTN0080 study
to conduct research to address overdose preven�on and learn about persistent barriers to treatment
among Hispanic, Black, and Na�ve American pregnant and post-partum (PP) women, as well as PP
women living in rural areas of the US. The CTN is currently suppor�ng CTN0080, a large mul�-site clinical
trial (13 sites) led by Dr. T. John Winhusen of the CTN Ohio Valley Node that evaluates the compara�ve
eﬀec�veness of buprenorphine formula�ons in PP women. This proposal requests supplemental funding
to conduct four projects that will target opioid overdose preven�on, as well as learn about barriers and
facilitators regarding treatment engagement in PP women, especially PP of color and living in rural areas.

10987198,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Auditory hallucinations (AH) are experienced by approximately 60-80% of individuals with
schizophrenia (SZ), and are often associated with significant distress and functional disability. Many individuals
who experience these symptoms do not respond adequately to standard treatments with antipsychotic
medication, and/or experience adverse side effects from these treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to
better understand AH pathophysiology to inform the development of novel, targeted interventions. Recent
mechanistic models of psychosis suggest that AH may result from a pathological overweighting of expectations
relative to bottom-up sensory signals during perception, and that lower-level sensory processing impairments
in SZ may contribute to this pathology. Therefore, the goal of the proposed project is to investigate these
potential AH mechanisms by leveraging recent advances in the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to index
hierarchical processing of natural speech. The specific aims are to evaluate whether AH in SZ are associated
with: 1) impaired auditory processing of speech stimuli; and 2) alterations in the effects of prior knowledge
regarding speech content on the auditory processing of speech. Fifty-six SZ participants will be recruited,
specifically 28 with AH (AH+) and 28 without AH (AH-), along with a group of 28 matched healthy control
participants (HC). EEG will be recorded as participants listen to speech segments that are either unaltered or
acoustically degraded. EEG responses will be modeled to derive indices of auditory encoding of speech.
Measures of the effects of prior knowledge will be based on the lexical predictability of narrative speech, and
the manipulation of prior knowledge regarding the content of degraded speech. It is hypothesized that AH in
SZ will be associated with impaired auditory encoding of speech and a greater influence of prior knowledge on
this encoding, and that within AH+, these two alterations will be related. Results will provide data on
unanswered questions regarding AH mechanisms, and will be used to support an NIH grant proposal of a
larger, well-powered investigation of AH pathophysiology in psychotic disorders and of potential subgroups
with regard to underlying pathology. This work has the potential to inform the identification of novel therapeutic
targets for AH, along with biomarkers of underlying pathology that can be used to identify subgroups most
likely to benefit from particular intervention strategies. Given the significant unmet therapeutic need this line of
work aims to address, and its relevance to transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychosis and mechanistic
heterogeneity within diagnostic categories, these efforts are consistent with the public health mission of NIMH
and its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative."
10980273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are responsible for
significant morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs in the USA. This problem will continue to grow due to
the diabetes epidemic as people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and less
likely to have favorable treatment outcomes. Endovascular therapies such as placement of a metal stent that
has been dilated by a balloon will open the blockage and restore blood flow. However, these therapies are
plagued by relatively high restenosis rates, which have been attributed to the permanent presence of the stent.
Polymeric bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVSs) have emerged as a potential solution to these problems by
providing initial support to prevent recoil and slowly degrading to restore vasomotion and eliminate residual
foreign materials that may contribute to restenosis. However, polymeric BVSs are difficult to fabricate (making
them costly with limited design control) and are made from polymers such as poly(L-lactide) that are
thrombogenic and cause oxidative tissue damage resulting in exacerbated inflammation. In addition, as in the
case of the FDA-approved BVS Absorb GT1 from Abbott Vascular, the strut thickness has to be greater than
150 μm for the scaffold to have sufficient strength to prevent vessel recoil and to accommodate a polymer
coating that contains an anti-restenotic drug to prevent stent re-occlusion. Clinical studies suggest that this
strut thickness, which is 2 times larger than that of bare metal stents, leads to a high incidence of thrombosis in
small-diameter arteries (<2.5 mm) and major adverse cardiac events, limiting the wide spread use of these
devices due to their large profile. The Ameer and Sun research teams have been developing a liquid citrate-
based biomaterial (CBB) that is compatible with a 3D printing technique referred to as micro continuous liquid
interface production (μCLIP). CBBs, which are degradable, have been shown to be thromboresistant and
antioxidant. These properties are desirable for vascular stents. The objective of this research proposal is to
develop radiopaque, low-profile, drug-eluting, biocompatible and mechanically functional citrate-based BVS.
We hypothesize that a low-profile citrate-based BVS fabricated via μCLIP will perform as well as the Abbott
drug-eluting Xcience BVS in vivo. The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize, in vitro and in vivo in a standard
swine model, low-profile, fluoroscopically visible BVSs fabricated using μCLIP, and 2) Assess the long-term
safety and efficacy of fluoroscopically visible BVSs in atherosclerotic swine with metabolic syndrome.
Specifically, we will investigate the patency, biocompatibility, and resorption of the BVS in coronary arteries of
the Ossabaw miniature pig, which recapitulates human coronary atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome."
10980494,"Mislocalization of TDP-43 is a common pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia. Many studies support the
loss-of-function mechanism caused by TDP-43 nuclear clearance as a major pathogenesis pathway toward
neurodegeneration. It is of great importance to understand the dynamics of disease progression in TDP-43
knockout mouse models.
Functional microcircuits are at the heart of the information processing capability of the brain. Calcium imaging
is a powerful tool to study functional microcircuits. Calcium imaging can generate high-dimensional longitudinal
datasets, which are collected at multiple time points over a temporal process (each observation time point is a
wave). Longitudinal analysis models the evolving temporal process. However, existing analysis methods are
primarily designed to process cross-sectional data, which provides a static view of the brain network. As a
result, existing methods have limited capability to model complex dynamic network patterns for high-
dimensional data. Lack of advanced longitudinal analysis methods is a bottleneck for using calcium imaging to
study the dynamics of brain networks in TDP-43 knockout mouse models.
This project seeks to develop a Bayesian computational system to model longitudinal functional microcircuits
and use it to examine microcircuit changes in a TDP-43 knockout mouse model. The developed system is
referred to as Bayesian Longitudinal Microcircuit Analysis (BLMA). The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Develop a
computational system for longitudinal microcircuit modeling. The proposed system, BLMA, will include these
components: preprocessing, microcircuit construction, feature extraction, and Bayesian multivariate mixed
modeling. Aim 2. Understand microcircuit changes in a TDP-43 knockout mouse model. We will apply BLMA to
an existing longitudinal calcium imaging dataset of pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from
awake behaving Tdp-43F/F mice. We will compare the control and knockout groups to determine whether the
knockout group exhibits abnormal PFC microcircuit trajectories.
This project will develop BLMA to advance the state-of-the-art in data analysis and modeling for longitudinal
calcium imaging. It leverages Bayesian machine learning to address critical challenges in longitudinal calcium
imaging data analysis: shared information across waves and high dimensionality. This project is innovative
because it will develop a novel Bayesian system to model microcircuit changes based on calcium imaging data
and delineate a unique brain network mechanism leading to TDP-43 related neurodegeneration. At the
completion of this project, we will have delineated a unique brain network mechanism in TDP-43 related
neurodegeneration."

Hypertension is the single prominent risk factor of epidemic proportions leading to cardiovascular disease and
stroke, which comprise the top two reasons for mortality of humans in the modern age. Genetics and dietary
salt intake are the most investigated factors for susceptibility to hypertension. We recently discovered a novel
link between the composition of gut microbiota and hypertension in the Dahl Salt-Sensitive (S) rat, a rodent
model of human disease. However, except for a few metabolites such as short chain fatty acids, the
mechanisms by which microbiota trigger hypertension is largely unknown. Microbiota collaborates with the
host to produce key metabolites required for host health. Conjugated bile acids are one such class of bile
acids. They are generated by the host in the liver and deconjugated by microbiota in the gut. A bile acid
targeted metabolomics study led us to discover that conjugated bile acids are significantly depleted in
hypertension, rescuing which ameliorated hypertension. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this proposal is
that conjugated bile acids are novel antihypertensive metabolites. To test this hypothesis, experiments
are proposed to address two important questions: First, why are conjugated bile acids depleted in
hypertension? Aim 1 will address this question. Preliminary data show that specific gut microbiota which are
known to deconjugate bile acids expand during hypertension. We propose to investigate whether such
microbiota are the culprits responsible for depleting the circulating pool of conjugated bile acids. Using novel
S rats which lack gut microbiota, studies are proposed to introduce specific microbiota to test its effect on
enhancing the circulating levels of the antihypertensive metabolites, conjugated bile acids. Aim 2 will address
the second important question, ‘What is the mechanism by which conjugated bile acids provide protection
against the development of hypertension?’ Focusing on taurocholic acid, which is a specific conjugated bile
acid depleted during hypertension, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that taurocholic acid lowers hypertension by
targeting the gut FXR-ceramide pathway. Specifically, taurocholic acid antagonizes the bile acid receptor
Farnesyl X receptor (FXR) in the gut to inhibit the transcription of key genes required for the synthesis of the
known prohypertensive metabolite, ceramide. A novel Villin-Cre rat knock-in rat and a second novel FXR
knockout rat have been constructed and proposed as tools to study this gut-specific mechanism. Overall, this
work expands our current limited knowledge beyond the host factors and sheds important new light on how
microbiota critically modify bile acid biochemistry to amplify hypertension. Our proposal not only identifies
this problem, but also interrogates a means to mitigate it by a simple solution of enhancing circulating
conjugated bile acids as a novel putative clinical therapeutic strategy to lower hypertension."

Although major advances in genetics of these disorders have been made over the past decade, therapeutic options are limited. Investigation of these disorders promises to advance scientific knowledge about hepatobiliary development, hepatocyte transporters, cholangiocyte biology, genetic regulatory networks, the neonatal immune response and mechanisms of injury, as well as the discovery of biomarkers of disease and testing of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. With the advent of next generation sequencing, genomics/epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics, disease modeling paradigms and a pipeline of new potential therapies, the immediate translational impact of research in these disorders has never been greater. The 8 cholestatic disorders of the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) have been studied in multi-centered research consortia at our Center for the past 22 years, during the last 15 years within ChiLDReN. Members of our Clinical Center at the University of Colorado Denver and Children’s Hospital Colorado have played major leadership roles as the Chair of the Steering and Executive Committees of ChiLDReN and Chairs of 4 protocols, among other roles. The objectives of this grant application in response to NIH RFA-DK-23-017 through our four specific aims are: to be chosen to be an active, collaborative and productive Clinical Center in the next version of ChiLDReN; to continue to enroll participants with biliary atresia and primary sclerosing cholangitis in the respective protocols and to continue to follow those already enrolled in all of the ChiLDReN ongoing protocols; complete, analyze and publish all of the ChiLDReN study protocols; to be an active participant in all new investigations, protocols and clinical trials initiated by the Network; to develop and propose new clinical and translational studies, trials and ancillary studies that will utilize our participant populations and existing data and biospecimens; to maintain leadership roles within the network and direct the Administrative Core Functions of ChiLDReN; to subcontract to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles for their ongoing work within the ChiLDReN Network; and to continue to provide PFIC/BRIC/ALGS Genotyping expertise and services. Through these activities, our Colorado ChiLDReN Clinical Center will enhance and build on the ChiLDReN goals of expanding clinical and translational research on 8 rare pediatric liver diseases focusing upon improving our understanding of these disorders and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

The gene Icam1 codes for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54), a member of the Ig-like superfamily
of adhesion proteins and a type 1 membrane-bound glycoprotein. It is expressed constitutively on most lung
parenchymal cells, functioning as a receptor for interactions between these parenchymal cells and leukocytes.
Its major ligands are the four members of the β2 leukocyte integrin family. Our laboratory has contributed to
understanding both the adhesive and the signaling functions of ICAM-1. We identified the differential expression
of ICAM-1 on AT1 compared to AT2 cells and its upregulation by lipopolysaccharide and S. pneumoniae on
these cells and capillary endothelial cells. During inflammatory responses, cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and IFNγ
regulate its expression differentially, depending on both the cell type and the inflammatory stimulus. Our studies
of its cell-cell adhesive function document its critical roles in pneumonia induced by LPS and P. aeruginosa.
Ligation of ICAM-1 by β2 integrins also induces intracellular signaling within both the parenchymal cell and the
leukocyte. Furthermore, ICAM-1 is proteolytically shed from the surface of parenchymal cells, and this soluble
ICAM1 (sICAM-1) has highly debated functions as an inhibitor of leukocyte adhesion or an activator of
leukocytes. Thus, ICAM-1 plays very dynamic roles during inflammatory and immune responses. Due to recently
identified issues with the Icam1 null mice generated by homologous recombination and the lack of cell-specific
knockouts, we are at a standstill in understanding ICAM-1. We are generating both Icam1 null mice using
CRISPR/Cas9 and mice with floxed Icam1 alleles. We will test the hypothesis that membrane-bound and sICAM-
1 mediate a range of cell-cell interactions that depend upon the particular ICAM-1-expressing cell type during
both homeostasis and innate immune responses. Aim 1 determines the functions of sICAM-1 in the alveolar
space and its therapeutic potential. The role of sICAM-1 in the trafficking of alveolar macrophages along the
alveolar surface and the functions of sICAM-1 in recruitment and function of neutrophils and inflammatory
macrophages during pneumonia will be identified. Aim 2 determines the functions of ICAM-1 on the alveolar
surface during homeostasis and innate immune responses. Mice deficient in ICAM-1 in alveolar epithelial cells
will be studied to determine its role in trafficking, motility and function of alveolar macrophages in healthy mice.
The effect of alveolar epithelial ICAM-1 in recruitment and function of neutrophils, macrophage subpopulations
and NK cells during pneumonia will also be determined. Outside-in signaling initiated by ICAM-1 ligation will also
be assessed. Aim 3 determines the functions of endothelial ICAM-1 during innate immune responses. Mice
deficient in ICAM-1 expression by endothelial cells will be studied to determine if the leukocytosis observed in
Icam1 null mice is due to the absence of endothelial ICAM-1, as well as the functions of endothelial ICAM-1 in
neutrophil, macrophage and NK cell trafficking during pneumonia. Signaling pathways will be assessed. These
studies will expand our knowledge of ICAM-1 and its therapeutic potential."

There is increasing evidence over the past decade that the composition of the gut microbiome is important for
cancer therapy effectiveness including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and immune therapy. In fact,
modulation of the microbiome is in clinical trials to enhance immunotherapy clinical responses in multiple solid
tumors. Despite the explosion of studies on the microbiome-cancer therapy axis, relatively little is known about
the mechanism(s) utilized by gut microbiota to shape therapy response or resistance. In metastatic castration
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the deadly form of the disease, intra-tumoral androgens likely mediate
immunotherapy and endocrine therapy resistance. Collectively, the three PIs of this application have 1) identified
and characterized the only known human-associated bacterial genes capable of converting glucocorticoids into
non-conventional androgens; 2) collected and sequenced a 5-year microbiome biorepository from individuals
with advanced prostate cancer taking oral androgen axis-targeted therapy; and 3) demonstrated that response
to immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer requires androgen receptor inhibition on T cells. Working
together, we provide evidence that species of the gut microbiome produce androgen metabolites that act as
ligands for the androgen receptor. This observation underscores our clinical observation that the gut microbiome
of endocrine therapy or immunotherapy sensitive versus resistant patients is distinct and significantly unique.
We propose that androgen metabolism by the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota serves as a unique source of
tumor-associated androgens that promote endocrine and immune therapy resistance. We propose the following
aims: Aim 1: Define the functional significance of microbial-derived androgens on immunotherapy effectiveness.
We will determine if microbial-derived androgens are sufficient to mediate therapy resistance and how these
metabolites regulate murine and human T cell function. Aim 2: Determine the GI microbial gene pathways and
androgen metabolites that are determinants of therapeutic response and resistance in mCRPC. These studies
will identify novel bacterial species and genes associated with endocrine and immunotherapy resistance. Aim 3:
Evaluate the impact of microbial-derived androgen production on tumor intrinsic growth, MHC I expression, and
abiraterone acetate/prednisone resistance. We will evaluate the cause-and-effect relationship between microbial
metabolism of androgens and endocrine therapy resistance. Cumulatively, these studies provide a mechanistic
understanding of how the human microbiome promotes endocrine resistance and inhibits anti-tumor immunity
and provide novel microbiota-associated therapeutic targets to reduce androgen-mediated immune suppression."

 The effects of alcohol use disorder are widespread throughout the brain. A fundamental knowledge gap
in the field of alcohol research is the identification of the changes in whole-brain networks underlying the critical
phases of the addiction cycle: intoxication, withdrawal, abstinence, and relapse. In the previous funding cycle,
our lab started identifying these neuronal ensembles, their cellular phenotype, and their networks by focusing
on a known region of interest, the central nucleus of the amygdala. While these efforts have been very
successful, it has become clear that our research endeavor will benefit from moving away from the classical,
biased region-of-interest-based approach to a modern, unbiased, whole-brain approach using single-cell
whole-brain imaging. We believe that this innovative approach is required to identify the changes in whole-
brain networks underlying the critical phases of the addiction cycle. The overarching goal of this renewal is to
continue dissecting the neuronal ensembles of the volitional induction of alcohol dependence using single-cell
whole-brain functional connectomics. We will use the rat model of ethanol vapor self-administration that we
developed in the previous funding cycle to 1) identify the neuronal ensembles of alcohol intoxication, acute
withdrawal, protracted abstinence, and stress-induced relapse and evaluate the contribution of CRF and
dynorphin neurons to these networks, 2) compare pharmacological treatments on alteration of whole-brain
functional networks and recruitment of CRF and dynorphin neurons, and 3) characterize the functional network
of high-intensity binging in dependent rats. This project will provide unbiased brain atlases of the critical
phases of the addiction cycle, identify the role of CRF and dynorphin neurons in these neuroadaptations,
provide a mechanistic framework for the therapeutic effects of several pharmacological treatments, and identify
the specific networks associated with high-intensity alcohol binging, an intensifying trend in alcohol drinking."

Immunoassays – tests that estimate the concentration of analytes in a sample using antibody-antigen binding
reactions – are widely used for clinical diagnostics, biopharmaceutical analysis, and environmental monitoring.
The current method for estimating concentrations of analytes measured in immunoassays has several limitations,
including large measurement errors, difficulty in estimating very low or high concentrations, and noisy estimation.
In addition, with the advance of new technologies using multiplex assays, multiple analytes can be measured
simultaneously in a single plate, but the current method fails to account for the potential correlations between
multiple analytes of the same sample. Further, operator error may arise and environmental samples can be
contaminated, resulting in assay errors. Although some Bayesian methods exist that use immunoassay data more
efficiently, they have not yet been incorporated into a practical workflow, in part because of concerns about
robustness to model error. Motivated by these challenges, the proposed research aims to develop a new Bayesian
workflow for the analysis of immunoassay data, considering possible error and contamination in the samples and
providing a step-by-step guide to model building, checking, and validation. Further, to enhance the proper use
of immunoassay data, a joint modeling and a two-step model approach will be developed to analyze exposure-
outcome associations accounting for the uncertainty in the exposure measure by immunoassays. The methods will
be developed and validated using immunoassay data of indoor allergens with dust samples from the New York
City Neighborhood Asthma and Allergy Study. A lab protocol and a graphical user interface will be developed
and tested to facilitate the uptake of the proposed methods. Once completed, the proposed research will provide
methods and tools for the analysis and use of potential contaminated immunoassay data, advance research in
the broader scientific field when dealing with model contamination and uncertainty in predictors, and provide
important insights into allergic sensitization and asthma morbidity among asthmatic children."
10981021,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, remain among
the most debilitating inflammatory disorders of the western world. It is estimated that more than 3 million
Americans suffer with IBD, with incidence rates on the rise in many populations. The precise etiology of IBD
is not known but emerging evidence implicates shifts in the constellation of microbes in the intestine
(dysbiosis) as a significant factor.
 Our interest in this proposal is aimed at capitalizing on the importance of microbiota- derived
metabolites in promoting intestinal homeostasis. In particular, we aim to better understand how microbial-
derived factors, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA, esp. butyrate), contribute to mucosal barrier function
and wound healing. Our work in progress has focused on developing and testing a panel of butyrate
mimetics that may best serve mucosal barrier function and wound healing in models of IBD. Additional
ongoing work using unbiased single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we identified a cohort of butyrate-
induced genes with potential importance in barrier function.
 In this proposal, we will elucidate whether butyrate mimicry can elicit selectively integrated epithelial
functional responses that promote barrier function and coordinate wound healing. Three synergistic specific
aims are proposed to address this goal. In Aim 1, we will expand on molecular mimicry of butyrate analogs to
optimize epithelial function. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms of selective epithelial control butyrate
analogs. Specific Aim 3 define disease-relevant influences of butyrate mimicry on signaling and gene
expression in acute and chronic mucosal inflammation models in vivo. Results from these experiments will
provide new insights into innate regulation of mucosal barrier and an expanded physiological role for SCFA
produced by commensal bacteria. It is our hope that extensions of this work will lead to the discovery of new
therapeutic templates for mucosal inflammatory disease."
10981158,"Project Summary
 IRAK1 is a core transducer of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R-mediated innate immune signaling
from flies to humans. In response to pathogen infection, ligated TLR/IL-1Rs activate IRAK1 via formation of the
MyDDosome complex (IL-1R/TLR—MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK1) at the cell surface. Once phosphorylated by IRAK4,
activated IRAK1 is released into the cytoplasm where it engages TRAF6-NF-kB and other proinflammatory
cascades. Until recently, IRAK1 had not been implicated in processes other than the microbial response.
 In an unbiased zebrafish screen, we recently identified IRAK1 as essential for cell survival in response to
ionizing radiation (IR) (Liu et al., Nat Cell Biol 2019). This function is conserved in human cells and drives
cellular resistance to radiotherapy in tumor models. Surprisingly, while IR-induced IRAK1 activation requires
IRAK4 within a MyDDosome-like platform, the pathway does not involve IL-1R, TLRs or MyD88. Furthermore,
rather than remaining in the cytoplasm to engage TRAF6, IR-activated IRAK1 is immediately translocated to
the nucleus (Li, et al., Sci Signal in press). Once in the nucleus, a fraction of IRAK1 travels to the nucleolus
where its antagonistic target, the PIDDosome, resides (Ando et al., J Cell Biol 2017; Shah et al., Dev Cell
2021). IR-induced IRAK signaling thus diverges from TLR signaling both upstream and downstream of the
IRAK4-IRAK1 core module, revealing the existence of a non-canonical IRAK signaling (NCIS) pathway.
 With the NCIS pathway backbone in hand, we will now uncover the underlying signal transduction. In Aim
1, we will define the process through which DNA breaks in the nucleus trigger IRAK4-IRAK1 platform formation
in the cytoplasm. Our preliminary data identify cGAS, a DNA sensor which shuttles in and out of the nucleus,
as a strong candidate for initiating NCIS in response to DNA damage-induced ATR signlaling. In Aim 2, we will
first identify the adaptor molecule responsible for nucleating the IRAK4/1 activation platform in place of MyD88,
with the IRAK-interacting protein Pellino1 and death domain-containing protein kinase DAPK1 as lead
candidates (Aim 2A). We will also define the mechanism by which the sister E3 ubiquitin ligase, Pellino2,
orchestrates the nuclear translocation of activated IRAK1 (Aim 2B). Finally, we will elucidate the biologic role of
NCIS; we will integrate our zebrafish and mammalian studies with Drosophila models to ask if NCIS is
conserved in flies, and whether it evolved as a mechanism guarding against unwarranted apoptosis caused by
UV light or the endogenously generated DSBs necessary for meiotic and VDJ recombination (Aim 2C).
 These studies will illuminate a novel stress response pathway in animals and identify a biologic role for
IRAK kinases outside of innate immunity. Because NCIS has been implicated as a pervasive driver of tumor
resistance to radiation therapy (R-RT), an additional immediate impact of our work might be the discovery of
diagnostic tools to predict treatment resistance in patients, as well as novel drug targets for overcoming R-RT
in patients."

Healthcare disparities that adversely affect patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups are often attributed
to provider level factors such as implicit bias. However, efforts to reduce disparities have been hindered by an
incomplete knowledge of factors that leave providers more vulnerable to bias and their underlying mechanisms.
This proposal will address this critical knowledge gap by identifying situations that increase bias among
healthcare providers that can be intervened on at the provider and system level. The proposed research
leverages theory from psychology and psychoneuroimmunology to document the impact of three adverse
provider conditions (APCs) that could increase provider bias: (1) workplace demands (e.g., heightened levels of
stress or burnout), (2) concerns about one’s own health, and (3) increased inflammation occurring during illness.
We hypothesize that when providers experience higher (versus lower) workplace demands, are more (versus
less) concerned about their own health, and experience higher (versus lower) acute inflammation, they will
demonstrate more bias against patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups. We will test our hypothesis in
the context of abdominal pain treatment in emergency departments. Participants will be attending physicians,
nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and residents in emergency medicine and internal medicine
hospitalists who treat abdominal pain for patients who are admitted. We will address three specific aims to
document effects of APCs on quality of care disparities. To address Aim 1, we will use a correlational design to
determine the relationship between APCs and standardized assessments of bias (implicit and explicit bias,
perception of others’ pain, and social avoidance). To address Aim 2, we will use a randomized controlled
intervention design; we will use the influenza vaccine to simulate illness by experimentally increasing
inflammation (indexed by pro-inflammatory cytokine levels). Increases in cytokines are hypothesized to be
positively associated with standardized assessments of bias. To address Aim 3, we will use a prospective,
longitudinal design to tracks provider illness symptoms, stress, burnout, and local cases of infectious illness over
the course of a year. These provider data will be correlated with patient data from abdominal pain cases treated
by the provider on those days. This study has high ecological validity and findings will identify distinct
contributions of APCs to lower quality of care, especially for patients from racial and minoritized groups. Overall,
the proposed research will have widespread positive impact by outlining paths for novel interventions at multiple
levels and domains of influence within the NIMHD Research Framework, such as by engaging administrator and
clinical management stakeholders in conversations about consequences of staffing policies for health disparities."

Currently 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain. This number continues to increase as the
elderly population grows, the prevalence of diabetes rises, and cancer survival rates improve. Chronic pain
not only severely impacts daily quality of life for many patients, but it also places a heavy socioeconomic
burden on society. With a lack of efficacious treatment options available, chronic pain is often treated with
opioids. This is dangerous due to recent understanding of the extremely addictive and detrimental effects
of opioids leading to the current opioid epidemic. Therefore, there is an urgent and clear unmet need for
non-addictive alternative analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. This need to find a solution to
addictive opioids has brought interest to a particular sodium channel, NaV1.7, shown to be important for
pain sensing. Gain-of-function mutations in NaV1.7 are associated with a disorder characterized by intense
burning pain in the extremities: primary erythromelalgia. Conversely, loss-of function of NaV1.7 results in
the inability to feel pain. Therefore, inhibiting NaV1.7 can be an effective method of reducing pain and treat
erythromelalgia patients. To accomplish this, we designed epigenetic modulators to repress expression of
SCN9A (encoding the NaV1.7 channel). Rather than making permanent edits to the genome, these epigenetic
modulators will transiently inhibit expression of SCN9A. By targeting NaV1.7 at the DNA-level instead of
the protein or RNA level, we can achieve specific and long-lasting modulation of NaV1.7, with better
pharmacokinetics prospects than RNA- and protein-targeting approaches. In the parent CREATE grant, we
propose to optimize these epigenetic modulators as well as their delivery to achieve high specificity and
efficacy. The result of this study will be an optimized gene therapy that is not only non-addictive and
efficacious for treatment of chronic pain but also highly specific and long-lasting. Although there is a clear
market for a non-addictive therapy for chronic pain, we believe that a continued optimization of the AAV
so that it can be delivered systemically instead of intrathecally will expand the patient population. This
supplement will contribute to the optimization of the delivery of the therapy to improve the specificity and
decrease manufacturing costs, which will translate to a more affordable therapy for patients."

Resistance to therapy is the major challenge for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Despite recent successes
in immune checkpoint therapy of several human cancer types, pancreatic cancer showed a poor response to the
immunotherapy. Increasing evidence reveals that a dense stromal barrier in pancreatic cancer blocks drug
delivery and intratumoral distribution. The physical barrier of stromal and biological barrier from
immunosuppressive responses further limit the number and function of infiltrating effector T cells. The objective
of this project is to develop a new immunotherapy strategy by co-delivery of tumor penetrating and
immunomodulating theranostic nanoparticles and PD-L1 inhibitors. Our innovative uPAR targeted and stroma
breaking ligand consists of the amino terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA and the catalytic domain of matrix
metalloproteinase-14 (ATFmmp14). It targets multiple cell types in tumors and promotes nanoparticle/drugs
migrating through stromal and extracellular matrix barriers to reach tumor cells. ATFmmp14 conjugated magnetic
iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) carrying Doxorubicin or SN38 enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided
targeted delivery of nanoparticle/drug in tumors, and strong therapeutic effect in pancreatic cancer patient
derived xenograft (PDX) and Kras-driven transgenic mouse tumor models. Notably, targeted delivery of the
theranostic IONPs into tumors promoted infiltration of immune effector cells and decreased immunosuppressive
cells, converting an immune “cold” pancreatic tumor into a “hot” tumor. We further developed an ultrasmall IONP
PD-L1 inhibitor (Nano-iPD-L1) using an engineered PD-L1 blocking peptide. We showed that Nano-iPD-L1
selectively accumulated in pancreatic tumors following systemic delivery. Co-delivery of Nano-iPD-L1 with
ATFmmp14-IONP/drug enhanced intratumroal delivery and significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse
pancreatic cancer model. Therefore, we hypothesize that improved drug delivery in pancreatic tumors by co-
administrations of stroma penetrating ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 leads to a strong therapeutic
efficacy through direct tumor cell killing, modulating immunosuppressive stroma, and blocking PD-L1 function to
generate a strong response from cytotoxic T cells. In the proposed study, we will first investigate and optimize
dose and therapeutic efficacy of co-delivery of ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 in mouse pancreatic
cancer models (Aim1). Followed by non-invasive MRI to assess theranostic IONP delivery and tumor response
after the combined therapy using ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 in transgenic mouse and pancreatic
cancer PDX models (Aim 2). Finally, the effects of an enhanced intratumoral accumulation of ATFmmp14-
IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 on promoting infiltration of effector immune cells, modulating stromal
immunosuppressive cells and factors, and activating cytotoxic T cells will be investigated in transgenic mouse
pancreatic tumor models (Aim 3). Results of this study should provide us with new targeted theranostic IONPs
and immunotherapy for translation of this novel therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer."

Primary Mitochondrial Diseases (PMDs) result from intrinsic dysfunction of mitochondria and have a
prevalence of 1 in 5,000. Although over half experience neurologic symptoms, PMDs are heterogeneous both
genetically and phenotypically. Given the disease heterogeneity, metabolic pathways common to multiple
forms of PMD are appealing therapeutic targets. However, the full extent of mitochondrial metabolism in
neurons is incompletely understood as in addition to generating energy in the form of ATP through the electron
transport chain (ETC), mitochondria also generate metabolites through the TCA cycle and reactive oxidation
species, any of which may contribute to neuronal function. The foundation of this proposal is based on
preliminary studies indicating that the mitochondrial TCA cycle plays a critical role in GABAergic inhibitory
interneurons which are essential for regulating excitatory neuronal circuits. The focus of the proposal is to test
whether the ETC is required for inhibitory interneuron survival or GABA metabolism. The two aims will: (1) use
an in vitro iPSC-derived inhibitory interneuron system to evaluate acute manipulation of mitochondria; and (2)
use mice lacking mitochondrial function in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons to establish the effects of
chronic mitochondrial impairment. The scientific purpose of this proposal is to begin defining the effects of
mitochondrial metabolism in GABAergic hippocampal neurons, with the vision of expanding the tools and
measurements in GABAergic neurons including those outside the hippocampus, and eventually translate
findings by therapeutically targeting metabolism to promote neuronal health in mitochondrial disease. The
proposal is a five-year physician-scientist development program for the candidate who is an Assistant
Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University, with 75% protected time for research, independent
laboratory space and start-up funding. In addition, his clinical time at Lurie Children’s is dedicated to managing
children with mitochondrial disease in both the outpatient and inpatient critical care setting. He is committed to
a career in translational mitochondrial metabolism research focused on neurologic symptoms and is strongly
supported by his Department of Pediatrics, Section of Child Neurology and his mentorship team. The
candidate will build on his prior experience in neuroscience by learning advanced techniques in mitochondrial
metabolism research under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Navdeep Chandel. Additionally, his co-
Mentor, Dr. Mustafa Sahin at Boston Children’s and Harvard, will provide project- and career-level guidance as
an experienced translational researcher and child neurologist. Together, the proposed experiments,
collaborations with experts, advice from consultants and formal didactics will provide the skills and experience
for his transition to independence as a physician-scientist with unique expertise studying mitochondrial
metabolism in neurons, with the long term goal of translating the findings into treatments for PMD."

This K01 is a mixed methods research project in collaboration with an industry partner (i.e., Healthy Minds Innovations)
and will be conducted across three aims during a 5-year comprehensive training program. In this innovative proposal, the
candidate has identified a mentorship team and training goals to facilitate their transition to an independent research career
focused on achieving health equity and advancing mind-body research by delivering culturally tailored digital health
interventions to improve mental health and well-being in underserved populations. Background: African American (AA)
adults are 20% more likely to report serious psychological distress (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) compared to white
adults. Racial discrimination, a significant source of stress in AA adults, increases psychological distress. AA adults lack
access to quality mental health care and the compounding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate mental
health disparities. Reducing psychological distress and increasing access to mental health care for AA adults is a public
health emergency. Commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile apps may be an effective and efficient solution
because they improve psychological distress, are highly scalable and can increase access to care. However, most are not
culturally tailored (i.e., include groups’ unique experiences, values, and beliefs). Culturally tailoring mindfulness meditation
apps can enhance engagement and efficacy in racial/ethnic minority populations. Specific aims and research design: The
goal of Aim 1 is to inform the development of an app prototype via focus groups (N=4, 5 participants each) in AA adults
(half meditators, half non-meditators). The goal of Aim 2 is to culturally tailor a commercial mindfulness meditation app
(Healthy Minds Program app) through a User-Centered Design (UCD) workshop. AA adults (N=8) will attend a virtual
half-day UCD workshop where they will co-design an app prototype. After the prototype is built, participants will test it for
1 week and complete an exit interview to refine the app. Aim 3 will determine the feasibility of the culturally tailored
prototype app following predetermined benchmarks. AA adults with elevated stress (N=72) will be randomized to use HMP
or a health education app (The Wellness App) for 8 weeks. Psychological distress, race-related stress, mindfulness, and self-
compassion will be measured at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Acceptability (ability to recruit, satisfaction, continued
use, appropriateness) will be assessed with a post-intervention satisfaction survey. Demand (adherence to treatment) will
be measured by objective app usage data (sessions/minutes completed) and attrition rate. Mentoring and training: A team
of expert mentors and advisors (Vranceanu, Burnett-Zeigler, Gallo, and Roesch) will oversee the progress of this study and
contribute to mentoring the candidate across 4 training goals aimed to develop expertise in: 1) mental health disparities, 2)
cultural tailoring methods, 3) digital clinical trials, and 4) qualitative and mixed methods research and advanced statistics.
This proposal aligns with NCCIH’s funding priorities including the development of feasible mobile health (mHealth) mind-
body interventions and reducing health disparities. Impact: Collectively, this career development award will serve as a
strong foundation toward the candidate’s independent research career and provides an innovative solution to improve access
to mental health care for AA adults."
10989332,"PARENT R35 ABSTRACT
Direct examination of presynaptic processes has historically been limited by the resolution constraints
of conventional light microscopy. As a result, much of what we know about vesicle movement, fusion,
and recycling relies on inferences from indirect electrophysiological and/or biochemical assays, or from
electron micrographs that reflect a single instant of a dynamic system. The long-term goal of my research
program is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of synaptic transmission at central synapses,
including details of spatiotemporal dynamics under normal conditions, and what disruptions lead to
disease states. Current projects in the lab address two central knowledge gaps. First, we directly probe and
track dynamic presynaptic processes in living tissue by applying our own novel, nanoscale resolution
imaging technology. Using this approach, we will, for the first time, visualize these processes at the level
of single synaptic vesicles within identified synapses. We have already made significant contributions
using this approach, including the discovery that synaptic vesicle dynamics are active, not passive, and
are controlled by actin cytoskeleton and myosin motors. The second major knowledge gap we address is
the contribution of presynaptic deficits to pathophysiology of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is the most
common known cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism. Our recent findings have triggered a
necessary shift in the field towards considering the contributions of presynaptic mechanisms in addition to
postsynaptic mechanisms, thus creating an entirely new array of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.
Continuing work in this area will focus on linking presynaptic defects with abnormalities at the circuit level
and the implications of these abnormalities for behavior and cognition. Sustained funding through this
R35 mechanism will support a multipronged approach to these important neurobiological questions that
will maximize the potential for synergy and translational impact."

Neurofibrillary tangle formation and neurodegeneration occur, during preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in
remarkably restricted cell populations, in the layer II of the EC (ECII), at first in a subregion of EC, the
transentorhinal area (TEC). The reason for this selective vulnerability pattern is still unknown. It is crucial to
discover genes and pathways underlying vulnerability, because they could both yield mechanistic insight into
the disease and open new therapeutic avenues. We previously compared protein-coding genes between ECII
and various neuron types resistant to AD and uncovered a number of gene drivers of neuronal vulnerability by
building an ECII functional network. Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we identify a micro RNA
(miRNA), miR-129-2, with a unique expression pattern that makes it a very promising candidate vulnerability
gene. It is expressed at highest levels in the TEC, might be differentially expressed between mouse and
humans, and is predicted to modulate AD pathology in the EC by our functional network analysis. Additionally,
two of its targets are extremely relevant for AD: RBFOX1, an AD genetic susceptibility factor, and MAPT, the
gene that codes for tau itself. miRNAs, by modulating expression of hundreds of genes at once can have
profound effects on cells, serving both as functional and pathological hubs. Here we propose to investigate
how miR-129-2 interferes with different aspects of AD pathogenesis and to demonstrate that it is protective
against tau accumulation. In Aim 1, we propose to map the subregions of EC where miR-129-2 is expressed,
in mouse and humans. In AD, miR-129-2 is downregulated, and we will test how early in the disease this
downregulation occurs by comparing its levels in the EC in control and prodromal AD individuals. To determine
why miR-129-2 decreases in AD, we will test its expression in AD-like contexts (Aβ, aging) in the mouse. In
Aim 2, we will study the crosstalk between miR-129-2 and Rbfox1 and how both broadly regulate AD genes in
ECII, by regulating splicing and RNA stability. We will test if miR-129-2 regulates amyloidosis and microglia
activation. Lastly in Aim 3, we will ask if miR-129-2 has a role in directly curtailing tau levels. If we validate that
this is the case, miR-129-2 will be an exciting therapeutic target that we could mimic in order to keep tau levels
at bay in ECII neurons. Systematically silencing it in AD mouse models would also generate models with more
abundant AD-like pathology in ECII neurons."

Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States and is the third leading cause of death in
women, and the fifth in men. Through improvements in acute ischemic stroke management with increased use
of thrombolytics and thrombectomy, there are a growing number of patients surviving ischemic stroke. Recent
findings suggest that ~65% of stroke survivors live with some degree of cognitive impairment that negatively
impacts their quality of life. Compared with men, women experience worse post-stroke functional and quality-
of-life outcomes. Reasons for this disproportionate stroke burden are not clear. Cerebral small vessel disease
(SVD), such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is highly prevalent in older adulthood and a common
cause of stroke, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. The female sex is associated with more severe
vascular brain lesions secondary to SVD, and long-term cognitive deterioration after acute lacunar stroke.
Indeed, the underlying pathological mechanisms and relationship between SVD and ischemic stroke have
remained elusive, in part, because animal models rarely examine stroke pathophysiology in the setting of SVD.
The long-term sequelae and how they differ between sexes have been largely ignored. Our proposal aims to
understand the chronicity of events, secondary injury mechanisms, and disease phenotypes underlying the
chronic phase of stroke. We hypothesize that stroke causes accelerated brain aging in a sex-specific manner,
with postmenopausal females having worse neurological outcomes. We further hypothesize that brain injury-
induced senescence is a key driver of inflammatory neurodegeneration. Our preliminary data suggest that
ischemic stroke is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with non-resolving inflammation and cognitive deficits
that continue to worsen over time. We identified senescent microglia as potential culprits. To explore this
further, Aim 1 will examine the chronic and evolving neurological consequences of SVD following stroke. Male
and female Tg-SwDI and wildtype C57Bl/6 control mice (12-months-old) will undergo middle cerebral artery
occlusion or sham surgery and be evaluated longitudinally using magnetic resonance imaging and a battery of
behavioral tests at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-stroke. Biomarkers of aging/disease will be examined to generate
a temporal map of chronic pathologies. In Aim 2, we propose that delayed treatment strategies targeting the
elimination of senescent cells will reduce chronic inflammation, vascular amyloidosis, white matter loss,
neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Using the same paradigm outlined above, we will administer a
senolytic combinatorial therapy, dasatinib plus quercetin, starting at 1-month post-stroke, to determine whether
mitigating secondary injury can improve CAA disease course and functional outcomes. In summary, the
proposed aims will determine if injury-induced senescence is responsible for accelerated brain aging after
stroke, and whether delayed treatment strategies can slow cognitive decline and promote healthy aging."

Employment insecurity (EI; unemployment or underemployment) may escalate substance use as a maladaptive
coping mechanism for distress. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a rapid surge in EI for millions of Americans,
hitting racial and ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status workers harder. The long-term impacts of the
recent surge in EI on substance use are unknown. Employment recovery has been observed, but the speed has
varied across subgroups and regional areas and future economic volatility looms. Despite robust cross-sectional
associations of EI with substance use, prior studies have produced mixed results regarding the prospective effect
of EI on substance use, its causal nature, and its differential impacts across racial and ethnic minority and low-
SES workers. Moreover, the science base is unclear regarding which person-level factors are critical to address
in interventions and how context-level factors intersect with person-level factors to buffer or amplify the impact
of EI on substance use. National drug use surveys typically follow an annual or longer survey schedule that is
not temporally granular enough to address these critical questions, leaving public officials without critical
information to establish sound policies and practices related to EI as a means to reduce substance use.
The proposed secondary data analysis study will address this challenge by isolating transitions in employment
status (including underemployment) to elucidate the time course of effects (i.e., timing, duration, and trajectory
of EI) on substance use. The study also will examine a targeted set of systemic environmental and individual
factors that moderate the effects of EI on substance use and the mechanisms through which it affects substance
use. We will anchor the inquiry in a novel conceptual model that synthesizes behavioral economic models of
substance use with an ecological perspective. The model hypothesizes that people are motivated to engage in
rewarding activities, and when critical sources that can bring rewards, such as full-time employment, are taken
away, a cascading risk process is triggered, involving loss of financial and nonfinancial rewards, distress, mental
health, and increased substance use. Environmental stressors and resources in the neighborhood may amplify
or mitigate these forces. We will leverage the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative
panel of 9,000-plus individuals. UAS involves high-frequency (biweekly from March 2020 to March 2021 and
monthly thereafter until June 2022; 39 waves; 237,849 total observations) assessment of EI, substance use,
financial and nonfinancial rewards, distress, and mental health. We will augment these intensive longitudinal
data with neighborhood context data. The recent rapid surge in EI, its unknown long-term impacts on substance
use, economic uncertainty, decades-long but unresolved debates regarding the causal nature of the EI–
substance use link, and unknown interplay between person- and context-level factors that shapes the association
of EI with substance use at the national level underscore the urgency and timeliness of this proposed study."

Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with solid tumors. Since there are no clinically-
approved targeted therapies for treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), metastatic TNBC pre-
sents a dire clinical situation for which intervention strategies are urgently needed. The long-term goal
of this proposal is to elucidate novel tumor cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms that
drive TNBC progression and metastasis. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the molecu-
lar/cellular basis by which post-translational hypusination and nucleocytoplasmic transport of eukaryotic
initiation factor 5A (eIF5A1/2) governs pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase one (PEAK1)-dependent
invasion/dissemination and lipocalin two (LCN2)-mediated reprogramming of the premetastatic niche
(PMN). Toward this end, evidence is presented that the eIF5A1/2 hypusination/activation pathway
associates with poor TNBC prognosis and is required for TGFβ/PEAK1-driven metastasis and LCN2
expression in TNBC cells. Furthermore, the eIF5A1/2-LCN2 axis is identified as a novel mechanism
through which primary tumor cells remodel the PMN to support TNBC cell expansion. Thus, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that hypusination and cytoplasmic localization of eIF5A1/2 in TNBC cells
drives PEAK1-dependent TGFβ/fibronectin signaling crosstalk and LCN2-mediated anti-inflammatory
reprogramming of the premetastatic niche to support metastasis. The approach is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by elucidating targetable eIF5A1/2-dependent
translational mechanisms of cell state plasticity at early and late stages in the metastatic cascade using
the single-cell Cyclic ImmunoFluorescence (CycIF) platform, our novel in vivo/ex vivo tumor cell-free
PMN reprogramming assay, the Multifunctional Approach to Pharmacological Screening (MAPS)
platform and a suite of preclinical mouse models that faithfully recapitulate complementary aspects of
human TNBC metastasis and progression. Furthermore, the proposed research is significant because it
will define spatiotemporal mechanisms by which dysregulation of eIF5A1/2 expression, hypusination
and subcellular localization drive TNBC pathogenesis and identify targeted treatment strategies for
metastatic TNBC. Specific Aim 1 will determine cancer cell autonomous mechanisms of eIF5A1/2-
mediated TNBC cell invasion and dissemination. Specific Aim 2 will identify eIF5A1/2-dependent
mechanisms of premetastatic niche reprogramming that support TNBC cell seeding and expansion.
The collective knowledge gained from these studies will elucidate targetable mechanisms that govern
both early and late stages of TNBC metastasis and establish rationale for new therapeutic combina-
tions to overcome TNBC progression and improve patient outcomes."

Vagus Nerve Somatotopy using the COSMIIC System
 In this Supplement, we will use the COSMIIC Platform System components to assess the
impact of chronic fibrous encapsulation on evoked recording from the cervical vagus nerve
immediately post-implant and chronically over time. Recent studies have provided basic proof
of concept that smaller, multi-contact electrodes may stimulate specific portions of the cervical
vagus to selectively activate intended therapeutic pathways while minimizing co-activation of
off-target pathways. These studies were performed acutely under anesthesia. In this
supplement, we intend to leverage the HORNET system for chronic stimulation and recording to
develop pilot data to address these gaps. The aims of this supplement are: 1) assess the impact
of chronic fibrous encapsulation on evoked emg, eng, and physiological responses over time
with continuous stimulation started immediately post-implant, and 2) assess the impact of
chronic continuous stimulation started 1-month post-implant on evoked emg, eng, and
physiological responses over time."

 Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures. The growth at the cranial plates
normally separated by the fused suture is arrested, resulting in compensatory overgrowth parallel to the fused
suture. This abnormal development causes head malformations and can lead to increased intracranial pressure
and developmental complications. Patients with this condition normally undergo surgical treatment to remove
the growth constraints and create more aesthetically normative head shapes. However, the traditional evaluation
of these patients after treatment has been based on subjective clinical expertise. During the last decade, three-
dimensional (3D) photogrammetry has gained popularity to evaluate craniofacial anomalies, but existing
methods to analyze this data have failed in their clinical translation due to the use of inefficient and inaccurate
processing techniques. Hence, there is a lack of quantitative evidence to evaluate and compare the continuous
process of head shape normalization between different surgical treatments. This proposal aims to develop new
geometric deep learning methods to enable the fully automated, real-time evaluation of head shapes using 3D
photogrammetry at the clinic and will address the lack of quantitative evidence in the objective assessment of
surgical outcomes. The first aim of this proposal is to characterize the normalization of head shape after
corrective surgery for different treatment approaches. A statistical model of head shape normalization for each
surgical approach will be created to quantify novel metrics of head shape anomaly and probabilistic risk of
craniosynostosis. This model will be the first to incorporate the effects of age at surgery, sex, and the pre-surgical
severity of head shape anomalies on the normalization of head shape. The second aim of this proposal is to
develop a personalized geometric deep learning framework to determine the optimal surgical approach for each
patient with craniosynostosis. This aim will incorporate a novel context-encoding geometric deep learning
method to estimate the expected post-surgical head shape normalization for each potential surgical treatment
and identify the optimal surgical treatment for every patient based on objective retrospective data. The results
from these aims will enable the data-driven, personalized, and objective assessment of surgical treatment for
craniosynostosis that can be used to optimize patient management. This proposal includes a comprehensive
training plan consisting of mentored computational training in the development of deep learning methods,
mentored clinical and translational research training at Children’s Hospital Colorado, and didactic coursework in
statistical and machine learning methods. This proposal is uniquely positioned to be successful given the
multidisciplinary environment at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with resources in
translational research at Children’s Hospital Colorado and machine learning expertise within the Medical Image
Phenotyping lab through the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics."
10994922,"PROJECT SUMMARY. South Africa (SA) is home to the largest number globally of people with HIV (PWH).
Mental health (MH) conditions, particularly depression and harmful alcohol use, are non-communicable diseases
contributing greatly to HIV morbidity and mortality in SA due to poorer quality of life, lower engagement in HIV
care, and worse disease progression. A key priority of SA Department of Health is to integrate MH services into
an existing infrastructure of community health workers (CHWs) conducting home visits to engage PWH who are
initiating or re-initiating HIV treatment. CHWs often encounter patients with MH, yet receive little MH training
despite interest. Training CHWs in an evidence-based intervention to support PWH with MH concerns is a unique
opportunity to improve HIV and MH outcomes. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model for intervention adaptation and
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), this proposal builds upon our prior work that
developed clinic-based interventions for PWH to support MH and HIV care outcomes based on motivational
interviewing, problem solving, and behavioral activation, and aims to adapt the approach and implementation
strategies for home-delivery (“Khanya-Ekhaya”). We are leveraging a robust, existing infrastructure of CHWs
doing home visits with PWH, thus promoting the sustainability of the proposed model. We propose to: (1) Explore
multi-level barriers and facilitators to implementing a home-based CHW intervention (Khanya-Ekhaya) for PWH
with MH concerns seen by a CHW after newly initiating or re-initiating ART. Guided by CFIR, we will conduct
individual semi-structured interviews with CHWs (n=10), patients (n=30) and other key stakeholders (i.e.,
supervisors, policymakers, organizational leaders; n=10) to inform the adaptation and implementation strategy of
Khanya-Ekhaya for home-based delivery for PWH with MH problems (depression/harmful alcohol use); (2) Adapt
Khanya-Ekhaya for home-based, CHW delivery to improve HIV care engagement and MH symptoms based on
Aim 1, guided by the ADAPT-ITT model and human-centered design principles. We will conduct four workshops
with PWH with depression and/or harmful alcohol use (n=12) and CHWs (n=12) to identify adaptations to improve
acceptability; (3) Evaluate the implementation and preliminary effectiveness of the home-based Khanya-Ekhaya
CHW intervention in a pilot Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (n=20 CHWs), evaluating
implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability, fidelity), and preliminary effects on HIV care engagement and
MH symptoms (depression, harmful alcohol use). Implementation outcomes will be assessed among CHWs (n=10)
and patients (n=25) using mixed methods. This proposal is responsive to PAR-23-191 as an innovative
implementation science trial to support MH services shifting from clinic- to community-based care. Capacity
building efforts will build a research network focused on MH and HIV clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa.
Findings will inform an R01 to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of the CHW Khanya-Ekhaya intervention
to reduce MH problems and improve HIV care engagement for PWH with MH concerns."

This application aims to address the urgent need for precision in intercepting hereditary diffuse gastric cancer
(HDGC) associated with pathogenic germline CDH1 mutations, elevating lifetime cancer risk up to 80% for
developing advanced diffuse gastric cancer (AGC), particularly at a young age. HDGC patients pose unique
challenges in cancer interception and risk reduction due to the aggressive nature of AGC, which is associated
with a poor prognosis. Consequently, those with pathogenic CDH1 mutation are advised to undergo prophylactic
total gastrectomies (PTG), However, the incidence of AGC in CDH1 carries varies significantly, with only 25-45%
of mutation carries develop AGC while many patients remain negative during surveillance (normal-appearing
mucosa, N) or stable at the T1a stage (intramucosal stage which is considered as the “precancerous” lesion of
AGC in the context of HDGC) without progression to AGC in years or even lifetime. These facts indicate that
PTG, a major operation associated with chronic physical and psychosocial disabilities, may not be necessary for
all CDH1 mutation carries, however, previous attempts to stratify risk based on specific variants or family cancer
history have not been successful and tools to identify patients at high risk of AGC development, potentially
requiring PTG, are currently lacking. This is largely due to our limited understanding of the earliest events that
drive T1a lesion development and progression. To fill this void, we assembled the Center for Gastric Pre-Cancer
Atlas of Multidimensional Evolution in 3D (GAME3D) that is composed of scientists who work closely together
bridging multiple disciplines, have longstanding expertise in pathobiology of HDGC, and who developed
innovative workflows for multimodal characterization and modeling of the N-T1a-AGC pathologic continuum in
CDH1 germline mutation carriers. The overall objective of our GAME3D Research Center is to develop a
multimodal, single-cell, dynamic, and 3D spatial atlas of normal-appearing mucosa, T1a lesion, and AGC
through longitudinal samples from CDH1 mutation carriers that will inform of transition of at-risk mucosa
to T1a lesions and then to AGC. Aim 1 will build a multimodal, dynamic, 2D spatial atlas that maps the transition
of T1a lesion from at-risk mucosa and its subsequent evolution to AGC. Aim 2 will employ revolutionary technical
and computational approaches and build a spatiotemporal three-dimensional (3D) atlas at single-cell resolution
that captures the N-T1a-AGC pathologic continuum. Aim 3 will leverage complete use cases and 2D and 3D
atlases to build computational models of tumor initiation in normal-appearing gastric mucosa, pathogenesis and
progression of T1a lesions, and, ultimately, the N-T1a-AGC pathologic continuum. Our atlas is of high-value to
the current HTAN repertoire as it will provide an exceptional view into the single-cell spatial landscape of the N-
T1a-AGC pathologic continuum, thereby generating an invaluable resource for HTAN and the field to
understand the earliest phases in human AGC development in high-risk CDH1 mutation carriers and thus
identify targets that are ideal to intercept this trajectory."

The destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) led to the exposure of thousands of first responders and
inhabitants of New York City to WTC-particulate matter (WTC-PM). WTC-PM exposure in our Fire Department
of New York (FDNY) cohort is associated with the development of obstructive airways disease (OAD),
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett’s Esophagus (BE). GERD is a well-known risk factor of
the metaplastic changes of BE, which can subsequently lead to adenocarcinoma. GERD is also associated
with occupational or environmental exposure related OAD. Overall, WTC-exposed firefighters with OAD had a
three times higher risk of developing GERD. At least 40% of WTC rescue and recovery workers have
developed GERD symptoms, which is 8.2 times its pre-9/11 prevalence. It is in the context of these findings
that we propose to study, Aerodigestive Disease in the World Trade Center Exposed FDNY Cohort: Validation
of Biomarkers and Defining Risk to Tailor Therapy. This will further define and phenotype
aerodigestive/gastrointestinal health biomarkers, as well as determine impact on lung health to improve care
thereby fulfilling the mandate of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act: PAR-20-280.
GERD diminishes health-related quality of life and productivity. Complications of GERD can further extend
beyond BE; extra-esophageal reflux can incite or exacerbate allergies, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, and
asthma. Management of reflux is challenging, as often refractory to therapy, diagnosis can be invasive and
have significant associated costs. Patients with WTC-PM exposure associated asthma more often had
persistent GERD. Furthermore, GERD increases the odds of developing WTC-AHR, independent of exposure
intensity. Although many studies have suggested interdependence between airway and digestive diseases, the
causative factors and specific mechanisms remain unclear. We have successfully identified metabolic,
vascular and inflammatory biomarkers of WTC-airway hyperreactivity (WTC-AHR). We have also identified
biomarkers of GERD/BE in our WTC exposed population with respiratory disease, facilitating the identification
of biologically relevant immune pathways.
We propose the continuation of our two AIMs to explore the HYPOTHESIS that serum biomarkers will
differentiate FDNY rescue and recovery workers with aerodigestive morbidity who proceed to develop
GERD/BE. Noninvasive biomarkers will identify subjects that may require improved treatment. We are
requesting funding of our translational research to leverage the longitudinally phenotyped FDNY-WTC cohort
and identify Biomarkers of Airway Disease, Barrett’s and Underdiagnosed Reflux Noninvasively (BAD-
BURN). We will develop the WTC aerodigestive repository, validate biomarkers of GERD and BE (AIM 1), and
phenotype subgroups with aerodigestive disease to identify noninvasive biomarkers of diagnosis/treatment
efficacy to inform future biologically plausible therapies to improve care (AIM 2)."
10995195,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As Parkinson’s disease (PD) progresses, patients develop slowness of movement (bradykinesia), tremor and
rigidity. The first-line treatment for PD is the dopamine precursor levodopa. However, long-term use can lead to
excessive movement (dyskinesia). To address levodopa-induced dyskinesia, medication dose is adjusted, and
deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the basal ganglia is utilized. Without sufficiently lowering the medication dose,
DBS can exacerbate dyskinesia. However, the mechanisms with which DBS causes dyskinesia, and how they
are modulated by the dopaminergic cycle, are not fully understood. Excessive gamma band (65-90Hz)
synchronization in the motor network correlates with dyskinesia in preliminary human studies. This signal has
the potential to predict the onset of a dyskinetic episode when identified across a complete set of spectral
features with continuous measures of motor fluctuations. During therapeutic DBS of either the subthalamic
nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus (GP), the gamma oscillation is often entrained (amplified and modulated) to
one-half the stimulation frequency. However, the clinical relevance of entrainment, and how it may interact with
across stimulation settings, has not yet been investigated. We predict that stimulation-induced 1:2 entrainment
of cortical oscillations (oscillations detected at one-half the stimulation frequency) will therapeutically increase
movement, while simultaneously decreasing excessive/pathological movement, otherwise known as
dyskinesia. The goals of this study are to use multisite, chronically implanted neurostimulators and continuous
wrist-wearable sensors to identify correlates of dyskinesia across a complete set of spectral features and to
assess the possible clinical benefit, as it relates to dyskinesia scores measured by the wearable sensors, of
stimulation-induced entrainment of these spectral features. First, we will characterize correlates of dyskinesia
using hundreds of hours of chronic neural recordings collected in a naturalistic environment across typical
dopaminergic cycles with objective dyskinesia monitoring using wearables prior to the initialization of
stimulation. The majority of these patients experience dyskinetic motor signs while taking their clinically
recommended medications. Then, we will determine the most predictive features of dyskinesia using machine
learning models to predict the continuous dyskinesia scores derived from validated wearable algorithms of the
sensors worn on the wrist. We hypothesize that periodic gamma components will be most predictive of
dyskinetic episodes prior to the onset of stimulation. Next, we will determine the relationship between gamma
entrainment, dyskinesia severity, and deep brain stimulation amplitude. To do this, we will record neural data in
a similar setting as before. However, during this process, patients will experience deep brain stimulation at the
clinically recommended stimulation frequency, and patients will slowly increase their stimulation amplitude
across a period of several weeks up to the clinically recommended setting. We hypothesize that gamma
entrainment and dyskinesia severity will be inversely correlated at moderate levels of entrainment."
10979242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia worldwide, is a rapidly increasing public
health concern. There is an urgent need for the validation of novel targets and therapeutic strategies for AD.
Given the heterogeneity of AD pathogenesis, targeting the connection between amyloid pathology, tau
pathology, and neuronal cell death in AD is gaining increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy for AD. In this
context, CAPON (the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)) has been recently
identified as a novel tau-binding protein that represents a promising target to break the connection between
amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration. In tauopathy models, CAPON/tau interaction induces tau
aggregation and neurodegeneration, while CAPON deficiency ameliorates AD-related pathological
phenotypes. Moreover, the interaction between CAPON and nNOS mediates A-induced neurotoxicity in AD
animal models. However, there are no small molecules reported to date that target the multifaceted role of
CAPON in AD pathogenesis. Our goal is to establish targeting CAPON with small molecules as a promising
therapeutic strategy for AD. Our hypothesis is that CAPON-targeted small molecules with dual inhibition of
CAPON/tau and CAPON/nNOS interactions can ameliorate neuronal cell death and tau pathology. Building on
our previous work focused on the discovery of small molecule modulators of tau and amyloid aggregation, we
propose to screen a central nervous system (CNS)-focused chemical library of small molecules for the ability to
bind CAPON using a temperature-related intensity change (TRIC)-based assay. Subsequently, we will use
time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays to identify small molecule CAPON binders that
inhibit CAPON-centered interactions (Aim 1). We will validate the identified hits using a panel of screening
assays for CAPON-targeted small molecules and perform structural optimization guided by molecular modeling
and site-directed mutagenesis (Aim 2). In Aims 2 and 3, we propose to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the
optimized leads using a combination of in vitro assays and two AD mouse models. The selection of three leads
for the AD mouse models will be guided by the assessment of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and in vivo
target engagement of the investigated compounds. The proximal expected outcome of this work is validating
the potential of small molecules to target CAPON and efficiently block CAPON/tau and CAPON/nNOS
interactions in vivo. The optimized leads from this work will serve as the basis for future target-based drug
development programs and preclinical AD studies."
10979293,"Thalamocortical networks consist of two parallel circuits that involve distinct thalamic and cortical neurons and
have distinct nuclear, areal, and laminar distribution. A more specialized ‘core’ system consists of excitatory
thalamic neurons that focally target the middle cortical layers, as classically described for sensory systems. A
more diffuse ‘matrix’ system consists of excitatory thalamic neurons that broadly target the upper layers of
multiple areas, integrating information across cortices. Growing evidence suggests differential involvement of
core and matrix systems in the vital processes of sleep, attentional modulation and states of vigilance, multimodal
integration, cognition, emotion, and action, and in the disruption of these processes in schizophrenia. However,
little is known about the organization of these networks in the human brain and the distinct mechanisms of
disruption of core vs matrix systems in schizophrenia and associated sleep disorders. Our overarching
hypothesis is that core and matrix thalamocortical circuits vary in parallel with the systematic variation of cortical
laminar structure and exhibit graded connection patterns, function, and dysfunction, such that the most plastic
thalamocortical circuits allow functional flexibility but are also more vulnerable to disruption in psychiatric
diseases, and prominently in schizophrenia. Based on this, we will test the hypotheses that core and matrix
pathways differ in density, structure, termination pattern, and interactions with cortical inhibitory interneurons in
prefrontal cortices and exhibit distinct pathophysiology in schizophrenia, with matrix circuits primarily affected
along with their preferential innervation of limbic medial and orbital prefrontal areas, whereas core circuits will
mostly affect lateral prefrontal cortices. The goal of the proposed studies is to investigate the unknown circuit
interactions between core and matrix thalamocortical systems in humans, then compare and cross-validate these
findings in rhesus macaques, using archival postmortem tissue and identical approaches, so we can then reliably
study their pathophysiology in schizophrenia. We will use high-resolution microscopy to label and image
pathways at multiple scales, from system to synapse in the brains of both species and will additionally use tract-
tracing in monkeys and neurochemical labeling to cross-validate circuit interactions. We will study the density,
caliber, and myelination of axons in core vs matrix pathways and estimate the g-ratio, which is directly associated
with the speed of conduction, and thus reflects axonal function and integrity. Then we will use the novel
quantitative circuit data to computationally model core and matrix thalamocortical network dynamics and
disruptions in schizophrenia and associated sleep disorders. Our proposed studies are predicated on primate
specializations that likely underlie normal and pathologic function through thalamus and cortex in primates,
including humans. The proposed studies will yield novel data on the as-yet unknown neurochemical and synaptic
organization and interactions of core and matrix circuits in primates, which critically affect the dynamics of
sensory, affective, and goal directed processes, and are disrupted heterogeneously in schizophrenia."

The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool."
10980467,"Abstract
About 27% of premature infants weighing less than 1500 g develop intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). These
infants suffer from post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits. No optimal therapy
exists to prevent or minimize post-IVH hydrocephalus. IVH damages the multiciliated ependyma in the cerebral
ventricles and aqueduct disrupting the cilia-driven CSF flow. Moreover, this inflames the choroid plexus (ChP)
and periventricular regions, increasing CSF production and contributing to hydrocephalus. The cerebral ventricle
in fetuses is lined by pseudostratified epithelium consisting of radial glia and other neural progenitors. As the
brain matures, the radial glia differentiates into multiciliated ependymal cells (E1) and quiescent neural stem
cells (B1). This multiciliated differentiation program is regulated by MCIDAS>p73>FOXJ1 signaling pathway that
regulates the specification of radial glia into multiciliated ependyma. Indeed, human infants with FoxJ1 or
MCIDAS mutation and FoxJ1 knock-out mice display defective multiciliated ependyma and hydrocephalus. IVH
injures the ependyma and ChP, reduces the proliferation of progenitors in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular
zone (SVZ), and downregulates Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression in the periventricular regions. Conversely,
Shh overexpression promotes the proliferation of progenitors in VZ and SVZ, reduces inflammation, and
upregulates FoxJ1, p73, and Rfx3 transcription factors, likely promoting repair of the damaged ependyma and
CSF flow. Our preliminary data show that IVH reduces the number of E1 and B1 cells. Additionally, the Shh
activation increases the population of E1 and B1 cells and reduces the ventricular volume in the rabbit model of
IVH. We hypothesize that a) IVH results in apoptosis, reduction, and arrested maturation of multiciliated
ependymal cells in preterm rabbits and humans, and b) activation of Shh/MCIDAS > FoxJ1 signaling reverses
the damage to the ciliated ependyma and reduces hydrocephalus in kits with IVH. Our well-established rabbit
model of IVH (E29 kits) and autopsy samples from human preterm infants will be used to test these hypotheses.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of IVH on the proliferation and maturation of the ependyma development in
premature rabbit kits (E29) at postnatal D3, 7, and 14 by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Also,
the planar polarity of cilia in immunostained sections, ciliary movement, and ependymal transcriptomic changes
by scRNA-seq will be assessed. Autopsy samples from human fetuses and premature infants (20-40 weeks) will
be analyzed to assess the impact of gestational age and IVH on the ciliated ependyma development. In Aim 2,
we will determine if Shh activation by Ad-Shh or Smo-agonist treatment reverses IVH-induced ependymal
damage, ciliary loss, hydrocephalus, and behavioral deficits by increasing FoxJ1 expression. In Aim 3, we will
modulate MCIDAS>p73>FoxJ1 signaling to reverse the ependymal injury, reduce hydrocephalus, and assess
its impact on Shh-signaling. These studies should hasten the development of new therapies for hydrocephalus
and expand our understanding of ependymal plasticity in premature newborns."

 Alterations in the control of lipid homeostasis can lead to cardiometabolic diseases, including
atherosclerosis, the most common cause of mortality in Western societies.
 Our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of miRNAs in regulating high-density
lipoprotein (HDL)-C and LDL-C. Work from our group and others identified miR-33a/b as key regulators of
cellular cholesterol efflux and uptake, HDL biogenesis and fatty acid metabolism. Notably, we have recently
discovered that miR-33 and the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) regulates the expression of
transmembrane protein 86a (TMEM86a), which is a lysoplasmalogenase that regulates plasmalogen
(phospholipid) metabolism. This finding is highly relevant given the key role of these phospholipids as
reservoir of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are the precursors of bioactive lipids that control inflammation
resolution. Plasmalogen/lysoplasmalogen content in cells can also regulate membrane fluidity, which may
contribute to cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses, efferocytotic capacity, ER stress, lipid
peroxidation, and cellular cholesterol efflux in macrophages. Notably, TMEM86a is highly expressed in
human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a relevant role for this enzyme in regulating
macrophage immunometabolic response during atherosclerosis.
 Together, these novel findings strongly suggest that LXR/miR-33/TMEM86a signalling pathway
might contribute to the chronic vascular inflammation observed in atherosclerotic lesions. To investigate the
functional relevance of TMEM86a in regulating macrophage phospholipid metabolism during the
progression of atherosclerosis, we have recently generated a mouse model that lack the expression of
TMEM86a in macrophages. Using these mice and cutting-edge techniques (genomics and metabolomics),
we will elucidate the contribution of LXR/miR-33/TMEM86a pathway in atherogenesis."

Over 500,000 survivors of childhood cancer are living in the United States today. Cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of noncancer late mortality in this cohort. Subgroups of survivors, including individuals
previously exposed to radiation to the chest, abdomen, and total body, are also at treatment-related risk for a
constellation of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic inflammation, and
hypertension, which further amplifies their risk of cardiovascular disease. Tailored, scalable and sustainable
interventions that target modifiable risk factors, such as obesity, are thus urgently needed to reduce
cardiometabolic risk in this cohort. Time-restricted eating, or voluntary abstinence from all caloric intake for 14-
16 hours per day, has been demonstrated in pre-clinical and human studies to combat these risks. This mode
of fasting appears to be feasible, safe, and sustainable in diverse populations. Results on the efficacy of time-
restricted eating, however, are discrepant across studies, with some studies demonstrating marked
improvement in weight, glycemic control, and circadian rhythm alignment and others showing minimal effect.
Yet this intervention has not been tested in childhood cancer survivors, and it is unknown whether it would be
an efficacious risk-reducing intervention in this population. The proposed STRENGTH (Survivors engaged in
Time-Restricted EatiNG after THerapy) Study would fill this gap by determining the efficacy of time-restricted
eating to reduce weight and improve markers of cardiometabolic risk in radiation-exposed survivors with
overweight/obesity. To this end, we will conduct a phase IIb randomized controlled trial of 300 radiation-
exposed survivors of childhood cancer with overweight/obesity and enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor
Study (CCSS). Participants will be randomized to either a 6-month time-restricted eating intervention followed
by a 6-month maintenance phase, or usual care, which consists of mailed educational handouts on healthy
lifestyle behaviors. We will: (1) Determine the impact of time-restricted eating on measures of weight status
and other weight-related outcomes (waist circumference, percent body fat); (2) Assess the impact of time-
restricted eating on cardiometabolic risk profile (blood pressure, glycemic control, insulin resistance,
adipokines, markers of inflammation); (3) Identify moderating and mediating factors, as well as barriers and
facilitators, associated with adherence to the intervention and weight loss, with the goal of informing future
implementation efforts. The proposed time-restricted eating intervention, which is grounded in social cognitive
theory, will include stepwise progression to build self-efficacy using “nudges” and motivational interviewing.
This proposal will leverage novel mHealth technology to deliver a fully remote, theoretically grounded
behavioral intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk and thereby address the burdens of cancer and its
treatment among adult-aged survivors of childhood cancer. Time-restricted eating may represent a sustainable
intervention to improve long-term outcomes in a highly morbid survivor cohort."

Despite advances in kidney transplantation (KT) with improved 1-year graft survival to >90%, KT attrition is
unchanged due to persistent antibody mediated rejection (ABMR). Given limited ABMR treatment options, the
outcome is persistent KT inflammation and accelerated KT loss. As subtypes of rejection are diverse in their
pathogenesis and treatment response, the need for precise treatments based on molecular basis of rejection is
well-founded. We propose to develop and apply a drug repurposing pipeline to ABMR expression profiles to
query publicly available drug-gene expression databases, to identify single and combination drug repurposing
candidates for ABMR (Aim 1). Our preliminary, published studies support the successful analyses for ABMR
with identification of publically available histological and molecular stable (control) and ABMR renal allograft
datasets, to be integrated with single-cell RNASeq analysis experiments that will be conducted on curated ABMR
renal allograft biopsies. We will use transcriptomic-based computational drug-repurposing to identify potential
new single agent and combination therapeutics for the treatment of ABMR, based on expression reversal,
leveraging public and newly generated single cell data. We will further determine the kinetics and the mechanism
of action of promising drugs or drug combinations in human cells and ABMR tissue, ex vivo (Aim 2). Promising
single agent and combination agents will be further validated for efficacy for treatment or prevention of ABMR in
vivo, in a pre-clinical, established, rodent renal allograft model of ABMR (Aim 3).
Our approach is highly significant because we will investigate unique and novel cell-specific transcriptomic
profiles, underlying biological processes and signaling pathways in ABMR and these data will be analyzed with
a drug repurposing pipeline to discover novel single agents and combination therapies that can be used as a
personalized approach to management of ABMR. The in vivo experiments will take these studies to validation of
compound or combination of compound efficacy for reversing or preventing ABMR. The successful completion
of these studies can propose new, FDA approved drugs, that could be repurposed for improving long term
outcomes in kidney transplant recipients, by reducing ABMR injury, extend graft and patient survival."
10982160,"Project Summary/Abstract
While the steady transition from 2-D mammography to 3-D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in recent years
has resulted in improved breast cancer diagnosis, x-ray based breast imaging techniques are inherently limited
by their inability to provide physiologically relevant functional information. The persistent high percentages of
unnecessary biopsies and poor sensitivity to malignant tumors among dense breasts and early-stage cancers
have motivated the research community to seek additional functional assessment. Diffuse optical tomography
(DOT) – a non-invasive imaging modality using only non-ionizing near-infrared light – has shown promise in
fulfilling such a role by exploiting cancer’s high endogenous contrasts in angiogenesis and metabolism.
However, the low spatial sampling density due to use of optical fibers and the ill-posedness of the DOT inverse
problem have resulted in low image resolution in DOT, hampering its clinical translation. For nearly two
decades, our group has been a key contributor in advancing DOT for breast clinical diagnosis via multi-modal
imaging. We have developed translational imaging systems combining DOT with DBT as well as prior-guided
algorithms that “fuse” x-ray contrasts with DOT reconstructions, and tested these systems in clinical studies
with over 450 subjects. Under the initial funding period, we have developed a new DOT imaging architecture
that utilizes fiber-less widefield pattern-illumination and camera detection to achieve ultra-high-density and
uniform spatial sampling. We have also developed highly efficient compressive-sensing strategies to take
advantage of such unprecedented dense datasets without long acquisition time. With these advances, our
optical mammography co-imager (OMCI) system prototype is capable of providing a raw measurement density
several orders of magnitude higher than previously reported high-density DOT systems at only a fraction of the
cost and instrument size. Built on this strong momentum, in the renewed period, we aim to further enhance
optical measurement density by developing the first-in-the-field widefield frequency-domain (FD) DOT system
combining single-pixel imaging with our compressive-sensing approaches. Moreover, we will also implement
real-time adaptive illumination/detection patterns optimized for individual breasts. Furthermore, through our
decade-long research in DOT, we have developed a comprehensive suite of toolboxes that have been
rigorously validated using clinical data, offering unique capabilities for widefield DOT forward modeling, pattern
compression/optimization, and prior-guided image reconstructions. With a strong track record for developing
and maintaining high-quality open-source tools, we are excited to share these packages with the biophotonics
research community as open-source software. Both our next-generation widefield FD breast DOT hardware
and algorithm innovations will be tested by an experienced clinical team with healthy (N=20) and lesion cases
(N=60). The success of this project will not only accelerate the clinical translation of breast DOT, but also
introduce powerful new DOT architectures to assist biophotonics researchers in a wide range of applications."
10982162,"Pharmacological mTOR inhibition (mTORi) extends lifespan and healthspan in older mice, suggesting these
medications may similarly slow the progression of age-associated deficits in humans. However, older individuals
may exhibit greater susceptibility to adverse drug effects. The current RFA seeks pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) mTORi studies to gain insights into safe dosing strategies for use in older adults. Indeed,
reliable PK/PD indicators of mTOR activity for use in clinical studies could lead to optimal, even
individualized age-ameliorating treatments. Towards this end, our over-arching goal is to define PK/PD
parameters that reflect mTORi activity in otherwise healthy older adults in order to determine an optimal, safe
dosing protocol for clinical amelioration of age-associated functional deficits. Aim 1. Assess PK/PD effects of
the mTOR inhibitors Rapamycin (RAPA) and Everolimus (EVERO) in healthy elderly persons as a
function of agent, dose, dosing schedule, and sex. We will recruit healthy older persons (65-90 yrs) for a
short-term (6 week) adaptive, open-label, dose-finding, PK/PD study comparing RAPA and EVERO using both
daily and intermittent dosing. We will make detailed PK measurements while also quantifying mTORi effects on
PD biomarkers of mTORC1 [phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6]; mTORC2 [Akt]; and on a
potential PD biomarker, soluble ICAM-1. Optimal dosing will be defined as the mTORi dose and drug that best
re-established “youthful” PD values in the older adult subjects. Aim 2. Assess the safety/tolerability/adverse
effects of PK/PD-optimized doses as determined in AIM1 for daily and intermittent dosing of either RAPA
or EVERO in a placebo-controlled trial in healthy elderly persons of both sexes. With the optimal doses
from AIM 1, we will perform a longer-term randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily vs. intermittent mTORi.
To this end, 3 older cohorts of 24 older adults each (12/group x 2 sexes) will be recruited and treated for 6 months
with either daily (sustained) mTORi, intermittent mTORi, or placebo. Specimens will be collected for PD
biomarkers as in AIM1. In addition, PK/PD parameters will be assessed in skeletal muscle (hydrophilic tissue)
and fat (lipophilic tissue) biopsies. Maintenance of the mTORi outcomes post-treatment will be assessed during
a 6 month follow-up. Throughout the study, safety measures will be incorporated, including glucose tolerance
tests. Undertaking a well-controlled PK/PD study to define those PD parameters that best correlate with
optimal mTOR pathway inhibition while being safely administered to the target population is a necessary
step in development of mTORi as a therapeutic for enhancing healthy human aging. This long-term goal
will be further facilitated as follows: i) PD parameters will be optimized across tissues and may identify an easily
assayed surrogate mTORi marker; ii) a Repository of blood/tissues will be established for further aging research,
and iii) we expect a diverse demographic drawn from our population, which is >50% Hispanic."

Benign prostatic pathological changes (collectively known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia/BPH), characterized
by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a prevalent condition that significantly impacts the quality of life in
aging males. Current medical treatments for LUTS/BPH are largely ineffective, necessitating a deeper
understanding of the underlying pathogenesis to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Our prior investigation
identified that lipid accumulates in the prostate in BPH as well as macrophages enter the prostate lumen and
become lipid-laden foam cells. However, we have very limited information on the etiology and consequences of
these processes. Therefore, through the utilization of clinical specimens, a well-established mouse model of
prostatic disease, and the creation and testing of novel mouse models, we will investigate the intricate interplay
between prostatic inflammation, lipid accumulation and urinary dysfunction. Accordingly, aim 1 will elucidate the
role of CXCL17 as an epithelia-derived cytokine in remodeling the prostatic immune environment in mice as well
as will identify candidate cytokines that drive the same process in humans via a comprehensive transcriptomic
and proteomic approach. Aim 2 will generate a mouse model with inducible upregulation in lipid synthesis
pathways in the prostate epithelium to assess pathological and functional consequences. Aim 3 will decipher the
impact of foam cell-derived factors via transurethral instillation. Our research team consists of experts in urology,
immunology, and proteomics research, ensuring a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to address the
research questions. The anticipated outcomes of this research project include a better understanding of the
pathogenesis of LUTS, the identification of novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring, and the
development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting foam cell formation and lipid accumulation.
In conclusion, this study holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of benign prostate disease
and ultimately improving clinical outcomes for patients suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms. By
elucidating the role of lipid accumulation and foam cells, we aim to pave the way for the development of effective
interventions to alleviate the burden of LUTS in the aging male population."
10981270,"The observed increased occurrences of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are largely a consequence of ocean
warming due to climate change, eutrophication, and nutrient pollution, which raise concerns that HABs are
negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems, coastal resources and the health of coastal communities. Among
these HABs, Karenia (K.) brevis affects many Gulf Coast communities, particularly southwest Florida. Over the
last decade, K. brevis blooms have caused massive destruction to marine life and morbidity and mortality of
marine mammals. These harmful effects of K. brevis are attributed to the release of potent neurotoxins,
brevetoxins (PbTx). Currently, the impact of aerosolized PbTx exposure on the human central nervous system
(CNS) is not yet known. Human consumption of PbTx causes Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP), including
a wide range of neurological symptoms. We recently showed that SW Florida residents exposed to aerosolized
PbTx are experiencing NSP-like (NSPL) symptoms, and those with past medical histories (PMHx) of migraine
and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were particularly vulnerable to the neurological effects of aerosolized
PbTx. Carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele who are genetically at a higher risk of cognitive
impairment more frequently experience memory problems and fatigue during red tide blooms. We have
detected PbTx in blood, and antibodies against PbTx correspond with the reporting of NSPL symptoms
following exposure to aerosolized PbTx. However, a dose-response relationship between aerosolized PbTx
exposure and the emergence of NSPL and neurological symptoms is currently unknown. Therefore, we will
determine a dose-response relationship between aerosolized PbTx exposure and NSPL and neurological
symptoms. We will determine whether individuals with preexisting neurological conditions or e4 carriers more
frequently experience NSPL compared to general residents and non-carriers. We will also determine whether
PbTx in biospecimens and blood PbTx antibodies can serve as biomarkers of NSPL and neurological
symptoms. Currently, there is no information available on PbTx pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans. Therefore,
we will determine the PK parameters using PbTx in biospecimens and determine their relationship to NSPL
and neurological symptoms. Using physiology-based PK modeling, we will estimate the amounts of PbTx that
can reach the human brain, which will be critical for understanding the adverse brain health effects from
aerosolized PbTx exposure. This work will inform future decision-making for developing strategies to minimize
the risks of neurological symptoms in humans following aerosolized PbTx exposure. Given the ongoing threat
of climate change on the formation of powerful hurricanes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Gulf of
Mexico and subsequent occurrences of intense HABs in coastal waters, this poposed work will provide a
roadmap for future investigations into studying the adverse human health impact from exposure to HAB toxins."

10985869,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a major public health
problem. While existing findings suggest an increased biological risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, the
direct developmental effects are nearly impossible to disentangle fromsocioeconomic, environmental, and family
factors. Children with NOWS are often exposed to multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with known
detrimental effects on long-term health, however, positive childhood experiences (PCEs) can buffer the effects
of ACEs, promoting positive adaptation. In this proposal our objective is to identify PCEs associated with optimal
developmental outcomes as meaningful and feasible future intervention targets. To achieve this goal, we
propose incorporating lived experience through an active partnership with a local community advisory board and
an innovative, strengths-based focus on positive experiences. We will capitalize on our established, prospective
longitudinal cohort of children with a history of NOWS, adding a school-age assessment to establish a more
complete developmental trajectory with a comprehensive evaluation of socioeconomic, parental, and
environmental variables. We will accomplish this study through the following specific aims: (1) Engage key
community members as active partners in the research process to participate in identification of key patient-
centered outcomes and explore acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of potential interventions, (2)
Assess the independent and moderating effects of total PCEs/ACEs and longitudinal measures of parenting on
school-age neurodevelopmental outcomes in a prospective cohort of infants with NOWS, (3) Examine the
association between the individual PCEs and components with neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with
a history of NOWS. We use several novel concepts that differentiate this proposal and line of research from
others including an analysis plan directed by positive psychology principles and incorporation of key
community members in all phases of the project to improve study processes, reduce barriers, and facilitate
meaningful results. I will work with a team of experienced mentors (Drs. Freisthler, Taylor, Sege, Breitenstein &
Rausch) to increase my competency in three critical areas: (1) community-engaged research, (2) design and
analysis of longitudinal studies, (3) methods for assessment of and intervention to promote PCEs and
prevent ACEs. These three training objectives will be accomplished through formal coursework, interactive
workshops, presentations and conference attendance, completion of my research aims, and hands-on
mentorship activities with my diverse, multi-disciplinary group of mentors and collaborators. This early career
development award will provide the necessary candidate training and foundation for an R01 testing the efficacy
of an intervention to increase relevant PCEs identified during the K23, propelling an independent, federally
funded program of research designed to promote optimal developmental outcomes in children with in-utero
substance exposure."

 This proposal describes a five-year project through which Dr. Joseph Cooley will develop the skills and
knowledge necessary to transition into an independent basic and translational physician-scientist. He will receive
mentorship from a primary mentor, several advisors and collaborators from National Jewish Health and the
University of Colorado. His long-term career goal is to help patients with fibrotic lung diseases by uncovering
mechanisms of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) and developing therapeutic strategies to halt or reverse
fibrosis. This proposal explores how interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes apoptosis resistance in fibroblasts by
increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, and how this IL-6-BCL-2 axis can be targeted
therapeutically. It is directly relevant to the NHLBI given its applicability to all progressive fibrosing interstitial lung
diseases (ILDs). Candidate: Joseph Cooley, DO is board certified in Internal, Pulmonary, and Critical Care
Medicine. He is an Instructor at National Jewish Health in Denver, CO who clinically specializes in ILD and
performs rigorous basic and translational scientific investigations related to pulmonary fibrosis as a physician-
scientist. Training: Dr. Cooley has created an extensive career development plan that builds on his prior
mentored research during medical school, residency, and fellowship training. His multi-faceted career
development plan utilizes formal classwork, conferences, seminars, workshops, small and large group
collaborative meetings, and on-on-one training to develop and expand his skills and knowledge of 1) biologic
concepts related to mechanisms of cell death, biostatistics, genetics and genomics, and lung injury, repair and
fibrosis, 2) laboratory techniques, 3) scientific writing, 4) rigorous experimental design, 5) data interpretation, 6)
oral presentation, and 7) leadership, mentorship and laboratory management. Mentor/Environment: Dr.
Cooley’s primary mentor is Dr. Elizabeth Redente, PhD whose laboratory has a history of producing high-impact
research regarding fibroblasts behavior during lung injury, repair and fibrosis. Dr. Cooley has assembled a team
of mentors and collaborators that are experts in pertinent aspects of the project including advanced genomic
analysis techniques (Dr. Gerber), cutting edge gene transfer techniques using viral vectors (Dr. Bridges),
genetics and genomics of pulmonary fibrosis (Dr. Schwartz), and IL-6 signaling across diverse disease states
(Dr. Rincon). All proposed activities will be performed at National Jewish Health, a highly collaborative top-ranked
research institution. Research Project: The primary objective of this proposal is to determine if fibroblast BCL-
2 dependent apoptosis resistance is driven by sustained IL-6 signaling in PPF, and if this IL-6-BCL-2 axis can
be targeted therapeutically to treat PPF. We will use in vitro cell culture and precision cut lung slices from humans
and mice, and in vivo mouse models to determine 1) the effects of IL-6 on BCL-2 expression in fibroblasts during
PPF, 2) the causal role of IL-6 in driving PPF and 3) ability of IL-6 signaling inhibition or genetic knockout to
reduce BCL-2 expression in fibroblasts, induce fibroblast apoptosis and reverse established PPF."
10988604,"Overall Summary/Abstract
This Asthma and Allergic Disease Cooperative Research Center (AADCRC) continues its focus on the
mechanistic basis of respiratory tract type 2 immunopathology (T2I), particularly in aspirin-exacerbated
respiratory disease (AERD), a distinctive clinical syndrome that accounts for a disproportionate percentage of
individuals with severe asthma and recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). In the
current period of support, we discovered marked epigenetically imprinted abnormailites in epithelial basal cell
(BC) function and differentiation underlying CRSwNP and AERD, some of which are driven by strong,
persistent signaling through the interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) and some by altered Wnt/Notch signaling.
We identified dramatic hyperplasia of mast cells (MCs) in CRSwNP tissue, especially from individuals with
AERD, driven in part by a novel, transcriptionally and cytofluorographically distinct MC population with a high
rate of proliferation. We now have strong evidence that MC-stromal interactions drive many pathophysiologic
features of respiratory T2I, and that these interactions are regulated by synergistic inputs from IL-4Rα and IL-
33/ST2 signaling axes. A tightly interactive team of accomplished investigators with complementary skills will
apply cellular, molecular, and whole animal strategies, combined with a proof-of-concept clincal trial to
determine the mechanistic basis for these findings, their relevance to disease pathophysiology, and their
amenability to therapy. Project 1 (J. Boyce, PI) focuses on the the developmental origins of respiratory tract
MCs, how their interactions with stromal cells dictate MC development and function and are altered by IL-4Rα
signaling, and how MCs drive altered stromal cell function through a feed-forward loop involving IL-6 and
leukemia inhibitory factor. Project 2 (N. Barrett, PI) focuses on the mechanisms by which epigenetic
reprogramming of BCs combines with IL-4Rα signaling to drive BC dysplasia and sensecence as a disease-
causing mechanism. Project 3 (T. Laidlaw, PI) will compare the efficacy of IL-4Rα blockade with IL-33
blockade in a proof of mechanism placebo controlled trial, focusing on restoration of BC function and
suppression of MC hyperplasia and activation. The Projects are supported by respective Cores for
Adminstration (Core A), and Integrative Genomics (Core B)."
10988843,"Advanced Imaging Tools to Assess Cancer Therapeutics in Pediatric Patients
Imaging tests are essential for cancer diagnoses in children. However, computed tomography (CT) and
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are associated with considerable radiation exposure. Several large
population studies have demonstrated that cumulative radiation doses from CT scans significantly increase the
risk of children developing leukemia, thyroid cancer, and brain cancer later in life. Thus, there is an urgent
need to reduce the radiation exposure of children caused by medical imaging procedures. To this end, we
have developed a radiation-free imaging test for pediatric tumor staging, based on advanced whole body
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DW MRI) technology. Our team was the first to integrate
tumor physiology information (proton diffusion) with an MRI technique for anatomical orientation (nanoparticle-
enhanced T1-weighted MRI), based on the concept of integrated PET/CT scans (Lancet Oncology). While DW
MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection, the value of DW MRI for cancer
therapy monitoring in children has not yet been extensively studied. Current approaches for assessing tumor
therapy responses in children often measure changes in tumor metabolism using PET after the injection of
radioactive glucose (18F-FDG). Previous comparisons of WB-DW MRI and 18F-FDG PET for cancer therapy
monitoring have been inconclusive, possibly because the scans were not obtained at the same time. Thus,
apparent differences may be due to differences in the timing of the scan. We are in a unique position to
address this problem by simultaneously measuring therapy-induced changes in tumor metabolism and
diffusion in children. These measurements have only recently become possible due to novel integrated
PET/MRI technology, which is available at our pediatric hospital. The overall goal of our project is to
compare the diagnostic value of DW MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET-based imaging tests for tumor
therapy response assessment in children with cancer. In our pursuit of an improved and immediately
clinically applicable approach for a minimally invasive imaging test, we will first apply artificial intelligence
algorithms to develop ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET/MR scans. Next, we will determine the value of ultra-low-
dose 18F-FDG PET and DW-MRI scans for monitoring tumor response to classical chemotherapy: We will
determine which pediatric tumor type should be monitored with 18F-FDG PET only, DW-MRI only or a
combined approach. Finally, we will determine the value of ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET and advanced DW-
MRI techniques for monitoring tumor response to immunotherapies. Both radiation-free WB-DW MRI and ultra-
low-dose 18F-FDG PET/MRI entail significantly less radiation exposure than traditional 18F-FDG PET/CT scans.
The results of this project will yield customized cancer therapy response assessments for children
with substantially reduced radiation exposure compared with current clinical imaging tests, thus
eliminating associated risks of secondary cancer development later in life."
10985951,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Many patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) undergo surgery. Indeed, patients
with ADRD patients account for 25% of patients undergoing hip fracture surgery and 10% of patients
undergoing high risk surgery. However, the extent to which these patients are at higher risk for adverse
postoperative outcomes remains unknown, with existing studies finding conflicting results. Moreover, while
many aspects of the management of these patients, such as the use of certain anesthetic agents and gases,
have been hypothesized to improve or worsen postoperative outcomes, the evidence base in support of these
hypotheses is weak. Our long-term goal is to advance the health of surgical patients with ADRD by developing
individualized models of risk assessment as well as evidence-based guidelines aimed at reducing this risk.
Towards this end, the overall objective of this study is to (a) identify the extent to which surgical patients with
ADRD are at increased risk for adverse postoperative outcomes and (b) estimate the association between
various perioperative interventions (e.g., use of anesthetic gases, choice of discharge location) and the
incidence of adverse postoperative outcomes. Specifically, this study will test the central hypothesis that
surgical patients with ADRD are at increased risk for adverse postoperative outcomes but that appropriate
perioperative interventions can reduce this risk. To assess this hypothesis, this study will use a novel linkage
between two datasets: healthcare claims data and the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), a
large, multicenter registry of surgical cases using data extracted from electronic medical records. This linkage
will produce a unique dataset that unites the best aspects of both datasets: the ability to measure perioperative
care and the ability to follow patients over time to assess outcomes. We will accomplish the project goals
through three specific aims. First, using healthcare claims data, we will evaluate the extent to which patients
with ADRD are at increased risk for worse postoperative outcomes and identify the factors that mediate this
risk. Second, using the linked healthcare claims data-MPOG dataset, we will evaluate the association between
perioperative interventions (e.g., use of anesthetic gases, choice of discharge location) and the incidence of
adverse short-term outcomes. Finally, using the linked healthcare claims data-MPOG dataset, we will evaluate
the association between perioperative interventions and the incidence of adverse medium and long-term
surgical outcomes. The completion of this project will result in a comprehensive understanding of the risks
facing surgical patients with ADRD as well as the interventions that can reduce this risk. In addition, it will also
help identify targets for further study through randomized trials, and influence clinical guidelines and policies
aimed at improving population health outcomes among surgical patients with ADRD. Ultimately, the project is
in line with the agency’s priorities as its successful completion will improve shared decision-making between
clinicians and patients with ADRD and improve healthcare outcomes for surgical patients with ADRD."

The goal of this 5-year research infrastructure development grant (R61/R33) is to substantially strengthen a
small but successful collaborative, international network – the SENSE Network – to accelerate and translate
innovative research in sensory aging, Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and late-life
wellbeing. MPIs of this proposal [Deal, Ehrlich] launched the SENSE Network in September 2020. Despite the
Network’s successes, its growth and objectives have been limited by critical fiscal and organizational barriers.
This proposal aims to address these barriers by growing the Network and undertaking key activities needed to
develop and accelerate the pace of interdisciplinary sensory aging research, a field at the nexus of sensory
health and gerontology. Objectives of the Network include: i) strengthening and expanding the SENSE
Network’s coordination of resources, data, and expertise through an expanded Steering Committee and
creation of Cores (Data Collection, Harmonization, and Integration Core; Research Development and
Mentorship Core; and Dissemination and Translation Core); ii) creating novel integrated and harmonized data
resources that include measures of sensory health and ADRD; iii) generating actionable scientific knowledge
through pilot project awards; iv) supporting and guiding research of early-stage investigators (including with the
lived experience); and v) disseminating and translating new scientific knowledge to inform clinical care,
intervention design, and sensory health and ADRD-related policy. These objectives are directly aligned with
R61/R33 key areas of interest of the NIA Divisions of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) and Geriatrics
and Clinical Gerontology (DGCG), including data infrastructure for longitudinal research; harmonization and
data linkages across multiple data sets; demographic, social, economic, institutional, and geographic factors at
the population level that influence health; and functional independence. The SENSE Network leadership team
is a diverse group of investigators with an extensive track record of collaboration and experience creating
research infrastructure, ensuring that the SENSE Network has the capacity to grow sensory aging research
beyond what can be accomplished by individual experts and research groups. By accelerating and potentiating
the impact of siloed researchers, data sets, and projects, the SENSE Network is poised to take a leading role
in the field of sensory aging and ADRD research, advancing the science through in-depth interdisciplinary
partnerships and collaborations to positively impact the health of older adults in the U.S. and globally."
10991779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), some of the worst prognoses come from comorbidity
with accelerated brain growth, known as disproportionate megalencephaly (DM). ASD-DM is associated with
regressive autism, slower gains in IQ, greater difficulties with expressive language, and more severe cognitive
defects. Recent genome sequencing studies of probands with ASD have identified an excess of rare de novo
heterozygous mutations of genes expressed in early fetal development that impact cell cycle and proliferation.
Although recurrent variants have been identified in a handful of well-known ASD-DM genes, including CHD8
and PTEN, many genes impacted by de novo variants in patients with ASD-DM have never before been
reported, thus requiring sifting through hundreds to thousands of candidate genes with unknown significance.
To ultimately confirm disease genes, experimental validation is necessary. The proposed study hypothesizes
that knockout of ASD-DM candidate gene orthologs will result in alterations in the abundance of specific cell
types in the developing zebrafish brain, reminiscent of those observed in human patients as well as mouse and
cerebral organoid models. Due to their small size, robust reproduction, embryonic transparency, and rapid
development, zebrafish are well suited for functional studies of developmental genes. Although knockouts of
single genes in zebrafish have successfully pinpointed defects, no systematic study characterizing multiple
genes in parallel has been performed for ASD. One limitation is the lack of higher-throughput quantitative
assays to characterize neurodevelopment. Further, very few studies have assessed disease-causing missense
substitutions using fish. The primary goal of the proposed project is to functionally characterize ASD-DM
candidate genes and develop an in vivo strategy to rapidly assay identified patient mutations to measure their
impact on neurodevelopment. To achieve this goal, the project will focus on the following aims: (1)
functionally assay patient loss-of-function and missense variants of unknown significance in the
conserved human/fish ortholog of a single ASD-DM gene, CHD8; and (2) target multiple ASD-DM
candidate genes identified from disease sequencing studies using a higher-throughput gene editing
method to characterize their impacts on brain development in zebrafish. As mutants are identified, future
work includes developing small-molecule screens to rescue quantitative phenotypes of zebrafish carrying
mutations of candidate genes generated from our study. These avenues of research differentiate our use of
zebrafish from ongoing mouse studies. If successful, the developed approaches will significantly improve our
ability to pinpoint disease genes critical in improving diagnostic measures facilitating earlier interventions and

 In the United States, millions of people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year carrying individual,
healthcare, and societal costs greater than $45 billion annually. Mild TBI (mTBI) accounts for more than 75% of
all TBIs, with many individuals sustaining more than one. mTBI patients report post-concussion syndrome (PCS)
symptoms that include sleep disorders (insomnia, daytime sleepiness), somatic symptoms (dizziness, headache,
blurred vision), cognitive complaints (memory, executive function), and emotional problems (anxiety, depression,
irritability, disinhibition). For many, PCS is transient, and still 10-25% report persistent PCS symptoms. The
enigmatic PCS symptom presentation and persistence after mTBI urges investigation into dynamic responses
in the brain that tie acute neurophysiology to behavioral function. The investigative team has refined in vivo
imaging methods of miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood
brain barrier (BBB) permeability in the unrestrained, behaving mouse. New preliminary data leverage the
miniscope headcap to induce impact acceleration (weight drop) closed head injury. The data driving this proposal
show immediate accumulation of fluorescent dextrans in the parenchyma within the field of view. The strength
of this approach eliminates anesthesia during long-duration imaging, permits naturalistic behavior without head
restraint, and locks into a baseplate for repeated imaging of single channel, wide-field, fluorescence. For the first
time, the cumulative effects of TBI on neurophysiology (CBF, BBB permeability, sleep) can be regressed toward
neurobehavioral impairments. The present proposal tests the hypothesis that the cumulative effects of
mTBI on CBF and BBB permeability promote post-traumatic sleep and predict neurological impairments.
Male and female mice are prepared for miniscope imaging through a cranial window and attached baseplate.
The baseplate headcap substitutes for a helmet in closed-head impact acceleration TBI. With a 15 sec transition,
miniscopes visualize CBF and BBB permeability with intraperitoneal dextrans (40-2000 kDa) in vasculature and
parenchyma, respectively. The cumulative effects of mTBI are assessed with impacts delivered twice daily, daily,
or every other day for a week. Aim 1 monitors the cumulative effects of mTBI with varying temporal spacing on
CBF concurrent with post-traumatic sleep and subacute behavioral performance. Aim 2 quantifies the extent of
dextran extravasation with post-traumatic sleep and subacute neurological performance. Neurological outcomes
include anxiety (open field), spatial memory (novel object location), and somatosensory pain (mechanical
hyperalgesia). Twice daily injuries likely show temporal summation of CBF, BBB permeability, and sleep effects,
which are recovered with longer recovery times between injuries. The integration of miniscope imaging and
closed head injury can propel future studies on physiological perturbations and clinical management of TBI."

This exploratory project is a collaboration between Huntington's disease (HD) researchers and BRAIN tool
developers and will utilize novel interventional tools for changing neural circuit dynamics to causally link brain
activity to behavior in the context of HD. Almost 30 years after identifying the genetic mutation causing this
debilitating neurodegenerative disease, treatments remain limited to managing late-stage symptoms of motoric,
psychiatric, and cognitive deficits. Findings from patients and mouse models of HD point to pre-symptomatic
imbalances in neuronal circuit activity, well before any overt symptoms are observed. This project will explore
modulating specific microcircuits in the HD brain using tools developed under the BRAIN initiative. Our central
hypothesis is that manipulating the firing activity within selected microcircuits before the onset of symptoms by
chemogenetic inhibition and/or excitation of key target populations will slow HD disease progression. A crucial
early event in HD is the pathological increase in the overall excitatory output from cortex onto striatum. Underlying
mechanisms could be enhanced excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) and/or decreased inhibition by
cortical parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) that provide the main inhibitory drive onto PNs. Stimulating PVs offers
a physiologically relevant approach, as it restores this critical input while preserving other modulating synaptic
inputs to the PNs (Aim 1). A second, and more direct, correction is to decrease the firing of the PNs themselves
(Aim 2). Finally, a third approach will convert excitatory synapses into inhibitory ones at the PN terminals which
would directly reduce the hyperactivity of specific striatal neurons during the prodromal phase of the disease
process (Aim 3). Our major goal will be to determine which of the three key entry points provides the most
efficacious strategy for preventing or delaying and mitigating the behavioral deficits in the R6/2 transgenic mouse
model of HD. For manipulation of neuronal activity this project will utilize the bioluminescent optogenetic (BL-
OG) platform that employs light emitting luciferases to activate light sensing opsins, including the recently
developed ‘interluminescence’ approach that enables controlling synaptic transmission by expressing the light
emitter and sensor in pre- and post-synaptic partners, respectively. To achieve our goals, we are combining
expertise in circuit manipulation tool development and HD mouse model behavioral research towards a more
refined understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors. At the same time our project will
drive translational progress toward potential novel therapeutic purposes. In addition to the impact on HD research
our results are expected to have a significant impact on approaching other neurodegenerative diseases that
show circuit imbalances."
10991123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding how our brain produces complex feelings, decisions, and behaviors is a daunting task. Each of
the ~130 trillion synapses in the human brain could potentially function as an individual processing unit, yet we
lack methods to study the functional significance of individual synapses within a neural circuit even in
experimentally accessible animals such as the mouse or the fly. Indeed, human genetic studies are now revealing
that mutations that alter the formation or activity of synapses are commonly associated with neurological
conditions ranging from autism spectrum disorder to ADHD to epilepsy. Determining the functional significance
of individual synaptic connections within a circuit could provide insights into the fundamental computations that
underlie brain function and help us better understand the effects of dysfunction. Here, we will use rational
molecular design, in vitro screening, cell culture approaches and functional work in vivo in the Drosophila brain
to develop a new, revolutionary technology that will allow scientists to re-engineer connectivity in the living brain,
preventing the formation of specific synaptic contacts between neurons to test specific hypotheses on circuit
dynamics and behavior. We anticipate that this work will expand our mechanistic understanding of how brain
circuits function in the normal state, as well as allow the design of new experiments that accurately reproduce
synaptic dysfunctions known to underlie human disease."
10995816,"SUMMARY - Subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) occurs in more than half of adults over
50 and progresses in many to clinical ASCVD events such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and limb
ischemia. A key contributor to ASCVD progression is excess inflammation, which persists in 1/3rd of people on
otherwise optimal therapy for ASCVD and confers twice the risk for recurrent ASCVD and death. Yet, although
therapies bluntly targeting inflammation can modestly reduce ASCVD events, off-target effects resulting from
broad and sustained systemic inflammation reduction, such as infection, limit use. These results highlight the
therapeutic potential of inflammation modulation in ASCVD, but also the need for more precise, nuanced
immunologic targets. Experimental findings from our group and others revealed dynamic ways in which immune
cells polarize to favor inflammatory versus inflammation-resolving functions, including via metabolic and
epigenetic rewiring to alter gene expression. Yet, these have largely been limited to experimental models and
small cross-sectional human studies utilizing convenience samples. Meanwhile, studies by our group and others
in large population-based cohorts indicated associations of broad immune cell phenotypes in the blood with
ASCVD, but lacked granular data on cell-level functional heterogeneity within these broad cell subsets. Thus,
there is a critical gap in human data, particularly longitudinal data, on relationships between immune cell
functional polarization and ASCVD; this limits precise insights into immune cell-level features that could be
targeted to modulate inflammation and reduce ASCVD. We propose a translational epidemiologic study
investigating single-cell transcriptomic and gene-regulatory profiles of immune cells in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plaque associated with coronary, carotid, and lower extremity manifestations
of ASCVD. Based on our pilot and prior data, we hypothesize that inflammatory monocyte polarization, as well
as linked epigenetic regulatory elements and glycolytic metabolic preference: (1) precede clinical ASCVD onset
and (2) associate with high-risk plaque morphology and clinical presentation. We investigate this in Aim 1 with
single-cell sequencing and functional metabolic analyses of PBMCs viably preserved from Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants with subclinical ASCVD at baseline who progressed to (cases) versus
remained free from (controls) clinical ASCVD over follow-up. In Aim 2, we analyze immune cells isolated from
the blood and plaque of patients with prevalent clinical ASCVD undergoing carotid or femoral endarterectomy;
we will determine single-cell gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and metabolic polarization associated with
high-risk plaque morphology and clinical presentation, as well as whether these features in plaque are imprinted
in blood. Our pilot data in human PBMCs and plaque inform our approach and feasibility. We expect our findings
of new transcriptional, metabolic, and gene-regulatory immune cell profiles associated with ASCVD will yield
viable targets to modulate human immune cell function and curb inflammation in ASCVD."

Many inflammatory diseases and cancer are driven by dysregulation of CD4 T helper cells (Th cells). Our group
has shown that different T cell subsets utilize distinct metabolic programs. Proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 T cells
utilize aerobic glycolysis and increase lipid synthesis, while anti-inflammatory T regulatory cells (Tregs) utilize
fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Importantly, the lab has shown that manipulation
of metabolic pathways can affect Th cell differentiation, thus offering new approaches to modify immune-related
diseases. Fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism are critical processes that may be targeted to alter CD4 T
cell fate. Utilizing established in vivo CRISPR screens in models of inflammatory bowel disease and lung
inflammation, I identified several metabolic genes involved in lipid metabolism for this potential purpose. These
screens found mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) and the mtFAS enzyme Mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-
coenzyme A reductase (Mecr) to be important in T cell-mediated inflammation. mtFAS is a pathway parallel to
cytosolic fatty acid synthesis that creates acyl-ACP and lipoic acid or longer fatty acid chains crucial for electron
transport chain assembly and OXPHOS. Mecr is the final mtFAS enzyme and humans with MECR loss-of-
function mutations develop a rare neurometabolic disorder. Mechanistically, Mecr-deficient skeletal myoblasts
have reduced OXPHOS and Mecr-knockout in patient fibroblasts and drosophila cause increased levels of iron
and impaired iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. Despite cytosolic fatty acid synthesis being well-characterized
in T cells, it is currently unclear what effect Mecr and mtFAS play in immune cells. Therefore, I proposed studying
the effects of Mecr and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis on T cell function and metabolism. In a Th17 model of
transfer inflammatory bowel disease, Mecr-knockout cells were depleted compared to non-targeting control cells
in the spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, lamina propria, and intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Mecr-knockout cells
had lower Tbet expression and reduced IFNγ+ T cells, showing reduced Th1 function. In addition, Mecr-knockout
cells had reduced proliferation, increased rates of cell death by apoptosis, and an increase in intracellular iron.
These preliminary data demonstrate that Mecr plays a key role in inflammatory T cells as a rate limiting step in
mtFAS. I hypothesize that mtFAS and Mecr activity supports TCA cycle flux and are required for the
mitochondrial metabolism of Th1 CD4+ T cells. I will utilize control and Mecrfl/fl; Cd4cre conditional knockout
mice that I generated and validated for my experiments in which Mecr will be knocked out specifically in T cells.
I have also developed and utilized single-guide CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts for Mecr and have validated their
functionality. I will: (1) Test the requirement of Mecr expression in the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells
in Th1/Th17-driven IBD; and (2) Define the role of Mecr in T cell mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and iron
metabolism. Ultimately, these studies will advance our understanding of mtFAS in T cells and the potential
opportunities to modify this pathway to decrease T cell-mediated inflammation in IBD."

Brain stimulation therapies are important and effective treatments for people with depression and other mental
disorders. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is supporting studies exploring how to make brain
stimulation therapies more personalized and effective while reducing side effects. For all brain stimulation
modalities, computational numerical modeling of the electric, magnetic and acoustic fields within a patient-
specific head model is the leading and most promising way to develop improved spatial targeting methods and
quantitatively determine the required stimulation dose. Similarly, neurophysiological signal analyses require
extensive numerical computational modeling to identify active cortical domains from limited electrode voltage
and magnetometer measurements. The present proposal will facilitate development of fast and accurate brain
and human body modeling methods and techniques via a dedicated and growing computational conference on
Brain and Human Body Modeling. Aligned with NIMH’s mission, the specific aims of this proposal will include the
following:
 (i) Exchanging ideas, method, and approaches on computational modeling electric and magnetic fields within
 the brain targeting neurostimulation modalities (TMS, TES, DBS, tFUS) and associated neurophysiological
 recordings (EEG, iEEG, MEG);
 (ii) Integration of modeling techniques into clinical practice;
 (iii) Hands-on training to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technologies by introducing four dedicated
 workshops in total as an integral part of the conference agenda;
 (iv) Inclusion of industrial participation in the form of dedicated presentations, demonstrations, and
 booths/banners to provide opportunities for training and future high-tech employment of young
 professionals including women and underrepresented populations.
These modeling techniques are aimed to provide better focality, targeting accuracy, and improve the overall
efficiency of brain stimulation methods. They will also support promising combinations and derivatives of the
neuromodulation and neurophysiological recordings such as TMS-EEG and TES-EEG. No established
computational methods for modeling these combined modalities currently exist.
The conference will include related topics that share very similar, sometimes identical, computational methods
and tools. We aim to synergistically share these computational tools for maximal benefit and to facilitate
interactions across disciplines."

The goal of this R21 project is to develop an in vitro salivary gland Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) tissue chip (SSTC)
platform based on microbubble array technology using the MRL/lpr mouse model. SS is an autoimmune disease
characterized by sialadenitis (lymphocytic infiltration) in the salivary glands resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth).
The disease commonly diagnosed in older women suggesting hormones may contribute to the pathogenesis.
Estrogen and androgen receptors are expressed in the salivary gland and on the infiltrated lymphocytic cells.
The proposed SSTC will be used to investigate the effect of in vitro and in vivo exposure to a mixture of endocrine
disrupting chemical (EDCs) on the growth and function of salivary gland tissue mimetics (SGm). RNAseq studies
will be performed on salivary glands to identify differentially regulated gene/pathways associated with sialadenitis
and to discover if oral EDC exposure contributes to disease pathogenesis. This project will develop the first ever
SSTC that can be used for mechanistic studies and future high throughput drug discovery studies. Currently
there are no disease modifying drugs to treat SS patients."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have drastically improved cancer survival over the past decade, but this
survival comes at the cost of a new class of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) characterized by
inflammatory and auto-immune pathologies that occur and persist long after ICI discontinuation. These irAEs
can have major impacts on long-term quality-of-life, but our ability to appropriately address them is limited by
an insufficient understanding of irAE rates and severity profiles. Automated methods to identify and monitor
irAEs could improve clinical care, biomedical research, and pharmacovigilance, however, irAEs are often only
documented in clinical text and cannot currently be automatically extracted from the EHR at scale. The
overarching objective of this proposal is to create applied informatics technologies for cancer surveillance
research and survivorship care in patients treated with ICIs. Our central innovation is the development and
clinical validation of natural language processing methods, particularly neural language models, that can
handle the complexities of the EHR for irAE extraction using unstructured and structured data streams. In
Specific Aim 1, we conduct a clinical trial of informatics-assisted irAE detection from the EHR, measuring
feasibility and effectiveness in improving registration onto Alliance A151804, an NCI cooperative group irAE
biorepository. This will be the first trial of informatics-based adverse event detection for cancer care and a
major step toward clinical translation. In Specific Aim 2, we develop new methods to extract irAEs according to
their severity grade for detailed and standardized computational phenotyping, and perform external validations.
In Specific Aim 3, we optimize generalist large language models for irAE information extraction without task-
specific fine-tuning, including innovative methods to tailor models’ diagnostic reasoning to each patient. This
work is highly significant for developing, applying, and validating informatics methods that take full advantage
of the EHR to support the long-term goal of improving quality-of-life and survival in patients treated with ICIs.
This clinical translational work will be carried out by an expert team of cancer clinicians, clinical trialists,
informaticians, and computer scientists."

Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by disruption of
distal lung architecture that results in scar formation, abnormal gas exchange, and respiratory failure. Barriers
to better IPF outcomes have included an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiologic underpinnings and
a dearth of translationally relevant preclinical models. However, identification of rare genetic variants in the
alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell-restricted Surfactant Protein C (SP-C) gene (SFTPC) in subsets of PF
patients has been part of a paradigm shift in which dysfunctional AT2 cells serve as a proximal driver of IPF.
Coupled with the recent identification of a population of “reprogrammed” AT2 cells in human IPF lungs deficient
in classic AT2 transcriptional programs and enriched in profibrotic mediators, new opportunities are emerging
for therapeutic discovery for IPF. Our prior in vitro modeling demonstrated that IPF-associated SFTPC
mutations produce aberrant SP-C proprotein isoforms that functionally disrupt epithelial cell quality control
(QC) yielding 2 phenotypes: “ER stressed” from misfolding (“BRICHOS”) mutant with activation of all 3
signaling arms (ATF6, IRE1, PERK) of the unfolded protein response (UPR) or impaired autophagy /
mitophagy secondary to proSP-C mistrafficking (“Non-BRICHOS”) mutants. The prior funding period provided
proof of concept for a seminal role for disrupted AT2 QC showing that expression of either non-BRICHOS
(SftpcI73T) or BRICHOS (SftpcC121G) mutants in mouse lung epithelia are each sufficient to evoke a spontaneous
fibrotic phenotype with recapitulation of IPF defining elements. We also showed that SftpcC121G mice develop
marked activation of AT2 UPR with emergence of a reprogrammed transition state. Our Preliminary Data show
that mutant SftpcI73T expression in vivo causes AT2 glycolytic reprogramming, altered mitochondrial dynamics
(biogenesis, fission, and respiration) and emergence of the aberrant AT2 transition state. Thus, this renewal
application now seeks to mechanistically understand how imbalanced UPR signaling and metabolism each
contribute to AT2 reprogramming and promotion of a fibrotic niche. Leveraging our Sftpc mouse PF models,
we will first use mutant SftpcC121G as a model substrate for disruption of proteostasis while genetically and
pharmacologically interrogating UPR signaling focusing on IRE1α and ATF6 to define their impact on AT2
proteostasis, cell states, and progenitor function [Specific Aim 1]. Then using SftpcI73T mice we will define
downstream consequences of disrupted AT2 organellar QC for metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial
dynamics with contextualization of their impact on pathological AT2 endophenotypes and fibrotic remodeling
[Specific Aim 2]. Proof of concept studies for each Aim using patient derived human induced Pluripotent Stem
Cell AT2 (iPSC-AT2) expressing these mutants will provide translation of preclinical data to human disease.
When completed, these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of two understudied pathways in
IPF pathogenesis while providing equipoise and platforms to catalyze discovery and testing of new therapies."

A substantial amount of research over the past 50 years involving Medicare and other health insurance claims
data has focused on evaluating variation in health care use and outcomes across geographic regions. For
example, over the last quarter-century, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has focused on variation in Medicare fee-
for-service health care use for diagnostically defined cohorts of patients, often conditioning on future outcomes
(e.g., death) to account for variation in health status. Numerous other claims studies have also used Medicare
claims data to estimate comparative effectiveness of different treatments and procedures. Almost all of these
types of research studies have used a nationwide measure of health care markets created at Dartmouth known
as “hospital referral regions (HRRs).” These regional markets, and the methodology underlying their
delineation, have remained largely unchanged for nearly 30 years. In addition, because Medicare primarily
covers people aged 65 and over, these regional measures—even at the time—are not representative of the
whole population, leading to questions regarding the external validity of the published results especially given
the tendency to equate such findings with the whole population. Motivated by the recent surge of interest in
health and health care inequities, a growing concern in algorithmic bias, availability of newer and more
extensive data on younger populations, and advances in network and geospatial analysis, this project
proposes to revisit the methodology, definitions, and practical applications of regional and network measures of
health care use and outcomes. These new approaches will avoid the potential biases of prior geographic
measures by better capturing care patterns of underserved populations, and will facilitate geographic variations
and comparative-effectiveness research that overcomes bias and possesses greater statistical power to detect
effects of interest. Secondly, this project will develop new measures that quantify heterogeneity of geographic
and other variations in use and spending across population strata, including disparity indices. Thirdly, this
project will evaluate the bias of Medicare estimates and develop procedures to generalize results to other
populations. Results of all analyses, including the algorithms for HRR delineation, will be used to modernize
statistical and geographic approaches to characterizing health care access and health outcomes. These will be
widely disseminated to research and stakeholder communities, thus empowering public health professionals
and researchers to define analysis and administrative units pertaining to their specific health care systems and
needs. This project will have a major impact on the research communities engaged in the evaluation of
geographic variation in health care delivery and health outcomes."
10980179,"The societal and patient-centered impacts of osteoarthritis (OA) are profound – total costs for OA treatment in
the US exceed $486 billion annually. OA management is limited to symptom management (e.g., pain,
inflammation). As such, OA often progresses to end-stage at which time only surgical options are available in
the form of total joint replacement (TJR). Alarmingly the prevalence of moderate-severe functional limitations 2-
5 years post-surgery remains high (>30%) post TJR. OA is a heritable trait which we recently estimated to be as
high as 50% in Hispanic Veterans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Despite two recent seminal
manuscripts on the genetics of OA, gaps remain in our understanding of the role of specific genetic variation to
OA susceptibility, heterogeneity, and progression. These gaps impede development of personalized approaches
essential for guiding OA risk reduction and therapeutic intervention. Previous research has demonstrated OA
joint site reflects underlying etiological heterogeneity demonstrate distinct genetic region associated with OA at
specific joint sites. Similarly, women are more likely to develop OA however, the MVP is comprised of
predominantly male Veterans limiting power to identify genetic variants which may be sex specific. Our overall
goal is to decipher the genetics of OA susceptibility, heterogeneity, and progression. Toward this goal in
Aim 1, we identify new and fine-map known genetic loci associated with susceptibility to OA and total hip/ total
knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); in Aim 2, we disentangle OA heterogeneity by identifying distinct genetic variation
associated with OA at specific joint sites; and in Aim 3, we identify sexually dimorphic genetic variants associated
with OA in women. We will identify genetic regions associated with OA susceptibility, heterogeneity and
progression enabling risk stratification and in turn advancing patient care."

Substance P is a sensory nerve tachykinin neuropeptide capable of inducing bronchoconstriction and
inflammation. We have recently shown that airway sensory nerve density and neuronal substance P expression
are significantly increased in humans with eosinophilic asthma. We have also demonstrated that mice born to
allergen-sensitized mothers or transgenic mothers with elevated interleukin-5 (a primary cytokine involved in
eosinophil maturation and survival) recapitulate key features of human asthma including increased airway
sensory nerve density and substance P expression. When these offspring are exposed to allergen, they develop
lethal bronchoconstriction that is rescued by antagonists of substance P's target, neurokinin-1 receptors. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that increased airway substance P innervation causes lethal
bronchoconstriction and potentiates eosinophilic inflammation after allergen challenge. In this proposal,
we will determine the mechanism by which substance P mediates these effects using both cre-recombinase and
pharmacologic methodology to 1) test the role of NK1 receptors on specific airway nerve subtypes (sensory and
parasympathetic nerves) and smooth muscle 2) test the role of NK1 receptors and a novel substance P receptor,
MrgprA1, on airway dendritic cells and 3) test the role of NK1 receptors on airway eosinophils both in isolation,
and synergistically with CCR3 (the target of eotaxin, a potent eosinophil chemoattractant). Endpoints include
measurement of airway responsiveness in vivo, eosinophil and dendritic cell activation using flow cytometry, and
quantitative assessments of airway nerve density, substance P expression, and eosinophil and dendritic cell
interactions with nerves using novel 3D confocal microscopy developed by our group. Results will identify novel
pathways and drug targets in severe asthma."

 In most individuals, exercise counters the onset and progression of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and cancers), geriatric syndromes (e.g., frailty), and disability, even
when introduced in later-life. However, the physiological effects conveyed by exercise are highly variable across
individuals. In line with RFA-AG-24-045, this application builds on a robust scientific foundation and will use
innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to critically test the central hypothesis that biological mechanisms of
aging are modulators of exercise response heterogeneity (ERH) in older adults. Our proposal centers on cellular
senescence and epigenetics as causes of ERH in two distinct, clinically meaningful co-primary outcomes:
physical function and insulin sensitivity. Senescence is a cell fate that contributes to age-related tissue pathology
and impairs regeneration. Recently, we characterized hallmarks of cellular senescence in human skeletal muscle
and observed negative associations with measures of physical function and insulin sensitivity. We have also
demonstrated that circulating biomarkers of cellular senescence are associated with deficits in physical function
and are responsive to exercise training. Epigenetic modifications effectively govern transcriptional programs that
regulate cellular homeostasis and adaptations to stimuli. DNA methylation (DNAm) at CpG sites is a key
epigenetic modification that changes radically with advancing age. In skeletal muscle, age-associated alterations
in DNAm affect the expression of genes central to functional and metabolic adaptations to exercise. Based on
these observations, we will conduct a randomized, two-site clinical trial of a 6-month structured progressive
resistance training intervention (n = 200) and a health education intervention (HE) (n = 100) to define the ERH
in physical function (Specific Aim 1) and insulin sensitivity (Specific Aim 2) in community dwelling older (³ 65
years) women and men with evidence of mobility limitations. We will use state-of-the-art molecular profiling to
rigorously examine cellular senescence and DNAm in skeletal muscle in parallel with their blood-based
biomarkers. Through predictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity, we will examine how these
biological mechanisms, key clinical variables (sex, BMI, comorbid conditions, medications, depression, and
fatigue), and behavioral factors (nutrition, habitual physical activity, sleep, fatigue, and depressive symptoms),
and their interactions, mediate ERH."
10979395,"The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising rapidly worldwide. In the U.S., this cancer is
growing at a rate faster than that of any other cancer. New biomarkers specific for HCC tissue targets are
critically needed to develop improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and better manage the increasing
tumor burden. While alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is a common serological marker for HCC, no tissue targets are
currently being used as imaging biomarkers to detect this tumor, which is growing rapidly in incidence.
Individual HCC cells will be evaluated using scRNA-seq with trajectory analysis to identify promising early-
stage targets that are highly specific for this tumor. This methodology will examine the molecular pathogenesis
that drives hepatocyte transformation to identify promising imaging biomarkers that can accurately distinguish
malignant from benign lesions in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Antibodies are large in
dimensions, and have reduced ability to extravasate from vasculature, diffuse and penetrate into tumor, and
clear from interstitial space, resulting in higher background. Peptides are much smaller in size and lower in
molecular weight. The diminutive dimensions can overcome irregular microvasculature, heterogeneous uptake,
and transport barriers found in HCC tumors. These protein fragments can extravasate through leaky tumor
microvasculature for deeper penetration and better access to tumor targets. Peptides have less potential for
immunogenicity, allowing for repeat use. Conventional ligands are being developed for specific binding to single
targets only. This strategy is limited in effectiveness for heterogeneous tumor cell populations, such as HCC.
Monomer peptides will be arranged in a multimer configuration to produce multivalent ligand-target
interactions. Increased sensitivity occurs from simultaneous detection of multiple targets. Greater specificity
arises from the multimer binding to a larger combined target epitope. Cancer targets may be detected at lower
levels of expression, and at an earlier time point. Peptides specific for GPC3, CD44, and EpCAM will be used
as an initial demonstration. Peptides specific for new early-stage HCC targets identified from scRNAseq will
be identified and inserted. The multimer will be labeled with Gd-Dota for in vivo use to detect HCC tumors
using MR imaging, and will be labeled with IRDye800 for optical imaging with laparoscopy. Cell-derived and
subcutaneous tumor models do not accurately reflect the molecular and genetic profile and vascular delivery of
human disease. A pre-clinical model of HCC using patient-derived tumor specimens will be implanted in an
orthotopic location to validate specific multimer uptake. These tumors provide clinically relevant molecular and
genetic profiles. Tumor implantation in the orthotopic location provides vascular delivery with intact stroma and
vasculature that is representative of the clinical scenario. Success completion of the proposed aims will result
in a peptide multimer that will be validated in an advanced pre-clinical model for early cancer detection that
reflects the heterogeneity and variability of cell surface targets expressed by HCC."

Lassa virus (LASV) infection causes Lassa Fever (LF), a hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. Up to
30% of LASV infection survivors develop sudden onset hearing loss after clearing the initial acute disease, and
in some cases also develop dizziness and imbalance, similar to labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis or idiopathic
sudden sensorineural hearing loss, all of which are diseases with unknown etiology seen worldwide. Viral
infection is speculated to play a role. However, the responsible virus nor the molecular mechanism leading to
dizziness is unknown. The aim of this project is to investigate how the vestibular processing is affected leading
to dizziness or balance problems after a viral infection using the LF model mice. Our short-term goal for this
proposal is 1) to characterize the vestibular behavioral and cellular changes in LF model mice, and 2) to
determine the most effective treatment/prevention modality for the balance dysfunction in LF model mice. Our
long-term goal is to use this general model to determine the mechanisms leading to balance dysfunction after a
viral infection, and to develop effective prevention and treatment methods in humans. Specific Aim 1:
Characterize vestibular histopathology of LF model mice as a function of time lapse after infection. We will
determine the onset, degree, location of the damage at timepoints starting at 2 days to 90 days post-infection
in association with vestibular behavior changes in rotarod, balance beam in Biosafety Level-4 environment.
Specific Aim 2: Characterize balance dysfunction in the LF surrogate model ML29 infected mice. We will use
the LF surrogate model ML29 infected mice to perform in-depth vestibular behavioral tests in the Biosafety
Level-2 environment. We will contrast vestibular ocular reflex tests with rotarod test, balance beam test and
gross vestibular behavioral tests in mice infected with LASV and ML29, and determine the histological changes
in the inner ear associated with vestibular dysfunction in ML29 infected mice. Histopathology analysis will focus
on changes in spatial and planar anatomical changes using 3-D anatomical mapping of the inner ear vestibular
organs using tissue clearing in addition to thin sections. Specific Aim 3: Determine the modality and timing of
treatment to improve balance performance outcome. We hypothesize that damage to the inner ear after
infection with LASV causes mechanical damage in early timepoints whereas immune mediated damage is
triggered in association with the mechanical damage at later timepoints. We will determine the difference in
response after systemic or intratympanic administration of immunosuppressive agents or hyperbaric oxygen
treatment at early and later timepoints after LASV infection. Our project is innovative because we will assess
novel animal models of viral infection induced balance dysfunction that likely shares the same pathophysiology
with labyrinthitis/vestibular neuritis in humans."

As such, the prognosis of patients with ischemic AKI remains poor, and patients that recover from AKI are at increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Red blood cell (RBC) trapping is a hallmark of severe ischemic AKI in humans and in animal models of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The outer-medullary (OM) capillaries drain into the large veins of the kidney cortex. Red blood cell (RBC) trapping in the kidney OM occurs due to a combination of collapse of these large cortical veins during ischemia, along with, the continued entry of blood into the OM capillaries. As blood continues to enter the OM, it is unable to drain, expanding and engorging these capillaries with blood. The increasing OM capillary hydrostatic pressure then forces extravasation of the plasma, leaving behind aggregates of tightly packed RBCs with little or no plasma separating them. Our recently published data indicate that RBC trapping results in devastating kidney injury early in reperfusion, including distal tubular heme cast formation and denudation of the OM tubules. As injury from RBC trapping mimics many of the pathological features of ischemic AKI observed in humans, understanding the processes driving injury from RBC trapping may be critical to understanding the pathogenesis of AKI in humans. The goals of this proposal are to address key gaps in our knowledge regarding the central role of OM RBC trapping in mediating ischemic AKI and to identify novel approaches to limit kidney injury from RBC trapping. Our central hypothesis is that ‘RBC trapping in the OM microvasculature results in the extravasation of toxic heme from RBC congested vessels, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, tubular injury and loss of kidney function. Denudation of the OM tubules and incomplete recovery of the tubular epithelium then results in the unobstructed back-leak of filtrate into the blood, greatly reducing urine output, despite maintenance of glomerular filtration. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that RBC trapping induces tubular injury and cell sloughing, resulting loss of kidney function. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the extravasation and tubular uptake of heme from RBC is driven by high intravascular pressures in RBC congested OM vessels and tubular endocytosis. Our novel approach will, for the 1st time, allow us to investigate the effects of RBC trapping on kidney function at key early time points. Our findings have the potential to explain the synergistic effect of kidney ischemia and high cell-free hemoglobin on kidney injury in ischemic AKI. The impact of our research will be a change in the conceptual basis for the treatment of AKI by establishing RBC trapping and tubular heme toxicity as a primary mechanism driving OM injury and nephron loss in ischemic AKI."

Parental behavior is the hallmark feature of all mammals, and is critical to the health of both parents and
offspring. In the majority of mammals, since only the female can lactate, it is the mother who provides maternal
care and protection of the young. Inadequate maternal care can adversely influence the development of the
offspring and impair their health in adulthood. However, the neurobiological mechanisms for the regulation of
maternal behavior remain to be fully understood. In women who exhibit impaired bonding with their infants, we
identified several loss-of-function mutations in the TRPC5 gene, which encodes the TRPC5 ion channel, a
transient receptor potential channel that conducts calcium inward currents. We used the CRISPR-Cas9
approach to generate a knock-in mouse line that mimics one such human mutation, Trpc5K34del, and found that
this mutation causes severe impairments in a wide range of maternal behaviors in mouse dams, including
ignoring pups, reduced nursing/crouching, inefficient retrieval, disrupting nests, and impaired prolactin release
upon suckling. These findings demonstrate that intact Trpc5 function is required for normal maternal behavior,
but the neurobiological mechanisms for its effect remain unclear. One objective is to test a hypothesis that
Trpc5 maintains maternal behavior via activating oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus, which have been implicated in maternal behavior and mother-infant bonding. The second
objective is to test whether Trpc5 acts upon dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra to provide a redundant or
complementary mechanism to regulate maternal behavior. Finally, we will evaluate whether a Trpc5 activator
can ameliorate impaired maternal behavior in wild-type dams induced by psychological stress. Our work,
combining human genetic and mouse genetic experiments, has provided evidence to identify a novel molecular
basis underlying normal maternal behavior. As a logical extension of this initial and exciting discovery, we will
continue to unravel the neurobiological mechanisms by which Trpc5 maintains normal maternal behavior during
the postpartum period and will provide pre-clinical evidence to identify Trpc5 as a potential target improve
maternal care."

The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying luminal-to-neuroendocrine
transdifferentiation (NET) of prostate cancer (PCa). NET underlines the critical progression of prostate
adenocarcinoma (AdPC) to neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC), a lethal disease with no cure. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms that drive NET may pave the way to discovering critical druggable steps and identifying
biomarkers of NEPC progression. In our preliminary studies, we generated a model system where we push the
prostate luminal epithelial cell LNCaP towards NE cell type over a period of 28 days via the overexpression
(OE) of a single gene FOXA2, a chromatin-pioneering factor. Time-course RNA-seq analyses of FOXA2-OE
cells revealed a gradual loss of epithelial gene expression and gain of NE transcriptional program. This
transcriptomic shift is accompanied by substantial alterations in TF binding and chromatin remodeling at
luminal and NE enhancers, accompanied by remarkable changes in DNA methylation and 3D chromatin
architecture. Interestingly, FOXA2 induced the transcription of a neural TF called NKX2-1 on day 14 (D14) of
OE, and the expression of NKX2-1 is required for the completion of FOXA2-driven NET. Further, NKX2-1 and
FOXA2 bind to promoters and enhancers, respectively, and they interact with each other through chromatin
looping to co-occupy active enhancers. Further, we found regional DNA demethylation around FOXA2-binding
sites and a remarkable up-regulation of TET1, the key enzyme that catalyzes DNA demethylation, on D14
following FOXA2 OE. These preliminary data lead to our central hypothesis that enhancer-bound FOXA2
interacts with promoter-bound NKX2-1 to drive luminal-to-NE transdifferentiation, involving 3D chromatin
reorganization and enhancer priming and activation, which requires regional DNA demethylation mediated by
TET1. To test these hypotheses, Aim 1 will first determine whether the abilities of NKX2-1 to bind DNA and
interact with FOXA2 are both required for its role in facilitating FOXA2-induced NET and then validate this
pathway in additional NEPC models. Aim 2 will evaluate whether TET1 induction at D14 is required for FOXA2-
driven NET through modulating regional DNA demethylation and NE enhancer priming. Lastly, Aim 3 will
validate the genomic and epigenomic reprogramming in clinical samples by comparative analyses of the
spatial transcriptome, whole-genome DNA methylation, and 3D chromatin structure in AdPC vs. NEPC
samples. We will also examine the downstream genes regulated by a TET1 inhibitor and test its efficacy in
suppressing NEPC growth in vitro and in vivo."
10982231,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Roughly
8% of mCRCs harbor a mutation in BRAF, associated with the worst prognosis and poor response to treatment.
Limitations of standard of care (SOC) therapies targeting BRAF + EGFR include a response rate of 20% and
short time to cancer progression. Results of our original R01 underscore that mCRC is not dominated by
individual oncogenes, rather is mediated by the concerted upregulation of multiple signaling pathways. A key
discovery was a reversible SRC-relayed COX2-inflammatory program that drives resistance to BRAF + EGFR
inhibition (Nature Cancer 2023). Addition of the COX2 inhibitor (COX2i), celecoxib, consistently resulted in more
durable suppression of tumor growth in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Furthermore, promising
orthogonal mechanisms of resilience to SOC therapy emerged: a CDK1/2 pathway identified from the
reprogrammed kinome of residual PDX tumors, as well as a BCL-XL driven anti-apoptotic state and a pro-survival
IL8/CXCR2 autocrine loop. With our original R01, we discovered a strategy to improve duration of disease
control; with our R01 Renewal, our translational goals are to manage BRAFV600E mCRC as a chronic disease, to
increase response rate, and trigger tumor cell elimination. Our approach for this proposal is to test the
hypothesis that BRAFV600E mCRC tumors engage a specific set of stress response programs that enable
cancer cells to adapt and survive under therapeutic pressure and represent druggable vulnerabilities. In
Aim 1, we will probe converging phospho-signaling circuits that regulate response to combination therapies
using kinome profiling tools (high-throughput kinase-activity mapping, inhibitor-bead mass spectrometry) and
advanced computational modeling to map the phospho-signaling circuits of banked, residual PDX tumors treated
with SOC ±COX2i ±CDK1/2i. Aim 2 will elucidate core mechanisms of resilience to therapeutic pressure, utilizing
BH3-profiling to define the intracellular mechanisms promoting persistence of tumor cells and identify anti-
apoptotic factors; ELISA and antibody arrays to characterize the autocrine mechanisms that prime BRAFV600E
mCRC to survive drug treatments; and multiplex immuno-fluorescence to quantify the co-expression and
subcellular localization of key, pro-survival proteins in therapy-resistant PDX tumors. The purpose of Aims 1 and
2 is to reveal how therapeutic pressure induces adaptive stress responses that converge on a few critical
signaling hubs, which can be leveraged as drug targets and tested in in vitro models. In Aim 3, we will test
combinations and sequencing strategies with highest clinical potential in PDX models: promising candidates
from our original R01 and additional targets uncovered in Aims 1-2 will be evaluated in therapeutic switch
approaches (i.e., next-line regimen and de-escalation strategy), and new rational combinations including BH3-
mimetic drugs (e.g., BCL-XLi) to induce tumor killing. Our ultimate objective is to meaningfully improve survival
of patients with BRAFV600E mCRC by preventing drug resistance and maximizing therapeutic response."
10981346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading cause of stroke and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. AF is
highly associated with conditions that elevate intracardiac pressure, such as hypertension and heart failure.
Cardiac pressure overload induces electrical and structural changes in the left atrium (LA) in a process known
as atrial remodeling that creates the substrate for AF. There are currently no therapies that directly address the
underlying atrial remodeling process. To address this critical unmet need, we focused on signaling pathways
essential for atrial development to identify novel therapeutic targets. We found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA),
a vitamin A derivative that is essential for atrial development, can prevent and reverse atrial remodeling in a
cardiac pressure overload model. Comparative left atrial transcriptomic analysis revealed that ATRA treatment
normalizes important metabolic pathways, atrial developmental pathways, rapid conduction genes, and reduces
pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways. Single nuclear sequencing analysis shows that ATRA changes the
population of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory subtype to a reparative subtype. ATRA can also protect
against atrial fibrosis in a non-pressure overload mouse model of AF. ATRA is FDA approved for the treatment
of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We found that ATRA therapy improves atrial conduction parameters in
APL patients at one month of treatment. Our findings strongly support ATRA as a powerful new treatment that
can reverse atrial remodeling for the prevention of AF."
10981347,"This is a service-user informed mixed-methods study of the implementation and impacts of the Certified
Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) program in New York State. CCBHCs are comprehensive
outpatient behavioral health clinics that were originally authorized by Congress in 2014, through a federal
demonstration project. Since that time, the original program has been extended, and a new form of CCBHC,
which includes the same mix of services but not the original program’s innovative payment model, has been
introduced. The model is slated, through recent legislation, for national expansion. Yet, assessment of the
impacts of CCBHCs has been limited. Differences between the two models, the perception of the models by
service users, and the impacts of the models on acute care utilization and quality of care are not well studied.
No studies have compared effects of the two types of CCBHCs, which is critical for understanding the role of
the payment model and the potential impact of future payment reforms. No studies of CCBHCs have involved
service users in the research team to ensure that service user perspectives are represented in all aspects of
the research. New York State is an ideal setting in which to study CCBHCs because of the large number of
different types of CCBHCs and the unique institutional and data resources available in the state.
 The study has three components. First, the study will assess implementation of the CCBHC model
through qualitative interviews with administrators, clinicians and peer support staff in the clinics, clinic surveys,
and administrative data related to staffing and salaries. This component of the study will provide rich
description of how the clinics changed when they became CCBHCs, how they have maintained those changes
over time, and how the two types of CCBHCs differ from each other. Information on implementation of the
models from this component will inform the design and content of the other two components. Second, we will
investigate the perspectives of the people who receive services in CCBHCs on the impact that the model has
had on them. This component will involve interviews with service users at a diverse set of CCBHCs as well as
site visits to a subset of clinics to conduct direct observations and hold in-person discussions with staff and
service users. Third, the study will use Medicaid claims data to examine the impact that the CCBHCs have had
on utilization of acute mental health services, such as visits to an emergency room for a mental health
problem, and quality of care, such as appropriate monitoring of metabolic indicators for patients on
antipsychotic medications.
 The study will provide needed evidence on the diverse impacts of the CCBHC models on core
outcomes along with rich contextual information to assist in interpreting the findings to inform further
implementation and modification of the program in NYS and other states."
10981407,"ABSTRACT. Childhood social anxiety is highly prevalent and impairing; in severe cases it can lead to school
refusal and social isolation and is often comorbid with other mental and physical health problems posing a
significant public health burden. Although exposure to environmental toxicants have not commonly been
thought of as contributors to mental health problems, epidemiologic studies have linked prenatal exposure to
ambient air pollution with increased risk for anxiety symptoms and disorders. Children living in the context of
economic disadvantage are at disproportionately higher risk for anxiety and exposure to air pollution. This
proposal integrates findings from environmental health sciences and developmental psychology/neuroscience
and proposes a novel framework detailing the pathway through which prenatal exposure to air pollution
contributes to social anxiety symptoms (SAS) in children who are most at risk. In animal models, prenatal
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) – a common class of neurotoxic air pollutants – causes
increased avoidance behaviors, analogous to human behavioral inhibition (BI), a well-documented risk factor
for SAS. Prenatal PAH exposure also alters children’s cognitive control, which in turn increases SAS risk in
children with BI. We have linked prenatal exposure to PAH with BI-like behaviors in infants and children and
with internalizing symptoms and altered cognitive control. We now propose to test the overarching hypothesis
that (1) prenatal PAH exposure is linked with SAS via effects on BI-like behaviors and (2) that prenatal PAH
exposure alters neural function underlying cognitive control, and (3) moderates the association between PAH,
BI, and SAS. We will conduct our study in 200 Black and Latinx children living in the context of economic
disadvantage who are followed in a prospective longitudinal birth cohort at the Columbia Center for Children’s
Environmental Health. Using EEG to measure alterations in brain function associated with PAH exposure will
allow us to show effects of air pollution on children's task-related brain function (versus structure) for the first
time and at very early time points (preschool age) when intervention and prevention may be most effective.
Findings will identify modifiable factors (air pollution) that can be targeted to deliver maximally effective
personalized prevention strategies. Future studies can leverage our findings to develop personalized
prevention strategies targeted to help children from marginalized groups who are at greatest risk for exposure
and poor mental health outcomes."
10981906,"Myocardial infarction (MI) from coronary artery obstruction affects more than 1 million people annually in the
United States resulting in symptoms, reduced quality of life, and substantially increased risk of heart failure and
sudden death. Rapid diagnosis on electrocardiography and treatment with percutaneous intervention (PCI) are
essential to minimize the risk and size of permanent myocardial injury as well as the risks of ischemia or
reperfusion triggered malignant arrhythmia. Ironically, restoration of blood flow to infarcting myocardium can
result in reperfusion injury and expand infarct size. Recent data from animal studies suggest that reperfusion
injury may promote lipomatous metaplasia (LM) or intra-myocardial fat deposition. LM has been shown to
associate with negative cardiac remodeling, leading to worsening heart function and higher chances for
congestive heart failure. We have shown that LM is prevalent but highly variable in distribution among patients
with prior MI and ubiquitous among those presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT). We have also shown
that corridors critical to VT circuitry traverse infarcted tissue through or near LM. The latter association appears
to be mediated by prolonged local action potential duration, reduced conduction velocity, as well as increased
regional resistance and reduced current loss as impulses traverse corridors adjacent to LM. In prior studies, we
have also shown that reperfusion injury, the apparent precursor to LM, can be quantified by cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) as pathologic iron deposition, and is present in most patients despite nominally successful
reperfusion. However, the association of reperfusion injury with LM incidence and progression in humans have
not yet been defined. Additionally, no prospective study has evaluated the longitudinal evolution of scar, LM,
and viable tissue architecture with the incidence of VT. Thus, we propose a prospective observational study of
175 patients <2 months since PCI for acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) that undergo CMR at baseline, and at 1-
and 2-years’ follow-up. Using data from this cohort we will test the following premises: 1. That LM incidence
occurs early post STEMI and that its volumetric progression is associated with time since reperfusion; 2. That
the extent of LM is associated with reperfusion injury following PCI for STEMI; and 3. That LM precedes and
predicts the incidence of sustained VT following MI. Our group has extensive experience with STEMI and VT
management, image acquisition and analysis, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The findings of this study will
have wide applicability to our mechanistic understanding and management of cardiac remodeling and VT."
10982435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer treatment has been transformed by a class of drugs, that includes Keytruda and Opdivo, that enables
the immune system to recognize and selectively kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, many cancers are refractory to
such immuno-oncology (IO) drugs, and so developing novel approaches to augment their efficacy is a high
priority, as these
would undoubtedly lead to a significant reduction in disease mortality. One potentially promising
way to achieve this is to promote the transcriptional reactivation of ancient endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and
retrotransposons in cancer cells beyond a threshold level of tolerance such that they elicit an immune response,
an approach termed “viral mimicry”. Cancer cells with reactivated ERVs/retrotransposons phenotypically
resemble virus-infected cells and are subsequently recognized and killed by cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK)
cells. We discovered that histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 is a key component of an enzymatic complex that
is essential for the transcriptional silencing of ERVs/retrotransposons in cancer cells. SUV39H1 targeting
reactivated ERVs/retrotransposons in cancer cells, leading to stimulation of intracellular antiviral pathways and
interferon (IFN) signaling. In preclinical studies, SUV39H1 inhibition stimulated the intra-tumoral infiltration of
cytotoxic T/NK cells (i.e., converted “cold” tumors to “hot”), and sensitized refractory tumors to immune
checkpoint therapy. SUV39H1 targeting also exhibited stand-alone antitumor activity by inducing replication
stress and double-strand-breaks (DSB) in cancer cells, presumably by promoting transcription-replication fork
conflicts at reactivated ERVs/retrotransposons. Importantly, SUV39H1 inhibition had no effect on
ERV/retrotransposon silencing in normal cells, indicating a therapeutic window for cancer treatment.
The overall objective of this project is to discover potent and selective SUV39H1 inhibitors with properties suitable
to definitively test our hypothesis that such compounds would be powerful stand-alone antitumor drugs and
immunomodulators. In preliminary studies, we profiled the properties of known SUV39H1/H2 inhibitors (chemical
probes) and provide data from a 1536-well TR-FRET assay that demonstrates robustness and readiness for a
high throughput screen (HTS). Our research plan to advance these preliminary studies has four aims: Aim 1 will
identify selective SUV39H1 hit scaffolds from a 320,000 compound HTS campaign. Aim 2 will utilize a structure-
based design approach to convert a clinical grade SUV39H2 inhibitor into potent SUV39H1-selective
compounds. Aim 3 will use biochemical and ADME assays and iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry to identify
lead compounds with potent cellular activity. Aim 4 will further optimize these leads to compounds with drug-like
properties and explore their stand-alone antitumor and immunomodulatory effects using in vivo cancer models.
The resulting drug leads developed from this study are anticipated to have broad utility to test our therapeutic
hypothesis and represent a critical step in our overall objective to develop SUV39H1 inhibitors as therapeutics
for cancer patients, and specifically those with tumors refractory to IO regimes."
10981265,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health burden and affects an estimated 10% of the population
worldwide. CKD is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), hospitalization, and premature
death. There are only few therapies available to reduce remission, but progression of the disease and its
vascular complications can be delayed with access to timely and accurate diagnostics and early treatment.
Without diagnostic pathology assessment of kidney biopsy tissue, the underlying disease process and extent
of microvascular damage are frequently unknown in an individual patient as the main measures used to
diagnose and stage CKD – the estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria – do not provide insight on
underlying histopathologic changes and have limitations related to specificity and diagnostic accuracy.
However, pathologist assessment of biopsy tissue is costly, impacted by inter-rater variability, and not available
for many patients at a global level.
 Computer-vision, a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses computer systems to derive meaningful
information from digital images, can help to overcome these limitations. In this proposal, we will utilize an
advanced form of machine learning (a branch of AI that allows computers to learn without being explicitly
programmed) known as deep learning (artificial neural networks that search for common characteristics to
organize data) to associate image-derived features from digitized kidney biopsies with clinical phenotypes. We
will perform the following tasks: 1) develop and validate an automated assessment of kidney vascular
pathology and risk of adverse cardiovascular events, and 2) integrate the information from digital pathology,
clinical parameters, and CKD proteomics (7,000+ proteins) into a larger prediction framework. Deep learning
algorithms will be developed using the Boston Kidney Cohort, a prospective cohort study of individuals with
biopsy-confirmed kidney disease, and validated in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project and the Boston
Medical Center CKD Cohort. The Principal Investigator of this study, Dr. Insa Schmidt, is an early-stage career
investigator with prior research experience in kidney disease epidemiology, biomarkers, and -omics analysis.
With this K01, Dr. Schmidt plans to expand her research beyond biomarkers and epidemiology to encompass
applied data science, to be able to analyze far larger datasets that are expected to play a major role in clinical
research and nephrology. Dr. Schmidt will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship and advisory team,
comprising experts in data science, kidney pathology, omics integration, and biostatistics. Training in these
fields will be facilitated through a combination of formal coursework, seminars, and mentored research
experience. Completion of the research and training proposed in this K01 will position Dr. Schmidt to reach her
long-term career goal to become an independent investigator with expertise in combining epidemiologic tools
with machine learning techniques to improve the lives of patients with kidney and cardiovascular disease."
10981296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year, over 200,000 Americans suffer from global cerebral ischemia associated with cardiac arrest leading
to cognitive deficits or death. While emergency treatments of cardiac arrest focus on restoring cardiac function
and blood flow, an effective therapeutic treatment for neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with
global cerebral ischemia is a crucial unmet medical need. Although the entire brain is deprived of oxygen, global
ischemia causes selective, delayed death of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, which in turn induces severe
deficits in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology
of global ischemia are unclear, the long delay between insult and neuronal death is consistent with a role for
transcriptional changes. In preliminary studies, we performed RNA-seq using next generation Massively parallel
sequencing to investigate alterations of gene expression in post-ischemic hippocampal CA1 in rats. Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that `Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) signaling' and
`Neuroinflammation' are the top canonical pathways. TREM1 is an inflammatory type I membrane receptor
expressed in myeloid lineage and known to magnify the proinflammatory innate immune response. Evidence
implicates a proinflammatory role of TREM1 in inflammatory diseases, cancer, and other brain diseases,
however, the role of TREM1 in global cerebral ischemia associated with cardiac arrest remains unknown. Our
preliminary confocal imaging showed that TREM1 is activated in CD11b positive immune cells but not in neurons
or astrocytes in hippocampal CA1 after global ischemia. IPA analysis further identified BRD4 and p300 as
upstream effectors which are recently reported as epigenetic regulators of TREM1 in inflammatory related
diseases. We also validated both proteins are increased in TREM1 positive cells in post-ischemic hippocampal
CA1 and upregulated TREM1 expression was rescued by a BRD4 inhibitor. Importantly, our preliminary data
showed that TREM1 peptide inhibitors LR12 and GJ073, and BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 attenuate global ischemia-
induced neuronal death. The overall objectives of this proposal are to determine the pathological importance of
TREM1 and mechanisms of TREM1-mediated neuroinflammation in global ischemia-induced neuronal death, and
establish inhibitors of TREM1 and its upstream BRD4 as novel therapeutic agents to improve outcomes in global
ischemia. The central hypothesis is that global ischemia activates neuroinflammation by epigenetic regulation of
TREM1 in hippocampal CA1 and that inhibition of TREM1 signaling rescues neurons against global ischemic
insults. We seek to test this hypothesis as described in the following Specific Aims; Aim 1. Determine the
pathological importance of TREM1 in global cerebral ischemia. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which global
ischemia activates TREM1 mediated neuroinflammation. Aim 3. Evaluate the ability of TREM1 and BRD4 inhibitors
as potential therapeutic agents to rescue neurons against global ischemic insults."
10981298,"Project Summary: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the immune-mediated loss of insulin-producing
β-cells in the islet. Loss of the peri-islet ECM has been well documented in recently diagnosed patients with T1D
and is associated with increased insulitis and β-cell death. In pre-symptomatic T1D, β-cell dysfunction and ER
stress occur prior to significant immune cell infiltration. Our preliminary results indicate that cytokine-stressed β-
cells express ECM degrading enzymes (including MMPs) that may contribute to loss of the peri-islet ECM prior
to the onset of insulitis and may facilitate infiltration of autoreactive immune cells and β-cell death. In the early
stages of T1D, islet infiltration correlates with loss of peri-islet laminin-10. Our preliminary data suggests that
loss of islet interactions with laminin-10 increases cytokine-induced death and increases the activity of protein
kinase C δ (PKCδ), where we have recently identified increases in PKCδ activity as a critical mediator of β-cell
death. Additionally, previous studies have shown that islet interactions with laminin increase glucose stimulated
insulin secretion (GSIS) via increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and mediate mitochondrial morphology
and function. Taken all together, this supports a role for loss of peri-islet laminin-10 in contributing to T1D
pathogenesis. We hypothesize that cytokine-stressed β-cells contribute to loss of the peri-islet ECM in
early T1D leading to decreases in β-cell function and survival. We propose the following 2 aims: 1)
Determine if cytokine-stressed β-cells degrade the peri-islet ECM in early T1D, and 2) Determine if loss of
laminin-10 interactions regulates islet survival and function in early T1D. Experiments for both aims will utilize
mouse and human islets encapsulated in a novel 3D biomimetic scaffold with laminin-10, as well as human
pancreas sections from the nPOD program. Aim 1 will determine if β-cell mediated degradation of the peri-islet
ECM precedes the onset of T1D. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying islet dysfunction
and death with loss of peri-islet laminin-10 in T1D. The successful completion of this project will define a new
role for the β-cell in degrading the peri-islet ECM in early T1D that contributes to altered islet function and
survival. Our results will challenge the current paradigm that β-cells are innocent bystanders in T1D onset and
will provide novel therapeutic targets to halt immune infiltration of the islet and improve islet function and survival."
10982250,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aging is associated with a striking increase in the incidence of stroke, which is a major cause of disability among
those aged 65 years and older. Effective therapeutics for stroke remain a pressing need for elderly Americans.
Ischemic stroke is caused by an occlusion of a cerebral artery leading to neuronal cell death and blood-brain
barrier (BBB) disruption while inducing a systemic signaling cascade of reactions in the blood, “stroke-induced
blood dyscrasia (SIBD)” and causing long-term disability in elderly stroke patients. BBB disruption and SIBD
exacerbate brain injury and neurological outcomes, and SIBD is more severe in elderly patients. We have shown
that blood substitution (BS) reduces neutrophils and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the blood, protects
BBB integrity, ameliorates SIBD, decreases infarct volume and mortality, and improves neurological deficits in
the acute phase after stroke. Increased BBB permeability assessed using MRI persists in the acute phase after
stroke in patients and focal stroke mice. We have discovered that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos) in cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CECs) plays a critical role in the maintenance of BBB integrity.
Dysfunctional mitochondria in CECs cause BBB dysfunction and induce SIBD, which results in leukocytes
infiltrating through the BBB leading to exacerbation of the brain injury after stroke and contributing to long-term
functional disability. We have found a mitochondrial membrane protein is nearly absent in the CECs of brains
from stroke patients and focal ischemic stroke mice. MMP-9, a proteinase mainly secreted by activated
neutrophils, is associated with BBB leakage, extracellular matrix degradation, and infarct evolution after stroke.
During the acute phase after stroke, neutrophils adhere to the CECs where they release MMP-9. Aging correlates
with MMP-9 levels in both stroke patients and animal studies. We have found that MMP-9 degrades the
mitochondrial membrane protein in cultured CECs. Further, we have designed peptides (stable binding models
shown with MMP-9 crystal 3D structure) to block MMP-9 activity in CECs. As we have recently developed an
aptamer targeting CECs specifically, we have further designed the conjugates of CEC-specific aptamer with
peptides to preserve mitochondrial membrane protein specifically in CECs in vivo. The central hypothesis is that
BS therapy reduces stroke severity by removing neutrophils and MMP-9 in the blood thereby preserving
mitochondrial membrane protein from degradation in CECs after stroke. To test the hypothesis, we will employ
two strains of aged mice and use two in vivo murine focal cerebral ischemia models (a transient stroke model
and a permanent stroke model) and in vitro human and murine CEC culture models. We have devised two
independent aims: Aim 1: To investigate the ability of BS to improve outcomes after stroke in both male and
female aged mice. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that BS improves outcomes by removing neutrophils and MMP-
9 thereby preserving mitochondrial membrane protein in CECs after stroke. The results of this research will
demonstrate the potential of BS as a future therapy and impact the field of blood-brain interactions in the elderly."
10982307,"Project Summary: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) develops in a third of over 300,000 patients and lead to long
term memory and cognitive disorders which impact quality of life. The dentate gyrus, a circuit severely
impacted in hippocampal sclerosis in TLE, serves as the first node in the flow of cortical information to the
hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is a critical for episodic memory function and is proposed to discriminate
highly similar inputs through a process known as pattern separation, the underlying mechanisms of which are
not fully understood. The dentate receives highly structured inputs with lateral entorhinal cortical projections
with content or object related information targeting the distal dendrites of the granule cells through the lateral
perforant path and spatial and contextual information from the medial entorhinal cortex reaching the middle
dendrites through the medial perforant path. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying how these inputs
streams are processed to discriminate subtle differences in each modality, how they are associated to form
episodic memory representations and their contribution to dentate electrical activity patterns associated
memory consolidation and recall are not known. We propose that input specific recruitment of inhibitory
neurons and their layer specific inhibition of granule cell dendrites is critical for the ability of the dentate to
decorrelate distinct input streams. Since dendrite targeting dentate interneuron subtypes undergo extensive
structural and functional plasticity in epilepsy, we further propose that seizure induced changes in dendritic

and behavioral and multisite recordings with optogenetic interrogation will allow us to address these questions.
Aim 1 will develop a fundamental understanding of input specific and recruitment, and frequency dependent
dynamics of dentate interneuron subtypes and how it is altered in epilepsy. Aim 2 will determine the role of
somatic and dendritic inhibition in dentate decorrelation of layer specific inputs and their transformations in
epilepsy at the circuit level. Finally, Aim 3 will examine determine the role of inhibitory neuron subtypes to
behavioral spatial and object discrimination and electrical correlates of dentate memory processing in control
and epileptic mice. in line with the proprieties established in the 2021 AES/NINDS Epilepsy Research
Benchmarks, these studies will address mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and
is of broader relevance to understanding memory processing and decline in ageing and Alzheimer’s Disease."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that gives rise to chronic neurological deficits. It is caused by
an immunological attack on the myelin sheath leading to demyelination and axon degeneration. MS is the most
common demyelinating disease of the CNS in young adults. 8,000-10,000 children and approximately 1 million
adults are currently diagnosed with MS in the US. Furthermore, most MS cases result in frequent relapses.
Currently available treatments can diminish the incidence of acute flare-ups, but do not prevent progressive
axonal degeneration and neurological disability. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived
extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been suggested as a promising approach for the treatment of MS, since MSCs
and MCS-EVs can confer multifactorial therapeutic functions such as immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and
angiogenesis. Our lab has established methods to isolate and expand early gestational placenta-derived MSCs
(PMSCs) and demonstrated that compared with adult tissue-derived MSCs, PMSCs and PMSC-EVs possess
superior immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and pro-angiogenic functions. In a preliminary study, we confirmed
PMSC-EVs promoted re-myelination through the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into
mature oligodendrocytes and improved motor function outcomes in an experimental autoimmune
Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. One major obstacle of effective clinical application of EVs is the
lack of disease-specific targeting efficiency to the sites of injury, especially to the CNS. It is well known that
integrin a4ß1 is highly expressed by multiple pathogenic lymphocytes and mediates inflammatory cell homing
into the CNS in MS. Currently, therapies targeting integrin a4ß1 have been used as a treatment for adult MS.
Using ultra-high throughput one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial screening, we identified LLP2A as
a high-affinity (IC50~2pM) and high-specificity targeting ligand against activated a4ß1 integrin. Furthermore, we
showed that LLP2A is an a4ß1 integrin antagonist and can decrease inflammation. The overall goal of this
proposal is to develop a new multi-component, multi-functional, EV based nanotherapeutic with improved
targeting efficiency for MS. The treatment is comprised of unique PMSC-EVs that will be further engineered by
surface modification with targeting ligand LLP2A. In this application, we hypothesize that conjugation of LLP2A
onto the surface of PMSC-EVs (LLP2A-PMSC-EVs) can facilitate the targeting of PMSC-EVs to multiple
activated pathogenic immune cell subsets, thus improving PMSC-EV targeting efficiency, tissue distribution, and
ultimately therapeutic efficacy. We will leverage our lab’s established state-of-the-art bulk and single-EV
characterization methods to evaluate ligand conjugation efficacy on EVs. The central objective of this study is to
develop an effective approach to modify PMSC-EVs with LLP2A to efficiently target and modulate pathogenic
lymphocytes to promote neuroprotection and remyelination. This study will facilitate future investigations into
finding a novel bioengineering approach of stem cell-derived and cell-free regenerative therapy for MS."

This application presents a five-year mentored research and training plan that will prepare Dr. Muriel Babey to
be a leader in the field of the skeletal, aging, and metabolic physiology. Dr. Babey completed her MD at the
University of Berne, Switzerland and her clinical fellowship of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes at the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She is an Assistant Adjunct Professor in Endocrinology and
Diabetes at UCSF and supported by an NIDDK supplement for emerging physician-scientist under the
mentorship of Dr. Holly Ingraham. Dr. Babey’s long-term career goal is to unravel the fundamental mechanisms
governing the intricate interplay between skeletal, aging, and metabolic physiology. This project will facilitate
foundational discoveries for her independent research program, as she seeks to delineate the role of brain-
derived cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3) in bone and marrow fat metabolism.
Based on multiple assays, CCN3 emerged as the most promising pro-osteogenic factor from KISS1 neurons of
the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1). The proposal builds on this recent discovery (11) and will further test the
hypothesis that CCN3 drives bone formation and reduces bone marrow fat. Using in vitro and in vivo models,
she proposes to 1) determine how the dose and levels of circulating brain-derived CCN3 affect bone formation
in vitro and in vivo assays and 2) determine the role of circulating CCN3 on bone and marrow fat metabolism
during aging, menopause and after a HFD dietary challenge. This work will provide strong evidence for further
development and future clinical trials of CCN3, ultimately providing a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating
osteoporosis and fracture risk.
The proposed career development plan includes training in brain stereotaxic surgery, skeletal stem cell biology
and osteocyte mediated perilacunar remodeling. Dr. Babey will learn all the skills needed for an independent
research career, including supervising trainees and staff, grant writing and scientific communication. She has
assembled a world-class mentorship team with complementary expertise in brain-body communicationin female
physiology (Primary mentor, Dr. Holly Ingraham), skeletal stem cell biology (Co-Mentor, Dr. Thomas Ambrosi),
osteocyte mediated perilacunar remodeling and mechanobiology (Co-Mentor, Dr. Tamara Alliston), novel
therapeutic approach for human skeletal disorders and bone injuries (Advisor, Dr. Edward Hsiao), link basic
mechanism of metabolic regulation to causality in clinical patients (Advisor, Dr. Suneil Koliwad) and bone marrow
adipose tissue and bone crosstalk with nerves (Advisor, Dr. Erica Scheller). Dr. Babey, her mentors, and the
Department of Medicine at UCSF are fully committedto this proposal and to her goal of becoming an independent

10985773,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) exist across race as well as sex/gender, and
structural oppression is hypothesized to be an important social determinant. Mounting evidence demonstrates
that exposure to structural racism in early- and mid-life is associated with lower memory and neurocognitive
performance in late life. To remediate the harms of structural racism, it is essential to understand how racism
intersects with other systems of oppression, like structural sexism, to affect the cognitive aging of those with
multiple marginalized identities (e.g., being both Black and a woman). Cognitive aging is strongly impacted by
the social environment across the lifecourse and may be accelerated by early life exposures to cross-cutting
racism and sexism. Among aging Black women, exposure to intersecting structural racism and sexism (i.e.,
structural gendered racism) across the life course may compound to accelerate cognitive decline and increase
ADRD risk. This hypothesis has not been tested due to measurement limitations as well as reliance on between-
group comparative study designs, which limit our understanding of the mechanistic processes that impact
vulnerable populations and confer dementia risk. In response to this need, the scientific goal of this study is to
use a mixed-methodological, within-group approach to: (1) develop and validate a multidimensional index of
structural gendered racism using qualitative interviews with Black women, (2) identify categorically distinct latent
class profiles of structural gendered racism across index dimensions, and (3) examine the associations between
latent class profiles of early life exposure to structural gendered racism with cognitive aging and ADRD risk. To
achieve these aims, 68 Black women aged 50 or older across the United States will participate in qualitative
interviews of their experiences of gendered racism to further explicate structural domains of influence (e.g.,
gendered racism impacting access to housing). The PI will then conduct focus group interviews with research
and data experts to determine metrics that capture each gendered racism domain and identify corresponding
datasets that will be leveraged to create a state-level gendered racism index. This index will be linked to
geographically coded data on early childhood from 4,793 Black women in the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) and their cognitive data collected over 24 years in late adulthood. These new data will be analyzed for
gendered racism latent classes, and the latent classes will be examined in relation to cognitive aging trajectories
and ADRD risk. Consistent with NIA’s Strategic Directions for Research, this study may illuminate mechanisms
underlying Black women’s risk for ADRD and identify critical intervention points that can be addressed to reduce
racial-sex/gender disparities in ADRD and improve the cognitive health of Black women. The research plan is
complemented by training activities that build on the candidate’s background in neuropsychology and provide
new training in (1) longitudinal and latent variable modeling; (2) intersectional structural determinants of Black
women’s cognitive aging; (3) mixed methods research; and (4) clinician-scientist leadership development."

Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although maternal immune
activation during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, most cases of maternal
infections do not result in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, maternal immune activations appear to act as
‘priming events’, sensitizing the immune system and increasing susceptibility to subsequent perturbations. Early-
life adversity, such as maltreatment or neglect, increase the risk for stress-related disorders. Epidemiological
studies have found enhanced susceptibility to a second ‘hit’ of adversity stress. Indeed, two-hit models of
maternal immune activation and stress induce robust alterations in offspring behavior.
Rodent models of maternal immune activation typically induce immune activation through infectious agents such
as bacteria or double-stranded RNA. However, some of the prenatal infectious agents that are most strongly
linked to the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders are single-stranded viruses like rubella and influenza. The
recognition of single-stranded RNA by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) initiates a robust immune response. Although
the use of single-stranded mimetics that stimulate TLR7 are relatively underutilized in rodent maternal immune
activation models, recent data suggest that maternal TLR7 activation during pregnancy induces a robust
maternal immune response and impacts offspring neurodevelopment and behavior.
Here, we will use a model of maternal TLR7 stimulation by the single-stranded mimetic imiquimod in combination
with early postnatal resource deprivation stress through caging in limited bedding and nesting environments.
The central hypothesis of this R21 proposal is that a novel two-hit model of maternal immune activation using
TLR7 activation by imiquimod during pregnancy in combination with early postnatal resource deprivation stress
through LBN results in sex-specific neurodevelopmental susceptibilities. In Aim 1, we will determine whether
prenatal TLR7 stimulation induces maternal, placental, and offspring brain inflammatory responses in a sex-
biased manner. We will assess whether maternal immune activation induces placental macrophage and fetal
brain microglial priming. In Aim 2, we will determine whether microglial morphological alterations and pruning of
excitatory neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental areas is induced by prenatal TLR7 stimulation in combination with early
postnatal resource deprivation stress by LBN. Determining whether this two-hit model of maternal TLR7
stimulation in combination with early-life resource deprivation stress results in inflammatory alterations within
placental macrophages and fetal brain microglia, along with altering microglial phagocytosis of neuronal circuits."

The overarching goal of the proposed work is to engage spousal caregivers of patients with dementia to plan
for their own health emergency. Serious, unexpected health events such as hospitalization of a caregiver can
become a major disruption to the caregiving relationship. Often the caregiver has not planned for such
unexpected events where they may become ill. The project specifically focuses on the online development and
testing of an Emergency Preparedness Toolkit (EPT). The EPT is designed for caregivers, in the event of an
emergency, to provide a standby caregiver with detailed plans of how to care for the person with dementia.
Interventions which support a caregiver are known to reduce caregiver burden and delay or offset the need to
place a person with dementia in a care facility. Particularly challenging for some caregivers is the identification
of a standby caregiver, especially if they do not have nearby family/friends. Previous work using the paper
version of the EPT indicated that some caregivers had difficulty identifying a standby caregiver, recognizing the
value of using the EPT and/or stalled by the amount of work needed for EPT completion. The online version of
the EPT will provide tailored guidance to the caregiver and may increase the number of caregivers who identify
a standby caregiver and are able to complete the EPT. Alternatively, caregivers may require coaching in
addition to the online EPT format. Therefore, once the EPT is developed into an online format, spousal
caregivers will be recruited and randomized to receive access to the EPT either with or without a coach. The
first aim is to compare the two groups as to their ability to identify and engage a standby caregiver. Once the
caregiver has successfully completed the online EPT they will they provide it to the standby caregiver. The
second aim is to compare the change of spousal caregiver preparedness, confidence, and self-efficacy
between groups. The third aim will examine the barriers and facilitators for spousal caregivers to identify and
engage a standby caregiver for a person with dementia."

Many of the approved drugs used to treat a variety of diseases in children and adults target G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs). Furthermore, it is reported that two-thirds of those receptors couple to cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) regulation. Despite the approved use of GPCR-mediated drugs, little is known about
the subsequent cAMP signaling in specific neural circuits and their contributions to synaptic transmission and
behavior. In the brain, cellular processes important for learning and memory involve the second messenger
cAMP, along with other downstream messengers, such as Protein Kinase A (PKA) to decode neuromodulatory
signals. The applicant, Anthony James (post-baccalaureate student) will combine the viral expression of a cell-
type specific cAMP or PKA sensor to monitor postsynaptic intracellular signaling and presynaptic optogenetics
to precisely manipulate neuronal signaling and/or pharmacology to induce changes in synaptic plasticity,
focusing on long-term depression (LTD) with two-photon microscopy. Using this approach, he will evaluate the
somatic and dendritic cAMP and/or PKA activity organization in response to light-activated induction of synaptic
plasticity. Also, Anthony will determine if expression of the cAMP or PKA sensor alters synaptic properties within
expressed cells using electrophysiology. We hypothesize that neuromodulatory signals generate distinct spatial
and temporal patterns of cAMP-mediated signaling, which mediates synaptic transmission resulting in
appropriate behaviors. Also, we further hypothesize that sensor expression will not alter the synaptic properties
of the neuron. The results obtained from this study will further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
synaptic transmission involving GPCR-mediated cAMP signaling. Our proposal builds on the experiments
outlined in the parent award and will further strengthen the link of causality between synapse-specific activation
and subsequent cAMP-PKA signaling in mediating synaptic depression. These experiments are within the scope
of the parent award, which examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of cAMP-mediated signaling during synaptic
plasticity and learned behaviors. Anthony’s proposal employs optogenetic stimulation to activate a specific
subset of corticostriatal terminals to examine the resultant cAMP-mediated signaling. Anthony will receive
laboratory training in stereotaxic surgery, acute brain slice preparation, two-photon microscopy,
electrophysiology, and data analysis, as well as career development training in writing, scientific communication,
and networking. For Anthony’s training, I have recruited a co-mentor to provide complementary mentorship. With
our combined mentoring efforts, we will help Anthony in reaching his goal of attending graduate school to pursue
a PhD in neuroscience."
10995006,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Subcellular mRNA localization enables post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through the spatial
and temporal control of translation. Control of gene expression through mRNA localization is important in many
different contexts including development, cell polarization and cell cycle progression. This mechanism relies on
localization elements (LE) within the transcript which interact with trans-acting factors, (RNA binding proteins),
to drive localization to a specific subcellular location. LEs are often contained within the 3’ UTR and range in
size from 100 to 250nt. The mechanisms driving mRNA localization to the midbody (MB), an organelle which
forms during a cell division, are only just emerging and are the main focus of this proposal. The MB is a
microtubule-rich organelle that forms between the two dividing daughter cells and is a critical mitotic regulator.
The MB mediates the conclusion of mitosis, abscission. Abscission is the highly regulated separation of the
two daughter cells that relies on the tightly controlled recruitment of specific abscission regulating proteins to
the MB and the site of abscission. Abscission is important during tissue development and function, and defects
in this process contribute to increases in aneuploidy and genomic instability. Yet, how abscission regulators are
localized to and activated at the MB remains largely unclear and is the main focus of this proposal.
In this project I propose to use high-throughput experimental techniques, single molecule imaging, and
machine learning to identify and characterize RNA localization elements that drive RNA localization to the MB.
I will accomplish this by using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to generate ~20,000 sequences
spanning the 3’UTRs of MB localized RNAs. These 260nt long sequences will be systematically tested for their
ability to drive a reporter RNA to the MB. After identification of localization elements (LE) in each 3’UTR tested,
I will then test the necessity of each newly identified LE for MB RNA localization by deleting it from its
endogenous location using CRISPR-Cas9. Given that previously identified LEs that traffic RNA to neuronal
projections also traffic RNAs to MBs, I will combine data from the MPRA performed in MBs with MPRA data
from neurons produced by our lab to generate a predictive model and identify new LEs within other MB
localized RNAs. The minimally active size of previously identified LEs is over 200 nt, making it difficult to easily
identify the features of LEs necessary for their localization activity. To extract the active LE features from this
data, I will use machine learning techniques to uncover features (kmer/motif content, RNA secondary
structures, etc.) found in the active sequences but lacking in the inactive sequences.
These experiments will be the first to identify localization elements capable of localizing RNAs to the MB and
will represent the first step in defining mechanisms that regulate this process. Further, the completion of this
work will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms of mRNA localization and the features that govern
subcellular RNA localization in a variety of cell types."

 Zika virus (ZIKV) re-emerged over the last several decades to cause large outbreaks in the Asian Pacific
and Americas. ZIKV disease, though usually mild, can occasionally cause severe neurological complications,
including developmental defects in babies born to a ZIKV-infected person. Much remains to be learned about
ZIKV host-pathogen interactions, including how the innate immune system fights the early stages of infection in
human cells. Given their role in inhibiting viral replication, innate immune factors could help explain the
heterogeneity in ZIKV clinical outcome and could lead to the development of treatments for ZIKV. The type I
interferon (IFN) response plays a particularly critical role in the innate immune response to viruses, including
ZIKV. IFN is secreted from virus-infected cells, binds its receptor on nearby cells, and sets off a signaling pathway
that culminates in a transcriptional program turning on hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of
which encode antiviral proteins against a given virus. While the IFN response is clearly important in restricting
ZIKV, systematic studies to define which host genes are responsible for this potent effect are lacking. While
several specific antiviral ISGs have been identified, there have not been broader attempts to define all host
genes that contribute to IFN restriction of ZIKV, including non-ISGs that may play a regulatory role in the pathway.
Our lab performed a CRISPR knockout screen to identify genes that contribute to IFN restriction of ZIKV. The
screen approach successfully identified genes involved in IFN signaling (positive controls). IFI6, a previously
described ISG and flavivirus restriction factor, was also identified, as was AMOTL2, a non-ISG in our cell type
and a gene with no described role in innate immunity. Despite the fact that AMOTL2 is not itself IFN-induced,
AMOTL2 knockout increased ZIKV replication in the presence, but not absence, of IFN. These findings confirmed
the IFN-specific antiviral phenotype of AMOTL2 and led to the hypothesis that AMOTL2 acts upstream of ISG
transcription in the IFN response. My preliminary results support this model and are the basis for the proposed
studies. In Aim 1, the mechanism of AMOTL2’s viral restriction will be better elucidated. This will be achieved by
first validating the specificity of the observed phenotype through rescue experiments, then assessing the
involvement of AMOTL2’s binding partners YAP and TAZ in IFN restriction of ZIKV through double knockouts
and co-IP assays. In Aim 2, I will test the breadth of AMOTL2’s antiviral phenotype across diverse viruses (Aim
2a) and with ZIKV infections in a biologically-relevant primary cell type (Aim 2b). The complementary results of
my two aims will enhance our understanding of the IFN response against ZIKV and possibly other viruses."
10995009,"PROJECT SUMMARY: In the subsequent years following the World Trade Center (WTC) attack on September
11th, 2001, a cluster of chronic health conditions emerged among first responders (FRs) who were present during
the aftermath of the attack. Many FRs were at Ground Zero for prolonged periods in the first week after the
disaster, repeatedly exposing them to high levels of dust composed of particles of varying sizes that contained
metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, among many known toxins. A growing body of
scientific literature indicates that FRs who were exposed to high levels of dust for prolonged periods may have
a greater incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as other neurological complications i.e. changes
in white matter connectivity, decreased hippocampal volume which may put them at a greater risk of developing
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Crucially, the risk relating to exposure was elevated in individuals carrying the AD
vulnerability gene (i.e., apolipoprotein-E4 [APOE4], TREM2). Carrying a single APOE4 allele increases the risk
for AD by approximately 4-fold, while double carriers have a 10-fold increased risk compared to the neutral
APOE3 isoform. Based on this consideration, we have established the Late onset of Alzheimer's disease
(LOAD)2 mouse model which carries a humanized ApoE knock-in mutation for the E4 isoform, a CRISPR/Cas9-
generated APP allele with a humanized Aß1-42 region and R47H point mutation in the TREM2 gene to study
the effects of WTC airborne PM and the role of age and genetic and environmental risk factors on LOAD.
Additionally, in new studies, we found that the combination of experimental “extreme weather conditions” by heat
stress (HS) in mice, primed by exposure to WTC airborne PM, exacerbates impairment in energy metabolism,
altered lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, our feasibility evidence
shows that the combination of environmental risk factors (such as HS) to a single WTC airborne PM exposure
may negatively influence several metabolic cascades associated with energy metabolism. Based on this, our
proposed study will define an age-dependent interaction regarding environmental “climate changes” (HS) to
WTC airborne PM exposure on the onset and progression of LOAD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
examine the impact of WTC airborne PM on age x genetic interactions in response to exposure to WTC airborne
PM and/or extreme weather conditions (HS), ultimately providing new strategies for risk assessment, risk
reduction, and disease prevention in LOAD. The choice to study the role of WTC airborne PM in LOAD2 mice is
fundamental to our understanding of age x genetic interactions in response to exposure to environmental
stressors. The proposed studies seek to explicitly test the hypothesis that exposure to toxic WTC airborne PM
causes long-term cognitive impairment and AD-type pathology by using rodent models. We understand and
appreciate the importance of sex as a biological variable. However, for rigor and reproducibility
purposes, we would like to note that this study is not designed to specifically analyze sex differences."

The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the mechanism for increased periportal collagen
deposition, a sign of developing fibrosis, in the liver of the fetus with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and the impact
on future liver metabolic disease. Children born with FGR have a higher risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and fibrosis in childhood and adulthood. A distinct feature of MASLD
presentation in pediatric patients, and one that is higher in FGR offspring, is localized fibrosis in periportal
regions. Previous studies demonstrate that hypoxemia-induced oxidative stress promotes hepatic fibrosis in
animal models. Yet, there remains a gap in our understanding of how oxidative stress in the fetal liver may
promote a fibrotic niche and future susceptibility to liver disease associated with fibrosis. Our preliminary data
indicate that FGR fetal sheep have increased hepatic periportal collagen deposition and increased markers of
oxidative stress signaling. In addition, our preliminary data in fetal sheep exposed to long-term hypoxia show an
increase in hepatic periportal fibrosis. I hypothesize that hypoxemia-induced oxidative stress in the FGR
fetus produces cell-specific and regional effects in the fetal liver that initiate periportal fibrosis. Overall,
this proposal will provide critical information for how FGR promotes hepatic fibrosis that persists postnatally. Aim
1 will Identify cell-specific and regional gene expression signatures in the fetal liver in response to FGR. Aim 2
will test if FGR and hypoxemia promote intrinsic fibrogenic capacity in hepatic stellate cells and test whether
treatment of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, prevents hypoxia-induced activation. Aim 3 will determine if hepatic
fibrosis persists in postnatal lambs born with FGR. Expected Outcomes: This proposal will characterize the
impact of FGR on oxidative stress and fibrosis in the fetal liver. Importantly, completion of this proposal will
provide me with training in liver physiology and metabolism, bioinformatics, advanced histology, models to study
fetal development, hepatic stellate cell culture, and scientific writing to help me achieve my career goal as a
tenure-track assistant professor specialized in the fetal developmental programming of immunometabolism.
Impact: The aims in this proposal will be used to help understand how fibrosis develops in postnatal liver of FGR
offspring and determine future mechanistic experiments used to investigate fetal origins of fibrosis."

Intercellular adhesion is essential for tissue development and maintenance. One such adhesive structure is the
zonula adherens junction (ZA) where the tension sensitive protein -catenin (cat) couples transmembrane
cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. While the essential function of ZA components is well-established, we
know comparatively less about the dynamic regulation of this structure. During tissue morphogenesis, cells
must accommodate neighbor exchanges while maintaining crucial barrier function. Here we address the
overarching hypothesis that cat integrates actomyosin based mechanical signals with post-translational
modification (i.e., phosphorylation) to control epithelial barrier structure and function. Our team has identified
an evolutionarily-conserved phosphorylation scheme within a flexible region of cat linking the F-actin binding
domain to its mechanosensitive middle-domain. Phosphorylation at these sites is required for strong cell-cell
adhesion in widely used dog kidney epithelial cell line, as well as development in flies. But mechanistic
underpinnings and critical contribution to mammalian development remain incompletely understood. We find
that phospho-cat appears enriched at the zonula adherens junction and is reduced by actomyosin inhibition.
We also find that a phospho-mimic form of cat phenocopies this ZA enrichment and adopts a more opened
conformation in vitro. These data suggest actomyosin contractility promotes cat phosphorylation, leading to a
conformational change that favors recruitment of a key binding partner required for cat junctional enrichment,
ZA structure and barrier function. To address this model, Aim 1 will address whether Afadin, a multi-domain
scaffold protein implicated in ZA structure, is a key effector of phospho-cat, making use of a newly mapped
binding site in cat. Aim 2 will establish the in vivo relevance of this mechanism through characterization of a
novel cat phospho-null mouse with postnatal developmental delay. Together, these aims will fill a fundamental
gap in the understanding of how a central cell-cell adhesive component is regulated by mechanical and
chemical modification to control epithelial barrier function, with implications for diseases caused by cat
mutation, such as butterfly-shaped patterned eye dystrophy and vitreoretinopathy. I will carry out these
research aims under the mentorship of my sponsor, Dr. Cara Gottardi, with her expertise in epithelial cell
biology. Our strategy will be complemented by a training plan that enhances skill in quantitative image
microscopy, methods to interrogate epithelial barrier function, and tissue-level phenotypic analysis in a mouse
model. As these training goals are applicable to a range of research questions, they will be foundational to my
career development as a physician scientist, with current interest in ophthalmology, given that cat missense
mutations causally contribute to eye disease, and the mouse developed in Aim 2 may provide an avenue for
future independent research."
10995025,"Abstract
Resident memory T cells (Trm) are a recently appreciated subset of memory T cells that
maintain long-term residence in barrier tissues. Unlike central memory T cells that reside in the
lymph node and spleen, Trm are prepositioned at the site of a prior infection/inflammation where
they provide a rapid immune response to subsequent challenges. In the skin, CD8+ Trm reside
primarily in the epidermis and provide protective memory responses to herpes simplex and
vaccinia virus infections that exceeds the protection provided by central memory T cells. In
addition, epidermal Trm provide immune-surveillance against melanoma and are likely
pathogenic in many autoimmune diseases. Understanding the basic biology of these cells is
central to efforts to maximize barrier host defense and treat numerous diseases. In past cycles
of the grant we showed that persistence of CD8+ Trm in the epidermis requires autocrine TGFβ
that must be transactivated by avβ6 or avβ8 expressed by keratinocytes. We also found that
partial blockade of avβ6 and avβ8 by mAb or small molecule inhibition could eliminate
epidermal Trm. Importantly, only Trm that had not re-encountered cognate antigen in the skin
were depleted. In contrast, Trm that re-encountered cognate antigen in the skin were able to
persist when levels of active TGFβ were artificially suppressed. Thus, a second encounter with
cognate antigen in the skin during development renders Trm less dependent on active TGFβ
and represents a mechanism to preferentially deplete ‘bystander’ Trm during subsequent
rounds of infection/inflammation. Moreover, TCR ligation during development in the skin
promotes Trm ‘fitness’ and is an unappreciated obligate final step in the development of robust
epidermal Trm. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TCR-induced alteration of the
chromatin state is a key determinant of Trm ‘fitness’. We hypothesize that the niche size is
flexible and that expression levels of avβ6 by keratinocytes is a key T cell-extrinsic factor
determining its size. In Aim 2, we will develop mice with doxycycline controllable Itgb6
expression and test our hypothesis by directly manipulating αvβ6 expression at varying times
following Trm development. Finally, we hypothesize that both T cell ‘fitness’ and TGFβ
transactivation by the niche participate to shape antigen-specific CD8+ T cell pools in the
context of chronic antigen. In Aim 3, we will test this hypothesis using a transplantable B16
melanoma model in which T cell ‘fitness’ and stromal TGFβ transactivation will be manipulated."

on close and productive interactions that bring all stakeholders together to focus on critical scientific and
technical issues guided by user priorities. The International BCI Meeting Series, which has included 10
meetings since 1999, has always had the goal of bringing diverse disciplines together to discuss issues that
are critical for BCI development to restore communication and mobility. The BCI Meetings are instrumental in
creating the productive interactions and collaborations that are essential for continued progress. The BCI
Meeting will be organized to achieve the following specific aims:
 1) Convene and foster productive interactions among all the disciplines and stakeholders whose
 cooperation is crucial to successful BCI research and development. No other venue brings them all
together.
 2) Present a concise and comprehensive update of the current state of BCI research and development.
 3) Address topics critical for continued progress in BCI research and development through focused
 workshops and targeted plenary sessions. Broader topics will be covered in oral and poster
presentations.
 4) Promote the education and development of new researchers through the participation of many
 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Networking events will encourage interactions between
 new and established researchers and particularly target underrepresented groups of researchers.
 5) Maximize the immediate and long-term meeting impact through publication of a special issue of peer-
 reviewed primary articles and focused reviews derived from the meeting. Open-access conference
 proceedings will inform both the scientific community and the general public.
In summary, the 11th International BCI Meeting will bring together a diverse BCI community, review the
present state of the field including recent advances, address key issues critical for translating research into
clinical use, and promote the education and mentoring of young researchers. Thus, like its predecessors, this
meeting and the resulting comprehensive publications will promote the continued development of BCIs that
can restore communication and motor function to people with paralysis or impairment."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiomyocyte calcium (Ca2+)
dysregulation is a central feature of disease and is largely driven by defects in the activity of a critical Ca2+ pump
called the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a). SERCA2a itself is dynamically regulated by
the small protein phospholamban (PLN), which inhibits SERCA2a via direct binding and reducing its Ca2+ affinity.
Heart disease is associated with SERCA2a/PLN dysfunction, which further worsens Ca2+ disequilibrium and
disease progression. However, our knowledge of Ca2+ regulation in the heart remains incomplete, therefore few
advances have been made to restore cardiomyocyte Ca2+ homeostasis in disease conditions.
Our lab recently discovered the microprotein another-regulin (ALN) as a SERCA2a-inhibiting microprotein that
is enriched in cardiomyocytes. My preliminary data indicates that the activity of ALN may be controlled by
phosphorylation on position Serine 19, whereby in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells
show that this phosphorylation event results in the dissociation of ALN from SERCA2a. Studies in isolated adult
mouse cardiomyocytes stimulated with various G-protein-coupled receptor agonists indicate that ALN is
phosphorylated downstream of Gq activation, thus presenting ALN as a novel regulator of Ca2+ in the heart.
This preliminary evidence has led to our central hypothesis that ALN uniquely integrates neuroendocrine
signaling in cardiomyocytes via SERCA2a regulation of Ca2+ signaling and heart contractility. This
proposal will test this hypothesis by determining how ALN phosphorylation affects ALN-SERCA2a binding affinity
and SERCA2a enzymatic activity (Aim 1). This proposal also explores neuroendocrine and Gq pathway
activation upstream of ALN phosphorylation and its resulting regulation of SERCA2a activity (Aim 2).
The completion of this proposal will lead to advances in our knowledge of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and Ca2+
dysregulation that occurs during disease. Such findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutics aimed
at restoring Ca2+ homeostasis, an area which is currently lacking in cardiovascular care. The Aims herein expect
to show that phosphorylation of ALN on Serine 19 downstream of Gq signaling causes its dissociation from
SERCA2a and relief of its inhibitory effects, thus resulting in increased cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling and
contractility. The trainee leading this proposed project is currently a third-year graduate MD/PhD student at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in the laboratory of Dr. Cat Makarewich. The candidate will use
this proposal to gain meaningful experience in conducting cardiovascular research, leading to a strong base of
knowledge for the treatment and prevention of chronic cardiovascular disease."

 Primary Mitochondrial disease (PMD) is a clinically heterogeneous group of >350 gene disorders due
to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial (mt)DNA, and collectively
affect at least 1 in 4,300 people across all ages. Mitochondrial Myopathy (MM) refers to a subset of
individuals with PMD who predominantly express weakness, exercise intolerance, muscle fatigue, and/or
imbalance. Although PMD is one of the most common genetic disorders and is significantly burdensome,
causing a mean of 16 symptoms, there are no FDA approved therapies. Historically, there has been a lack of
validated outcome measures that reliably capture MM disease progression. Meaningful metabolic
biomarkers of MM do not exist. Prospective natural history studies in MM are lacking. In recent years, there
has been an expansion in the pharmaceutical repertoire of MM therapies, leading to a burgeoning
emergence of clinical trials. This has created a pressing need for MM outcome measures and natural history.
 At the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program (MMFP),
we have designed and validated the MM Composite Assessment Tool (MM-COAST), the first performance-
based outcome measure that quantifies MM key domains of muscle strength and fatigue, exercise
intolerance,dexterity, and imbalance as a single composite score. MM-COAST assessments generate
continuous data in each domain to facilitate capture of incremental change that is typical of MM. More
recently, we designed and validated a complimentary tool, the MM-Function Scale, to quantify motor
function. MM-COAST and MM- Function Scale facilitate longitudinal assessment that was not previously
possible. We have also designed the MM-IMPACT, a MM-disease specific patient-reported outcome
measure (PROM) to assess quality of life (QoL). Currently, our Mitochondrial Myopathy IRB protocol has
enrolled 210 genetically confirmed MM subjects from clinic, with ~5 new patients identified each month. In
Aim 1, we will obtain real-world longitudinal MM-COAST and MM-Function Scale measures and define their
minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in 175 symptomatic MM children (≥ 5 years old) and adults
up to 60 years with mtDNA genetic etiologies. We hypothesize that longitudinal MM-COAST and MM-
Function Scale assessments will demonstrate incremental change over time that varies depending on the
individual’s mobility level with or without fatigue, using our new IMPROVE Classification. In Aim 2, we will
validate our remote MM Function Scale-R assessment. We hypothesize that remote assessments will be as
valid and reliable as in-person MM-Function Scale assessments. In Aim 3, we will refine and validate the
MM-IMPACT PROM. We hypothesize that MM-IMPACT will be more meaningful as compared to generic
QoL scales. This timely proposal will be significantly impactful in transforming future MM clinical trial design."
10979741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need for more effective treatments for metastatic and relapsed neuroblastoma
(NB), the most commonly diagnosed extracranial solid cancer in children and the most common
cancer in infancy. Following years of advancement of multimodal therapies, 60 % of high risk NB
will recur after treatment, resulting in a 5% survival rate at 5 years. Conventional regimens now
include targeted radiotherapy to the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This is a well-validated
biomarker expressed in >90% of patients, and is targeted by 131I-MIBG – a beta particle emitting
NET substrate. SSTR2 is another important neuroendocrine specific target, which is also highly
expressed in >70% of NB. FDA-approved SSTR2 radiopeptides, 68Ga/177Lu-DOTA-TATE have
showed some efficacy in investigational use in pediatrics. However, both 131I-MIBG and 177Lu-
DOTA-TATE are low linear energy transfer, beta particle-emitting agents, which lack the capacity
to ablate cancer cells or occult small lesions. 131I-MIBG treatment only achieves a long-term
response in about 30% of NB patients, which is far lower than NET expression incidence. High
linear energy transfer emissions have the capacity to eliminate microscopic occult disease sites,
while sparing distant tissues from the long path lengths of conventional beta-emitting treatments.
In this application we put forwards a combination treatment strategy with novel ligands to address
multiple failure points of conventional targeted radiotherapy for this devastating disease. To NET,
we target 77Br-MBBG (a highly chemically stable, auger emitting meta-bromobenzylguanidine)
and to SSTR2 we have developed 227Th-L804-LM3 (a best-in-class Thorium-227 alpha emitter-
conjugated antagonist for SSTR2). These high LET agents will selectively kill cancer cells with
definitive anticancer effects; and the synergistic elimination of low expressors of either target will
be compensated by the combination approach. We deploy and characterize these next generation
agents to advance NB care in standard xenografts and advanced patient derived models of NB.
We monitor treatment efficacy of 77Br-MBBG, 227Th-L804-LM3 and their combinations, and
compare to conventional 131I-MIBG and 177Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment. We monitor tumor
response; target expression using quantitative molecular imaging analogs; DNA damage and
repair; and genomic profiles of NB in the de novo and post-treatment states. Through these
studies, we anticipate to optimize novel treatment approach that can undergo near term
translation at Washington University in St. Louis Children’s Hospital."
10979870,"While it is well known that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has a devastating disease course, approximately
30% of individuals with non-IPF interstitial lung disease (ILD) will develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis
(PPF), with an overall poor survival worse than most cancers. A diagnosis of PPF carries significant therapeutic
implications. Based on the results of the INBUILD trial, patients with non-IPF ILD who experience disease
progression benefit from antifibrotic therapy with nintedanib. A major clinical challenge is that a diagnosis of
PPF can only be made after evidence of disease progression via worsening respiratory symptoms, decline in
pulmonary function, or progressive changes on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Early
identification of patients at the highest risk for developing PPF is a crucial unmet need to improve outcomes of
those with non-IPF ILD. The capacity to predict the development of PPF with high accuracy would allow (1)
early initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy for those at highest risk of PPF, (2) improved prognostication to enable
care plans to be tailored accordingly (i.e. early referral for lung transplantation), and (3) enrichment of clinical
trials with subjects at the highest risk for PPF. We have developed two innovative and complementary
advanced imaging technologies that we will employ simultaneously to determine if our imaging measurements
can predict which individuals will develop PPF. We have developed a PET probe that binds type I collagen with
high specificity. This probe, 68Ga-CBP8, can stage the degree of new collagen formation in a mouse model of
pulmonary fibrosis, measure response to therapy with an αvβ6 inhibitor in a murine model, and detect
increased collagen in the lungs of IPF subjects. We have data that 68Ga-CBP8 preferentially binds recently
deposited collagen as opposed to established scar and that higher 68Ga-CBP8 lung uptake is followed by
disease progression in subjects with ILD. We have employed dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) to obtain complementary measurements of tissue injury (e.g., microvascular changes and
changes in the extravascular extracellular space) in subjects with ILD. In IPF subjects, we have shown that
DCE-MRI can distinguish subsequent stable versus progressive disease. We will build on these findings by
performing a longitudinal observational study in subjects with non-IPF ILD to determine if our PET-MRI
measurements predict PPF as determined by subsequent changes in pulmonary function tests and quantitative
measurements on HRCT. We will determine if the combination of PET and DCE-MRI measurements improves
the diagnostic accuracy of either measurement alone. We will also use these technologies to understand the
effect of immunosuppression treatment on collagen deposition. If successful, these studies will provide a non-
invasive tool for single timepoint disease activity assessment that could enable early initiation of antifibrotic
treatment for patients at the highest risk of developing PPF before additional irreversible fibrosis has occurred."

Built on the success of the GTEx project, the recently launched dGTEx project will recruit 120 donors to identify
genetic variants affecting gene expressions across tissues at four developmental stages (postnatal, early
childhood, pre-pubertal, and post-pubertal). Because there are considerably fewer samples in the dGTEx
project than that in the GTEx project, there is a critical need to develop powerful and robust statistical methods
to best use the dGTEx data for eQTL analysis. Moreover, single-cell sequencing is planned for the dGTEx
project, creating additional challenges and opportunities. The overall objective of our project is to develop and
apply novel statistical and computational methods to integrate different data sets to facilitate eQTL analysis of
the dGTEx data, and share the results with the research community. We will accomplish this objective through
three specific aims. For the first aim, we will infer tissue-specific eQTLs based on the total read count data by
borrowing information across tissues and developmental stages. We will then develop a hierarchical Bayesian
method to infer cell-type-specific eQTLs across developmental stages by jointly analyzing single-cell data and
bulk samples with computationally estimated cell-type proportions. We will also consider isoform eQTLs for this
aim. For the second aim, we will develop methods for identifying allele-specifically expressed genes in different
cell types. To gain more power, we will develop methods to jointly call allelic events across tissues and cell
types, correct for the specific biases in single-cell expression data, and develop methods for integrating allele-
specific chromatin accessibility and allele-specific expression using single-cell multiome data. Single-cell data
will then be combined with bulk RNA-seq data to improve allele-specific expression inference across subjects
further. Finally, we will jointly analyze total read counts and allele-specific data for eQTL inference for this aim.
In the third aim, we will develop methods to integrate data from other sources to complement the data collected
from the dGTEx project, such as data from the GTEx project. We will leverage chromatin data to ""transfer""
known eQTLs from bulk tissues and larger cohorts to the specific (smaller) single-cell cohorts. We will also
incorporate predicted effects of genetic variants from deep learning approaches in our modeling and analysis.
To facilitate transcriptome-wide association studies for complex traits rooted in early development, we will
develop gene expression imputation models based on our eQTL results. We will work with the dGTEx team to
share our results with the broader scientific community via the dGTEx portal and ANVIL."
10979706,"SUMMARY
Increased intestinal permeability, i.e., barrier loss, is a common characteristic of many gastrointestinal and
systemic disorders and has been hypothesized to be a key contributor to disease progression. Animal models
of disease provide strong support for this hypothesis, but, due to the absence of drugs that reverse disease-
associated permeability increases, the therapeutic potential of intestinal barrier restoration is untested. Myosin
light chain kinase (MLCK) is a signaling node that, when activated, increases permeability. In inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) patient biopsies, MLCK activity is upregulated and correlates with disease severity.
Recent studies have shown that inflammatory stimuli trigger recruitment of a specific MLCK isoform, MLCK1,
to the perijunctional cytoskeleton and that this MLCK1 recruitment is required for barrier loss. Further,
disruption of the MLCK1 interactome that directs recruitment is therapeutically superior to anti-TNF in
experimental IBD. Therefore, the long-term goal of this program is to create the detailed understanding that
will enable development of agents that target the MLCK1 interactome to restore barrier function and benefit
IBD patients. The overall objectives of this application are to i) discover the molecular basis of MLCK1
interactome function and ii) apply this knowledge to block MLCK1 recruitment in experimental IBD. The central
hypothesis is that prevention of MLCK1 interactome-dependent recruitment can restore the intestinal barrier.
The rationale for this project is that elucidating the molecular mechanisms of MLCK1 interactome function and
assessing the preclinical efficacy of targeting interactome components will create the scientific foundation
needed for translation to the clinic. The central hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: i) define
mechanisms that regulate interactions between MLCK1 interactome components and identify sites that can be
targeted to disrupt these interactions; ii) determine how, when, and where these interactions are modified by
inflammatory signals and the potential of obstructing key interactions as a means to block MLCK1 recruitment
and restore barrier function in intestinal stem cell models; and iii) characterize the impact of interfering with
dynamic regulation of the MLCK1 interactome in preclinical mouse models and assess interactome staus in
patient biopsies. This proposal is conceptually and technically innovative because it will define function and
regulation of the newly-recognized MLCK1 interactome using sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models as well
as patient biopsies. These studies are significant because they are expected to create the structural and
mechanistic insight required for development of molecular therapies that modify unique MLCK1 interactome
functions to prevent or reverse barrier loss in IBD. Ultimately, advances that build on this critical information will
create a foundation for development of safe, non-immunosuppressive means to restore the intestinal barrier
and induce and maintain remission in IBD. These agents are also likely to provide benefit in other barrier loss-
associated disorders, including celiac disease, food allergy, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome."

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major public health burden currently affecting
more than three million Americans and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. HFpEF prevalence is
expected to further increase with the aging population and the concomitant diffusion of recognized risk factors
such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. HFpEF is a complex multi-organ, systemic syndrome that
drastically reduces patients’ quality of life. Importantly, patients’ survival rate after first hospitalization is very
limited, as effective treatment options for HFpEF are currently inadequate. Notably, almost all therapies
developed for the better characterized HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have been shown to be
ineffective in HFpEF, implying the existence of different underlying mechanisms of disease yet to be identified.
The lack of effective treatment options for HFpEF is now one of the major unmet needs in the medical field and
may be due also to the large phenotypic heterogeneity observed in patients. In fact, HFpEF phenotypic diversity
represents an obstacle for timely diagnosis of HFpEF and is not entirely captured by most preclinical animal
models and clinical trials. Sex differences are thought to contribute to this phenotypic variability. Indeed, HFpEF
is more common in women, who experience worse symptoms but have lower risk of mortality than men. Overall,
HFpEF phenotypic heterogeneity hampers our understanding of the mechanisms underlying altered excitation-
contraction coupling (ECC) and increased propensity for ventricular arrhythmias (i.e., one of the leading causes
of death among HFpEF patients). Our overarching hypothesis is that, because of the presence of different HFpEF
subphenotypes, an effective therapy may benefit from a subgroup-targeted approach. We have previously
demonstrated the power of mechanistic modeling and data-driven precision medicine techniques to classify and
discriminate cardiac phenotypes. In this Project, we propose a novel integrative computational/experimental
approach aimed at i) identifying the key molecular and cellular functional changes in HFpEF in a preclinical
animal model, and ii) concomitantly investigating the impact of HFpEF heterogeneity in disease mechanisms
and therapy. Informed by novel functional and transcriptomic data, we will develop a refined modeling platform
that allows for new quantitative predictions amenable to experimental testing, as well as translation of
experimental findings across species. In synergy with the NHLBI initiatives HeartShare and Accelerating
Medicines Partnership, completion of the studies proposed in this Project will provide new mechanistic insights
into HFpEF phenotypic diversity in contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis and help targeting new
therapeutic strategies to different subpopulations of HFpEF patients."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable hypertrophy of the left ventricle that can present as sudden
cardiac death and heart failure. Autosomal dominant missense variants in myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) can
cause up to 40% of the familial HCM cases. While accurate interpretation of MYH7 variants can help identify
patients at risk for developing HCM, there are currently ~1,800 MYH7 missense variants in ClinVar that are
variants of unknown significance (VUS), creating diagnostic challenges for clinicians and emotional distress for
patients. Furthermore, because clinical guidelines now recommend that all HCM patients undergo genetic
testing, the number of MYH7 VUS is growing rapidly. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) can help address the
VUS problem by determining the functional consequence of thousands of genetic variants in a single
experiment. By generating accurate variant effect maps that define the function of nearly all possible missense
variants in a sequence of interest, DMS can assist with clinical variant interpretation at scale. So far, deep
mutational scans have been primarily practiced in cancer-derived cell lines, which are not helpful for assessing
genes such as MYH7 that are only expressed in specialized cells like cardiomyocytes. Human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can differentiate to many cell types, offering a solution to this problem;
however, gene-editing in hiPSCs is generally low throughput. We recently developed a novel gene-editing
technique called CRISPR activation On-Target Editing Retrieval (CRaTER) that can edit hiPSCs at scale,
enabling the generation of large variant libraries in hiPSCs for the first time. To address the growing MYH7
VUS problem, we plan to perform a deep mutational scan of MYH7 in physiologically-relevant hiPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). In Aim 1, we propose to generate a single nucleotide variant (SNV) library of
nearly all possible MYH7 SNVs in hiPSC-CMs. We will leverage CRaTER-assisted genome-editing to be able
to generate a hiPSC SNV library at this scale. In Aim 2 we will optimize and validate phenotypic assays to be
able to discriminate hiPSC-CMs expressing pathogenic variants from hiPSC-CMs expressing benign variants.
These phenotypic assays will inform a deep mutational scan of MYH7 that will determine the functional effect
of nearly all possible MYH7 SNVs and assist with clinical variant interpretation. In summary, we will combine
CRaTER, a novel gene-editing technique we developed, with hiPSCs to perform a DMS of MYH7 in genome-
edited hiPSC-CMs. The results will improve the interpretation of ~1,800 MYH7 VUS, enable the interpretation
of thousands of possible MYH7 SNVs that may be encountered in the future, and provide a framework by
which deep mutational scans can be performed in hiPSC-derivatives for the first time, which we believe will be
transformative for the field of variant interpretation."

Disorders of social behavior are increasingly prevalent and pose a substantial burden to society. These
disorders often show sex differences in prevalence, expression, and severity. One explanation for these
differences reflects dysfunction in the sexually differentiated social brain. A particularly relevant neuropeptide
system in this respect is the arginine vasopressin (AVP) innervation of the brain, which shows marked sex
differences across many species, including humans, and has been implicated in aggressive as well as
affiliative behavior. Indeed, the main receptor for AVP in the brain, V1aR, has been linked to social behavior,
including that of humans. Despite the significance of this system, few studies have directly assessed how,
when, and where AVP and V1aR systems interact to influence social interest in adults. Here we focus on the
interaction between the sexually dimorphic AVP cells of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and its
major target, the lateral septum (LS), an area with the highest expression of V1aR in vertebrate brains. In the
first aim, we will test the necessity of LS V1aR cells for social interest by optogenetic inhibition of these cells or
by genetically knocking out V1aR in LS. In addition, we will combine optogenetic stimulation of BNST AVP
cells and V1aR knockdown in LS in vivo and ex vivo to test whether AVP from the BNST specifically acts on
LS V1aR cells to alter behavior and cellular physiology. The second aim will test whether V1aRs in the LS are
sufficient for driving social interest by optogenetic excitation of these cells. The third aim will test whether V1aR
cells in the LS encode social interest in a sexually dimorphic manner, and whether this encoding is altered by
BNST AVP cell activity (via chemogenetic inhibition). This project will significantly enhance our mechanistic
understanding of how the brain controls social behavior differently in males and females and may give insight
as to why many behavioral disorders show striking sex differences in morbidity. Although recently major
advances have been made in understanding the neural basis of social behavior, how such behavior is
controlled differently in males and females is, by and large, unknown. This grant will address these issues."

This proposal aims to determine the mechanisms that lead to the generation of astrocytes in the developing
human cortex. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the adult human brain, mediating vital functions
including myelination, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. During
development, control over the spatio-temporal patterns of the production and numbers of astrocytes is necessary
for proper brain function. The developmental potential of neocortical progenitors exhibits evolutionary divergence
across mammalian clades, leading to primate-specific cell types, such as interlaminar astrocytes. Progress in
studying human astrocytic development is limited by the ethical and practical challenges in working with human
fetal tissue and fundamental differences between mammalian models and humans. Consequently, how the
developmental potential of progenitor cells of the cortex is restricted to generate astrocytes remains unknown.
Addressing this question is essential for understanding human brain development and will lay the foundation for
uncovering the causes and devising new treatment strategies for astrocyte-related human diseases
In mouse, astrocytic progenitors arise only after cortical neurons from the six layers are generated. The common
hypothesis was that, similarly, astrocytes arise from outer radial glia in humans in the second trimester of
development after the layers of the cortex are already formed. Preliminary work obtained through the analysis of
single-cell gene expression data from the developing human cortex, in vitro embryonic stem cell experiments,
and in vitro to in vivo mapping shows that the astrocytic lineage in humans arises very early before the cortical
layers are formed and likely from the neuroepithelium of the forebrain. Computational analysis of the fetal tissue
single-cell expression data and preliminary experiments implicate cell-to-cell contact-dependent signaling
through YAP and NOTCH pathways in determining the astrogliogenic fate of the progenitors. Further, preliminary
computational analyses of human fetal data identify critical transcription factors involved in this fate decision.
The proposal aims to determine the developmental potential and the lineage decisions of the newly identified
astrogliogenic progenitors over 9 months. This will be accomplished by tracing the lineage decisions of
progenitors in the validated in vitro system using viral bar-coded viral libraries and clonal analyses and mapping
the results, through data analysis, onto in vivo human fetal data as well as through immunostaining of
cryosectioned fetal tissue obtained at different time points.
The proposal further aims to determine the role of YAP and NOTCH signaling and the computationally implicated
transcription factors in generating these newly identified progenitors. This is accomplished through novel human
embryonic stem cell lines and live imaging to monitor the dynamics of these signaling pathways, chemical, and
genetic perturbations that allow modulation of pathway activity, and inducible CRISPRi to knock down specific
genes while monitoring their effects on the generation and patterning of the progenitors."
10981908,"Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) plays a central role in mitochondrial energetics. It is the final electron
acceptor in the respiratory chain of mitochondria, which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of
oxygen to water and harnesses the chemical energy to pump four protons across the inner
mitochondrial membrane to establish an electrochemical proton gradient that is used to synthesize
ATP. In humans, CcO activity is intricately regulated by a variety of cellular effectors, such as
hormones, adenine nucleotides and cytochrome c. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms by
which the oxygen reduction reaction carried out by CcO is coupled to proton translocation and the
activity of the enzyme is regulated by cellular effectors remain poorly understood. It creates a critical
barrier hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies against the related diseases. The
two major aims of this project are to (i) determine the 3D structures of key oxygen intermediates of
CcO using time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX), thereby delineating the
protein conformational changes associated with the oxygen reduction reaction occurring in the active
site of the enzyme, and (ii) determine the 3D structures of CcO in complex with cellular effectors,
including thyroid hormones, steroid hormones, ADP/ATP, and cytochrome c, using single-particle
cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), thereby deciphering the allosteric protein conformational
changes critical for the cellular regulatory mechanisms. The structural studies will be complemented
by activity assays and spectroscopic measurements to establish structure and function relationships
of the enzyme. This project, built on our extensive experience in spectroscopic and structural studies
of CcO, as well as our strong preliminary data in structural determination of CcO with cryo-EM, will
uncover paradigms that greatly enhance our understanding of this important enzyme essential for
life."

Loss and changes to central nervous system (CNS) myelin architecture are prevalent in neurological
conditions across the lifespan. Incomplete restoration of myelin sheaths, as seen in multiple sclerosis,
leads to disability. Our long-term goal is to identify developmental mechanisms controlling CNS myelin
formation essential to CNS function, thus informing future therapies that remediate lost and aberrant myelin
in neurological diseases. Myelin sheath architecture, particularly length, controls axonal signaling speed.
The >10-fold variation in myelin sheath lengths observed in the CNS adjusts neuronal signaling speeds
and, therefore, is thought to enable neural network coordination. Considering this pivotal role for myelin
sheath length, a critical question arises: how can appropriate myelin sheath lengths be restored after
disruption in neurological disorders to faithfully enable neural networks? The objective of this proposal, to
determine mechanisms that establish CNS myelin sheath lengths, is paramount to addressing this
question. Contrasting the long-held hypothesis that biochemical instruction from neurons is required for
CNS myelination, our team made the unprecedented discovery that diameter of synthetic axons (a.k.a.
microfibers) is sufficient to control oligodendrocyte myelin sheath length. These findings led to a new model
for myelin formation and to our central hypothesis: axon diameter is a primary instructive cue that
establishes CNS myelin length, triggering oligodendrocyte mechanotransduction (i.e., how physical cues
are translated into molecular responses) mediating myelin growth. Based upon our preliminary data, we
propose that oligodendrocytes respond to the physical cue of diameter (1) via a mechanosensitive ion
channel, (2) triggering Ca2+ signaling, and (3) that diameter-triggered mechanotransduction coordinates
translational machinery essential to promote myelin sheath growth. We experimentally test this model using
complementary approaches: primary oligodendrocyte-microfiber cultures, ex vivo slice cultures, and
traditional in vivo tissue analysis. We combine our innovative oligodendrocyte-microfiber cultures with live
timelapse imaging and photomanipulation methods that allow us to both observe and manipulate signaling
within individual myelin sheaths formed by single oligodendrocytes. This uniquely enables us to assess
signals triggered solely by diameter during myelin formation with spatial precision—at the level of individual
myelin sheaths–and experimentally interrogate current proposed models for how each myelin sheath
independently controls sheath growth/elongation. Identifying mechanotransduction signals that establish
myelin sheath length in this proposed project will lay the groundwork to directly test the impact of altered
myelin lengths on CNS function that will inform strategies for myelin restoration in neurological disorders."
10982437,"Early detection through screening mammography has decreased death rates from breast cancer. There are
approximately 39 million mammogram procedures conducted each year in the US. However, there are still
alarmingly high error rates in radiological interpretations, with missed cancer rates ranging from 10-18 percent
and false positive rates as high as 67% over a 10-year period. To reduce error rates, digital breast
tomosynthesis, a new 3D imaging technology intended to make cancers more visible to the radiologist, is
rapidly being introduced throughout clinics in the US. The widespread adoption of new 3D technologies has
dramatically increased the data volume that radiologists must scrutinize and has fundamentally altered how
they search, relying on vision away from where they are fixating (peripheral vision), eye movements, and
image (slice) scrolls to find potential disease. Yet, we are missing a theoretical and empirical understanding of
how radiologists might best search through 3D clinical images to maximize target detection while maintaining
reasonable reading times. Furthermore, what metrics to use to optimize image processing and acquisition
parameters to maximize radiologists’ performance with the new 3D technologies? The last 30 years of the field
of medical imaging have been shaped by task-based image quality metrics based on ideal and model
observers that mimic human performance. And yet, these often omit human bottlenecks of peripheral visual
processing and do not work with 3D search with clinical images or phantoms. In this context, the overall goal of
the current proposal is to combine recent Deep Neural Network developments and biologically-plausible
models of human-foveated vision to create a model that learns about anatomy and optimally (performance
maximizing) programs eye movements and scrolls to find lesions in digital phantoms and clinical images
(foveated search DNN, FS-DNN). If successful, the FS-DNN could be used to evaluate in what way a
particular radiologist is not adequately examining the 3D clinical, estimate the accuracy costs of the
scroll/search inefficiency, and determine how they might improve. The project will implement learning
protocols based on FS-DNN/human comparisons and assess their impact on improving diagnostic accuracy. If
successful, the FS-DNN could be a new powerful metric of image quality for 3D search that, unlike previous
models, can be applied to phantoms and clinical images. A collaboration with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) aims at integrating the developed FS-DNN model with the FDA Virtual Imaging Clinical
Trial for Regulatory Evaluation (VICTRE) pipeline that is made available to academic researchers and industry
technology developers. Together, these advances can potentially help reduce radiological errors with digital
breast tomosynthesis and also help evaluate and optimize new technologies. Although the proposed work is
developed for breast cancer and DBT, the approach, framework and concepts investigated are potentially
applicable to other areas of 3D medical images in radiology."

somatic cell reprogramming. Our recent studies have identified the nucleotide excision repair protein XPC as a
potent activator of TDG-dependent DNA demethylation genome-wide and preferentially at gene enhancers
bound by transcription factor HIF1a. The overall objective of this project is to determine how XPC and TDG
together integrate signals to regulate active DNA demethylation and epigenetic reprogramming. The central
hypothesis is that XPC is a novel regulator of dynamic DNA demethylation via TDG and thereby plays an
essential role in pluripotent cell fate transitions. The rationale of our work is that by deciphering how XPC
regulates TDG-dependent DNA demethylation in response to HIF1a, we will gain a new understanding of how
the XPC-TDG-HIF1a axis integrates signals to coordinately regulate epigenetic changes that contribute to
normal development and reprogramming. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific
Aims: 1) Identify mechanisms by which XPC-TDG-HIF1a axis regulates DNA demethylation and metabolism in
somatic cell reprogramming; 2) Identify mechanisms by which XPC promotes recruitment of TDG by HIF1a;
and 3) Identify the role of post-translational modifications of TDG via SUMOylation in regulating DNA
demethylation dynamics. Under the first aim, genome-wide and functional studies will be employed to identify
how XPC and TDG regulate epigenetic changes at HIF1a-regulated gene loci to induce transcriptional and
metabolic changes favorable for reprogramming. In the second aim, biochemical and loss-of-function studies
will be performed to identify the role of XPC and novel associating factors in directing TDG to specific gene
enhancers for demethylation. Under the third aim, the role of XPC in regulating post-translational modifications
of TDG and the effect of TDG SUMOylation on demethylation dynamics and specificity will be directly
measured in living cells using single particle tracking. The proposed research is innovative because new
activities of XPC in DNA demethylation, through post-translational modification of TDG and novel TDG-HIF1a
complex assembly mechanism, will be uncovered using new tools. This contribution is significant, because the
regulatory components and epigenetic mechanisms we identify are likely to advance our fundamental
understanding of epigenetic control of development, and how epigenetic dysregulation causes disease."
10980662,"Polycystic Kidney Disease is the common denominator in several phenotypically diverse genetic conditions of
the kidney. These diseases include Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), Autosomal
Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease, Nephronophthisis (NPHP), and Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial
Kidney Disease (ADTKD). NPHP, which can also be implicated in syndromic forms of PKD such as Joubert,
Bardet-Biedl, and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, together with ADTKD account for 10-20% of children with chronic
renal failure and for 1-5% of all patients undergoing dialysis or transplantation. Mechanisms of cyst development
have been extensively studied using a wide variety of genetic, biochemical, functional, and pharmacological
approaches. While significant progress has been made in identifying the involvement of signaling pathways and
key organelles in disease pathophysiology, the step-by-step mechanisms mediating the architectural and
structural changes of tubular cells during cyst formation and expansion are incompletely understood. It is
becoming increasingly clear that both intrinsic processes such as cell signaling, cell death, and proliferation, as
well as extrinsic factors, such as fibrosis and inflammation influence cystic growth and expansion. Understanding
these processes would be of paramount importance in identifying new, more effective, and specific targets for
pharmacologic intervention. We undertook an approach of proteome reprogramming by deleting the Fbxw7 gene
in tubular cells to identify protein networks responsible for cystogenesis. FBW7 (gene name, Fbxw7) is the
recognition receptor of the SCFFBW7 E3 ligase which processes numerous proteins for ubiquitin-mediated
degradation. Mutant mice developed slowly progressing cystic kidney disease without kidney enlargement,
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular degeneration, and an overall gradual decline in kidney function. These are
cardinal features of NPHP and ADTKD. Aided by the ability to identify direct FBW7 targets, we have identified
protein networks with potential roles in cystogenesis, fibrosis, and tubular degermation. Using this information,
we now aim at understanding how cystogenesis develops, how it is modulated by fibrosis and/or tubular
degeneration, and how these processes impact overall renal function. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will enhance our understanding of cellular mechanisms of cystogenesis, fibrosis, and tubular
degeneration and aid in the identification of new therapeutic targets for PKD."

 In the United States alone each year an estimated 60,000 individuals are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD)
with an economic cost of over fifty billion dollars each year. The individuals with Parkinson's disease show severe
hypokinetic motor symptoms as well as anxiety, depression and cognitive decline. There are currently no treatments to
prevent the progression of PD. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets is essential to address this clinical burden. The
primary disease pathology involves degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra which triggers
maladaptive changes in the striatum that underlie some of the motor and possibly non-motor symptoms in PD. Recent
studies have identified an important contribution of the thalamostriatal system to behavioral deficits in PD models.
Changes in function of synapses at parafascicular thalamus (Pf) inputs to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) has been
observed in mice with 6-OHDA lesion. Importantly, chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of Pf neurons or their
terminals in the striatum alleviates motor dysfunction in PD models. Therefore, identification of mechanisms underlying
this defect has potential to improve motor and non-motor function in PD. Based on our recent studies and preliminary data
we hypothesize that glutamate delta 1 receptor (GluD1)-cerebellin 1 (Cbln1) complex and associated synaptic organizers
contribute to PD-related changes in thalamostriatal function and therefore can be targeted to mitigate behavioral deficits.
Specific Aim1 will examine the effect of dopamine-depletion on GluD1-Cbln1 and associated synaptic organizer
expression in an acute neurotoxin as well as a progressive genetic mouse models of PD. Changes in ultrastructure of
striatal synapses in PD models will be evaluated using 3D-electron microscopy. Specific Aim 2 will determine the
relationship between changes in synaptic organizer levels, synaptic properties and motor and non-motor behaviors.
Specific Aim 3 will determine the effect of genetic and pharmacological restoration of normal GluD1-Cbln1 trans-
synaptic signaling in rescuing synaptic changes and mitigating behavioral deficits in PD models. To accomplish these
aims we will utilize a combination of confocal and electron microscopy (immuno and 3D), brain slice electrophysiology,
behavior, optogenetics and genetic approaches to determine the contribution of synaptic organizers in striatal
neuroplasticity and behaviors in PD. This project is significant because it would identify therapeutically targetable
strategy to alleviate PD motor and non-motor deficits and/or modify disease progression. Scientific rigor of research
design is established by the use of multiple methods and approaches, replication of experiments in independent
laboratories, use of validated models and reagents, consideration of blinding, biological variables and sex in addition to
other aspects of experimental design."

Research: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic inflammatory diseases of the
gastrointestinal tract that affect over 3 million Americans. Abdominal pain is a common symptom of IBD, but the
role of pain-sensing nociceptor neurons in regulating the inflammatory process is largely unknown. Based on my
published and new preliminary data, I hypothesize that nociceptor sensory neurons and neuropeptides are
tissue-protective, but become dysregulated in the context IBD, and subsequently drive pathological adaptive
immunity and alterations to the microbiota that facilitate intestinal inflammation and impair tissue repair. This
proposal aims to thoroughly investigate the regulation of intestinal infection and inflammation by nociceptor
sensory neurons and determine the detailed underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms using innovative and
interdisciplinary approaches from neurobiology, gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology. These studies
will uncover novel neuro-immune-microbiota crosstalk pathways and their unique roles in intestinal inflammation
and transform our understandings of host-microbe interactions and neuro-immune mechanisms in IBD.
Career goals: My overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic institution
where I decipher the neuro-immune and neuron-microbiota pathways that regulate intestinal tolerance and
inflammation and eventually discover neuronal-based and microbiota-based drug targets for immune modulation
to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including IBD. Furthermore, I aspire to become an inspirational teacher
and outstanding mentor.
Career Development Plan: To become a successful independent investigator I will further develop various
research, professional and personal skills. These will include further acquiring expertise in neurobiology and
microbiology techniques, as well as fostering collaborations and developing skills in writing, mentoring, teaching,
communicating and laboratory management. My host laboratory and Weill Cornell Medicine provides an
outstanding academic environment in which trainees can fulfil these criteria by promoting scientific interactions
and enrolling in courses to develop skills in specialist scientific areas, personal development and laboratory
management. The mentorship I will receive will be of the highest standard. Furthermore, in addition to my mentor
and co-mentor, I have support from a team of independent investigators with extensive expertise in areas that
will greatly facilitate the completion of experiments proposed and my career transitional into independence.
Career Development Environment: I will perform the K99 phase in the laboratory of Dr. David Artis at the Weill
Cornell Medicine, which provides an unprecedented environment in terms of the resources and facilities
available. Weill Cornell Medicine is an ideal environment to develop during the K99 phase as I progress to
become a successful independent investigator. The laboratory has access to all of the equipment and facilities
necessary to complete the experiments proposed in this application."
10985074,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease diagnosed postmortem in people
exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) from football and other contact sports. NINDS consensus research
diagnostic criteria for the clinical syndrome of CTE, known as traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), were
published in 2021. However, we cannot diagnose CTE in life due to the following knowledge gaps: 1) TES criteria
do not include biomarkers, limiting disease specificity; (2) longitudinal studies are lacking; (3) biomarkers and
clinical features that distinguish CTE from other AD/ADRDs are unknown; and (4) risk/resilience factors of TES
are unclear, particularly social determinants of health (SDOH). In 2015, we were awarded a NINDS funded 7-
year U01 known as the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project (DIAGNOSE), designed in part to develop biomarkers
of CTE. It enrolled 180 former football players (120 professional, 60 college) and 60 non-RHI controls, all males
ages 45-74. Baseline clinical exams, MRI, tau (flortaucipir) and amyloid PET, and blood draws were completed
in 2020. Four-year remote follow-ups, including in-home blood draws, were finished in Nov. 2023. We had a 90%
retention rate. The goals of this R01 are to retain and grown DIAGNOSE and examine the clinical and biomarker
course and profiles of TES (Aim 1); investigate risk/resilience factors of TES (Aim 2); and compare biomarkers
of amyloid (Aβ), p-tau, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and white matter injury between TES and AD
syndromes (Aims 3-4). Our hypotheses are that TES has unique clinical and biomarker profiles, and RHI and
non-RHI risk factors influence the development of TES. There will be 3 groups: (1) Retention, 150 former football
players and 50 controls retained from DIAGNOSE; (2) Expansion, we will grow DIAGNOSE by newly recruiting
75 former college and professional football players and 25 controls; (3) AD, 50 Aβ+ participants with cognitive
impairment. In total, we will study 225 former football players, 75 controls, and 50 AD. Groups will be similar in
age (50+), sex (males), and race (40% Black). Participants will complete a single visit, including clinical exams,
SDOH measures, MRI, blood draw, and tau PET, at 1 of 5 P30 AD Research Centers: BU, UCSF, Arizona,
1Florida, or South Texas. Retention Cohort will have flortaucipir PET to study its longitudinal value. Expansion
Cohort will have MK-6240 PET to build on our R21. A subset of Retention (n=20) will have flortaucipir and MK-
6240 for tracer comparison. Blood will be analyzed for 6 p-tau epitopes, Aβ40/42, neuroinflammation, and white
matter injury. Retention Cohort will have legacy data for longitudinal study of outcomes (2-3 timepoints over 6-8
years). Expansion will contribute to pooled cross-sectional analyses. DIAGNOSE participants were asked for
brain donation; 8 have donated. This R01 will permit continued brain donation and clinical-pathological validation
studies. This R01 will retain and grow a unique, deeply phenotyped, longitudinal cohort of people at risk for CTE.
Results will help refine the TES criteria and differentiate it from other AD/ADRDs. This R01 will provide insight
into the detection, diagnosis, and prognosis for people living with CTE, paving the way for treatment trials."

Neurodegenerative Diseases: Biology & Therapeutics
December 4 - December 7, 2024
This proposal seeks support for the biennial conference on Neurodegenerative Diseases: Biology
& Therapeutics, from December 4 – December 7, 2024 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL).
The meeting brings together scientists who investigate both basic and translational aspects of
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. For many of these disorders, the molecular pathways of the disease processes
remain unclear and thus few biomarkers have been identified. For other disorders, existing
treatments are designed primarily to provide relief from symptoms without addressing the biology
underlying degenerative processes. Translational research is therefore needed to develop and
validate novel diagnostic strategies as well as new therapeutics that might halt or stem disease
progression, rather than simply alleviate symptoms. The conference will advance knowledge in
neurodegeneration by providing a forum where scientists from distinct laboratories and
institutions, both academic and industry, can exchange findings, ideas, and seek collaborations.
It will include sessions on convergent and divergent pathways in neurodegenerative diseases,
glial biology, immune system, therapeutic strategies, APOE and lipid metabolism, cell biology,
and biomarkers and structural studies. For human studies seeking new treatments for
neurodegeneration to be informative, it is essential for scientists who research different aspects
of those treatments to meet regularly in a setting like CSHL to exchange data and ideas. The
2024 CSHL meeting on Neurodegenerative Diseases: Biology & Therapeutics will build on the
successes of prior CSHL meetings to assemble an international gathering of top scientists from
academia and the biopharmaceutical industry, discuss new developments in the field, and
catalyze innovative research collaborations, all of which will ultimately accelerate the pace of
discovery."
10995977,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are genetic disorders of the immune system that can present with a wide diversity
of signs and symptoms. Specific antibody deficiency (SAD) is among the most common classes of IEI and occurs
when patients have normal levels of serum immunoglobulins but are unable to form specific responses to
antigens. Despite its high prevalence, the pathogenesis of SAD remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate
a family that presented with a specific antibody deficiency with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
Although whole exome sequencing did not reveal any variants in known IEI-associated genes, whole genome
sequencing uncovered a heterozygous tandem duplication on chromosome 14 that intersects the
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. All affected individuals also had a selective memory (CD27+ CD38
Lo/Int) B cell deficiency in peripheral blood. CD27- B cells were hyperproliferative in response to T-dependent
and T-independent stimuli yet showed diminished differentiation to plasmablasts when stimulated with CD40L
and IL-21. Intriguingly, one of the duplicated genes, JAG2 was upregulated more than 100-fold at baseline when
measured by bulk RNA-seq. CITE-seq revealed that JAG2 is uniquely overexpressed in patient B cells but not
in other immune cells. Given the diminished differentiation and B-cell-specific overexpression of JAG2 seen in
these patients, we hypothesize that the duplication has transposed JAG2 under the transcriptional control of the
IgH locus, a phenomenon known as ‘enhancer hijacking’, resulting in its increased expression only in B cells.
We further hypothesize that the sustained expression of JAG2 upon stimulation results in diminished
differentiation, leading to the clinical phenotype of SAD. Throughout this project, we will investigate the effects
of JAG2 on B cell differentiation and explore the genetic mechanism of JAG2 overexpression using a number of
cutting-edge techniques and novel models, including tonsil organoids and measles-pseudotyped lentivirus to
manipulate the expression of JAG2 in human B cells and assess its effects on B cell differentiation. Previous
studies of IEI have primarily focused on single nucleotide variants causing altered protein function or abundance.
Here, we propose a structural variant is causing altered enhancer interactions between JAG2 and the
IgH locus, resulting in SAD. This represents a novel genetic mechanism of IEI and would alter the way we
approach the genetic diagnosis of IEI."

Food insecurity disproportionately affects people with diabetes mellitus and is associated with suboptimal
diabetes self-management behaviors and poor diabetes outcomes including hypoglycemia, poor glycemic
control, and increased acute healthcare utilization. Standardized diabetes self-management education and
support (DSMES) services designed to improve health behaviors of people with diabetes are associated with
improved diabetes outcomes but have rarely been studied in people experiencing food insecurity, who face
unique challenges in diabetes self-management. The proposed research aims to adapt and develop a DSMES
intervention for people with food insecurity. The candidate will use formative mixed methods research to
determine the nutritional, behavioral, and psychological barriers to diabetes self-management for people with
food insecurity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to inform the development of the intervention, which will focus on
strategies to improve nutrition and mitigate medication-related barriers relevant to this population. Results of
this study will contribute to the limited body of research centered on DSMES services for people with health-
related social needs and provide preliminary data for a future career development award to test whether the
adapted intervention improves the effectiveness of DSMES for people with food insecurity. The three-part aim
will (a) use quantitative methods to identify demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors associated with
low dietary quality in a cohort of low-income patients with T2D (N=161); (b) use qualitative methods to
interview patients (n=25) and providers (n=5) to explore key barriers in this population; and (c) adapt a DSMES
intervention to the specific needs of this population using findings from (a) and (b). The candidate will complete
the proposed work under the mentorship of Drs. Anne Thorndike, an expert in behavioral interventions for
cardiometabolic disease prevention and management, and Deborah Wexler, an expert in T2D and intervention
design. In addition to their direct mentorship, the candidate will pursue formal coursework in qualitative
research methods and design and evaluation of health interventions and will participate in regular collaborative
research meetings related to diabetes, qualitative research, and health behavior interventions. The Divisions of
Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism and General Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital
will provide an unparalleled environment for trainee learning. This application represents a comprehensive plan
to develop an intervention to improve equity in diabetes management for people experiencing health-related
social needs, and to prepare the candidate to apply for a career development award with the ultimate goal of
becoming an independent clinical investigator."
10994780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 During retinal development, thousands of genes change in their expression as multipotent retinal
progenitor cells produce each of the 7 classes of cell types in an evolutionarily conserved birth order.
Although it has been well established that large enhancers called super-enhancers (SEs) can play an
important role in regulating developmental stage– and cell type–specific gene expression, a major
barrier in the field is identifying specific promoter-SE interactions. This is challenging because SEs can
act over long distance (up to 1 Mb) and in either orientation. For convenience, investigators often
assume that the closest SE is the most relevant, but this is often not the case. Identification and
characterization of specific promoter–SE interactions are important because mutations in the non-
coding genome can contribute to human disease including retinopathies. To address this major gap in
knowledge, we have spent the past 10 years developing a detailed map of chromatin structure in the
developing human and murine retinae. This integrated retinal nucleome database (iRNDb) is the largest
and most comprehensive map of chromatin structure in the retina with over 2,500 individual files.
Recently, we updated the iRNDb (v.2) with the addition of single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-
seq to provide developmental stage– and cell type–specific features and HiChIP to provide data on
promoter–SE interactions. All our published and unpublished data are shared freely with the biomedical
research community on the St. Jude Cloud (https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/iRNDb_v2). Using the iRNDb
(v.2), we have identified developmental stage– and cell type–specific promoter–SE interactions for
each of the early retinal transcription factor network genes (Vsx2, Lhx2, Otx2, Pax6, Rax, Six3, Six6,
Sox2 and Tbx3). The most exciting discovery is that each of the SEs associated with the early retinal
transcription factor genes is made up of discrete modules predicted to have developmental stage– and
cell type–specific activity. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that Six3/SIX3 and Otx2/OTX2
are regulated by modular SEs in human and murine retinae. These genes were chosen because they
are essential for retinogenesis and altered expression can cause developmental defects in humans.
Our results will fill a fundamental gap in our knowledge about the regulation of early retinal transcription
factor network genes and validate our genome-wide map of promoter–SE interactions in the developing
retina (iRNDb (v.2)). This research proposal is relevant to human health because it will provide a map
of relevant regulatory elements in the non-coding genome that may contribute to developmental
defects."

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality, reflecting the fact that only
9% of patients present with tumor localized to the primary site, so that the vast majority of patients with pancreatic
cancer are unresectable at the time of diagnosis. We have created a program that spans the identification of
new molecular targets by spatial transcriptomics, the identification of peptide/small molecule ligands, and the
preclinical and eventual clinical evaluation of these therapies. Peptide targeted radionuclide therapy (PTRT) is a
molecularly targeted treatment strategy that uses radiolabeled peptides as biological targeting vectors designed
to deliver cytotoxic levels of radiation dose precisely to cancer cells that overexpress specific receptors. Peptides
with high receptor affinity are conjugated with a chelator for diagnostic imaging using positron emission
tomography (PET) for patient staging, selection of suitable candidates for PTRT, and subsequent treatment
monitoring. In turn, peptides are then stably radiolabeled with the intermediate-energy β-emitter lutetium-177
(177Lu). Peptides are superior for delivery due to the ease of synthesis, comparable potential affinity and
specificity, improved pharmacokinetic profiles, and low immunogenicity. We now have 40 spatially sequenced
pancreatic cancer samples, each with 4000 locations sequenced at a depth of 18,000 genes. Across all of these
samples, we have identified Claudin-4 (CLDN4) as a particularly promising target; CLDN4 is the top target from
our analysis as it 1) is a tight junction protein that is not accessible in normal tissue, and 2) is overexpressed
(~16x) in all patients and in 97% of the cancer cluster spatial regions we have sequenced. Peptides have been
identified with nanomolar affinity for CLDN4 and we have demonstrated specific accumulation of ~20%IA/cc in
tumor and peritoneal metastases in a PDAC model. Our spatial analysis of these samples indicates that if we
can deliver a peptide carrying a beta-emitter to all CLDN4 expressing cells, all cancer cells could receive a
therapeutic dose of radiation. Further, we have developed the first computational method to generate cyclic
peptides to specific binding domains and have now generated peptides against the tight junction region of
CLDN4. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (Cpe) is a natural ligand to CLDN4, and we evaluate mutated
peptide fragments from this ligand and cyclic peptides designed by new machine learning tools. Our specific
aims are to: Aim 1) Assess and optimize claudin-4 peptides in vitro. Aim 2) Evaluate 64Cu and 68Ga-labeled
claudin-4 peptides in cell culture and mouse models of pancreatic cancer Aim 3) Evaluate claudin-4 peptides
labeled with lutetium-177 in 3A) cell culture, 3B) xenograft, transgenic and PDX mouse models and 3C)
combination therapy with immunotherapy."

Non-Hodgkinlymphomas (NHL) represent about 90% of all lymphomas diagnosed each year and is classified
based on cell type - B cell, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell types, location - nodal or extra nodal, and the tumor
grade - aggressive (high grade) and indolent (low grade). Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent
B-cell lymphoma but remains a largely incurable malignancy. The most clinically challenging aspect of FL is the
transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), characterized by the emergence of more aggressive
subclones, loss of the follicular growth spatial architecture, and resistance to treatment, leading to a much-
shortened survival period, typically less than 2 years. Among T-cell lymphomas, angioimmunoblastic T-cell
lymphoma (AITL) is one of the most common subtypes characterized by a tumor with follicular helper phenotype
surrounded by an inflammatory microenvironment, arborizing vasculature, and progression with dramatic
changes in spatial architecture. Although the discovery of FL transformation and AITL tumor evolution was
initially documented over 50 years ago, the biological mechanisms and clinical implications remain poorly
understood. No biomarkers exist to predict or therapies to prevent its metastases or progression to highly
aggressive lymphomas. Both of these tumors hijack normal follicle biology to escape immune surveillance and
potentially develop resistance clones. Yale HTAN Center aims to leverage the latest development in single-cell
and spatial omics technologies to construct a spatiotemporal atlas of human FL transformation to DLBCL and
AITL evolution. Specifically, we will apply high-plex immunofluorescence protein imaging to map all major cell
types and spatial whole transcriptome sequencing to link cell type to mutational landscape, clonal evolution, and
spatial interaction within the tumor microenvironment. We will further integrate spatial omics data with single
nucleus RNA sequencing to identify cell subtypes and niches across tissue samples over various disease stages
to construct a complete cell atlas associated with tumor transformation for different genders and racial/ethnic
groups and then computationally model the spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamics. Finally, we will apply and
integrate spatial-epigenome-transcriptome co-profiling to unveil epigenetic mechanism underlying such
transformation and potentially discover earliest events to predict the progression. The proposed spatiotemporal
lymphoma atlas represents a valuable resource to test a range of hypotheses such as how different tumor clones
emerge, interact, compete or cooperate in the spatial tissue context to drive lymphomagenesis, how T cells
recognize and interact with different mutant clones, how the microenvironment co-evolves with tumor cells, and
how to predict the likelihood of transformation and therapeutic stratification of patients. Single-cell spatial omics
techniques and computational models can be applied to other types of human tumors within the HTAN
consortium."

Dysbiosis of the host microbiome is now recognized as a hallmark of cancer and a factor in the systemic
response to immunotherapy. While a large volume of literature and data resources on microbiome research are
available, systemic comparison and analysis are limited due to the heterogeneity in data and reporting
schema. To enable rapid and cost-effective elucidation of the roles of microorganisms in the etiology and
progression of cancer, we have developed high-quality harmonized databases of public microbiome data and
microbial signatures. This proposal expands and creates new features of these microbiome databases through
four aims. First, it will enhance the analytic scope of BugSigDB, a Semantic Mediawiki for manual curation and
review of microbial signatures by incorporating microbial physiologies and morphologies, predicted metabolic
functions, automatic identification of similar signatures, and creation of user-friendly Bug Set Enrichment
Analysis workflows. Second, it will establish the next generation of curatedMetagenomicData, a microbiome
database of large-scale manual curation and uniformly processed shotgun sequencing data, supporting FAIR
principles. We will create a federated, ontology-based curation system and distributed computing metagenomic
profiling workflow, both applicable to all Sequence Read Archive (SRA) records. Third, it will expand
curatedMetagenomicData and BugSigDB with data from thousands of published studies and perform
meta-analyses using these resources. Lastly, we will mobilize hundreds of data curators from diverse
backgrounds by participating in established internship programs and mobilize the microbiome research
community to adopt reporting standards for publication. This contribution is significant because it increases the
likelihood of developing effective public health interventions to prevent and detect microbiota-linked cancers by
providing methods for improved mechanistic interpretation of microbiome studies, extracting new information
from published raw metagenomic shotgun sequencing data and metadata, and enabling re-use of existing data
by a much broader range of researchers and methodologies. The proposed research is innovative because it
identifies and corrects important deficiencies in how microbiome data are published, increasing the utility of
public data and published results on a large scale by other research teams."

Synthetic gene circuits that enable precise, customizable control of gene regulation and human cell function can
address unmet needs in biology, medicine, and synthetic biology, ranging from next-generation cell-based
therapies to programming tissue function. However, the lack of engineering toolkits that provide robust in vivo
activity, clinically-suitable compositions, and easy implementation for implementing gene circuits in biomedically-
relevant human cell types has drastically limited our ability to realize these important biomedical goals. To
overcome these limitations, our collaborative team recently established a powerful set of toolkits that enable the
construction of “clinically-optimized” synthetic circuits for (FDA-approved) drug-inducible and cell-autonomous
control of therapeutic human cell function. Using these toolkits, we already succeeded in engineering advanced
control of primary human T cells, such as programming T cells to recognize multi-faceted features of target cells
and launch complex, multi-tiered therapeutic actions – foundational work that serves as the basis of a recently
launched clinical trial for next-generation cellular therapy. In this project, we will expand our gene circuit
engineering capabilities in critical new directions – toward engineering precise control of human macrophage
and coordinated multi-immune cell functions – through the development of monocyte/macrophage-optimized
toolkits. Macrophages are functionally versatile cell types that play central homeostatic roles in nearly all tissues.
Additionally, macrophages have a number of unique properties that make them promising tools for potential cell-
based therapies, including their natural ability to migrate into tumors and their ability to phagocytose cells and
interface with the adaptive immune system through antigen presentation. However, engineering macrophage
function through synthetic biology-based methods remains nascent and technologically underdeveloped. We will
address this unmet need through three independent Aims. First, we will develop macrophage-optimized toolkits
of synthetic humanized transcription factors and transcriptional receptors for programmed gene regulation,
enabling the construction of circuits for localized, signal-dependent production of immune effectors and payloads
in vitro and in vivo. Second, we will establish a novel, high-throughput pipeline to generate and screen
engineered macrophage receptors with customizable phagocytic and immune activation functions. Finally, we
will demonstrate novel circuit types that allow macrophages to coordinate their responses with endogenous
and/or engineered T cells to drive synergistic and amplified immune functions, thus establishing the basis for
engineering multicellular immune networks. Together, this work and our toolkits, which will make freely available
to the academic scientific community, will substantially expand the capabilities of mammalian cell engineering
and usher in an exciting era of macrophage cell-based biotechnologies with broad biomedical and therapeutic
applicability."
10990937,"Recurrent breast cancer is typically an incurable disease. Consequently, the tendency of breast cancers
to recur following treatment is the most important determinant of clinical outcome. Recurrent tumors arise from
the reservoir of residual tumor cells (RTCs) that can persist in patients in a presumed dormant state for
decades after treatment of their primary tumor. As such, minimal residual disease, tumor dormancy, and
recurrence constitute fundamental manifestations of tumor progression that collectively are responsible for the
vast majority of breast cancer deaths. Despite their unrivaled clinical importance, however, the mechanisms
underlying them are largely unknown. Consequently, understanding the biology of RTCs and elucidating the
molecular pathways that contribute to tumor dormancy and recurrence is a critical priority in cancer research.
 We propose that disabling the survival mechanisms by which dormant RTCs persist in breast cancer
patients following treatment will deplete this critical reservoir of cells, reduce tumor recurrence, and thereby
improve patient survival. Using genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models that faithfully recapitulate tumor
dormancy and recurrence, we have identified a Sox5-associated osteochondrogenesis-like program that is
markedly upregulated in dormant RTCs, subsequently downregulated in spontaneous recurrent tumors in GEM
models, and strongly associated with decreased recurrence risk in breast cancer patients. When taken
together with our observations that Sox5 deletion accelerates tumor recurrence in mice, we hypothesize that a
developmental program requiring Sox5 is co-opted by dormant RTCs as a mechanism to evade therapy,
survive in a dormant state, and recur. Thus, we hypothesize that upregulation of an osteochondrogenesis-like
program requiring Sox5 promotes tumor dormancy following therapy, and that subsequent downregulation of
Sox5 activity promotes tumor recurrence by inducing the re-entry of dormant tumor cells into the cell cycle.
 The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Define Sox5/osteochondrogenic pathway activity in residual
disease and recurrence. Sox5-related pathway activity will be evaluated in primary and recurrent tumors,
RTCs in the mammary gland, and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow and lung in GEM
models following targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Companion studies will evaluate this pathway in bone
marrow DTCs and in residual disease in breast cancer patients following neoadjuvant therapy, and (2)
Determine the impact of Sox5 pathway modulation on residual disease and recurrence.
 This proposal will advance understanding of the role of a novel Sox5/osteochondrogenesis-like pathway in
dormant RTC survival and recurrence, thereby evaluating it as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention
of recurrent breast cancer. If successful, the ability to therapeutically target escape pathways used by dormant
residual tumor cells has the potential to prevent recurrence and its associated mortality, thereby transforming
treatment options for millions of breast cancer survivors."

Response to immunotherapy remains less than 20% for Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). The
poor response is in part due to dysfunctional cytotoxic T cell activity resulting from terminal exhaustion as a
response to chronic exposure to tumor antigen. New strategies are needed to sensitize OSCC to
immunotherapy to improve response rates and overall survival. Neurotransmitters of the parasympathetic
nervous system, such as Acetylcholine (Ach), can be secreted from non-neuronal tissues, including
lymphocytes, which are abundant in microenvironment of OSCC. These lymphocytes express choline
acetyltransferase (ChaT), the enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step of Ach production. Ach binds to two
classes of receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, to mediate downstream responses. Stimulation of
muscarinic receptors by Ach restrains pancreatic and breast cancer but promotes gastric and late stage
prostate cancer. The contribution of Ach signaling to the promotion of OSCC is poorly understood. The goal of
this proposal is to elucidate the role of Ach signaling in maintaining homeostasis of T lymphocytes in the tumor
immune microenvironment in OSCC. Preliminary studies have uncovered a putative autocrine pathway of
signaling from Ach secreting CD8+T cells via the cholinergic muscarinic receptor-1 (CHRM1) supporting the
central hypothesis that autocrine Ach-CHRM1 signaling by ChaT+ CD8+ T cells sustains the OSCC anti-tumor
immune response by replenishing the memory T cell pool. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: 1. determine if loss of lymphocyte derived Ach and muscarinic signaling promotes OSCC
growth and impairs T cell infiltration into the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and 2. determine if
autocrine Ach-CHRM1 signaling on T lymphocytes maintains long-term activation potential and prevents
exhaustion by maintaining the memory T cell pool. In the first aim the effect of targeted disruption of the Ach-
CHRM1 pathway in CD8+T cells on orthotopic OSCC tumor growth kinetics will be evaluated. Topography of
the TIME will be analyzed using quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence. For the second aim ex vivo
activation and proliferation assays will be used to asses T cell dysfunction longitudinally over the course of
tumor progression in OSCC models with targeted disruption of Ach-CHRM1 signaling in CD8+ T lymphocytes.
The proposed research examines a role for non-neuronal, lymphocyte derived, Ach in maintaining anti-tumor
immune responses by maintaining the memory T cell pool and preventing terminal exhaustion that can lead to
failure of immunotherapy treatment."

Surgical complication represents one of the biggest factors impacting quality of care and is one of the major
burdens on the healthcare system. There are 40-50 million surgical procedures performed in the US annually
with a mortality rate of 1.3% (650,000 people) and morbidity rate of ~14% (7M people). The mortality rates
significantly increase for patients who are frail, with a heightened risk of 5.1%, and continues to increase into 90
and 180 days for those who are deemed very frail, reaching a staggering 43%. The difficulty in increasing surgical
success is not necessarily in improving the surgical procedures, but rather the perioperative care that surrounds
the surgery: pre-habilitating the patient into fitness prior to surgery, improving patient recovery to discharge
patients to recover comfortably at-home, detecting onsets of complications early to provide non-emergent
treatment. The main objective of this project is to develop a hand grip strength (HGS) measurement solution
based completely on a smartphone application that converts the phone’s vibration motor and sensor into a mobile
dynamometer. Our scientific premise, demonstrated by a berth of clinical evidence, is that hand grip strength
provides a biomarker of physical frailty that corresponds to general physiologic reserve and cardiopulmonary
status, as well as systemic inflammation. Prior studies have linked a diminutive HGS preoperatively to
heightened risk of surgical complications. This corresponds well to evidence that frailty, which correlates strongly
to a weakened HGS, is a major risk factor for surgical complications due to the extremely taxing nature of surgical
procedures on the body requiring a level of fitness to recover after the operation. Although HGS as a measure
is possible with commercial HGS dynamometers, a smartphone-sensor enabled digital dynamometer can make
measurements guided through adaptive interface, automatically digitized, and integrated with ML analytics. With
the patient’s own smartphone, progress of pre-habilitation can be assessed to determine fitness to undergo
surgery, changes in health status can be detected, and timely changes in surgical plan can be made. To increase
the scalability of HGS screening, we propose a smartphone assessment that patients, including older adults, can
administer themselves at home that tracks changes in HGS during the preoperative period. We will further
develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms that use the HGS feature biomarkers measured by
the phone to perform automated risk prediction of postsurgical outcomes. Because the project would be carried
out in the rich research context of UC San Diego Division of Perioperative Informatics in the School of Medicine
in conjunction with the Anesthesiology Preparedness Clinic, it will be possible to validate the mobile
dynamometer assessments with a cohort of surgical patients undergoing medium to high-risk procedures that
would benefit most from a stratified risk assessment protocol. Our translational goal is to provide access to low-
cost, digital at-home HGS monitoring to transform the way perioperative care is conducted, from one that is
sparse and poorly assessed, to one that is highly integrated through close monitoring and feedback."

A single acute ethanol exposure causes lasting changes in behavior and brain function. Acute changes may
form a basis for progressive changes with subsequent ethanol exposures, incrementally increasing the risk of
alcohol use disorder. Studies from humans to Drosophila have uncovered strong behavioral and neural links
between the development of ethanol tolerance, an early form of ethanol-induced plasticity, and changes in
sleep. We recently discovered in Drosophila that a small group of circadian clock neurons that regulate sleep
also encode rapid ethanol tolerance, the form of tolerance that is closely associated with proximal changes in
sleep. Whereas prior work in Drosophila implicated clock pacemaker genes and a potential relationship
between sleep and rapid tolerance, our new data provides an anatomical locus and a focus on the specific
aspects of the tolerance/sleep interaction. The long-term goal is to determine how ethanol causes changes in
sleep. The expected long-term impact is a better understanding of the relation between addiction and sleep.
Because rapid ethanol tolerance appears to map to some but not all sleep regulatory neurons, we
hypothesize that ethanol may ‘misuse’ sleep circuitry.
Circadian rhythms and sleep are extensively studied in Drosophila. While our understanding of rapid ethanol
tolerance is less complete, it is easy to study and intriguing underlying mechanisms are beginning to emerge.
The density of data on sleep mechanisms in Drosophila and mammals creates an opportunity to better
understand tolerance and its relation to longer term effects of ethanol.
The plan for this proposal is to determine the extent of co-encoding of rapid ethanol tolerance and sleep in
Drosophila. To do this, we propose three experiments. First, we plan to map rapid ethanol tolerance in sleep
circuitry. Second, we discovered that rapid ethanol tolerance is composed of a labile and a consolidated
memory-like states. We plan to map these and also evolutionarily conserved tolerance genes in the sleep
circuitry. Third, We plan to survey the function of the approximately 50 known sleep genes in rapid ethanol
tolerance. The majority of these genes have not yet been tested for their role in tolerance.
The expected outcome of the proposed research is a genetic and circuit map of rapid tolerance with respect to
sleep."

Broadening the spectrum of vaccine platforms that confer protective, durable and broad immunogenicity is
important for pandemic preparedness. Here, we aim to create essential preclinical data to characterize a novel
genetic vaccine platform called PARVAX to increase its clinical acceptance. Our previous studies show that a
single dose of PARVAX candidates for COVID-19 elicits sustained humoral immunity, near-sterilizing upper
and lower airway protection from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and potent and durable cellular responses. These
qualities combined with established commercial and low-cost manufacturing processes, make this platform
imminently feasible, scalable and affordable for vaccine applications. In this proposal, we will investigate the
mechanism behind the potency and durability of PARVAX, which we hypothesize is correlated with antigen
expression kinetics (Aim 1). We also use rational engineering approaches to enhance the potency of the
PARVAX platform, which will enhance safety and applicability for other pathogens (Aim 2). Finally, we propose
to generate proof of the potency of PARVAX as a vaccine platform beyond COVID-19 by exploring the serum
and mucosal immunity and protection from influenza viruses in two preclinical models of influenza infection
(Aim 3). The proposed work is highly relevant for pandemic preparedness, since it will enable the rapid design
of new and preclinically derisked PARVAX candidates for existing and future pathogens, and has the potential
to provide clarity on the means to improve the durability, breadth and mucosal immunity of other platforms."

 The current studies are based on unexpected data from early brain development in mice establishing that
reduced neuronal activity results in premature oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation. These data
contrast with the extensive data in the literature that axonal activity increases myelination. The fundamental
hypothesis under investigation is that during early development, neuronal activity initially allows and/or
enhances OPC proliferation but inhibits premature differentiation. The current studies will use Designer
Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-expression in cortical neurons to investigate
the impact of decreased or increased neuronal activity on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation, survival
and differentiation in corpus callosum and cortex. scRNASeq studies will characterize the transcriptome
changes in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells when cortical neuronal activity is reduced or increased. Our data
establishing that reduced neuronal activity induces premature oligodendrocyte differentiation in young mice are
unexpected given the significant data in the literature establishing that neuronal activity enhances
oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and myelination later in development. We will therefore
investigate when during development the impact of neuronal activity shifts from blocking differentiation to
enhancing differentiation."
10979302,"Hepatic fibrosis is a major cause of mortality in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Hepatic fibrosis also plays a major role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC,
which is a second leading cause of cancer mortality world-wide. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that
generate hepatic fibrosis are activated by liver injury, but the mechanism of their activation is not
fully understood. Upon activation HSCs start expressing genes such as alpha-smooth muscle
actin (aSMA) and collagen type 1a1 (Col1a1), which are markers of hepatic fibrosis. Upon
activation HSCs become highly glycolytic and consequently produce high level of lactate. Lactate
has been suggested to play a role in regulating gene expression upon HSCs activation, but the
mechanism remains elusive. We found that high glycolysis and lactate production in activated
HSCs is largely due to the induction of hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. Our results show that
HK2 is required for the activation of HSCs and liver fibrosis. Interestingly, we found that lactate
produced, because of HK2 expression, induces histone lactylation, which is required for gene
expression in activated HSCs. In the absence of HK2 the induction of gene expression is impaired
in HSCs, but lactate could override the effect of HK2 deletion on gene expression. We also found
that HK2 deletion in hepatocytes attenuates NASH-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, our
results suggest that targeting HK2 could be therapeutic for both liver fibrosis and NASH-induced
HCC. In this grant application we will further validate the role of HK2 in liver fibrosis and how it
affects NASH-induced HCC. We will employ a mouse model of NASH-induced HCC in which
there is extensive fibrosis. We will use these mice to study the role of HK2 in the interplay between
liver fibrosis and HCC. Finally, as a proof of concept, we will verify if systemic HK2 deletion, which
does not elicit adverse physiological consequences, could inhibit both fibrosis and HCC in a
mouse model of NASH-induced HCC."

Health disparities for Latinas remain a persistent problem leading to increased incidence of chronic disease,
comorbidities and premature mortality. The NIH has called for interventions that improve adherence to
prevention regimens (NOT-OD-21-100) because of the potential to decrease health disparities by reducing
disparities in meeting health guidelines. There has been little research into interventions to improve meeting
and adhering to behavioral health guidelines, especially in understudied Latinas. Often the process of adopting
new health habits is challenging for marginalized communities who have fewer resources and time to invest in
healthy behaviors. In particular, stress can be a barrier to adopting new habits. This study aims to address the
everyday stress faced in the general population of Latina women in their daily lives that can be interfering with
their ability to adhere to prevention regimens such as meeting physical activity (PA) guidelines. Our research
team has significantly improved total PA minutes and the number of Latinas meeting PA guidelines through
rigorous research and theory-based interventions, delivered remotely with technology. Nonetheless, only 40%
of women meet PA guidelines at 6 months. We have shown that participants who experience the stress
relieving benefits of PA, regardless of baseline stress levels, are more likely to meet and adhere to PA
guidelines and that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) can increase PA minutes, improve other
health behaviors, as well as reduce stress. It is our goal to optimize our PA intervention by integrating the most
potent ingredients from MBSR for those women who do not meet PA guidelines at 6 months. With an
innovative SMART design, all participants, inactive Latinas aged 18-65 (n=258), will receive our evidence
based PA intervention. At 6 months, participants will be objectively assessed for meeting PA guidelines.
Women who meet the guidelines will continue to receive the standard intermittent PA for another 6 months.
Women who do not meet the PA guidelines (»60%), will be randomized to continue intensive PA counseling or
attention matched PA counseling incorporating the most potent components from MBSR adapted for PA.
Participants in all arms will be followed and compared over 18 months. We will also rigorously evaluate stress
as a mechanism for meeting PA guidelines using multiple measures to better assess the causal relationship
including cortisol, self report, and daily Ecological Momentary Assessment and stress context. Finally, we will
strengthen evidence for the longer term heart health benefits of meeting PA guidelines and reducing stress, by
using laboratory based assessments of weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipid profiles. This study has the
potential to advance intervention science by optimizing an evidence based intervention to deliver greater
improvements in health behaviors and health outcomes."

Vertebrae and long bones display marked differences across a range of clinical and basic properties, such as
their basic architecture, responsiveness to PTH, their rate of seeding with solid tumor metastases, or the types
of developmental and degenerative diseases present. The etiology of these differences has remained elusive,
in part due to the current state of skeletal stem cell (SSC) biology that largely considers skeletal stem cells in a
monolithic manner, without drawing clear distinctions in cell type based on bone of origin. Here, we have
identified a vertebral skeletal stem cell (vSSC), having established that it displays a comprehensive set
of stemness features, including the ability to self-renew across multiple rounds of transplantation, the ability
to serially form bone organoids across multiple rounds of transplantation and reisolation, long-term label
retention after a pulse with a chromatin bound H2B-GFP marker, in vivo multipotency through an ability to give
rise to chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocyte in vivo, and being long-lived in vivo. This vSSC type is specific
for vertebrae, being completely absent from long bones. These vSSCs have a clear physiologic
contribution to vertebral mineralization, as deleting genes required for osteoblast differentiation with a Zic1-
cre created for this project targeting the lineage of this vSSC produced marked defects in the mineralization of
both the dorsal neural arch and the vertebral body and no detectable phenotype in long bones. Thus, we have
here identified a vSSC, including generating 2 cre lines targeting this cell, that meets all published criteria to be
defined as a novel SSC type. Here, we propose to address a series of key issues enabled by this discovery to
further develop the clinical and physiologic role of this new stem cell type. First, (Aim 1) we will determine the
unique cellular features of the vertebral bone versus long bones, demonstrate which of these features are due
to Zic1+vSSCs, the relationship of Zic1+vSSCs to other skeletal progenitor cell types identified in the literature
and the function of vSSC-specific transcription factors and secreted ligands. Next (Aim 2), we will establish
that this vSSC is a key cell mediating spine fusion, a common orthopedic management strategy to treat a
variety of spine degenerative disorders. Lastly (Aim 3), we will build upon preliminary efforts identifying a
human counterpart of the murine vSSC to fully establish the identity and differentiation hierarchy of the human
vSSC and to determine the functional conservation of vSSC-lineage defining transcription factors. Altogether,
this project will establish the existence and unique properties of a new and distinct vSSC cell type in humans
and mice and facilitate subsequent studies into how this vSSC mediates vertebral skeletal disorders or how
these disorders can be therapeutically addressed by targeting this new stem cell."

Title: Immigrant Integration and Health: Multidimensional and Cross-National Analyses Over the Life Course.
 Older immigrants of color have high levels of cognitive impairment and physical disability, which stands in
sharp contrast to the “healthy immigrant effect” where recent immigrant arrivals tend to be healthier than the
native-born. With the elderly immigrant population in the U.S. projected to quadruple by 2050, the decline of the
healthy immigrant effect over the life course represents a growing public health concern. The existing literature
has made much progress in identifying associations between time since immigration and accelerated health
declines. However, it remains unclear 1) which mechanisms within the broad process of acculturation and
integration drive this decline, 2) how the timing of integration over the life course affects health, and 3) the role
of U.S. institutional designs in shaping immigrant health declines, particularly among populations of color.
 This project will leverage linked survey and administrative data to develop multidimensional and longitudinal
measures of immigrant integration and evaluate their impact on older adults’ health. We will also investigate the
role of institutional designs on immigrants’ health using a cross-national comparison between the U.S. and
Canada. Specific Aim 1 investigates how social, economic, and residential dimensions of integration affect
trajectories of physical functioning and cognitive impairment among Black, Hispanic, White, and other immigrants
after age 60. We hypothesize that different dimensions of integration will affect different dimensions of health in
later life. Furthermore, we expect that Black and Hispanic immigrants will receive especially small or negative
returns to integration due to higher exposure to racism. Specific Aim 2 adopts a cross-national design to
compare the effect of economic integration trajectories on U.S. and Canadian immigrants’ physical health,
including the racial differences in these effects. We hypothesize that the timing of economic integration will be
consequential for immigrants’ later-life health outcomes because health (dis)advantages are cumulative over the
life course. We further expect that these consequences are more pronounced in the U.S. than in Canada
because the latter has universal healthcare, and immigrants have access to programs and resources regardless
of their individual economic conditions.
 The research team contains an interdisciplinary group of sociologists, demographers, and health policy
scholars who have the necessary expertise and familiarity with the data and methodology to produce new
evidence on immigrant integration and older immigrants’ health. The outcomes of this project can advance our
understanding of how racial and immigrant health disparities emerge and what interventions can most effectively
reduce them."

Technologies for gene delivery are desperately needed to address a wide array of pathological processes in the
various tissues of the body. In particular, effective therapies for diabetic skin wounds poses a significant clinical
and scientific challenge due to heightened health care costs and increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide.
Recent progress in biomaterial-based gene delivery has ushered in promising options to treat chronic wounds
via localized effects; however, degradation or interception of precious nucleic acid therapeutic cargo in transit—
especially after unsuccessful escape from their endocytic vesicle—contributes to underwhelming transfection
efficiencies that render these technologies insufficient for clinical translation and an unmet need. The overall
objective of this proposal is to construct a modular arsenal of versatile, multi-functional supercharged proteins
and lipids that can be co-formulated into a hybrid nanovehicle, termed lipoproteoplex (LPP), for the delivery of
short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences. We seek to improve the efficiency and safety of the LPP technological
platform by delving into its unique mechanism of cellular entry and cytosolic uptake. We propose the central
hypothesis that engineered proteins serve as the core, functional component of the LPP, dictating cargo binding
strength, whereas the outer lipid component serves to protect the payload. Both items collectively contribute to
and influence the bulk LPP's mechanism of cellular entry and cytosolic uptake. By harnessing a computationally-
informed experimental approach, we will generate novel cationic supercharged protein sequences and study
their interactions with various lipid shells to enhance the overall effectiveness of our LPP platform technology for
siRNA delivery. We will pursue this optimized formula through the following specific aims: (1) expand the cationic
supercharged protein library with viral tagged mutants to maximize the amount of endosomal escape while
balancing gene binding capabilities; (2) evaluate the role of the LPP's outer liposome on payload protection and
vehicle self-assembly; and (3) elucidate the LPP's cellular uptake mechanism essential for efficacious delivery
of siKeap1 in a murine humanized diabetic wound model. The expected outcome of this proposal is an adaptable
LPP formulation optimized to address the critical disease model of diabetic ulcers and wounds by promoting
wounded skin repair in a pre-clinical hyperglycemic environment. Beyond the proof-of-concept validation model,
the long-term goal of our work is to rationally design the LPP formulation for other siRNA sequences to have a
positive translational impact on a wide array of monogenic cutaneous disorders.
While other approaches focus
on chemically modifying the vehicle, our innovative approach focuses on the LPP's easily-modulated and
scalable components as the key driver of nucleic acid loading and subsequently successful delivery.
The
proposed research will determine significant structure-property-function relationships in the LPP's protein and
lipid components, which are quintessential to designing a harmonized LPP formula that can overcome the
endosomal escape barrier and achieve ultraefficient cytosolic siRNA delivery."

 Targeted nanotechnologies have shown great promise in overcoming roadblocks in cancer therapeutics.
Tumor metastasis has a limited response or resistance to chemotherapeutics and a moderate response to new
antibody therapies. Our RNA nanotechnology has shown great promise in targeting metastatic disease to deliver
both gene silencing and chemical drug therapies.
 Our long goal is to overcome colon cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death primarily due
to the mutations to KRAS and subsequent lung metastasis with expected survival of months. KRAS, the gene
that codes for the K-Ras protein, is considered “undruggable”. KRAS mutations are found in up to 45% of
colorectal cancers. We have designed an epigenetic repressor to silence mutant K-Ras through epigenome
editing. We created a fusion protein consisting of nuclease-inactive dCas9 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1
and targeted dCas9-HDAC1 to the promoter of mutant KRAS. We can load the recombinant dCas9-HDAC1-
gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex into exosomes and silence K-Ras; we designed RNA nanoparticles
carrying mutant K-Ras siRNA to inhibit KRAS mutant lung cancer; we also successfully constructed RNA 4WJ
carrying SN-38 to inhibit colon cancer lung metastasis.
 The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that govern the high delivery platform to silence K-Ras in
colon cancer. We intend to deactivate mutant KRAS via RNA-ligand displaying exosomes loaded with dCas9-
HDAC1-gRNA ribonucleoprotein, siRNAs, and chemical drugs individually or in combination in colorectal cancer
primary and metastasis tumors, using orthotopic and PDX xenograft models. We will investigate the mechanism
of action in K-Ras inhibition, including the conditions for the integration and assembly of dCas9-HDAC1 and
gRNA or crRNA such as sequence and length requirement for silencing mutant KRAS and suppressing colon
cancer cells. We will apply RNA nanoparticle orientation to display targeting ligands on the surface of exosomes.
Instead of delivering dCas9 plasmids, we will deliver a ribonucleoprotein complex of dCas9-recombinant protein
and gRNA. Exosomes will display RNA nanoparticles with an aptamer to bind colon cancer cells specifically. We
will engineer RNA nanoparticles and increase the surface display density of the negatively charged RNA ligands
to enhance the negative zeta potential of exosomes for preventing binding to the vital organs and healthy cells
that normally have negatively charged lipid membranes. We will try to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce
toxicity by overcoming endosome trapping and non-specific cell entry through RNA ligand manipulation. Zonal
and density gradient ultracentrifugation or size exclusion columns will select exosomes smaller than 100 nm to
escape macrophage engulfment and improve biodistribution. This project with a multidisciplinary approach will
build a strong foundation from which researchers can deploy large protein complexes to treat cancer by tumor-
specific delivery and effectively targeting those previously difficult targets like K-Ras."

Uncovering fundamental mechanisms of neuronal connectivity that enable associative brain centers to learn
efficiently is an important goal of neuroscience. In the mushroom body — the associative brain center in
Drosophila melanogaster — the constituent Kenyon cells receive input from olfactory projection neurons. Each
projection neuron connects to one of the 51 glomeruli forming the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory processing
center in the Drosophila brain. Our previous work has shown that these connections are random in that there
are no sets of glomeruli converging preferentially onto a given Kenyon cell. However, the glomeruli are not
represented with equal frequency among Kenyon cell inputs. Certain glomeruli are significantly overrepresented
or underrepresented, even though a uniform distribution would be optimal for learning performance. We are
proposing to test the hypothesis that this non-uniform distribution — which we call 'biased randomness' — serves
an important biological function, namely to predispose the learning ability of the mushroom body towards certain
ethologically pertinent stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we will first compare the representation of individual
glomeruli in different Drosophila populations that have evolved in different environments in order to investigate
whether there are correlations between biases and known differences in chemosensory ecology (Aim 1).
Second, molecular regulators of glomerular representation will be identified in Drosophila melanogaster to
manipulate the representation of individual glomeruli and test for effects on olfactory representation in the
mushroom body and learning (Aim 2). The research in this proposal has the potential to reveal a fundamental
mechanism by which neuronal connectivity is fine-tuned to predispose learning towards particularly pertinent
stimuli and that underlies the evolution of neuronal circuit architecture in different chemosensory environments."

Autophagy degrades cytosolic material, such as aggregated proteins, via the formation of autophagosomes that
fuse with lysosomes for degradation and is important in the adaptation to metabolic and cytotoxic stressors.
Autophagy has been shown to decline with age and is tightly linked to age-related diseases, thus its study is
important for developing future strategies to maintain homeostasis and promote human health.
 I have found that autophagy is induced in C. elegans upon a short exposure to a heat shock early in life.
Such a heat shock leads to organismal benefits including longevity, a conserved phenomenon called hormesis.
Autophagy genes are required for these heat shock-induced benefits, indicating that autophagy is a critical
mechanism underlying hormetic stress responses. I have implicated two conserved transcription factors, the
helix-loop-helix transcription factor HLH-30, an ortholog of mammalian transcription factor EB (TFEB), and HSF-
1 in regulating autophagy induction upon HS. It however remains unclear when and where autophagy is required
to manifest long-term organismal benefits. While I have shown that specific autophagy genes retain elevated
transcript levels for days, the tissue-specific and potential long-term transcriptional shifts induced by HS, that
could underlie the hormetic benefits, are unknown. Understanding the effects of heat shock on autophagy, both
in the short-term (i.e., immediate response) as well as in the long-term (i.e., sustained changes), is paramount
for developing new strategies, such as the concept of heat therapy, to improve autophagy during aging and in
diseases with dysregulated autophagy. Therefore, I here propose to analyze the spatio-temporal requirement for
the autophagy-regulating transcription factors HLH-30/TFEB and HSF-1 for heat-induced adaptations and
analyze the cell-specific transcriptional changes that are induced by HS and sustained over time.
 The ability to mount a beneficial hormetic response declines with age and is accompanied by reduced
function of HLH-30/TFEB which is ameliorated by a hormetic HS. HS thus induces sustained changes that affect
HLH-30/TFEB function. Controlling the prolonged activation of autophagy, for instance via transcriptional
regulation, could be an important way of manipulating autophagy, which in turn could benefit organismal fitness.
Hence, I am proposing to investigate how the autophagy regulator HLH-30/TFEB is regulated by heat shock and
age and to identify new regulators of HLH-30/TFEB, that will be validated for conservation in human dermal
fibroblasts. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms by which autophagy ensures cytoprotective effects in vivo
using multi-cellular organisms like C. elegans addresses significant gaps in our understanding of the temporal
and spatial dynamics of HS-induced autophagy, cell-specific transcriptional responses to HS, and regulatory
mechanisms of transcription factors with HS and age. The impact of these insights could reshape therapeutic
approaches, offering more precise interventions for diseases with deregulated autophagy."

 This project aims to investigate the neural mechanisms that lead to complex behavioral sequences, such as
hitting a tennis forehand or playing the piano. To accomplish these behaviors, the brain must stitch together each
component movement into a coherent act. Both local and long-range synaptic inputs can play a major role in
generating the underlying premotor commands that drive these actions, but their respective influences can often
be difficult to distinguish. We investigate this issue by examining the neural circuit dynamics underlying the
courtship song of the zebra finch. Birdsong is a complex behavior that consists of precisely executed vocal
elements mediated by a dedicated set of anatomically distinct brain regions. We recently found that thalamic
drive engages a specific subpopulation of premotor neurons within the zebra finch song nucleus HVC (proper
name) and that these inputs are critical for the progression between song elements. Here we investigate how
such long-range inputs interact with local circuit properties to advance our understanding of the neural processes
governing skilled movements across species.
 In Aim 1, we will test the relative impact of local and long-range excitatory input on singing. To accomplish
this, we will measure the behavioral consequences of optogenetic silencing of two primary afferent streams to
HVC. We will then use in vivo voltage clamp recordings and glutamate imaging to test the related hypotheses
that long-range inputs have specific temporal and spatial patterns at the level of individual postsynaptic neurons.
Finally, we will test the hypothesis that intrinsic excitability may affect network function by relating cellular
properties of individual neurons to their role in singing behavior.
 In Aim 2, we will examine the contribution of local circuit inhibitory interneurons to HVC network dynamics.
We first identify functionally defined categories of interneurons with distinct behavioral roles. We will then
determine whether each inhibitory subpopulation exhibits distinct connectivity patterns within the network, and
we will use a novel hybrid intra-/extracellular approach to examine their influence onto premotor neurons. Finally,
we will leverage a newly developed family of viral tools to test the hypothesis that these functionally defined
interneuron groups are mediated by molecularly distinct cell classes.
 Taken together, our proposal will examine how local and long-range inputs direct cortical dynamics in the
context of an ethologically relevant behavioral sequence. Our findings will have clear implications for the
understanding of mammalian behaviors in health and disease."
10981410,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has a devastating effect on quality of
life. HS affects up to 1.2% of people and disproportionately affects women and Black people. The age of onset
is typically in adolescence/young adulthood and symptoms persist for decades. More than half of patients have
affected family members, consistent with a strong genetic contribution to HS. Variants implicated in familial cases
of HS have been reported in four genes, three of which encode subunits of the γ-secretase complex, but these
likely affect less than 5% of patients with HS, raising the question: what other variants may be at play?
In our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 760 patients and meta-analysis with additional cohorts,
we identified significant risk loci near SOX9 and KLF5, which play important roles in follicular and epidermal
maintenance, wound healing, and inflammation. We hypothesize that larger sample sizes will identify additional
significant risk loci that will substantially improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify
potential treatment targets. We further hypothesize that dysregulated SOX9 and KLF5 expression will be found
in the hair follicles, epidermis, and cutaneous tunnels in skin from HS patients.
In this study, we propose to build upon our recent GWAS to examine the genetic basis of HS in an expanded
cohort of 2,000 diverse patients with HS at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We continue to recruit
participants from one of the highest volume HS subspecialty clinics in the country. Approximately 50% of our
cohort is composed of Black patients, and we will examine potential differences in the genetic architecture based
on ancestry, sex, and phenotypic diversity. We also will perform GWAS in the All of Us cohort and meta-analyze
GWAS results with the FinnGen, UK Biobank, and BioVU biobanks, and other cohorts as described in the
research plan. This meta-analysis will include more than 12,000 total subjects. Identifying genetic variants that
show evidence for association with HS disease status will provide candidate genes for further validation and
biological study to develop new treatments and possibly prevent disease. At the recently discovered GWAS loci
near SOX9 and KLF5, we will analyze gene expression patterns in HS-affected tissue using RNA-seq and
immunohistochemistry. To identify candidate genes for new loci, we will analyze transcriptome data to identify
variants associated with both HS and gene expression and integrate with existing chromatin data. To identify HS
risk variants that affect gene expression, we will evaluate skin cell transcriptome and epigenome data and
perform reporter assays in keratinocytes. By identifying dysregulated gene expression patterns in the epidermis,
hair follicles, and cutaneous tunnels of HS-affected tissue, we will learn how risk variants contribute to follicular
disruption, inflammatory responses, chronic wounds, and tunnel formation, which will impact our understanding
of HS pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies."

associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients with PAD have a 6-fold increased risk of dying of a
cardiovascular event compared with patients without PAD. In a recent systematic review by investigators at PHRI

10982433,"Abstract
 Aging is the time-dependent functional decline responsible for increased susceptibility to
chronic disease, frailty, and disability. Aging is a substantial public health concern, and new
therapeutic interventions intended to mitigate its effects are needed. While preclinical evidence
supports the crucial role of mTOR inhibitors in slowing aging processes, the lack of
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data in older adults presents a substantial
challenge in designing clinical trials.
 Sirolimus and everolimus are well-studied mTOR inhibitors commonly used in
transplantation. However, both age and severe illness can significantly alter drug PK, and there
is currently limited data in older adults without underlying, confounding illnesses. Additionally,
there is a lack of data to inform the selection of PD biomarkers that optimally demonstrate
improvement in age-related processes. Without well-defined PK characterization and identification
of robust PD biomarkers, future clinical trials will lack the statistical power needed to establish
evidence of effectiveness. To lay the foundation for future studies, we assembled a
multidisciplinary team of clinical pharmacologists and epidemiologists, as well as experts in
geriatrics, gerontology, and immunosuppression. The primary goal of this research is to precisely
estimate fundamental PK/PD parameters of sirolimus and everolimus in older adults without
confounding illness. We will first validate measurement techniques and quantify the in vitro
exposure-response relationship for two different biomarkers: S6K activity and mitochondrial
function (Aim 1). We will then conduct a clinical study to characterize the PK/PD of sirolimus and
everolimus in older adults (Aim 2). Lastly, the biomarkers will be evaluated for their ability to
demonstrate the magnitude of treatment response over an intermediate term follow-up (Aim 3).
We anticipate that our research will address the existing knowledge gaps related to mTOR
inhibitor PK/PD, leading to a transformative shift in the field of aging research."

10984328,"Research Design, Compliance, and Data Management Core Project Summary / Abstract.
Strong research design, data analysis, and study implementation expertise are key components of rigorous,
reproducible, and impactful clinical and translational (C&T) research. Large health datasets, including
electronic health records (EHR), combined with the procedures in place to ensure research is both ethical and
compliant with NIH and institutional policies, provide C&T investigators with the capability to address a wide
range of C&T research questions in a resource-efficient way. Although expertise and infrastructure are
growing, there are critical gaps in Montana in each of these areas that the Montana Clinical and Translational
Research Center (Montana CTRC), Research Design, Compliance, and Data Management (RDCD) Core is
tasked with filling. These activities are critical to address health research priorities in Montana, a rural state
with populations that experience substantial health disparities but who are underrepresented in C&T research.
The overall objective of the RDCD Core is to support Montana CTRC investigators by providing expertise and
resources in all phases of study protocol development and implementation with careful attention to adherence
to federal and institutional research policies, rules, and guidelines. With RDCD support, we hypothesize that
Montana CTRC investigators will produce rigorous and impactful research that addresses community priorities
and establishes further capacity for C&T research in Montana. IDeA-focused program resources at the
University of Montana (UM) provide an excellent platform to achieve goals and build C&T research capacity.
Within the past decade, UM has built valuable capacity through two IDeA-focused programs: the Centers of
Biomedical Research Excellence (CoBRE) Center for Population Health Research and the Montana site of the
Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ECHO
ISPCTN). By collaborating closely with the Montana CTRC Cores and leveraging IDeA program-related
resources, the RDCD Core will achieve three specific aims. Aim 1: Provide Montana CTRC investigators with
the expertise needed to design and implement rigorous research protocols. Aim 2a: Leverage and enhance
existing EHR to address community, partner organization, and investigator C&T research priorities. Aim 2b:
Establish data navigation tools for clinical researchers that facilitate use of EHR and supporting datasets
relevant to health research in Montana. Aim 3: Ensure compliance with NIH and institutional policies related to
research in human participants and management of protected health information. In achieving these aims, the
RDCD Core will foster the design and conduct of high quality and impactful C&T research, support Montana
CTRC project success, and build capacity for future C&T research focused on health priorities in Montana."
10980583,"Project Summary
 In all domains of life proteins are modified via glycosylation. This addition of sugar molecules to proteins
is critical for their folding, function, and recognition by their partners. Rigorous studies have shown that in
well-studied eukaryotic organisms, proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are
glycosylated on asparagine residues as well as on serine or threonine residues. These modifications are
critical for the trafficking of proteins in the secretory pathway. Protein glycosylation acts as a marker for
protein folding to ensure only folded and functional proteins are sent from the ER. Once outside the ER,
glycans on proteins also act as critical recognition motifs to route proteins accurately to their correct
subcellular location. These glycan-centric mechanisms are found in almost all well studied eukaryotes.
 Surprisingly, the intracellular eukaryotic parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, does not appear to utilize any
of these canonical protein glycosylation-based mechanisms to traffic proteins in its secretory pathway.
This parasite causes malaria, and the clinical symptoms of malaria are a direct result of its growth and
expansion with human red blood cells (RBC). The parasite depends upon protein secretion to ensure its
survival within the RBC. Even though glycan modifications on proteins are a major driver of immune
responses, we do not know if and how P. falciparum glycosylates proteins in its secretory pathway during
the clinically relevant asexual blood stages. In fact, the P. falciparum genome lacks several genes in this
pathway that are well conserved in other eukaryotic organisms, including other closely related parasites.
 To fill this major gap in our knowledge, we will combine genetic and cellular assays to study if conditional
knockdown of the targeted glycosyltransferases inhibits protein trafficking within the highly branched and
unconventional secretory pathway of P. falciparum. Our preliminary data show that the parasite protein
glycosylation pathway genes are essential for parasite growth within the RBC. The experimental approach
will test if protein glycosylation also functions in an unconventional protein quality control pathway in the
parasite ER. We will utilize glycoproteomic approaches to determine the landscape of protein glycosylation
during the intraerythrocytic growth of P. falciparum. The collaborative research team will combine these
proteomic approaches with genetic tools to determine which glycosyltransferases are responsible for
which the glycan modifications. The specific glycosyltransferase activities will be validated using
complementation assays as well as in vitro assays using recombinantly expressed glycosyltransferase.
The tools and reagents developed for this project may find wider applicability in glycobiology and
parasitology. Given the importance of glycans in driving the host immune system, the proposed studies
may have important implications for our understanding of the antimalarial immune response."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a global public health burden despite advances in risk factor targeted
therapies. Meta-analyses across ancestrally diverse populations have identified >300 genetic loci associated
with CAD risk. We and others have investigated candidate genes that are dysregulated in the coronary
vascular wall; however, the causal genes and regulatory mechanisms remain mostly unknown. Recent
advances in single-cell genomics profiling have begun to unravel the cellular diversity during atherosclerosis.
Molecular quantitative trait (QTL) mapping and gene regulatory network approaches in disease-relevant
tissues have refined some of the regulatory mechanisms, however the specific cell types and phenotypic states
driving these changes remain unclear. We have leveraged a large biobank of coronary artery tissues from
ancestrally diverse individuals to perform bulk and single-cell profiling of genetic variation and cell states. Using
single-nucleus profiling of chromatin accessibility in healthy and subclinical atherosclerotic coronary arteries we
identified cis-regulatory elements to explain transitions of smooth muscle cells (SMC) to fibroblast-like cell
types. By meta-analyzing single-cell gene expression data in atherosclerosis, we have also identified etiologic
SMC phenotypic states underlying CAD as well as coronary artery calcification (CAC). Here we propose to
extend our previous efforts to apply multimodal single-cell profiling to capture QTLs and gene regulatory
mechanisms in both subclinical and advanced atherosclerotic coronary segments. Building on our holistic
framework and resources, this proposal will generate unprecedented insights into the hierarchical regulatory
networks that influence dysregulated vascular wall processes. By enriching these high-resolution data with
large-scale population genetics, clinical imaging, and genomic and histologic cardiometabolic tissue biobanks
we will provide context for translating these findings to patients at various stages of disease. We have already
identified several disease stage and cell state-specific markers for atherosclerosis. We will validate and
discover new candidate causal genes and functional regulatory elements using perturbation assays coupled to
high-throughput phenotyping in SMC, along with spatial imaging in intact tissues across the disease trajectory.
Together with our interdisciplinary and experienced collaborators and unique established resources, we are
well-positioned to carry out this work and discover fine-grained molecular features and hallmarks of CAD
initiation and progression in the coronary vessel wall. Ultimately, these studies will enable the next generation
of multimodal treatment strategies for risk stratification and eradication of this debilitating disease."

This R34 pilots a scalable service for EAs, named Launch, that involves both parents of EAs and peer recovery support services (PRSS), thereby targeting poly-substance use from two crucial angles. After adapting and evaluating training protocols and adherence tools (Aim 1), 48 EAs with poly-substance use and their parents will be recruited and randomized to one of three conditions: parents will engage
in web-based coaching to use Contingency Management for Emerging Adults (CM-EA) only; EAs will receive PRSS only; or parents will receive CM-EA coaching and EAs will receive PRSS. Notably, PRSS will consist of standard services plus additional vocational/educational/financial skills. The feasibility and acceptability of the study protocol and Launch services will be assessed (Aim 2). To improve eventual uptake, payors/providers of substance use services will be interviewed. Sites for a future large-scale adaptive trial will also be recruited (Aim3). If Launch is ultimately deemed effective, it would fill a major gap in the substance use services field by providing a highly specified and individualized service for reducing risk and promoting adaptive life functioning in EAs with poly-substance use. In the proposed Diversity Supplement to Launch, a Hispanic woman early-career scientist with direct lived experience of substance use disorder, Dr. Castedo de Martell, will complete two research activities that enhance and expand the aims of the parent grant, while also providing intensive, dedicated mentorship and training to support her transition to independence as a NIDA-funded investigator. The Diversity Supplement research activity (RA) 1 consists of developing a parameters list and preliminary cost-effectiveness analytic model informed by key staff and leadership informants in a community-based participatory research approach to concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be implemented in a future R01 of the parent grant services. The cost-effectiveness analysis of Launch will help providers and policy-makers understand the long-term economic and patient outcome impacts of the services. The Diversity Supplement RA2 will consist of the initial qualitative work for a larger mixed-methods study of peer worker recovery capital at multiple socioecological levels to understand potential influences on peer worker (1) retention in the workforce, (2) fidelity to delivering specialized interventions outside the scope of standard training, and (3) participant
outcomes, focusing initially on rural peer workers. RA2 enhances Aim 2 of the parent grant and expands beyond peer workers involved in the delivery of parent grant services. Finally, the Diversity Supplement will provide dedicated, intensive mentorship and training to prepare Dr. Castedo de Martell to enhance the diversity of the field of NIH-funded substance use disorder researchers as an independent NIDA-funded investigator from an underrepresented background in research with direct lived experience.

10980590,"Project summary / Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose underlying mechanisms have been
proposed to include abnormal excitatory-inhibitory balance in brain regions including the cerebral cortex. The
ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor chromodomain helicase binding protein 8 (CHD8) is one of the
most commonly-mutated genes in sporadic ASD, producing an ASD subtype associated with a high prevalence
of macrocephaly (Barnard et al., Front Neurosci., 2015). In prior work supported by the original grant, we
optimized a human cortical organoid model we developed (Velasco et al., Nature, 2019; Uzquiano et al., Cell,
2022) and applied it to show that CHD8 and other ASD risk genes converge on an early developmental defect
in the GABAergic neuron lineage, leading to asynchronous development of target neurons relative to the other
cell types developing in the organoids (Paulsen et al., Nature, 2022). From this data, we hypothesized that
asynchronous development of GABAergic neurons relative to the excitatory neurons they wire with could lead to
later abnormalities in the activity and function of the cortical local circuit. In support of this hypothesis, we showed
that mutation in another ASD risk gene, SUV420H1, also associated with accelerated development of GABAergic
neurons, leads to abnormal activity of mutant circuits in organoids (Paulsen et al., Nature, 2022). Building on this
data, in this renewal we will leverage our expertise in organoid biology and cortical development together with
co-Investigator Mark Harnett's expertise in human cortical physiology to investigate the effect of heterozygous
loss-of-function of CHD8 on neuronal development and circuit activity using newly-developed organoid models.
Firstly, we will apply a chimeric organoid (“chimeroid”) model (Antón Bolaños and Faravelli et al., preprint at
bioRxiv 2023, and in revision at Nature) to understand whether the genetic context of ASD patients is permissive
for expressivity of the previously-identified CHD8+/- phenotypes (Aim 1). In parallel, we will apply a new human
organoid model of the ventral telencephalon, which we validated to be able to produce GABAergic neurons of
the caudal, medial, and lateral ganglionic eminences (Sartore et al., manuscript in preparation), to understand
whether specific classes of GABAergic interneurons are preferentially affected by CHD8 mutation (Aim 2).
Finally, with the aim of promoting circuits that reflect the endogenous neuronal composition, we will apply a new
“dorsal-ventral chimeroid” organoid model that allows us to control development of the correct proportions of
both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, to investigate cell identity and circuit activity in the CHD8
heterozygous mutant in a more physiologically-relevant system, using calcium imaging, extracellular recording,
and pharmacological manipulations (Aim 3). Taken together, this work will provide mechanistic understanding of
the roles of a major ASD risk gene in the formation of GABAergic neuron populations of the cerebral cortex and
in the biology of cortical circuits."

Determining whether a tumor has spread to the regional lymph nodes is critical for staging and treatment planning
for several types of cancer, including cancers of the head and neck. This determination is routinely performed
surgical removal of regional nodes for cancers of the head & neck. While widely accepted and proven to be
effective for tumor staging and limiting the further spread of the disease, surgical removal of lymph nodes can
lead to morbidity and small metastatic deposits may remain undetected due to pathological sampling error. Thus,
patients who undergo the procedure may receive a suboptimal treatment plan. In this project, we will develop a
noninvasive ultrasound-based molecular imaging tool to identify micrometastases in the lymphatics. We will
develop perfluorocarbon nanodroplet contrast agents targeted to cell surface receptors via directional
conjugation of antibodies. We will synthesize two classes of nanodroplets, each with a different boiling point and
molecular target. One nanodroplet formulation will be targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
to enable molecular detection of cancer cells, while the other will be untargeted to act as a delivery control.
Based on the phase-change behavior visualized in ultrasound images, we will differentiate between the EGFR-
targeted nanodroplets and the nonspecific control. Then, we will apply ratiometric and kinetic modeling strategies
to use the different accumulation patterns to highlight regions with small metastases. The nanodroplets and
imaging methods will be tested in polyacrylamide phantoms before the dual tracer design is applied to a small
animal model of head and neck cancer metastasis. The overall result will be a method that can detect small
pockets of metastases in the lymphatics several centimeters deep in tissue."

Asthma is the most common chronic condition associated with pregnancy and affects up to 300,000
pregnancies every year in the United States. Asthma drugs are critical for achieving and maintaining
proper control of asthma symptoms. The pharmacokinetics of these drugs can be affected by the
altered physiology and lead to unacceptable drug-related toxicity or treatment failure. Progressive
changes to physiology occur throughout pregnancy. In the current proposal, Dr. Kathleen Job will
determine optimal dosing of two common asthma medications in pregnant individuals. In Aim 1, she
will develop maternal-fetal PBPK models for these asthma medications. In Aim 2, she will evaluate
model predictions with data from prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant individuals
with asthma. In Aim 3, she will develop pharmacodynamic models for the drugs of interest in pregnant
individuals with asthma with data collected as part of the prospective clinical pharmacokinetic studies
in pregnant individuals. Findings will inform a Phase II/III Phase II/III safety and efficacy trial in
pregnant individuals with asthma and build a platform that can be applied to dosing of any drug at any
stage of pregnancy. This research will prepare Dr. Job to design and implement scientifically rigorous
and ethical drug trials in pregnant populations."
10990587,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hair is produced in the hair follicles. Hair follicle formation, cycling, and neogenesis relies on extensive cross-
talk between hair follicle keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells. This cross-talk is primarily mediated by
molecular signaling pathways. In classic models of molecular signaling, a ligand binds and activates a receptor
on the surface of a cell to produce a signal into the cell body. Such signal may influence a cell’s ability to
proliferate, differentiate, migrate, contract, and more. Integrins exist on the surface of many cell types. They
serve three basic functions: adhesion, scaffolding, and signaling. The functions of integrins in the hair follicles
are not fully understood. We obtained evidence supporting a role of integrin in transducing signals from the
extracellular matrix into hair follicle keratinocytes to promote its proliferation. The extracellular matrix is made
of proteins produced by the dermal papilla cells. One major component of these proteins are proteoglycans.
Here, we propose a new form of cross-talk that proteoglycans produced by dermal papilla cells activates
integrins on hair matrix keratinocytes to promote hair growth. In this proposal, we will investigate 1) how
production of proteoglycans is controlled in dermal papilla cells, 2) the functions of proteoglycans on dermal
papilla formation, 3) how proteoglycans control hair follicle formation and regeneration, and finally, 4) whether
impairment in proteoglycans production is responsible for hedgehog inhibitor-induced hair loss. Results
obtained from this study may provide new insight into the basic biology of hair follicle, and advance our
understanding on hair loss."

Shear stresses resulting from distinct blood flow patterns impact endothelial cell (EC) functions.
ECs under atheroprone flow exhibit increased proliferation, inflammation, and glycolysis,
compared to those under atheroprotective flow. Our recent studies have uncovered a novel role
of epitranscriptional regulation (i.e., functional changes to RNAs without altered nucleotide
sequence) in EC mechanobiology. Thus, atheroprone flow induces METTL3, a methyltransferase
that catalyzes N6-methyladenosine (m6A) to result in the most abundant RNA modification found
in eukaryotes. Our newly conducted preliminary studies indicate that METTL3 inhibition in ECs
suppresses the atheroprone flow-induced pro-inflammatory response and glycolysis. Through
transcriptome and epitranscriptome mapping, we found that METTL3 caused hypermethylation
of the mRNAs encoding the key enzymes involved in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP, a branch of glycolysis). These findings led to the guiding hypothesis that atheroprone flow
upregulates METTL3 to modulate m6A epitranscriptomes and hence promote glycolysis and PPP
in ECs, thus contributing to EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis. The four specific aims proposed
to test this hypothesis are: Aim 1. To delineate the dynamics of METTL3-regulated
epitranscriptomes in ECs under atheroprone vs. atheroprotective flow patterns; Aim 2. To identify
the METTL3-modulated m6A RNA targets that drive the atheroprone flow enhancement of EC
glycolysis and PPP; Aim 3. To elucidate the effects of the flow-regulated EC m6A
epitranscriptomes on the phenotypic changes of co-cultured SMCs and EC glycolysis by SRS
imaging; Aim 4. To validate flow regulation of METTL3 and m6A epitranscriptomes in mouse
atherosclerosis models. This interdisciplinary research will unveil novel epitranscriptional
mechanisms underlying EC mechanobiology and atherosclerotic diseases."
10987825,"Title: Mitigating the statistical bias due to anatomical variation in pediatric fNIRS
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging method that records
changes in blood oxygenation in the brain using optical sensors placed on the scalp. Although this technique is
widely used for functional imaging, this approach does not provide any direct anatomical information about the
structure of the head, such as layer thicknesses and brain depth beneath the sensors. As a result, the
magnitude of fNIRS signals is confounded by variations in this unknown underlying anatomy which introduces
the potential for statistical bias when comparing across groups and in longitudinal studies. This is particularly
relevant for pediatric and developmental studies where this anatomy is expected to systematically vary across
sample groups. Currently in the fNIRS field, corrections for this unknown anatomy have been proposed using
semi-empirical formulas, look-up tables, or off-the-shelf statistical mediation models such as mixed-effects
modeling. However, these corrections are not able to account for the complexity of this problem and unable to
model heterogeneity across subjects and spatial locations. In this work, we propose to develop a statistical
correction method based on the construction of a database of distributions of these corrections across
demographics and spatial locations on the head obtained from analysis of existing pediatric anatomical MRI
data. We propose to use these distributions as priors in the analysis of fNIRS group level data to model bias
and uncertainty introduced by unknown anatomical structures.
Aim 1. Characterize how key anatomical and demographic factors influence fNIRS measurements.
Aim 2. Development and characterization of our proposed novel anatomical statistical distribution
model.
Aim 3. Integrate the proposed model into our existing open source fNIRS toolbox."

completely regenerate limbs throughout life. Elucidating how axolotls regenerate limbs will provide critical clues
for scientific efforts aimed at therapeutic limb regeneration in human patients in the future. The precise genes
whose activity enables limb regeneration can now be defined with the advent of appropriate experimental tools
and genomic resources in axolotls. On the Harvard campus, axolotls are being used collaboratively to address
fundamental questions such as: potential metabolic trade-offs associated with appendage regeneration (Dr.
George Lauder); connections between regeneration and cancer (Dr. Brian Haas); how stress pathways
intersect with stem cell activation following amputation (Dr. Isaac Chiu), and central nervous system regulate—
or respond to—limb regeneration (Dr. Jia Liu). Our use of axolotls goes beyond limb regeneration.
Researchers are using HAF’s axolotls to study the evolution of novel sensory traits (Dr. Nicholas Bellono),
evolutionary aspects of pain sensation (Dr. Will Renthal), and evolution of skeletal morphologies such as pelvis
(Dr. Stephanie Pierce). Thus, the HAF is truly a multi-use facility that has supplied a variety of labs with high-
quality research organisms for study.
 Axolotls are permanently aquatic, and they are also cannibalistic. To generate and grow axolotls to
appropriate sizes for experiments, they must be bred in-house and raised in separate enclosures, ensuring
they are completely naïve to injury at the onset of studies. We are also generating targeted alleles of axolotls
and transgenics. These animals must be raised to adulthood to establish lines, yet the axolotl generation time
is one year. Thus, there is significant need for axolotl housing in the facility that is standardized and robust in
the face of environmental fluctuations. Automation is key to the management of a modern axolotl facility, yet
equipment for automation can be expensive and difficult to fund from traditional sources. Equipment requested
will provide hundreds of individual enclosures for live axolotls to live with minimal environmental fluctuation and
minimal human caretaker intervention, thereby simultaneously improving rigor and reproducibility while also
improving efficiency. Together, these improvements will greatly enhance the rigor, reproducibility, and
efficiency of research programs on campus using the axolotl model system."
10987403,"Abstract: Heterochronic parabiosis and serum transfer models have given evidence for the rejuvenating
properties of young blood in old mice and equally potent deleterious effects of old blood in young mice. The
critical factors or even tissues responsible for such effects remained elusive due, in part, to the complexity of
the parabiosis models. Taking an organ-specific approach may lead to better understanding of how individual
tissues contribute to the effects we have seen with parabiosis. Since the liver is a critical organ regulating
whole-body metabolism and is the primary source of secreted proteins in circulation, it is an intriguing target
to manipulate its biological age and determine resulting functional and molecular changes. To alter the
biological age of the liver, we will utilize the heterochronic hepatocyte transplantation technique to incorporate
young cells in the aged liver, and vice versa. Isochronic hepatocyte transplantation and non-surgical groups
will serve as controls. We have generated preliminary data showing successful transplantation into both
young and old livers and see whole-body effects on adiposity to validate efficacy of the model. We
hypothesize the donor cells will engraft and influence the host liver to take on either, a more youthful or
accelerated aging state based on the donor cell age. Moreover, we hypothesize that transplanted cells will
contribute to the liver secretome and mimic profiles of the young and old plasma proteome. We will test these
hypotheses through the following aims. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that transplanted cells will alter the host
liver function, cellular landscape and biological age. We will measure clinical markers of liver function,
including AST, ALT and BUN after heterochronic transplantation. In addition, we will use the recently
developed 10xGenomics Xenium Spatial transcriptomic platform to determine how this procedure affects the
cellular landscape of the liver, while using epigenetic clocks as an indices of biological age of the tissue.
Aim2 will test the hypothesis that donor hepatocytes will alter host liver secretome dependent on the donor
cell age. Hepatocytes-derived secreted proteins will be measured using the MetRS mouse model to label
proteins in the plasma and compare the plasma proteome across groups. The proposed studies will fully test
the hypothesis that donor cells will engraft into the host liver and influence tissue function, cellular phenotype
and secretome, which may mimic the effects of heterochronic blood sharing."

 This study addresses the challenge of improving neural progenitor (NP) survival and migration in the context of
neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries. It investigates the potential of adult CNS endothelial cells (ECs) to express
developmental genes following epigenetic reprogramming, aiming to guide NP migration and enhance neurovascular
communication. The research also delves into the capacity of CNS vessels, induced with developmental gene cohorts, to
boost NP survival and migration in stroke-affected brains. Specific aims include comprehensive migration assays and the
evaluation of post-stroke brain recovery through detailed assessments of NP survival, migration, and differentiation. The
anticipated outcomes seek to contribute fundamental knowledge and potentially transform neural progenitor treatment
strategies, proposing a novel approach that combines vascular rejuvenation with NP transplantation for improved
cognitive and motor skills and overall enhanced clinical outcomes. If successful, the results of this application will
significantly influence the design of neural progenitor (NP) transplant-treatment strategies for neurological disorders,
including stroke."

PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest
gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection
typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous ovarian cancer,
also known as high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer
histological subtypes also exist—endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early
diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90% with early-
stage detection. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive
value to be useful from a clinical perspective. During the first cycle of this project, we have mapped the metabolic
alterations in both serum and ovarian tissues for double- and triple-knockout mouse models of HGSC from early
stage to animal death. This has led to several potential biomarker panels that could be useful in humans and a
deeper understanding of metabolic rewiring that is observed at early stages of the disease. We have also found
that, contrary to the perceived notion in the field, ovarian progesterone is a crucial endogenous factor that
induces the development of primary tumors progressing to metastatic ovarian cancer in mouse models.
Remarkably, blocking progesterone signaling effectively suppresses ovarian cancer development and its
peritoneal metastases. Moreover, we have found that there are many unknown metabolites and lipids that are
highly correlated with disease progression, but we have been unable to identify all of them with current structural
annotation tools. These results have prompted us to propose the development of new tools to identify metabolites
using triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) coupled to energy-resolved collision-induced fingerprints (CIF) in Aim
1. Because the metabolic rewiring observed at the reproductive tissue level becomes diluted in serum, in Aim 2
we propose to look for OC biomarkers in closer proximity to the ovary by phenotyping “mock” Pap samples in
collaboration with Prof. Skubitz from the University of Minnesota. Aim 3 focuses on understanding the
progesterone-mediated mechanisms involved in suppression of ovarian cancer at a systems level applying Brca1
mouse models for high-risk BRCA1 carriers. In this aim, we will conduct serum metabolic phenotyping, mass
spectrometry tissue imaging, and gene expression studies in robust Brca1 mouse models of ovarian and breast
cancers in collaboration with Prof. Kim from Indiana University School of Medicine. We will investigate changes
associated with treatment with progesterone or an antiprogestin, allowing us to understand differences with
animals without the mutation. Overall, the successful completion of these three aims will lead to (a) new tools for
deeper metabolomic phenotyping of ovarian and other cancers, (b) more accurate ovarian cancer biomarkers
and methods to detect them, and (c) a deeper understanding of gene expression and metabolic alterations
associated with ovarian and breast cancer in high-risk populations."
10979987,"ABSTRACT
There exists an urgent need to develop and evaluate early interventions to mitigate neurodegenerative
processes in aging adults at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including those with subjective
cognitive decline (SCD). Prospective longitudinal evidence indicates that greater habitual fish consumption by
pre-symptomatic elderly adults is associated with a significant reduction in risk for developing dementia. Fish is
a primary dietary source of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which is concentrated in the
mammalian brain and is significantly lower in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brains of AD patients.
Preclinical evidence indicates that correcting age-related reductions in brain DHA levels is ‘sufficient’ to
promote neurotrophic signaling and mitigate degenerative processes including Aβ deposition in aged rodents
and AD mouse models. However, attempts to translate these promising findings in aging adults at risk for AD
using processed fish ‘oils’ that exclusively supply triglyceride-esterified DHA (TAG-DHA) have proven
unsuccessful. Importantly, recent evidence indicates that TAG-DHA has limited passage across the blood-
brain barrier (BBB) compared with DHA obtained from fish, which is also esterified to phosphatidylcholine (PC-
DHA). More specifically, DHA esterified to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA), a biosynthetic product of PC-
DHA, is preferentially transported across the BBB by a recently discovered transporter MFSD2A. Critically,
LPC-DHA, but not TAG-DHA, supplementation increases brain DHA levels in rodents and AD mouse models,
increases neurotrophic signaling (BDNF), enhances memory performance, and has robust neuroprotective
effects. While these findings suggest that LPC-DHA is more effective than TAG-DHA for increasing central
DHA levels and mitigating neurodegenerative processes, the effects of LPC-DHA on central DHA delivery has
never been investigated in human subjects. The recent availability of capsules enriched with preformed LPC-
DHA provides a novel opportunity to address this gap. We propose to conduct the first proof-of-concept
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the effects of LPC-DHA and TAG-DHA
supplementation on CSF DHA levels, and to investigate effects on neurodegenerative (p-tau217 & Aβ42) and
neurotrophic (BDNF) biomarker levels, in elderly adults with SCD. In addition, we will investigate associations
with executive functioning and episodic memory performance, and the potential moderating effects of relevant
genetic variants (APOE4, MFSD2A, BDNF). Our primary HYPOTHESIS is that LPC-DHA supplementation will
be more effective than TAG-DHA for increasing CSF DHA levels in elderly adults with SCD. We additionally
hypothesize that LPC-DHA will be more effective than TAG-DHA for increasing CSF and blood BDNF levels
and decreasing the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio. Results of this study are anticipated to provide a strong empirical
foundation to support future trials designed to further evaluate LPC-DHA supplementation on cognitive and
neuroimaging endpoints in at-risk elderly adults."
10979397,"Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. It is estimated that each
year more than 180,000 new prostate cancer patients will be diagnosed, and approximately 26,000 patients in
the United States will die, primarily due to metastasis. This occurs despite advances in early detection and
treatment. The available treatment options are limited, not very effective, and associated with severe side effects.
Furthermore, prostate cancer patients can develop resistance to the currently available therapeutics. Therefore,
this proposal will help develop effective treatments and address mechanisms of therapeutic resistance for men
with metastatic prostate cancer.
 Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) specifically modifies the histone H3 protein at its lysine 27; thereby,
tightly winding DNA and silencing gene expression. Our previous work showed that EZH2 is upregulated in
advanced prostate carcinomas and metastatic prostate cancer, and prostate cancer patients who have higher
expression levels of EZH2 have shorter survival times than prostate cancer patients with low or no expression
of EZH2. We also found that high expression levels of EZH2 induce chromosome instability by repressing many
important proteins that are responsible for repair of DNA damage. DNA damage and improper DNA repair can
lead to the initiation and progression of many cancers, including prostate cancer. Recently, pharmacological
inhibitors of Poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) have been clinically tested for the treatment of prostate
cancer; however, these drugs are only effective in a subset of patients with DNA repair defects. Furthermore,
patients can develop therapeutic resistance to PARP inhibitors. Therefore, treatment with PARP inhibitors alone
may not be effective for every patient, suggesting the importance of other biological mechanisms in regulating
the development and progression of prostate cancer.
 Most advanced prostate cancer cells have higher levels of EZH2 and PARP1 proteins compared to that in
early-stage prostate cancer cells, suggesting the importance of these proteins in prostate cancer progression.
We found that EZH2 directly interacts with and methylates a lysine of PARP1. In the proposed project, we will
identify precisely how EZH2-mediated PARP1 lysine methylation regulates PARP1’s function in DNA damage
repair and transcription activity. Understanding these mechanisms will lead to the future design of new inhibitors
of EZH2 and PARP1. Furthermore, our preliminary data strongly suggest that PARPi-resistant tumors have
higher levels of EZH2 compared to PARPi-sensitive tumors, suggesting EZH2 plays a critical role in PARPi-
resistance. Therefore, our work provides a novel rationale to target EZH2 in PARPi-resistant PCa."
10979400,"Alterations in glycosylation have been associated with the development and progression of many
types of cancers and other chronic and acute diseases. Structural glycan analysis on purified
proteins often provides the best “biomarker” information but is time consuming and can take days
or often weeks for the analysis of only a handful of samples.
 To address this limitation, our group has developed a streamlined antibody capture slide
array approach to directly profile N-glycans of captured serum glycoproteins. This method
combines the method of antibody arrays and imaging mass spectrometry to create a new method
of multiplexed N-glycan analysis. Importantly, this assay requires only a few microliters of serum
and utilizes simplified processing workflows that require no protein purification or sugar
modifications prior to analysis. This method is referred to as the GlycoTyper. In this method, N-
linked glycans are PNGase F released on slide from antibody captured glycoproteins and are
directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We have used this methodology to identify
biomarkers of pre-malignant and malignant liver disease.
 Our plan is to transition this method, which utilizes novel glyco-technology into the
commercial setting. To help translate this finding we propose to establish an inter-disciplinary,
multi-institutional research team, working in strategic alliance with both industry and clinical
partners to validate our identified biomarker. This application represents a true synergistic effort
between the group at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the clinical group at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), and an industrial partner GlycoPath
Inc, who has licensed this technology. We believe that this multidisciplinary team will lead to the
rapid and rigorous examination of the proposed biomarker panel."
10979244,"Project Summary
The amniotic membrane forms a tough fluid-filled sac that protects the developing embryo and is essential for
a successful pregnancy. Amniogenesis initiates early in human development as the embryo implants into the
uterine wall: the epiblast cells first polarize to form a pluripotent lumenal cyst and, subsequently, one half of
this polarized cyst loses pluripotency and becomes squamous amniotic ectoderm while the other side remains
pluripotent. In published work using an hPSC-based Gel-3D system, we showed that a mechanical cue
initiates amnion specification by triggering a BMP signaling cascade in individual cells of pluripotent cysts.
Recently, we established a new hPSC-based amniogenic model called Glass-3D+BMP, in which the mechanical
cue is bypassed and uniform addition of BMP ligand to pluripotent hPSC cysts leads to simultaneous activation
of BMP signaling in all cells within 10 minutes. Over the next 48 hours, all cells give rise to squamous amnion
cells, forming fully squamous amnion cysts. This highly robust amniogenic system, which enables reproducible
mechanistic analyses specifically into amniogenesis, will be used throughout this study to investigate
transcriptional, signaling and epigenetic machineries driving amnion fate progression. Interestingly, although all
cells are equally exposed to BMP in the Glass-3D+BMP model, amniogenesis initiates focally then spreads
laterally to form fully squamous amnion cysts. Importantly, similar focal amniogenesis followed by spreading
was also seen in the Gel-3D amniogenic system that we previously developed. Moreover, in early cynomolgus
macaque embryos, molecular signatures associated with focal initiation followed by spreading are readily seen
at transcript and protein levels, indicating that this two-step process is an important aspect of successful
amnion fate determination both in vivo and in vitro. The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms
that initiate (Aim 1) and spread (Aim 2) amnion fate specification. In vitro findings will be grounded using early
cynomolgus macaque embryo samples. Our preliminary loss-of-function data lead us to hypothesize that
GATA2 and GATA3 are critical for focal initiation of amniogenesis, while spreading is controlled by TFAP2A
and canonical WNT signaling. Proposed transcriptomic and epigenetic studies will further expose these
transcriptional and signaling machineries. Functional genetic deletion studies of candidate genes will be used
to test for potential master regulators of amnion fate. Overall, the work proposed here will greatly accelerate
the pace of discovery regarding critical but previously inaccessible post-implantation events and thus will have
enormous implications for understanding early processes that impact embryonic development and human
fertility."
10979766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
PAX3-FOXO1 and related fusions create oncogenic transcription factors that remodel chromatin to drive a subset
of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with dismal cure rates. Therapies to target PAX3-FOXO1 are lacking.
Recently, we established mTORC1 as a PAX3-FOXO1 genetic dependency that is exploitable with third
generation bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitors, now in phase 1 testing. Unlike rapamycin, RMC-6272 prevents
mTORC1-driven assembly of eIF4F and ensuing cap-dependent translation. This corresponds to striking efficacy
in patient-derived xenografts (PDX): RMC-6272 induces prolonged remissions, while rapamycin analogs only
stabilize disease, mirroring their modest effects in patients. However, PDX eventually regrow and show
resistance to RMC-6272 re-treatment, making it clear that a knowledge gap prevents us from effectively targeting
PAX3-FOXO1 via mTORC1. What is the molecular basis for PAX3-FOXO1 “addiction” to cap-dependent
translation, and how can we rationally combine this agent to overcome resistance and enable curative therapy?
This proposal addresses these questions with the goal of providing a molecularly informed strategy to aid
ongoing clinical development of bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitors in childhood cancer.
Aim 1 will define the molecular basis for RMC-6272 efficacy in fusion positive RMS. Excitingly, informatic
and proteomic data lead us to the anchoring hypothesis that PAX3-FOXO1 requires cap-dependent translation
for its own expression. We will use precise biochemical assays of mRNA translation and protein synthesis to test
this. Building on the observation that patient-derived xenografts (PDX) driven by less frequent PAX7-FOXO1
fusions show reduced response to RMC-6272, we will define molecular features in the untranslated regions
(UTRs) of PAX3 and PAX7 fusions that require mTORC1 and eIF4F for their translation, and test whether UTR
sequence determines RMC-6272 efficacy. Aim 2 will define the best means to augment RMC-6272 efficacy
in PDX. Single agents are rarely successful in curing even genetically simple cancers like fusion positive RMS,
and indeed we observe the emergence of resistance to RMC-6272 monotherapy. We find that BET inhibitors
(which decrease PAX3-FOXO1 expression) and RAS inhibitors (which blunt feedback activation of MAPK) each
are synergistic with RMC-6272. We hypothesize that such mechanism-based combinations will offer curative
treatment and will compare them to combinations with chemotherapy that are the mainstay of relapsed RMS
studies. Using pharmacodynamic modeling in PDX, we will identify safe and optimal biologic dosing to combine
agents, then find the strategy that best prolongs survival and prevents resistance to translate into clinical trials.
Completion of these aims will detail how eIF4F orchestrates oncogene output in a frequently lethal pediatric
cancer and define strategies to further enhance these effects to offer curative treatment. Beyond guiding bi-steric
mTORC1 inhibitor use in RMS, the knowledge gained will enable study of translational control as a therapeutic
target in other transcription factor-driven malignancies based on determinants of response we define here."
10979831,"Project Summary/Abstract
Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is essential for implementing
interventions that can slow cognitive decline, benefiting individuals, caregivers, and society. Gait speed emerges
as a powerful predictor of ADRD, especially in the early stages of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), often
preceding cognitive symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms between gait speed and cognitive decline
remain unclear, limiting the specificity of gait as an ADRD predictor. This research project aims to investigate gait
deficits during tasks requiring cognitive input into walking control (Aim 1) and to unveil the neural processes
behind these cognitive contributions (Aim 2). The study focuses on two crucial gait markers: locomotor learning
and attentional need for gait control. Locomotor learning involves encoding and retrieving walking motor
memories. Attentional need for gait control indicates the requirement for explicit attentional resources, primarily
from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), during walking, often assessed through dual-tasking. Both markers are vital for
the mobility of older adults in the community, yet their neural mechanisms remain unclear. We will specifically
determine the contribution of basal ganglia dysfunction on these gait markers. Growing evidence suggests that
BG pathology, characterized by factors like iron deposition, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and
compromised BG intra-connectivity, negatively affects mobility. Furthermore, we investigate the specific
contribution of BG's role in compensatory mechanisms for attentional control during mobility, particularly through
its connectivity with executive control networks (ECN), including the PFC. Our central hypothesis is that
individuals at high risk for ADRD (i.e., those with MCI) have diminished locomotor learning and higher attentional
need for gait control (Aim 1) due to BG pathology and weak BG-ECN inter-connectivity (Aim 2). Preliminary
results support this hypothesis, showing lower locomotor learning and higher attentional need for gait control in
MCI compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Interestingly, these gait markers prove to be more sensitive to
MCI than gait speed itself. Thus, we anticipate that BG pathology and BG-ECN inter-connectivity, which are
related to slow walking, will be strongly associated with the performance of locomotor learning and attentional
need for gait control. The expected findings from this research hold the potential to yield significant insights into
both behavioral and mechanistic deficits in cognitive contributions to gait in individuals with MCI. Such insights
can greatly enhance the specificity and validity of novel gait measures as preclinical indicators for risk of ADRD."

Postoperative pain is a major morbidity, and persistent opioid use after surgery has contributed to an epidemic.
An improved mechanistic understanding of how pain is regulated within the brain can lead to novel non-opioid
analgesic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the central regulation of
postoperative pain. The objective of the current application is to test how disruptions of input circuits to the
prelimbic cortex (PL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two key components of the prefrontal cortex in rodents,
contribute to symptoms of chronic postoperative pain. The PL is homologous to human dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex that is known to undergo synaptic changes with chronic pain, and the ACC is a well-described region for
processing affective component of pain across species. Our central hypothesis is that disruptions in input circuits
to the prefrontal system present a key mechanism for chronic pain and thus form important therapeutic targets.
Our hypothesis is supported by the current literature showing that the PL has a pain-inhibitory role, whereas the
ACC enhances pain aversion, and that chronic pain causes increased excitability in the ACC and hypo-
excitability in the PL. It is also supported by our recent results demonstrating that ACC receives nociceptive
inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the insular cortex (IC), whereas the paraventricular nuclei
(PVN) of the hypothalamus projects to the PL promotes top-down pain regulation. In Aim 1, we will test the
hypothesis that chronic postoperative pain strengthens the S1-ACC and IC-ACC connections and weakens the
PVN-PL connection. We will combine optogenetics with in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving rats to label
presynaptic neurons and record ACC neuronal activity in response to nociceptive stimuli in PI and SNI models,
followed by graph theoretic analysis. We will test that i) ACC pyramidal neurons receive inputs from S1 and
anterior IC; ii) as pain becomes chronic after SNI (in contrast to PI which is self-resolving), there is a progressive
increase in the number of ACC neurons that receive S1/IC inputs; and iii) neurons receiving S1/IC inputs are
more likely to be pain-responsive to overdrive ensemble nociceptive response in the ACC. Similarly, we will show
that neuronal function in the PL is enhanced by PVN inputs, but chronic pain after SNI decreases this connection
to impair PL function. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that altered S1-ACC, IC-ACC and PVN-PL circuits
contribute to postoperative pain. We will use closed-loop neuromodulation to pair detected neural activity of S1-
or IC- responsive neurons in the ACC with optogenetic inhibition, and pain relief after SNI will indicate a causal
link between circuit disruption and pain behavior. We will do similar experiments by activating PL neurons. Next,
we will test if normalization of S1-ACC and IC-ACC circuits with ketamine or the PVN-PL circuit with oxytocin
administration after SNI could inhibit postoperative pain. The innovation of this project lies in the systems
neuroscience approach and application of cutting-edge computational and experimental techniques. The impact
of the proposed work rests in the discovery of novel brain-circuit targets for postoperative pain management."

Broad Impact: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Here we
propose a set of experiments that will determine the role of insulin dysregulation and tau phosphorylation by
GSK3β in T1DM and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We believe these experiments will lead to a breakthrough
in our understanding of diabetic neuropathy that will impact development of new therapeutics for years to come.
Specific aims: Based on previous publications and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that insulin deficiency
in the STZ model will upregulate the activity of GSK3β and drive up the level of phosphorylated tau within the
neurons of the sciatic nerve resulting in neural dysfunction, IENF loss and mechanical and thermal
hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we will first identify increases in tau phosphorylation and dysregulation
of the insulin signaling pathway using high content microscopy and western blot techniques. Then, we will confirm
the role of GSK3β in tau phosphorylation with a GSK3β specific inhibitor and TRPV1Cre x GSK3βFL mice. Last we
will develop new in vivo and in vitro modeling systems using AAV vectors that can be used to examine the effects
of GSK3β activation in the absence of the insulin dysregulation that accompany T1DM.
Career development and goals: In order to provide further growth of Dr. James Nichols’ career, the K99 phase
of this award will be focused on 1) additional training in specific research techniques (High Content Microscopy,
AAV vector delivery and Cre/lox systems, etc.); 2) professional development through mentorship, scientific
writing, grant writing and attendance of scientific meetings; and 3) education in the field of peripheral
neuropathies through quarterly meetings between Dr. Nichols and his mentorship team, daily mentoring by Dr.
Andrew Shepherd, and collaborative opportunities with other PIs in the Neuroimmunology Lab.
Career goals: Dr. Nichols’ long term career goal is to become a professor at a college of veterinary medicine or
a college of medicine, so he can continue his research in the field of neuropathic pain, continue to encourage
medical students who wish to follow a career in research, and participate in the education of the next generations
of medical students.
Environment: The Laboratories of Neuroimmunology within the Department of Symptom Research at MD
Anderson Cancer Center is comprised of over 40 scientists at various levels of their career ranging from
Professors to student volunteers. This environment is perfect for collaborations with other labs and provides
access to a plethora of core facilities to which the candidate has ready access. During the R00 phase of this
award Dr. Nichols will seek a similarly equipped environment to continue his studies in neuropathic pain, and the
development of therapies for DPN."

The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated the efficacy of lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose
computed tomography in reducing 5-year lung cancer mortality by 20%, albeit with high rates of false-positive
results. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual LCS with LDCT for individuals ages 50-
80 years who currently or formerly (quit within 15 years) smoked with a 20-pack-year history. Despite the task
force Grade B recommendation, a major concern of LCS is the potential harm associated with false-positive
results which are defined as having one or more nodules requiring follow-up and no change or lung cancer
diagnosis after one year. Specifically, false positives may burden the patient, clinician, and healthcare system
due to the economic and psychological effects of extra imaging and invasive procedures, fear of missing
cancer, and complications from procedures for benign lesions. There is a need to better estimate the burden
and the factors that affect false positive results in real-world practice over multiple rounds of screening to
inform patient-clinician conversations, guide the development of interventions to reduce false positive rates,
and optimize the risk-benefit ratio of LCS. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify the burden of
false-positive results at the patient, clinician, and facility levels and to understand the impact of false-positives
across the screening continuum. Using rich sources of longitudinal LCS data for >40K LCS exams from 17
facilities linked with state-based cancer registry data, we will accomplish the objectives through the
following specific aims (1) Identify attitudes, knowledge, and experiences with false-positive results from LCS
among patients and clinicians; (2) Determine patient-, exam-, radiologist-, and facility-level factors that affect
false-positive findings on lung cancer screening; (3) Assess the cumulative risk of a false-positive LCS exam
over 5- and 10- rounds of annual screening across multilevel factors. An estimated 14.5 million US adults are
eligible for LCS and are at risk of experiencing a false positive result. This study will generate in-depth
knowledge about the potential harms of false-positive LCS results. These findings may inform patient-clinician
shared decision-making conversations or may help to reduce false positive rates by identifying modifiable
radiologist or facility-level factors."

Chronic, low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) is a hallmark of aging and is one of the ‘seven pillars of aging’
associated with age-related diseases. Liver aging is characterized by an increase in chronic inflammation that is
associated with chronic liver diseases (CLD), a leading cause of liver transplantation and mortality in the elderly.
Liver inflammation and CLD are proposed to promote neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in humans,
supporting a role of liver in cognitive dysfunction. Despite the link between the liver-brain inflammation axis,
pathway(s) promoting liver inflammation or how liver aging contributes to neuroinflammation or cognitive deficit
is not known. Necroptosis is a cell death pathway that releases damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs
such as HMGB1) and promote inflammation through the activation innate immune cells. We found that
necroptosis increases with age in the liver of mice, and inhibiting necroptosis (using Ripk3-/- or Mlkl-/- mice or
pharmacological inhibitor) reduced HMGB1, proinflammatory M1 macrophages, proinflammatory cytokines, and
liver pathology (steatosis and fibrosis) in the liver of old mice. Necroptosis inhibition improved autophagy and
reduced cellular senescence, key pathways associated with inflammaging and liver pathology. Importantly,
activating necroptosis specifically in hepatocytes of adult mice (7-month-old) impaired autophagy and increased
cellular senescence, macrophage numbers, and proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. Together, these data
support the conclusion that necroptosis is a key factor in liver inflammation and pathology through activation of
macrophages and senescence in the liver. Our data show that hepatocyte-specific necroptosis increases
neuroinflammation (proinflammatory cytokines and glial cell activation) and levels of circulating HMGB1, a known
mediator of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to cognitive decline, and we found
that hepatocyte necroptosis reduced nest building capacity, an early indicator of behavioral deficits in mice.
Given that hepatocytes undergo age-related necroptosis and are the primary source to circulating HMGB1 in
liver diseases, the central hypothesis of the proposal is that necroptosis activation specifically in hepatocytes will
increase HMGB1 release from hepatocytes that will increase liver inflammation by activating macrophages, and
liver pathology by increasing cellular senescence. Circulating HMGB1, in turn, will promote neuroinflammation
and cognitive impairment through systemic effects. We will test this hypothesis using novel mouse models that
allow us to either inhibit or activate necroptosis specifically in hepatocytes. Aim 1. Determine the role of
hepatocyte specific necroptosis on macrophage activation and liver inflammation; Aim 2. Determine the role of
hepatocyte specific necroptosis on cellular senescence and liver pathology; Aim 3. Determine the effects of
hepatocyte specific necroptosis on neuroinflammation and brain function."

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus; GAS) causes more than half a million deaths annually through
invasive infections and post-infection immune sequelae like rheumatic heart disease. The pathogenesis of these
diseases is poorly understood despite their public health importance, and they carry high mortality even with
treatment. The first barrier to infection is the skin. GAS frequently lives asymptomatically, but can invade further
to cause impetigo and erysipelas, and deeper still to cause the “flesh-eating disease” necrotizing fasciitis. The
long-term goal of this work is to understand the specific cellular processes that GAS virulence factors manipulate
when infections proceed to more severe invasive diseases, in order to develop more effective therapeutic
countermeasures. This proposal tests the hypothesis that keratinocytes sense invasive infection through a new
cell death mechanism of gasdermin A-dependent pyroptosis. The major secretion product of GAS is a protease,
SpeB, which degrades tissue to promote spread and immune factors to protect the bacterium. GAS can also
invade skin keratinocytes, which usually can restrict intracellular pathogens through autophagy, but hypervirulent
GAS escapes this also using SpeB. Notably, the inert cytosolic protein gasdermin A is processed by SpeB into
an active pore-forming effector. Keratinocytes express high gasdermin A and die of gasdermin A-dependent
pyroptosis during GAS infection. Thus, activation of gasdermin A is intrinsically linked to the same virulence
factors essential for invasion and serves as a cell-autonomous sensor of pathogenicity. This proposal dissects
cell death at the host-pathogen interface with three aims. In the first, a panel of defined mutant GAS and clinical
isolates naturally differing in their ability to cause invasive will be used to examine the molecular requirements
for cell death during infection, with specific reporters used to measure SpeB activity, gasdermin A activation, and
bacterial and host cell survival. Then, the molecular effector functions of gasdermin A and how pyroptosis results
in bacterial killing is examined. Lastly, in vivo models are used to separately examine inflammation, wound
healing, and bacterial killing to determine the specific contribution of cell death to the establishment and
progression of skin infection. These studies will lay the foundation for how gasdermin A acts as an immune
sensor of skin infection, dramatically improving our fundamental understanding of GAS pathogenesis and
revealing therapeutic targets to treat disease."

ABSTRACT
The Duke clinical site has the strongest record of productivity in Phases 1 and 2. In Phase 3, as a Diagnostic Center of Excellence (DCoE), while continuing our current activities, we align with new priorities in PAR-23-289, to increase the enrollment of patients with health disparities, scale the UDN to more patients and expand non- genomic approaches. Specific Aim 1: Scale our comprehensive UDN evaluations to more patients with undiagnosed diseases. We will enroll 50 undiagnosed patients in year 1 (compared to 30/year in Phase 2) and evaluate them in three tiers predicated upon diagnostic needs. Due to our existing and proposed efficiencies, we can scale enrollment in subsequent years, dependent on additional resources. Our niche is pediatric genomic disorders, but we will continue to evaluate adults and children with varied phenotypes, including those with non- genomic disorders. Specific Aim 2: Perform research analysis of the genomic data and utilize adjunct research genomic technologies to achieve diagnoses. In an individualized manner, our innovative and updated phenotype- agnostic research bioinformatics pipeline will be utilized to increase diagnoses and new disease gene discoveries. We expect patients in Tiers 3 and 4 to enter the study with a non-diagnostic exome/genome; for these patients, we will first re-analyze the pre-UDN genomic data. UDN-generated genomic data for patients in all tiers will also undergo research analysis. We will expand our pursuit of research technologies such as RNAseq and optical genome mapping to investigate etiologies for unresolved patients. Specific Aim 3: Utilize community- based participatory research (CBPR) principles to increase UDN participation by patients with health disparities (those living in the HRSA-designated rural MUA of NC and of minority background). Building upon relationships with the NC Office of Rural Health, the NC Area Health Education Centers, and the NC Family Support Network, we will engage constituents and stakeholders, to mitigate patient and provider barriers to the UDN, disseminate UDN information and collaboratively partner with community providers, to enroll patients with health disparities to approximate regional demographics. We will also engage the providers to be active participants in their patients’ UDN evaluations. As an exploratory sub-aim, we will assess our community collaborations to provide pre-implementation observational data. Specific Aim 4: Collaboratively contribute to new network priorities and ongoing activities. We will work with the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) to increase efficiencies within all Tiers 1-4. We plan to refine the environmental exposures survey to create separate pediatric and adult surveys and will share these for network implementation and validation. We will collaborate with the DMCC for artificial intelligence methodologies for medical information analysis and for health economics assessments, as per PAR-23-289. Finally, we will continue our current network-wide studies (e.g. studying the psychological impact of being undiagnosed) and our leadership roles in working groups. In summary, the Duke DCoE is well-positioned to further the UDN mission/science in Phase 3. OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 03/2020 Approved Through 02/28/2023) Page Continuation Format Page"
10979697,"Summary
Peritoneal metastases are present at diagnosis in 57% of women with ovarian cancer and 8% of patients with
colorectal cancer. Peritoneal metastases have been considered a terminal condition for the majority of patients,
but emerging evidence of immune advantages associated with intraperitoneal administration presents
opportunities to advance novel therapeutics for these cancers. Despite a strong rationale for immune therapy in
ovarian cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors have not demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for ovarian cancer,
and novel approaches are needed for this disease. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal
delivery of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) functionalized with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists leads to
rapid internalization by free and spheroid-associated CD11b+ myeloid cells with subsequent trafficking to tumor
implants, rather than sequestration in the liver as seen following intravenous delivery. Furthermore,
intraperitoneal delivery of TLR agonist-modified MSN eliminated disseminated peritoneal ovarian cancer and
protected against tumor rechallenge. In contrast, subcutaneous delivery did not demonstrate therapeutic
efficacy, highlighting the impact of route of delivery and local interactions with tumor infiltrating leukocytes. This
project seeks to define mechanisms whereby intraperitoneally administered modified-MSN achieves tumor
eradication with a focus on delivery route, trafficking, toxicodynamic properties, efficacy in diverse models of
peritoneal metastases, and activation of murine and human immune cells."
10979595,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the United States. Abnormal
DNA methylation patterning is an epigenetic hallmark of colon and other cancer types and is a major contributing
factor to genome instability and tumor suppressor gene silencing in this disease. Despite a deep appreciation of
roles for DNA methylation in development and cancer, causal mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of
DNA methylation abnormalities in colon and other cancer types, and consequences of this hallmark epigenetic
remodeling on cancer development, remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to address these
fundamental knowledge gaps. Our preliminary data implicate protein ubiquitination as an essential post-
translational modification (PTM) regulating the activity of DNMT1, the primary enzyme responsible for the
epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation patterns through mitotic cell divisions and a major target for epigenetic
cancer therapy. Building from these data, studies in Aim 1 will characterize the ubiquitin signaling network that
interfaces with DNA methylation inheritance. The therapeutic potential of targeting ubiquitin signaling regulators
in this pathway will also be considered. In Aim 2, we will test a mechanistic hypothesis connecting overexpression
of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 to DNA methylation dysregulation and colon tumorigenesis. Aim 3 will
investigate a non-canonical function for UHRF1 in the regulation of heterochromatic histone PTM signaling and
its implications for DNA hypomethylation therapy. Overall, our studies at the interface of ubiquitin signaling and
DNA methylation inheritance will reveal fundamental causes and consequences of abnormal DNA methylation
signaling in colon cancer and identify novel approaches to enhance the efficacy of DNA hypomethylation therapy
as a treatment strategy to manage this deadly disease."
10981546,"Summary: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major public health problem that affects 640,000 Americans each
year, and accrues $10B in healthcare costs. For critical thromboses, the American Heart Association and
Society for Interventional Radiology recommend thrombolytic drugs be administered to break down the
thrombus and restore flow in the vessel. Thrombolytic drugs are not effective for the 43% of DVT cases with
chronic thrombus, resulting in poor clinical outcomes for these patients. Adjuvant strategies are therefore
needed to ensure effective treatments for the entire thrombus. The scientific premise of this renewal project
is combining thrombolytic drugs with histotripsy, an ultrasound therapy that ablates tissue with the mechanical
action of bubble clouds, will improve outcomes for DVT patients. In the prior period of this project, we
established this combination treatment (histotripsy+) addresses all thrombus components, and resulted in
better outcomes than either approach individually in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, only a subset of thrombus
components could be treated with histotripsy or thrombolytic alone, which increases the likelihood for vascular
re-occlusion. These lessons have informed our revised approach in this Renewal Project, with an objective to
address current gaps that limit clinical deployment of histotripsy+.
 In Aim 1, we will upgrade our histotripsy+ instrumentation. A phased source will be produced that generates
bubble activity along a 1 cm length of thrombus for single transmitted pulses, and enables treatment for up to a
5 cm segment with electronic steering. Bubble activity will be monitored volumetrically with a coaxial matrix
imaging probe using our passive and active imaging algorithms. We will adjust transmitted pulses in real time
to account for defocusing from tissue heterogeneity using the send/receive capabilities of the phased,
cylindrical transducer. Finally, treatment protocols and imaging markers will be established that ensure
effective outcomes based on time-resolved measurements of in vitro clot degradation, and confirmed with ex
vivo chronic human specimen. Studies in Aim 2 will assess the safety of histotripsy+ for DVT. Mechanisms of
platelet activation during histotripsy+ will be assess in vitro, and effective antithrombotic strategies to counter
will be determined in vivo. For chronically thrombosed veins that have a reduced compliance to strain, we will
identify exposure conditions that effectively treat chronic DVT but avoid vascular rupture in vivo. Additionally,
we will assess treatment-related changes to cellular composition of treated veins with our microfluidics-based
scRNA-Seq technique. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will gauge the influence of thrombus age (0 to 30 days) on
treatment outcomes of histotripsy+ to develop personalized treatment strategies based on stage of disease.
Following successful completion of the proposed studies, we will have produced a validated system for rapid
treatment of DVT, with sufficient data to confirm the safety and efficacy needed for clinical testing. Further, new
information will be gathered to address currently intractable venous thrombi."

anticipated by public health or other government agencies. The pandemic caused several downstream hurdles,
including scheduling delays with CROs, supply chain shortages, and dramatic cost increases. The effect was
profound for the GMP drug manufacturing and testing (aim 1) and the extended GLP toxicology studies (aim

10981437,"Project Summary
 This research program is motivated by two goals. First, we seek to understand the neural mechanisms
by which the brain adapts to changes in vestibular (inner ear balance) input. Second, we seek to
advance development of a vestibular prosthesis/implant, a highly innovative treatment approach with
potential to improve quality of life for individuals disabled by disequilibrium and unsteady vision after loss
of vestibular sensation. In the United States alone, approximately 150,000 adults suffer disabling vertigo
and unsteadiness each year due to acute unilateral loss of vestibular function, while about 65,000 suffer
chronic imbalance and unsteady vision typical of severe bilateral sensory loss that fails to resolve despite
existing treatments.
 Sudden, permanent loss of vestibular nerve input causes disequilibrium, visual blurring due to
disruption of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and postural instability due to disruption of vestibulo-spinal
reflexes. These symptoms are usually followed by impressive but incomplete recovery. During the
previous funding period, we made excellent progress in defining the dynamics of compensation in these
vital reflexes. In addition, we established how these pathways respond acutely to activation of a
multichannel vestibular prosthesis (MVP), and have developed a primate model for single unit studies of MVP
mediated restoration of gaze/postural control and gait stability. In the proposed research, we will build upon
this solid foundation of progress through 3 synergistic aims. Experiments addressing Aim 1 will determine
how central vestibular pathways encode motion-modulated MVP stimulation and establish whether the use of
certain stimulation waveforms can enhance neural and resulting reflex responses. We predict that adaptation
of vestibular nuclei neurons is detrimental to generating prosthesis-evoked responses, and that methods to
desynchronize and increase afferent recruitment will improve functional outcomes. Aim 2 experiments will
examine mechanisms underlying the context-specific integration of prosthetic and extravestibular information
by investigating neural responses during gaze stabilizing & shifting behaviors. These experiments will extend
our investigation beyond reflex pathways and provide both systems and neuronal-level insight into how the
central nervous system (CNS) optimizes performance during complex behaviors typical of daily life.
Experiments addressing Aim 3 will examine, in freely moving monkeys, the context-specific processing of
prosthetic vestibular input at the single unit level during natural self-motion behaviors including postural control
and gait. Combined, these studies will enhance our understanding of how the CNS adapts to changes in
vestibular input; advance development of a potentially revolutionary treatment for loss of inner ear
function; and clarify how neuronal mechanisms that underlie learning at a single cell level can be
leveraged to optimize recovery of individuals disabled by loss of vestibular sensation."
10985343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Phospholipids, the fundamental components of cell membranes, play a crucial role in brain function. Research
indicates that changes in membrane lipid composition and fluidity may be contributing to the development of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By studying the distribution and alteration of membrane lipids in response to Aβ
exposure, new insights into the biology of AD and potential biomarkers for the disease may be uncovered.
Despite numerous studies on the role of membrane lipids in AD, research has been restricted to ex-vivo
tissues, and has not been utilized for diagnosis due to the absence of non-invasive imaging techniques. This
project aims to bridge this gap by developing an innovative MRI imaging technique to assess membrane lipid
properties in AD. The technique uses a nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) saturation transfer method.
Our preliminary studies strongly suggest that the NOE signal primarily originates from phospholipids and
changes significantly in AD on animal models. The NOE signal relies on both the underlying pool concentration
and the NOE coupling rate. Moreover, according to NOE theory, the NOE coupling rate depends on the
molecular motional properties, which may serve as an indicator of lipid fluidity as they likely share similar
physical properties. Based on these preliminary findings and analysis, we hypothesize that the NOE pool
concentration could reflect membrane lipid content, and the NOE coupling rate could represent lipid fluidity
regulated by membrane composition. The project is divided into three aims: 1) verifying the dependency of the
NOE signal on lipid properties on reconstituted phospholipid samples and cultured cells with varied lipid
composition; 2) confirming the origin of the NOE imaging in AD by correlating it with phospholipid species
maps determined by imaging mass spectrometry on animal AD models; and 3) evaluating the potential of NOE
for early detection of AD by comparing it with other traditional imaging methods in a longitudinal study. The
ultimate goal of this project is to provide a groundbreaking tool for AD research and diagnosis, enabling the
non-invasive study of membrane lipids in live brains. This could significantly improve our understanding of AD
pathology, potentially leading to new treatment strategies and early diagnosis."
10985872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research. Cardio and cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) such as hypertension and diabetes increase the
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence of CVRFs and dementia are higher among African Americans
and Hispanics than Whites. However, the etiological interaction between CVRFs and AD remains unclear.
Elucidating how genes and CVRFs interplay to influence AD risk will have the potential to reveal novel molecular
targets for prevention strategies and effective treatment for AD. To date, there is no accurate method to identify
genes or genetic variants that interact with CVRFs in AD. My overarching goal is to become an independent
investigator and interdisciplinary biostatistician on elucidating genetic architecture between AD and CVRFs in
diverse race/ethnic populations to aid in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies in AD. The objective of
this proposal is to 1) identify genes that interact with CVRFs to confer AD risk and 2) identify epigenomic and
transcriptomic signatures that interact with vascular pathologies to confer AD risk and investigate integrated
pathways across two omics profiles. The completion of these aims will generate harmonized CVRF data, genes
that interact with CVRFs in AD, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles, and integrative pathways in AD that
interacts with vascular pathologies. Our findings will pinpoint the our understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of CVRFs, cerebrovascular pathologies, and AD with the potential to reveal novel molecular targets
for developing effect drugs for prevention and treatment for AD that can be better tailored to the individual
Career development plan. The proposed career development plan will build upon my previous training in
statistical genetics and transcriptomics data analysis with the following training goals to enhance my trajectory
toward becoming an independent investigator: Training in 1) Clinical, epidemiological, and biological aspects of
AD, vascular disease, and aging; 2) Multi-omics Integrative data analysis techniques and interpretation of
molecular pathways; and 3) Develop leadership and professional skills to become a NIH-funded independent
investigator. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a mentoring and advisory team of internal and external
scientists with expertise in Neurology (Dr. Richard Mayeux), Computational Biology (Dr. Yufeng Shen),
Bioinformatics (Drs. Badri Vardarajan, Lana Garmire), and Biostatistics (Dr. Iuliana Ionita-Laza). I will broaden
my knowledge and proficiency through coursework, workshops, meetings, and hands-on training.
Environment. The research environment at Columbia University is ideal for my transition into an independent
`big data' AD/CVRFs scientist and a biostatistician. In years 4-5, I plan to develop and submit an R01 to conduct
a longitudinal investigation of gene-CVRFs interactions to track progression from CVRFs, vascular pathologies
to AD using a multi-omics analysis. Skills and findings from this K01 will be broadly applicable to communities."
10985578,"Abstract: Systemic and CNS sterile inflammation (inflammaging) are proposed drivers of brain aging and
neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, AD). Microglia, the resident CNS macrophages, alter
their phenotype with aging and AD, but how this reactivity contributes to, or prevents, AD development and
progression is unclear. An overarching view in the field is that microgliosis initially protects against accumulating
damage in the aged brain, but with time and AD neuropathology, persistent hyperactivation becomes deleterious
and promotes neurodegeneration. In our studies, we have identified a relatively unexplored aspect of
neuroinflammation with aging and AD characterized by upregulation of the Major Histocompatibility Complex I
(MHC-I). Microglial MHC-I is induced in humans, mice, and other species with aging, and occurs in AD patients
and AD mouse models. We have also determined that antigen-independent MHC-I receptors, leukocyte
immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily receptors (Lilr) and paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptors (Pilr),
are also present and induced in microglia with aging and AD. These receptors are almost exclusively restricted
to microglia in the CNS and contain either immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation or inhibition motifs (pro-
inflammatory ITAMs and anti-inflammatory ITIMs, respectively) that regulate Syk activity, a central modulator of
microglial phenotype. Thus, in the absence of, or in addition to, canonical signaling to T cell receptors on T cells,
MHC-I could cell-autonomously regulate microglial phenotype through Lilrs/Pilrs and this Syk. We hypothesize
that MHC-I is a cell-autonomous regulatory mechanism for microglia that promotes a pro-inflammatory
phenotype and alters microglia function. This proinflammatory microglial phenotype may also help recruit
infiltrating T cells to the brain parenchyma here MHC-I could signal directly to T cells. Using a novel, temporally
controlled and microglia-specific MHC-I knockout model we will: 1) Determine if MHC-I expression regulates
microglial reactivity and phagocytic phenotypes with aging, 2) Determine if MHC-I suppression exacerbates
prodromal AD phenotypes while slowing progression after symptom onset, and 3) Determine if T cell infiltration
into the brain and phenotype with aging and in models of AD is dependent on microglial MHC-I. Validation of
MHC-I as a novel regulator of microglial function will open new research avenues into controlling microglial
function and regulating T cell infiltration and function."
10986345,"One in four girls residing in the U.S. will be sexually abused before they turn 18. Child sexual abuse (CSA)
victimization is associated with an increased risk for morbidity, including adverse reproductive health outcomes
in women. In characterizing the associations between CSA and women’s reproductive health, previous work
has not fully accounted for selection bias and the role of developmental timing, abuse chronicity, and co-
occurrence with other child abuse types in determining outcome severity. These research limitations hinder our
ability to characterize and appropriately address adverse reproductive health outcomes among women who
are survivors of CSA. Moreover, the biological and psychosocial mechanisms that explain reproductive health
problems among female survivors of CSA remain understudied. Chronic inflammation and psychosocial
consequences of CSA, such as depression, substance use, a history of sexually transmitted infections hold
promise as potential mediating factors in these associations. Our study aims to examine the impact of CSA on
women’s impaired fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, and preterm delivery; and explore inflammation and
psychosocial mechanisms that may mediate these associations. Specifically, the aims of this study include
estimating the impact of CSA on women’s reproductive health outcomes (Aim 1); identifying patterns of child
abuse based on type, developmental timing, and chronicity, and the association of these patterns with
women’s reproductive health outcomes (Aim 2); and exploring inflammation and psychosocial mechanisms in
the association between CSA and women’s reproductive health outcomes (Aim 3). Our proposed study is a
secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)
restricted use dataset. The Add Health cohort is a nationally representative sample of adolescents recruited
from grades 7-12 during the 1994-1995 school year and prospectively followed into adulthood across five
waves of data collection. Add Health’s latest data collection occurred when participants were, on average, 38
years old (2016-2018; N = 6,197 women). Among women in Add Health sample, approximately 25% reported
a history of CSA. This nationally representative data assesses CSA and other child abuse types, chronicity,
and age of onset, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of abuse clustering. For each aim, we will
investigate several adverse reproductive health outcomes, including difficulty in getting and remaining
pregnant, complications during pregnancy (i.e., high blood pressure, preeclampsia, protein in urine, and
diabetes), and preterm delivery. We will employ several analytical approaches for data analysis, involving
propensity score matching, mixed-mode latent class modeling, mediation testing, and logistic regression
analysis. The results of this study will advance strategies to prevent or mitigate impaired fecundity and
pregnancy sequelae in women who have survived CSA—ultimately reducing the burden of adverse
reproductive outcomes among girls who experience sexual trauma in their childhood and adolescence."

This application proposes to examine where and for whom rural residence is associated with Alzheimer’s disease
and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in the United States. Analyses will 1) produce novel and
robust estimates of dementia prevalence in rural and urban America; and 2) characterize the types of rural places
and people most affected by dementia. This research is motivated by growing concerns for the health of rural
Americans, roughly 46 million people and 14% of the U.S population. Rural Americans have had poorer health
profiles than their urban peers since at least the 1980s, and the gap has widened over time. Yet surprisingly little
is known about rural-urban disparities in dementia, which is poised to become one of the most significant
population health challenges of the century. Dementia currently affects approximately 6.1 million or 11% of
Americans ages 65 and older, and numbers are expected to rise dramatically in the coming decades due to
population aging. The challenges associated with dementia may be especially severe in rural communities,
where access to quality healthcare and other services for people with dementia and their caregivers is often
severely limited. To anticipate and plan for the challenges associated with dementia, its patterning across places
and people must be understood. However, demographic estimates of dementia prevalence in rural and urban
America are lacking, even at the national level. Moreover, it remains unknown how the prevalence of dementia
varies among rural places and people, despite the fact that rural America is not monolithic. The proposed project
will therefore develop a demographic overview of rural-urban dementia disparities, including novel analyses of
heterogeneity across places (Aim 1) and people (Aim 2). In particular, Aims will explore variation in dementia
prevalence at the intersections of rural residence and regional setting (Aim 1a), county context and composition
(Aim 1b), and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 2). Analyses will be conducted with data
from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of older U.S. adults. This application,
led by an early-stage investigator, responds to PAR-23-179, which encourages applications generating scientific
insights about AD/ADRD, including estimates of disparities, from early-stage investigators and established
researchers new to the study of AD/ADRD."
10986157,"Project Summary
Fentanyl and other ultrapotent synthetic opioids cause respiratory depression, a potentially fatal acute toxic
effect that is mediated by activation of mu opioid receptors. Naloxone, an antagonist of mu opioid receptors,
can reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, but must compete with ultrapotent opioids for receptor
binding. A respiratory stimulant that acts independently of opioid receptors would be an appealing approach to
combat ultrapotent synthetic opioid poisoning. Serotonin generally provides a net stimulatory effect on
breathing due, in part, to 5HT2A/2C receptors in respiratory controlling areas in the brainstem. In addition, the
emerging interest in serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders,
including opioid use disorder, has led to renewed interest in development of serotonin agents, particularly
targeting the 5HT2A receptor. Activation of 5HT2A receptors in the dorsolateral pons can counter opioid-
induced respiratory depression and microinjection studies implicate medullary raphe neurons, which produce
serotonin, in opioid-induced respiratory depression, but mechanisms for these effects are unknown. The
overall goal of this proposal is to fill a major void in our understanding of serotonergic mechanisms in fentanyl-
induced respiratory depression. We hypothesize that fentanyl interferes with serotonin mediated mechanisms
that support breathing, which can be reversed by activation of 5HT2A receptors. We will test this hypothesis at
the cellular, circuit and whole animal level using approaches that selectively identify and modulate serotonin
neurons. Aim 1 will determine the effect of fentanyl on medullary raphe serotonin neuron activity mediated by
pre- and/or post-synaptic opioid receptors by recording from genetically labeled serotonin neurons contained in
acute brain slices. The role of post-synaptic opioid receptors on serotonin neurons in fentanyl-induced
respiratory depression will be determined in awake behaving mice. Aim 2 will determine the cellular and
synaptic mechanisms by which 5HT2A receptors and endogenous serotonin neurons counter opioid inhibition
of dorsolateral pontine neurons using ex vivo electrophysiology and a unique arterially perfused
pontomedullary circuit preparation. Aim 3 will determine the effect of systemic 5HT2A/2C agonists on fentanyl-
induced respiratory depression alone and in combination with a sub-therapeutic dose of naloxone in awake
behaving mice. Together, this R01 project will improve our understanding of serotonin mechanisms in fentanyl-
induced respiratory depression that will inform how to best leverage the serotonin system to counter fentanyl
toxicity in future studies."

10986307,"Background. Substance use continues to be a major driver of HIV acquisition and has been associated with
suboptimal ART adherence, treatment interruption, and inability to achieve or maintain viral suppression.1 Use
of PrEP, a key tool for HIV prevention, is disproportionately lower in racial/ethnic minorities, as well as people
who inject drugs. Factors related to structural racism and discrimination (SRD) may contribute to low rates of
adherence in these populations.2 New long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of PrEP/ART provide a potential
biomedical intervention to overcome adherence challenges, however, due to the prolonged subtherapeutic
period after LAI discontinuation, ensuring adherence is crucial. A peer-delivered reinforcement-based
intervention may be a promising solution for improving LAI adherence. Our team has developed through several
rounds of stakeholder feedback a peer-delivered behavioral activation and problem-solving intervention, Peer
Activate. Peer Activate focuses on problem-solving skills to improve adherence to ART and/or PrEP both at the
individual level and social/structural barriers to care (i.e., transportation, housing) and includes behavioral
activation to promote engagement in rewarding, substance-free activities in one's environment and structured
daily activities to promote treatment adherence. Delivery by a peer with formal training and shared lived
experiences enhances the impact of the intervention on SRD-related factors. However, Peer Activate has not
been evaluated in the context of LAI PrEP/ART. Preliminary Studies. This proposal builds upon our team's
prior studies demonstrating 1) our ability to engage patients with and at risk for HIV, facing multiple barriers due
to SRD, and provide LAI PrEP/ART in community-based settings; 2) the feasibility and acceptability of Peer
Activate and promise in improving HIV treatment adherence for people who use substances.; and 3) promise for
cost-effectiveness. Approach. We propose a randomized Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
(N=186) to test the effectiveness and implementation of Peer Activate for LAI PrEP/ART (“Peer Activate-LAI”)
vs. enhanced treatment as usual for a predominantly Black substance using population living with or at high risk
for HIV, evaluating the following over 12 months: (1) effectiveness: a) LAI PrEP/ART adherence (primary; receipt
of all 6 maintenance injections within 7-day window); b) substance use (secondary; urine toxicology, self-report);
c) SRD as moderators of effectiveness (exploratory); (2) Implementation of Peer Activate-LAI including
feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and adoption guided by RE-AIM and Proctor's model,9,10 assessed using mixed
methods, including a rapid ethnographic assessment of how SRD-related factors may affect implementation;
and (3) Economic viability of Peer Activate-LAI, including cost of implementation and sustainment and cost-
effectiveness from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Implications. This study will inform a potentially scalable,
cost-effective model for facilitating effective adherence to LAI formulations of ART/PrEP within Black, substance

Glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain cancer, remains uniformly fatal despite current
standard of care consisting of maximal safe surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation.
Glioblastoma is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, including the presence of therapeutically
resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that drive tumor recurrence after therapy. CSCs are greatly influenced by
cues received from the surrounding tumor microenvironment, but the results from studies on the role of direct
cell-cell communication through gap junctions in regulating GBM cell fate remain inconsistent. Gap junctions
have canonically been thought of as tumor suppressive due to frequent loss of connexin expression in tumor
cells. However, work from our laboratory and others now shows that connexins can also be tumor promoting in
CSCs in a context- and connexin subunit-specific manner. We have previously reported tumor-promoting roles
for connexin 46 (Cx46) in glioblastoma, Cx26 in triple-negative breast cancer, and Cx25 in leukemia. Here, in
preliminary data, we now show that glioblastoma CSCs from patient-derived xenografts in fact express higher
levels of Cx43 than Cx46, and Cx43 is required for their survival. Mechanistically, Cx43 is required to maintain
expression of MYC, a critical factor for CSCs. This relationship that has not previously been described.
Phosphorylation of the kinase WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) occurs downstream of Cx43 and is
also required for MYC expression. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that Cx43 activates WNK1
to maintain GBM CSC proliferation, survival, and self-renewal by driving gene expression of MYC. We will test
this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that Cx43 is required for
phosphorylation of WNK1 in an AKT-dependent manner and 2) test the hypothesis that the catalytic activity of
WNK1 is required for Cx43-mediated MYC expression. With these aims, we will continue to uncover a novel
Cx43-WNK1-MYC signaling axis. Due to the difficulty in specifically targeting connexin proteins, the long-term
goal of this project is to identify downstream signaling nodes that are amenable to targeting to develop new
therapeutic options for patients with glioblastoma."

As indicated by the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study, although women, on average, have a longer lifespan
than men, women typically experience worsened health outcomes as they age. Notably, postmenopausal women
have a higher incidence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and present with more severe disease progression over
time. However, it is still unclear whether these differences are genetic in nature, hormonal in nature, or a
combination of the two. Here, we propose to investigate whether and how changes in the chondrocyte
microenvironment—including soluble factors (Aim1) and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening (Aim2)—drive
KOA pathogenesis in a sex-, gender- and age-dependent manner. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will
mechanistically interrogate the direct role of soluble microenvironmental factors on the loss of cartilage
integrity with aging and according to sex. In Aim 2, we will interrogate the contribution of ECM biophysical
properties on the loss of cartilage integrity with aging and according to sex. We will accomplish these aims
using technically innovative approaches, including: (1) an in vitro and in vivo heterosex biofluid exchange
model, which will allow us to disentangle the multi-dimensional contribution of environmental factors on
chondrocyte health and cartilage integrity over time; (2) an advanced network medicine approach integrated
with machine learning algorithms to elucidate the sex chromosome- and sex hormone-dependent regulatory
landscape; and (3) a physiologically relevant model of female aging by which menopause is chemically-induced
in middle-aged mice. These conceptually and technically innovative studies will be carried out by an
interdisciplinary team comprising a stem cell biologist (PI), a computational biologist (co-PI), and a bioengineer
(co-I), the breadth of which enhances feasibility, impact, and likelihood for success. Successful completion of
the aims as proposed will provide mechanistic insights into how sex and gender profiles impact cartilage
physiology over time. Ultimately, we anticipate that the innovative research studies proposed will aid in the
development of effective interventions that consider sex- and gender-specific variables to the benefit of our
aging population."

Stimulation of beneficial neuroplasticity is a crucial component in promoting recovery from neurological diseases
or insults like spinal cord injury and stroke. Respiratory neuroplasticity, in the form of phrenic long-term facilitation
(pLTF), can be induced non-pharmacologically via acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH). However, it is abolished in
conditions of low circulating sex hormones or elevated systemic inflammation. At present, the interaction of sex
hormones, CNS inflammation, and mechanisms of neuroplasticity are not well understood. The long-term
objectives of this research are to understand the mechanism of microglial-mediated inflammation in cases of
reduced circulating estrogen. Our central hypothesis is that reduced levels of circulating estrogen provoke a
microglial-mediated increase in inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression in the spinal cord,
accompanied by altered microglial morphology, which inhibits plasticity. The hypothesis will be tested through
two specific aims. 1: Define the inflammatory cytokine signature of the ventral cervical spinal cord of
female rats across estradiol states. The approach for this aim will involve assessment of inflammatory-related
gene and protein changes in the ventral cervical spinal cord of female rats using quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and multi-color flow cytometry, respectively. Further, we will determine if
cytokine changes are driven by spinal microglia by assessing isolated microglia from ventral cervical spinal cords
of ovariectomized and naturally cycling female rats. 2: Determine the role of spinal cord microglia in
modulating the expression of phrenic neuroplasticity in states of reduced estradiol. The approach for this
aim will be to apply three dimensional Sholl analysis to cervical spinal cord segment images to allow
quantification of altered microglial morphology across low and high states of circulating estradiol. Multi-color flow
cytometry will be used to quantify microglial proliferation. Secondly, female rats will be treated with a CSF1R
inhibitor to transiently eradicate CNS microglial populations. AIH-induced pLTF will be measured via in vivo
phrenic neurophysiology. This proposed research will contribute to science by establishing the mechanistic role
and molecular signature of spinal microglia in inhibiting plasticity in states of low estradiol. These contributions
are expected to be significant in advancing neuroplasticity research because they will support the need to
account for sexual dimorphisms when designing and implementing novel neurotherapeutic interventions. The
proposed research is part of a fellowship training plan with extensive hands-on training and mentoring in technical
and professional research skills necessary to become an independent clinician-researcher. Primary research
activities and training will take place at the University of Minnesota Medical School with additional training at the
University of Wisconsin – Madison. The University of Minnesota’s strong foundation in research and the support
of the Rehabilitation Science graduate program will create an ideal environment for completing this training."
10979786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nonopioid analgesics are highly effective for pain management following most dental procedures, but data
suggest that prescription of opioids by dental clinicians is excessive. Prescription opioid misuse remains a
significant public health concern in the US, and ongoing opioid crisis has highlighted the need to optimize pain
management with non-addictive analgesics, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the forefront.
Numerous clinical trials have shown that NSAIDs are effective in the treatment of post-surgical pain following
third molar extraction. However, there is substantial inter-individual variability in the analgesic response, with
20-30% of patients requiring opioids in addition to NSAIDs to achieve adequate pain relief. The use of precision
medicine approaches to tailor analgesic therapy would enable oral surgeons to rationally prescribe opioids to
only those patients who require them and avoid unnecessary opioid prescriptions in those patients who can
achieve adequate pain relief with NSAIDs alone. However, the factors that contribute to heterogeneity in
analgesic response to NSAIDs and need for opioid rescue medication have not been well-studied, and there is
limited evidence to inform which patients should receive opioid prescriptions and how much should be
prescribed. The work proposed in this application will identify individual host factors associated with need for
opioid analgesics, in addition to NSAIDs, following third molar extraction. We will specifically investigate the role
of inter-individual differences in regulation of the acute inflammatory response to surgical trauma and seek to
identify an inflammatory response signature associated with need for opioid following third molar extraction. We
will also investigate the role of neutrophil subtypes in mediating heterogeneity in analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs.
Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs
may allow the identification of biomarkers that are predictive of response, thereby facilitating a precision medicine
approach to pain management. This work will provide a foundation for future clinical interventions to better
manage pain following third molar extraction, with the goal to limit opioid prescriptions to only those patients not
likely to respond adequately to NSAIDs."

Adverse pregnancy outcomes are a global issue that affects more than 50 million people per year. Infections
during gestation contribute significantly to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and neonatal
sepsis. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of ascending vaginal and
intrauterine infection during pregnancy. To initiate infection, GBS must colonize the vagina and initiate a robust
biofilm to turn the vaginal mucosa into a replicative niche. Subsequently, GBS ascends the reproductive tract in
an undefined process to invade the gestational membranes, cross the placenta, and infect the amniotic cavity
and the fetus. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against GBS to prevent its cognate disease
outcomes. However, epidemiological data has indicated that exposure to maternal breast milk is associated with
protection against GBS infection of the neonate. We have new and exciting data to suggest that components of
human breast milk, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), have antibiofilm activity against GBS. Given
this, we hypothesize that treatment with HMOs could lead to decreased GBS biofilm formation, colonization,
invasive infection cognate inflammation, microbiome disruption, and disease progression. We will test this by
determining the contribution of HMOs on bacterial and immunological responses in primary human placental
macrophages, an organ-on-a-chip infection model, ex vivo gestational membrane model, vaginal tissue models
and a mouse model of infection during pregnancy. This work will help us establish the efficacy of deployment of
prebiotic HMOs as a cost-effective dietary or chemotherapeutic strategy against GBS which may improve
pregnancy outcomes in vulnerable groups."

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and most patients are
refractory to currently available therapies. However, we have observed that sensory denervation slows or even
halts the progression from precancer stages to malignant disease in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma. This work contributed to a resurgence of interest in understanding the role of the
nervous system in cancer with the thought being that targeting nerves could be a novel way to improve
therapeutic efficacy. We have found that both sensory and sympathetic neurons express membrane bound
proteins recognized by immunologists as checkpoint proteins. Specific Aim 1 of this study will examine the impact
of sensory nerves on immune cell functions within the emerging tumor microenvironment, including the specific
contribution of neuronally expressed immune checkpoint proteins to tumor growth and immune responses.
Importantly, both sensory and sympathetic nerves have also been implicated in the development of secondary
lymphoid structures. In Specific Aim 2 of this study, we will evaluate changes in the innervation of draining lymph
nodes. We will examine whether changes in sensory and sympathetic innervation of the lymph nodes or neural
expression of checkpoint proteins contribute to a pro-tumorigenic immune response. We will also determine if
the lymph node innervating nerves are a therapeutic target and/or a prognostic biomarker. Finally, in Specific
Aim 3, we will evaluate whether combining chemotherapy or checkpoint therapy with interventions that directly
target peripheral nerves improves therapeutic efficacy. Overall these studies will provide essential information
about novel neuro-immune pathways that can be used to improve patient care."

Medicaid is an important source of health insurance for people with substance use disorder (SUD), currently
covering approximately one in ﬁve adults with SUD. States have increasingly contracted with Managed Care Or-
ganizations (MCOs) to administer services for their Medicaid population. They have also increasingly included,
or carved in, behavioral health services into MCO plans. As a result of these trends, 31 states and Puerto Rico
now enroll their Medicaid SUD population through MCOs. States determine, through a competitive procurement
process, whether to renew or to end contracts with MCOs operating in their state, and whether to contract with
new MCOs. Such MCO transitions may improve access and quality of care for Medicaid enrollees with SUD,
but they may also lead to service disruptions that can negatively affect uptake and continuity of care for this vul-
nerable population. Despite the importance of the MCO contracting process, little is known whether states are
successful in removing low-performing MCOs and selecting high-performing MCOs through the procurement
process, and what kind of state and MCO characteristics determine a successful procurement outcome.
In this application, we propose a mixed-methods study to examine the effects of MCOs entries and exits as a
result of the procurement process, and to explore factors at the state and MCO level that contribute to high-
performing MCOs being selected to operate in a state and low-performing MCOs being removed from a state's
Medicaid market. We will use the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files (TAF), a
national Medicaid data ﬁle, and collect information about the procurement process, MCO contracts, and per-
formance requirements through semi-structured interviews of experts and leaders from states' Medicaid agen-
cies and MCOs. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we will investigate the effects of MCO transitions
on provider networks (Aim 1) and quality of care as well as health care utilization (Aim 2). Our Aim 3 mixed-
methods analysis will bring together quantitative results with qualitative ﬁndings of MCO and state character-
istics to identify factors that can explain a more or less successful procurement process outcome. This policy-
relevant work will provide comprehensive evidence into how state Medicaid agencies can design their MCO pro-
curement and monitoring process to improve health care delivery for Medicaid enrollees with SUD."
10980408,"Project Summary
Abnormalities in cardiac energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in numerous
heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), diabetic cardiomyopathy, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, HFpEF, systolic and diastolic heart failure. The healthy heart has
metabolic flexibility, for example increasing fatty acid oxidation during fasting or increasing glucose oxidation
during exercise. In heart disease, there are changes in substrate selection and decreased metabolic flexibility
which precede contractile dysfunction.
 We propose to develop and translate hyperpolarized (HP) 13C-pyruvate MRI for evaluating metabolic
remodeling in heart disease. It can quantify metabolic fluxes from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA via pyruvate
dehydrogenase (glucose oxidation), and pyruvate to lactate conversion via lactate dehydrogenase for measuring
glycolysis/glucose oxidation coupling. No other non-invasive imaging can achieve this. Scanning is rapid, 1-2
minutes, which allows for multiple scans to measure metabolic flexibility under glucose and exercise challenges.
 In evaluating this technique, we will study HCM patients, the most common inherited cardiomyopathy with a
worldwide prevalence of ~1:250 and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes and otherwise
healthy, young individuals. HCM is a metabolic disease, and our pilot studies have demonstrated HP 13C-
pyruvate MRI visualizing metabolic remodeling in HCM patients. We propose the following specific aims:
1) Develop HP [1-13C]pyruvate MRI to assess metabolic flexibility and glycolysis-glucose oxidation coupling:
 scans after fasting and glucose load, rest and after handgrip exercise, and metabolism quantification methods
2) Translate into HCM patients, investigating correlations between metabolism and exercise capacity, substrate
 availability, and contractile reserve, as well as differences in HCM disease stage, genotype, and phenotype.
3) Examine the effect of 2 HCM treatments, namely recently FDA approved cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitors
 and exercise-training, on cardiac metabolic flexibility and glycolysis-glucose oxidation coupling, with HP 13C-
 pyruvate MRI scans at baseline and after 6-8 months of treatment.
4) Develop next-generation HP MRI methods, including refocused imaging methods to improve resolution/SNR,
 and [2-13C]pyruvate methods for interrogation of TCA cycle flux that is more directly coupled to fatty acid
 oxidation and reflects mitochondrial function. These will utilize fast acquisitions to freeze heart motion.
This translational imaging development will enable unprecedented individualized, regional and global profiles of
cardiac metabolism, allowing for preclinical detection, management, and prognosis of heart disease. There is an
immediate need for this in HCM, but the techniques developed have broad applicability and impact for examining
metabolic defects, abnormalities, and remodeling in heart diseases, with direct translation into the clinic."

Prevention of adolescent substance use (SU) and interventions to reduce harmful use has long been a goal of
NIDA in order to improve the health of individuals and lighten the societal burden of substance misuse.
Research from longitudinal observational studies is critical for establishing sufficient evidence that the target of
intervention could be a causal factor prior to developing and for fine-tuning interventions. This R21 responds to
a call (RFA-DA-22-038) to leverage data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study
to develop new and advanced statistical methods, in this case, to improve causal inference and inform
intervention target selection. We will develop and test a new model: a Discordant Sibling Random-Intercept
Cross-Lagged Panel Model (DS RI-CLPM) using data on several (child- and parent-driven) facets of parental
monitoring, a likely causal environmental factor for which there is strong extant evidence of an inverse
association with adolescent SU (aim 1). We will also (aim 2) explore the comparability of estimates from the
DS RI-CLPM model to standard RI-CLPM and DS models and other models to understand how the DS RI-
CLPM compares to current models, and (aim 3) conduct a series of simulation studies to explore power and
the minimum sample sizes needed to establish meaningful effects under various circumstances (i.e., effect
sizes, degree of sibling discordance). The initial products of this R21 will include: 1) openly available code to fit
the DS RI-CLPM model in tutorial form, 2) publications explaining the interpretation and utility of the model,
and 3) publications of simulation studies explicating power, sample size, and other (i.e., model specification)
considerations of the model. The expected end-users are twofold: This model can be used by any researcher
interested in testing a stricter model of causality for their focal associations using large-scale, longitudinal data
that includes twins and/or siblings, many of which are publicly available (e.g., ABCD, Add Health, harmonized
data from the NIH Environment in Child Health Outcomes initiative, Twins Early Development Sample).
Second, we have formed an advisory board of intervention experts to help guide our analyses, sensitivity
analyses, presentation, and dissemination of findings to aid in translation of these findings to ongoing work in
the intervention and prevention of adolescent SU. Through discussions with our advisory board, we expect that
scientists who develop and test interventions will find results from this model of use. By subjecting multiple
aspects of key malleable constructs to this model, we will provide intervention scientists with more detailed
information about the likelihood of causal links and key targets for future interventions. A longer-term product of
this R21 will be an R01 grant submission exploring the generalizability of this model (and the standard RI-
CLPM and standard DS design) to intervention samples (extant data provided by members of our advisory
board). Combined with results from this R21, the planned R01 is expected to yield critical information about
how and when nationally representative longitudinal data are more and less informative for interventions."
10979704,"This proposed research aims to investigate the emergence and transmission of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the Republic of Moldova, which has one of the most severe MDR-TB epidemics in the world. The study will focus on the transmission of two specific lineages of MDR-TB, the Beijing lineage and the Ural lineage, which we have identified as major drivers of the MDR-TB epidemic in Moldova. Our recent genomic epidemiology research in Moldova has revealed that several large transmission clusters of Beijing-lineage and one large cluster of Ural-lineage MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are currently spreading in the country. These lineages have different geographic distributions, with the transmission of multiple Beijing clades focused predominantly within the eastern region of Transnistria, while the Ural clade is more diffusely spread throughout the rest of the country. At this time, we have neither a sufficiently precise estimate of the speed by which each of these clades has grown and spread nor a clear understanding of the distinct genetic mechanisms favoring emergence and spread of these two MDR lineages. 

The first aim of this proposal is to compare the evolution and expansion of Beijing and Ural Mtb lineages in Moldova since 2010, using isolates and data systematically collected from all culture-positive patients prior to TB treatment. This will allow us to estimate the speed at which these two lineages have become prevalent in the population and to investigate how specific mutations accumulated within these lineages may contribute to their apparent evolutionary success. The second aim is to quantify and compare the transmission of these lineages using data collected during investigations of known contacts of TB patients in Moldova. This will allow us to estimate the relative reproductive potential of these lineages. The final aim is to develop transmission dynamic models to estimate the health impact and costs associated with interventions to interrupt MDR-TB transmission. These models will help to inform public health policy and guide resource allocation for MDR-TB control efforts in Moldova.

This research addresses a significant public health crisis of transmitted MDR-TB using innovative phylogenomic, phylogeographic, regression and transmission modeling approaches. Our long-term partnership with investigators in Moldova ensures access to a unique longitudinal collection of Mtb isolates and associated clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data. The ~2000 Mtb whole genome sequences, extensions to analytical tools for inferring transmission and estimating the relationship between bacterial and host factors and transmission, and transmission dynamic models developed during this project will be made freely available to other researchers to ensure maximum use of the data and methods generated during this project."
10980021,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is a central metabolic pathway of great physiological relevance to human health
and disease. FAO provides fuel for energy production, generates building blocks for the biosynthesis of many
cellular molecules, detoxifies damaging lipids, and produces key signaling molecules. Disruption of this pathway
contributes to fatty liver disease, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and
chronic kidney disease. Importantly, many fatty acids that ultimately are catabolized by FAO are not compatible
with FAO until they have first been modified by other enzymes. These lipids include the 4-hydroxy fatty acids (4-
HAs)—fatty acids that possess an oxidized carbon adjacent to the third, or β, position. Recent analyses
empowered by advances in mass spectrometry have revealed a wide range of 4-HAs and 4-HA precursors in
human plasma, which can originate from dietary intake, lipid peroxidation, and certain drugs of abuse. Prior
analyses in liver revealed that 4-HAs are indeed processed by FAO once they are converted to compatible
substrates. However, the enzymes responsible for this conversion are unknown, and the physiological relevance
of these lipids is largely unexplored. Recently, we identified two atypical, highly uncharacterized FAO-related
enzymes, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 10 and 11 (ACAD10 and ACAD11), that appear capable of processing 4-
HAs into FAO-friendly substrates via a novel mechanism. The long-term goals of this proposal are to define the
roles of ACAD10 and ACAD11 in the catabolism of 4-HAs and to establish the metabolic ramifications that result
from the disruption of these enzymes. We first aim to establish the specific biochemical reactions catalyzed by
ACAD10 and ACAD11 in vitro through enzymology and structural biology approaches. We hypothesize that
these ACADs employ their unique kinase domain, which is not found in other ACADs, to phosphorylate the 4-
hydroxy position as part of their enzymatic mechanism. We then aim to establish the cellular locations and
activities of each enzyme via microscopy and metabolite tracing studies. We hypothesize that ACAD10 is a
mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the conversion of shorter-chain 4-HAs and that ACAD11 is a peroxisomal
enzyme that converts longer-chain 4-HAs. Last, we aim to reveal the physiological ramifications of ACAD10 and
ACAD11 disruptions in worms, mice, and humans. Notably, ACAD10 and ACAD11 have putative links to
T2DM/insulin resistance, kidney disease, and coronary artery disease via GWAS studies, including in the Akimel
O’odham (Pima Indian) tribe, and mouse models have linked ACAD10 and ACAD11 collectively to insulin
resistance, weight gain, ectopic lipid deposition, and rhabdomyolysis; however, none of these have been studied
directly. We hypothesize that the loss of these enzymes in mice, or the expression of specific ACAD10 variants
in Pima Indians, will result in the accumulation of plasma 4-HAs concomitant with the development of metabolic
complications. Overall, this work aims to establish a fundamental new piece to our understanding of cellular FAO
metabolism and to forge new links between a large, unexplored class of fatty acids and mammalian physiology."
10980911,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary Embolism (PE) urgently requires improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to minimize both
acute complications resulting in hemodynamic shock and late complications encompassing possible progressive
pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension, and recurrent PE. Currently, fibrinolysis therapy of all PE does not provide an
overall net clinical benefit due to the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and fatal bleeding, aside from the
potential for unsuccessful fibrinolysis. To more accurately stratify and prognose intermediate-risk and low-risk
PE patients, a detailed understanding of the consequences of emboli composition, including its age, burden,
relevant cellular components, and post-PE inflammatory milieu, is needed. To address these unmet needs, this
proposal will utilize a novel murine model of PE in which the thrombi are formed in vivo in the deep veins of mice.
This model allows for direct control over thrombus age and size and the inclusion of the biological milieu during
thrombogenesis and aging. These thrombi are then embolized into the lung, resulting in PE. This model has
demonstrated a resident time of these emboli to be greater than 30 days, unlike previous published murine
models with emboli residence times up to 48 hours. To investigate the inflammatory and fibrotic response to PE
insult, we will utilize noninvasive longitudinal multiplexed molecular imaging evaluating specific agents for
neutrophils, macrophages, platelets, activated endothelial, epithelial, fibroblasts, type 1 collagen, and thrombin
activity. Translationally, we will quantify fibrin changes in various aged emboli pre- and post-fibrinolysis therapy
and its downstream effects on PE-induced inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Uniquely, this PE model allows
for the application of single nucleus molecular profiling across the proposal to examine the differences in
molecular signatures, cell composition, and cell-cell interactions associated with lung lobes with PE and those
lobes without PE from the same lung. This is important in uncovering the effects of PE-induced inflammation and
fibrosis that may drive the development of late PE sequelae, such as CTEPH and pulmonary hypertension.
Clinically translational imaging readouts tracking pulmonary artery pressures and right heart function in relation
to emboli size, age, and location will be correlated. Completion of the proposed work will provide a longitudinal
understanding of the influence of emboli age and size will be reported. Translation of these results may help
stratify PE beyond the acute high-low risk. It may help identify patients at a higher risk for late PE syndrome or
recurrent PE and highlight the usefulness of molecular imaging in the clinic, allowing for more bench-to-bedside
translation of preclinical molecular imaging agents."
10980962,"The goals of this project are to identify strategies to improve the integration of genomic testing, reporting, and
use into the clinical workflow of patient care. Over the last decade, we have acquired the infrastructure and
expertise to support genetic testing, reporting, alerting, educating, and returning results. We will now leverage
our past accomplishments and our genomics-enabled learning health system (gLHS) to share implementation
strategies, conduct two selected intervention projects network-wide and evaluate their impact, and share gLHS
tools and resources that can be broadly adopted. To facilitate this work, we are proposing two pragmatic
randomized stepped wedge clinical trials: one focused on implementing DPYD testing and one on APOL1
testing. In patients receiving fluoropyrimidine chemotherapies, DPYD testing and genetic-guided dose
adjustments reduce the severe toxicities caused by these drugs. In many other countries, DPYD testing is
standard of care; in the US, it is beginning to be used in some clinics, but needs additional leadership and
effective strategies to overcome the barriers and facilitate broad adoption. APOL1 variants contribute to the
development and progression of chronic kidney disease and disparate outcomes in patients with African
ancestry. APOL1 testing, together with joint decision making with the patient and provider, helps to manage risk
factors that contribute to poor chronic kidney disease outcomes. These trials represent two distinct genetic tests
and disciplines of medicine, are tests that are ready for broad implementation, can be implemented in most
health care systems, and address disparate healthcare outcomes. The two proposed clinical trials will serve as
a platform to implement innovative solutions to drive genomic medicine uptake. We propose that an initial set of
solutions would reasonably include EHR-based clinical decision support, educating providers, simplifying genetic
test ordering, and streamlining processes to improve insurance reimbursement rates. Following the initial
implementation, we will evaluate the success of the strategies and refine and integrate additional improvements
in two subsequent rounds of iterative implementation. In order to fully accommodate the selected projects, our
implementation team includes experts in genetics, counseling, informatics, pharmacology, bioethics, learning
health systems, economics, implementation science and many disciplines of medicine that have a productive
track record of working together. Our previous implementation work has led to the identification and resolution
of many barriers to genomic medicine. The insights gained from our learning health system, provider and patient
feedback, informatics analyses, workflow logistics, and laboratory challenges provide initial basis for our initial
interventions; they will also provide immediate strategies for other health care systems to learn from our
experience. Upon completion of these trials, we expect to have developed more effective strategies that will
expand genomic medicine adoption from the current boutique clinics out to mainstream and diverse clinics and
will minimize disparate outcomes across many life-threatening diseases."
10981606,"SUMMARY
This proposal will elucidate how an understudied uropathogen – Pseudomonas aeruginosa – establishes
acute infection and will determine whether age influences infection establishment and persistence.
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most prevalent urologic diseases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts
for ~3 million UTI annually, a number that matches Pseudomonas lung and wound infections. Yet, while the
pathogenesis of Pseudomonas in the lung and wound have been – and continue to be – thoroughly investigated,
there has been minimal study of the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bladder. Moreover,
Pseudomonas infections tend to occur in older individuals and afflict males and females equally. With this
proposed work we aim to innovate by assigning a molecular signature that defines uropathogenic Pseudomonas
and elucidating host and pathogen determinants that favor tropism of this pathogen to the aging population.
Rationale and Hypothesis: All prior work on understanding Pseudomonas UTIs has been performed using
model Pseudomonas strains isolated from wounds in the 1950’s. Given that the Pseudomonas genome is “open”,
meaning that there is vast genomic variability among strains, we hypothesized that distinct pathogen genomic
features exist in uropathogenic Pseudomonas isolates. Indeed, our isolation and sequencing of 96 uropathogenic
isolates and subsequent genomic comparisons with a global cohort of 700 sequenced strains revealed specific
genomic differences in one respiratory complex, ccoN between uropathogenic and other isolates. Based on
preliminary data that demonstrate Pseudomonas enters the urothelial cell, we postulate that the
identified ccoN mutations increase respiratory potential during acute infection. Moreover, we posit that
host features in the aging bladder may influence uropathogenic Pseudomonas respiration, favoring its
tropism for infecting older individuals. We propose two aims to test the posed hypotheses.
Aims: Aim 1 will define how CcoN contributes to respiration within the bladder epithelial environment. In
collaboration with the Dietrich group, we will create a series of specific mutations in CcoN in uropathogenic and
respiratory Pseudomonas strains and compare their ability to adhere, invade and consume oxygen within the
host cell cytosol. Aim 2 will determine the steps in pathogenesis followed by Pseudomonas in young versus old
bladders. In parallel, differences in the immune response to infection will be measured in the old and young mice.
Impact/How will the work change the field? These studies are the first to indicate a unique molecular signature
that may be defining uropathogenic Pseudomonas. Evaluating the contribution of this signature to establishment
and energy metabolism in vivo will provide significant insights into the kinetics of UTI caused by Pseudomonas.
Understanding how pathogen genomic features may influence infection as a function of age, has the potential to
change how Pseudomonas infections are mitigated in the elderly population, by guiding the development of quick
diagnostic tools and identifying modifiable host factors that can be modulated to prevent or control infection."

clinical centers of the NIDDK NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN). It has three specific aims that are aligned

retain adult and pediatric subjects in the NAFLD Database 3 (DB3) study to support execution, analysis and
publication of data to address unmet needs in the field. We will continue enrollment and follow up of participants
in the NAFLD Database 3 (DB3) cohort study with collection of bio-samples and clinical data according to the

the ongoing vitamin E dose ranging study of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD),
previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We are close to completing recruitment and
expect to meet our enrollment goals by the end of the current funding cycle and have 100% retention in the
study. Specific aim 3 is to leverage the transcriptomic dataset generated as part of the NASH CRN ancillary
study linked to the CRN database-2 study to validate molecular subclasses of MASLD and their relationship to
disease course and outcomes. It builds on our previously published findings that there are distinct transcriptomic
profiles within patients with similar histological severity of MASH. Specifically, we will generate novel data on
their relationship to histological progression of disease and in those with advanced fibrosis, relate them to time
to decompensation and clinical outcomes. A key focus will be to evaluate metabo-inflammation, accelerated
aging and fibrogenesis related pathways to disease progression and outcomes. The proposed studies will be
highly significant and impact the field as follows: (1) improved understanding of disease evolution including bi-
directional interactions in liver and other metabolic dysfunction associated end-organ disease and impact of
social and economic determinants of health, (2) acceleration of regulatory qualification of non-invasive tests for
clinical use via collaboration with the FNIH NIMBLE project, (3) validation of spleen stiffness measurements and
development of other biomarkers, (4) novel insights on disease heterogeneity via the proposed transcriptomic
studies and (5) generating foundational data to support future applications for a fully powered trial of vitamin E
for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The VCU and Emory clinical centers have played
a robust role in advancing the mission of the NASH CRN and are fully committed to the proposed requirements
of the RFA and have the resources to complete the proposed studies. As encouraged by the RFA, we are also
collaborating with both internal and external partners to fully leverage the data resources of the CRN. Together,
these provide a rationale for the fourth competitive renewal of the VCU and Emory clinical centers of the CRN."
10987600,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Current AAV-based methods to target inhibitory interneurons, and their subpopulations,
remain too leaky to use with recombinases such as Cre. Furthermore, the specificity of the widely used CaMKII
minipromoter to access excitatory neurons also displays off-target expression. The long-term goal of this project
is to develop ultra-specific AAVs that can overcome leakage into non-target cells and therefore be compatible
with recombinase enzymes. The overall objective of this application is to develop and test hybrid AAVs that
harness alternative splicing, through splicing linked expression design (SLED), in combination with current state-
of-the-art minipromoters and enhancers. The central hypothesis is that this hybrid approach will increase target
specificity, enabling the delivery of recombinases like Cre. The rationale for the project is to generate and share
novel tools to speed up basic science research and reduce the reliance on knockin and transgenic Cre lines to
target distinct populations of neurons. Increasing the specificity of AAVs would also benefit future gene therapy
interventions, where highly controlled gene expression is essential. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two specific aims: 1) Design and rigorously evaluate the ability of miniaturized enhancer-SLED hybrid
constructs to deliver Cre with increased specificity; and 2) Generate sequencing datasets from subcortical brain
regions to uncover cell type-specific splicing events. Under the first aim, cell-specific exons for inhibitory
interneurons (INs), parvalbumin positive interneurons (PV-INs), and excitatory neurons (ENs) will be identified
and utilized to make hybrid SLED AAVs with existing minipromoters or enhancers. These AAVs will be screened
in vitro, then leading candidates will be thoroughly tested in vivo in mice to rigorously evaluate their specificity.
For the second aim, the RiboTag technology will be used to isolate bulk RNA samples from ENs and PV-INs from
the amygdala and thalamus, allowing high depth RNA sequencing to map patterns of cell and region-specific
alternative splicing. This will enable integration with published cortical and hippocampal datasets so that region-
specific alternative splicing patterns can be identified. This will further a basic scientific understanding of
alternative splicing and support the future development of SLED vectors targeting subcortical cell populations
relevant to psychiatric disease. The proposed research is innovative because it combines SLED with the leading
enhancer and minipromoter technologies to create hybrid AAV constructs predicted to achieve a level of
specificity beyond what is possible with each individual approach. This proof of principle experiment could open
new horizons for the subpopulations of cells that can be targeted genetically. Furthermore, this research project
will generate a valuable dataset tailored to comparing alternative splicing across cell types and brain regions.
This is necessary because single cell RNA sequencing experiments, while invaluable, rarely have the
sequencing depth needed to detect alternative splice variants. The tools and datasets generated and shared in
this project promise broad utility both within and beyond the field of neuroscience."

The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is staggeringly high in the United States, and it is expected to
exponentially increase in the next few decades. Regulating health behavior that leads to T2DM is a key factor
that can slow the down prevalence of T2DM and decrease any complications resulting from T2DM.
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is one of the evidence-based approaches that providers can wield before
considering more expensive and invasive methods. MI is a counseling technique, involving empathy and evoking
“change talk” by the patient, that aims to resolve the ambivalence that prevents clients from realizing personal
goals. Together with the patient, the MI-trained provider can illicit the patients' hesitancy of unhealthy behaviors
that increase the severity of T2DM and eventually improve the patients' health outcomes and lifestyle. Research
has shown that MI is effective in modifying some of the health behaviors that relate to T2DM severity (e.g.,
regulation of sugar-sweetened beverages consumption and promoting physical activity). However, behavior
change counseling is rarely implemented in clinical practice.
The use of speech interfaces in devices have been increasing used by consumers over the last few years.
Coupled with advancements in intelligence-based dialogue methods, software agents can automate dialogue
exchanges between machine and users, and could engage users using human language and conversational
turns. If we could automate the counseling experience through a speech-based dialogue system we could
delegate the task counseling task and overcome some of the challenges to implement MI – training, consistency,
reimbursements, and lack of time.
The researchers presume that we can model and emulate the MI counseling method for machines to enact
conversations to evoke patients' ambivalence of harmful health behaviors surrounding sugar-sweetened
beverages and encourage light physical activity. In addition, we posit that motivational interviewing experts and
end users who have diabetes or pre-diabetes can positively assess the usability of our software agent (“app”),
code named “TROI”, to preform MI counseling for our use-cases.
This project aims to develop comprehensive ontology models (i.e., the knowledge base for machine
interaction) for motivational interviewing for counseling diabetic-related behavior. This will involve
conducting simulation of MI counseling to help us analyze and understand the method to translate it to a
computer-based model (ontology) and integrate that model towards the development of “TROI”. Lastly, we intend
to evaluate the automated counseling experience by the ontology-based computer agent. This will involve
recruiting MI experts to assess the integrity of MI counseling and the recruitment of diabetic patients to assess
their receptiveness of the tool."

The burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiometabolic disease, is increasing globally,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). NCDs are responsible for an estimated 35% of all
deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, and in Mozambique nearly 60% of all DALYs are attributable to NCDs and injury.
The prevalence of hypertension (HTN) and type II diabetes (T2D) are on the rise, from 33.1% in 2005 to 38.9%
in 2015 for HTN and 2.9% to 7.4% for T2D across the same period. Effective strategies to meet the growing
disease burden that can be integrated into – and scaled through – health systems and disease-specific platforms,
like those for HIV, are needed. Similarly, little information exists on effective, population-based primordial
prevention of cardiometabolic in LMIC community-based settings, including efforts to intervene in the relationship
between an individual's environment, health behaviors, and risk factors for HTN and T2D. In recent years, several
implementation research studies have applied the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) to
optimize care cascades for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission (R01HD0757; PI: Sherr), addressing
HTN among people with HIV (SAIA-HTN, R01HL142412, PI: Gimbel; SCALE SAIA-HTN, 1UG3HL156390-
01/UH3HL156390,PI: Mocumbi/Gimbel), and to pilot T2D care optimization within facilities where SAIA-HTN has
been implemented, coupled with food environment assessments and Citizen Science-based nutritional
education modules in three institutional cafeterias. This F31 proposal will leverage the data gathered under these
studies to conduct formative research to characterize determinants for effective implementation of integrated
care for T2D, HTN, and HIV embedded within ongoing health systems strengthening efforts in public sector
facilities in Mozambique. We will also conduct pilot research to determine possible associations between
community-based participatory education modules and changes in diet. We will evaluate barriers, facilitators,
and organizational readiness to deliver medical services for T2D alongside integrated HTN and HIV services
(Aim 1), leveraging qualitative data gathered through interviews and focus group discussions among
stakeholders in two Mozambican health facilities and organizational readiness for implementing change (ORIC)
assessments. In Aim 2, we will leverage data collected in food intake questionnaires administered under the
parent study to assess the presence of longitudinal or dose-response relationships between exposure to
community education modules and food intake. This formative research will contribute to scarce evidence for
effective systems approaches to treat and prevent cardiometabolic disease in LMICs. This research plan will
provide the F31 candidate rigorous predoctoral training including 1) application of implementation science
frameworks for qualitative research, 2) development of participatory research methods, and 3) advanced
statistical analyses using quantitative data for implementation science."
10986188,"SUMMARY: Traumatic Axonal Injury: Tau and Amyloid Pathogenesis in vitro.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease/ Alzheimer’s disease related
dementias (AD/ADRD) and TBI-related neurodegeneration (TReND). TReND comprises multiple pathologies,
many of which are commonly observed in AD/ADRD, including tau and amyloid-beta (Ab) deposition. Traumatic
axonal injury (TAI), one of the most common and important pathologies of TBI, appears to be a key source of
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and Ab formation acutely after TBI. Our previous data indicates that TAI induces
immediate mechanical breaking of axonal microtubules (MTs) leading to detachment and phosphorylation of the
primary MT stabilizing protein, tau. Preliminary data suggests that p-tau quickly accumulates in axonal swellings
and then is ‘missorted’ to the neuronal soma by way of a shortened axonal initial segment (AIS). We hypothesize
that this may be a key event initiating the somatodendritic accumulation of p-tau and eventual formation of
neurofibrillary tangles. However, since this appears to be a programmed response to injury, we alternatively
hypothesize that this process may represent a protective mechanism by removing high concentrations of p-tau
from damaged axons. Original efforts from our group have also demonstrated that TAI induces the rapid and
massive generation of Ab. In TBI, amyloid precursor protein accumulates in axonal swellings where secretases
cleave it into Ab. With axon degeneration, the release of Ab has been linked with rapid tissue deposition and
formation of diffuse Ab plaques in individuals within hours of TBI. We recently found that the most abundant
amino acid in axons, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a powerful inhibitor of Ab aggregation at normal physiological
levels. We therefore hypothesize that decreased NAA concentration observed in TAI permits greater Ab genesis
in axons that fosters Ab oligomer to fibril formation. Accordingly, it is curious why the ingredients and conditions
for Ab genesis and aggregation coalesce in injured axons. We hypothesize that beyond potential toxic effects,
the process of Ab generation in injured axons may have evolved to play protective or reparative roles in TAI. We
propose to use our well-characterized in vitro TAI model that induces dynamic stretch injury to micropatterned
axon tracts to, 1) Characterize the evolution of p-tau accumulation and missorting after TAI, and its interplay with
MT instability, and 2) identify evolving Aβ processing after TAI and the effects of endogenous Aβ depletion and
blockade of its aggregation on axon outcomes. These proposed studies will identify initiating mechanisms of p-
tau and Aβ genesis and metabolism in axons, which may have broad implications for understanding early events
that lead to TReND and AD/ADRD."
10986589,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States (US), it is recommended to not use cannabis during pregnancy or while breastfeeding
(referred to as “perinatal cannabis use”) because use during pregnancy has been associated with negative
parental-child outcomes. Also, tetrahydrocannabinol (the principal psychoactive component of cannabis) can
be transferred through breastfeeding. Yet, rates of use as well as perception of cannabis safety are increasing
within the pregnant population. Further, a subset of perinatal people persist in use despite knowledge of the
risks. Medical providers in the US are thus advised to educate and counsel patients about perinatal cannabis
use. This counseling can be particularly complex for patients who are unable or unwilling to entirely discontinue
use even once educated about the risks. However, medical providers currently lack the training support
needed for effectively engaging in discussions about perinatal cannabis use. Harm reduction strategies, which
aim to reduce the negative effects of health behaviors without necessarily discontinuing those behaviors
entirely, have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting health for individuals using substances. Taking a harm
reduction approach to discussing perinatal cannabis use with patients would involve delivering education and
counseling about modifiable risk factors related to cannabis use in a way that aligns with philosophical
principles of harm reduction (e.g., respect for patient autonomy). Despite multiple calls for harm reduction
strategies, such as in the National Institute on Drug Abuse's priority area #2, medical providers in the US have
not adopted a harm reduction approach towards the discussion of perinatal cannabis use with patients. The
proposed study will address this gap by utilizing implementation science methodology to create a toolkit that
enables US provider adoption of a harm reduction approach to the discussion of perinatal cannabis use. A key
feature of this toolkit will be a Canadian evidence-based practice resource on harm reduction for perinatal
cannabis use that we will adapt for a US audience. The study will involve key informants (providers, patients,
and leaders in healthcare and public health) in the creation of this toolkit to ensure that it matches the needs
“on the ground”. The study will take the following steps to build this toolkit: 1) conduct a core components
analysis of the Canadian practice resource, 2) hold interviews with stakeholders to assess: a) understanding of
harm reduction, b) determinants of adopting a harm reduction approach to perinatal cannabis use, and c)
needed adaptions of the Canadian practice resource for a US audience, and 3) bring together information from
the analysis and interviews to create a toolkit to support adoption of a harm reduction approach to US provider
discussion of perinatal cannabis use. This toolkit will be prototyped, presented to providers for feedback, and
refined in accordance with the feedback. In a future hybrid type II R01 study, the toolkit will be tested on its
ability to: 1) impact frequency of discussion and provider skill in discussing perinatal cannabis use, and 2)
increase US provider adoption of a harm reduction approach to the discussion of perinatal cannabis use."
10990456,"Project Summary
Animals and humans display a vast repertoire of behaviors, many of which are generated by motor
networks in the spinal cord. This coordinated spinal motor activity is strongly regulated by descending
motor control pathways and sensory afferent feedback. Sensory feedback is essential for both
stereotypical protective reflexes, such as limb withdrawal, and for regulating ongoing motor behaviors,
such as walking, running, and reaching. Interestingly, many descending motor control pathways converge
on interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord that transmit sensory information, indicating a prominent role for
these cells in motor control. Currently, very little is known about how sensorimotor networks in the spinal
cord are organized at a cellular level. Efforts proposed here will use cutting-edge genetic manipulations
and sensitive behavioral assays to deconstruct the cellular composition and synaptic connectivity of these
sensorimotor circuits. The goals of this study are to functionally define the neuronal cell types that make
up the sensorimotor circuitry and to generate a connectivity map that can then be used to construct a
working model of how the sensorimotor circuitry is organized. Intersectional mouse genetics will be used
to target specific populations of spinal neurons and ask whether inactivating or activating them with
chemogenetic and optogenetic reporters perturbs specific sensorimotor pathways, including those that
generate corrective behaviors during ongoing movement and noxious mechanical pathways that induce
protective reflexes. Studies of protective and corrective reflexes will be complemented with an analysis of
the sensory circuitry for the control of forelimb reaching and grasping behaviors. These studies, when
completed, will provide new insights into the organization of the spinal reflex circuitry, and improve our
understanding of the cellular computations that underlie sensorimotor transformation in the spinal cord."

This application requests funds to acquire specialized laboratory mouse housing systems- Digital Ventilated
Caging (DVC) designed to initiate a new generation of husbandry, breeding colony and animal welfare
management, and research data acquisition. The requested equipment will improve NKI’s animal housing by
establishing an ability for 24-hour remote monitoring of the cage microenvironment, promoting health, less
disturbance of cage inhabitants, and normal baseline behavior and physiology, conditions necessary to
produce more accurate animal models in brain-and-behavior studies. Such models, which, at NKI, aim at
understanding the molecular basis of normal and diseased states, also have improved translational usefulness,
including the development of early diagnostic and treatment abilities. Long-term monitoring of the behavior
and activity of mice in their natural environment using non-intrusive methods in their home cages can better
reveal their behavior and activity in their natural environment. Using home cage monitoring devices to track
the activity levels of mice, researchers can evaluate phenotypic expression of inserted or deleted genes as well
as the effectiveness of interventions, such as exercise and pharmaceutical treatments, on activity levels and all
while improving overall general health and husbandry. The DVC systems, as a shared resource, will be used to
provide GEM (genetically modified mice) models for multiple studies supported by funding from the NIH,
Alzheimer’s Association, Jerome LeJeune Foundation, New Vision Research, the Dr. Ralph and Marian Falk
Medical Research Trust, and the Templeton World Charity Foundation. Upgrading and modernizing animal
caging systems along with continued Institutional funding for facility improvements further the NKI animal care

10999222,"PROJECT ABSTRACT (Application submitted in response to NOSI NOT-CA-21-100)
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) with peritoneal metastases (PM) has evolved from a terminal
diagnosis to a condition treatable through cytoreductive surgery. Observed in up to 10-15% of
patients undergoing surgery for CRC and ultimately seen in up to 35% of patients with CRC,
cytoreductive surgery has revolutionized the treatment of patients with CRC-PM. A critical factor
predictive of oncologic outcomes after a cytoreductive surgery is the completeness of
cytoreduction; failure to do so is associated with earlier recurrence and poor survival. Current
methods of detection during surgery rely on visual and tactile inspection, posing challenges in
achieving complete cytoreduction. There is a critical need for improved methods of cancer
detection and treatment in the surgical setting.
 In response, new approaches such as in-vivo macroscopic immunohistochemical staining
using tumor-targeting fluorescent dyes for fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) are in
development. FIGS helps identify tumor deposits, but its effectiveness is limited to surgically
removable lesions. Another approach, targeted photoimmunotherapy (PIT), combines a
phototoxic fluorophore with an anti-tumor targeting antibody to both identify and treat lesions. A
lead target for PIT is CEA, as it is specifically overexpressed in many gastrointestinal cancers,
especially CRC. An ideal candidate for this approach is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a well-
studied tumor-marker overexpressed in many gastrointestinal cancers, particularly CRC. Its
specificity makes CEA an ideal target for our innovative approach, combining targeted
photoimmunotherapy (PIT) with fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS).
 Leveraging my expertise in fluorescence and surgery to develop theranostic approaches
along with a strong mentorship team, I propose to conduct a series of initial studies to determine
efficacy of PIT for FIGS and immune activation using CEA as the target. I hypothesize that a
humanized antibody targeting CEA (M5A) conjugated to the phototoxic fluorophore
(IRDye700DX) can effectively label CEA-expressing CRC for FIGS and upon NIR light activation,
induce phototoxic tumor-cell lysis, and elicit a cell-mediated immune response. This novel
approach aims to enhance surgical precision, offer local therapy in surgically challenging areas,
and potentially activate therapeutic immune responses. It could transform an immunosuppressive
microenvironment into an immune-activated one, significantly improving patient outcomes in
CRC-PM with minimal side effects and potential immune activation."
10999295,"The National Eye Institute estimates that in the United States there are presently over 1 million legally
blind people and this number will increase to about 4 million by 2050. According to the VA Office of Blind
Rehabilitation Services, there are approximately 130,000 US Veterans who are legally blind and more than one
million who have lost the ability to perform daily tasks because of low vision. Some of these people can be
helped by relatively simple and inexpensive devices such as magnifiers and canes. However, with more severe
vision loss, people are likely to experience loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Blindness has a
major impact on Veterans and others, as evidenced by the fact that over 70% of working-age people with
significant visual impairment are unemployed.
 While there are causes of blindness that can be readily corrected, in many cases there is no effective
treatment. One solution is to restore vision by surgically placing electrodes in the retina or visual cortex and
electrically stimulating the brain based on the light level recorded by a head-mounted camera. Systems of this
type are being developed and they have great potential. However, there are downsides to the implanted
systems that include the risks of surgery, high cost, and a form of vision that is severely limited compared to
normal perception. There is also a wide array of devices and smartphone apps that perform specialized
functions (text readers, obstacle detectors, color identifiers).
 The goal of the proposed research is to develop and test a new type of visual assistive device, named
AEyes, for individuals with blindness and low vision. It takes advantage of recent advances in artificial
intelligence including computer vision, machine learning, optical character recognition, speech recognition, and
3D sound rendering to give the user the ability to recognize, localize, and interact with objects and people in
their vicinity. In other words, the AI technology that can benefit people with low vision already exists and it will
be implemented in a device tailored to the needs of people with visual disorders. The system will be intuitive
and easy to learn and interact with as it understands spoken instructions and it speaks to the user. AEyes has
been developed based on a needs-analysis and feedback from focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and
prototype tests with Veterans conducted at the VA Providence Healthcare System.
 Aim 1 concerns device development. The system architecture and algorithms are largely implemented
and functional, but a range of refinements to the software and the integration of separate functional modules
into the overall system are needed. These improvements include upgrading to a higher resolution camera,
retraining the recognition neural network, and integrating the face recognition, hand tracking, and voice
recognition modules into the central architecture.
 Aim 2 consists of device tests that will be conducted with subjects having a range of low vision
conditions that include no light sense, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic
retinopathy. The tests to be conducted include the ability of a user to recognize and localize people, reach for
and grasp objects, read text on handheld paper, computer displays, and signs, and train the system to
recognize new people. Comparing performance with residual vision alone and with the addition of AEyes will
establish the device’s effectiveness as a visual assistant and indicate where improvements are needed."

Black and Latinx sexual minority men (BLSMM) in the Bronx, NY and in the U.S. overall are among the
populations most impacted by HIV in both Bronx, NY and in the U.S. BLSMM are impacted by multiplel
barriers, including medical mistrust, multiple stigmas, and limited health care access, which intersect to
cumulatively increase HIV risk and negatively impact access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Improving
access to and use of PrEP requires care delivery strategies tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of
BLSMM. There is broad consensus that addressing disparities impacting BLSMM and ending the HIV epidemic
requires creative, community-engaged, participatory approaches. One such approach is system dynamics
modeling, an action research methodology to identify practicable, effective solutions to complex problems by
examining both the dynamic relationships between their underlying factors and the potential impact of
interventions to address these problems. In the proposed study, together with a diverse, Bronx-based group of
community and implementer stakeholders, we will undertake a system dynamics-informed implementation
mapping process to identify promising PrEP implementation strategies. This work will be guided by two
implementation science frameworks: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and
Proctor’s Taxonomy of Implementation Outcomes. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we aim to: (1) co-design
and validate a system dynamics model delineating factors influencing PrEP engagement for BLSMM, and (2)
use the resultant model to determine the potential effectiveness of one or more prioritized strategies to improve
PrEP engagement. If we achieve pre-specified R21 milestones, in the R33 phase, our specific aim is to: (3)
pilot test the most promising strategies, working with stakeholders to operationalize and implement the
strategies and measure their impact. The findings from this participatory, community-engaged study will
provide timely and practical data that will advance our understanding of how to reduce disparities in PrEP
uptake and ultimately HIV transmission rates for BLSMM."
10991776,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by
progressive motor neuron (MN) loss, muscle denervation, and eventually, paralysis. Currently, no effective
treatments are available to stop or reverse ALS disease progression and the precise molecular mechanisms
underlie ALS pathogenesis remain elusive. Prior studies revealed decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain
activity, altered mitochondrial ultrastructure, and mitochondrial dysfunction in both MN and skeletal muscle (SM)
in ALS patients and mouse models. The first sign of ALS pathology occurs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),
where presynaptic MN axons connect with postsynaptic SM end plates. To date, whether signals resulting in the
initial NMJ damage are from MN or SM remain unclear. In this project, we aim to determine the tissue-specific
causative role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM and MN in disease onset and progression, and the therapeutic
efficacy of reducing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on NMJ and SM function in ALS mice. We hypothesize that
mitochondrial Ca2+ mishandling in both SM and MN actively contribute to ALS disease pathogenesis and that
attenuating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mitigates mitochondrial damage and preserves NMJ/muscle function. To
test this hypothesis, we will use transgenic mice with inducible, SM or MN-specific expression of a dominant
negative form of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter to specifically and selectively reduce mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
in SM and MN in hSOD1G93A mice and C9-500 (C9orf72) mice, two mouse models associated with the most
prevalent genetic causes for ALS. The central hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine
the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN in survival, motor function, NMJ function and in vivo muscle
performance in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice. Aim 2 will assess the impact of tissue-specific inhibition of
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN on NMJ and muscle structure, MN survival, muscle intrinsic contractile
properties, mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial bioenergetics in SM of hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice. This
project will: 1) provide a systematic, longitudinal characterization of SM and NMJ function from a cellular level to
whole animal level at different stages of disease progression in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice; 2) determine the
degrees to which defects in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN contribute to altered NMJ structure/function,
disease onset and progression in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice; 3) provide the first detailed dissection on the
relative role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM and MN in ALS phenotype using the same genetic models and
determine the origin of the signals that result in NMJ destruction (from SM or MN or both); 4) provide mechanistic
evidence for whether mitochondrial Ca2+ mishandling is a trigger or a target for disease progression in ALS mice,
regardless of the causing mutations (mitochondrial related or non-mitochondrial related); and most importantly,
5) test the validity of a potential new therapeutic target (mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, or the mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter) for the treatment of ALS."
10991778,"Cerebellar disease makes ordinary movements extraordinarily difficult, often resulting in endpoint errors. For
example, damage to lobule VII of the vermis makes saccadic eye movements dysmetric. These symptoms have
suggested that the cerebellum monitors ongoing commands and adjusts them, particularly as the movement nears
the target. Yet, individual Purkinje cells (P-cells) have firing patterns that are modulated much longer than the
movement. Thus, it has been difficult to decode the activities of P-cells, and their downstream nucleus neurons,
with respect to computations that are necessary for control of movements.
 A key to this puzzle is that the inferior olive monitors the output of the cerebellum and returns to it
information that appears to encode error [1–4]. This input to the cerebellum organizes P-cells and nucleus neurons
into anatomical groups called micro-clusters [5–7]. Cells within a micro-cluster likely have a common feature: they
respond similarly to error. Through a collaboration between Shadmehr, Soetedjo, and Kojima, we used this idea to
show that in macaques, if P-cells were organized into groups based on their complex spike response to error, then
their simple spikes as a population produced a rate coding that predicted parameters of the ongoing movement
[8,9]. The result was a new idea: the fundamental computational unit in the cerebellum may not be an individual
cell, but a population of cells that share a common preference for error.
 Here, we propose that P-cells that respond similarly to error are part of a network that exhibits a special
property: within this network, the P-cells not only coordinate their firing rates, but also temporally align their
spikes, especially during the deceleration phase of movements. That is, P-cells transmit information to the nucleus
by modulating their firing rates, and synchronizing their spikes. In our hypothesis, P-cells combine disinhibition with
synchronization to signal when the movement should be stopped [10]. To pursue this idea, in 2016 we built a
marmoset lab, pioneered techniques to train the animals, and then used silicon probes to record from many
neurons simultaneously [10,11]. We then built new tools for precise temporal analysis of cerebellar spikes [12].
Here, we propose to record from P-cells, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), and nucleus neurons, use their error
response to organize cells into populations, and then quantify both firing rates and spike timing during movements.
 Our proposed experiments have the potential to produce simultaneous recordings of P-cells, MLIs, and
nucleus neurons, something that is unprecedented in primates. We will use this neurophysiological approach to
test the anatomical basis of our hypothesis, that the inferior olive organizes the cerebellum into cell-assemblies.
The data will allow us to determine whether the healthy cerebellum relies on synchronization to encode
information, shedding light on conditions such as dysmetria and tremor, pathologies that appear to arise not from
mis-modulation of P-cell firing rates, but rather disorganization of spike timing [13–16]."
10991884,"PROJECT SUMMARY (from parent R35)
 Molecular mechanisms of innate immunity are constantly changing as organisms evolve to defend
against the threats of newly emerged pathogens. As a consequence, our innate immune pathways are a
patchwork of both ancient and recently evolved proteins. How did mechanisms of innate immunity arise, and
how have these pathways adapted to integrate new defenses? The answers to these questions are important
because these dynamics have shaped the functions of modern-day immunity, determining how hosts are
protected from infectious diseases. Moreover, because immune pathways are evolutionarily flexible, they can
serve as an excellent model for how cellular signaling networks assemble and diversify more broadly.
 We focus on the evolution of cell-autonomous immunity, which provides critical protections within
infected cells. Aspects of cell-autonomous immunity are found across eukaryotes, including in unicellular
phagocytic organisms that interact with bacteria in natural environments. To understand how ancient immune
proteins have assembled into modern mammalian pathways, we use diverse eukaryotes at ideal
phylogenetic positions to uncover the origins and evolution of innate immunity. We use the highly
tractable Dictyostelium system to discover and characterize antibacterial defenses in amoebae, while
leveraging additional eukaryotes to understand how immune proteins and pathways have evolved. Our
experiments integrate molecular, biochemical, genetic, cellular, evolutionary, and genomic approaches to
reveal genes functionally important for defending against bacterial infections in diverse organisms. Because
cell-autonomous defenses are easier to observe and study in haploid, unicellular species, these experiments
promise to uncover new mechanisms of cell-autonomous immunity. Some of these mechanisms may be
deeply conserved with immune defenses in animals, allowing us to reconstruct how these immune pathways
arise and change. Other immune mechanisms in these diverged eukaryotes may represent novel evolutionary
solutions to the problem of cellular defense, yielding both practical molecular tools such as new antimicrobials
and novel paradigms of immunity."

Like CVD, insomnia afflicts millions of US adults, burdens disadvantaged groups, and incurs high costs.
Moreover, insomnia is an independent, and likely causal, risk factor for CVD. Although candidate biological
mechanisms through which insomnia may promote CVD development have been identified, candidate
behavioral mechanisms have received less attention. Unhealthy eating behaviors – e.g., emotional eating,
external eating, restrained eating, poor diet quality, and night eating – are promising candidate behavioral
mechanisms due to their links with sleep disturbance and CVD risk. To date, little research has assessed the
relationships between objective sleep parameters and unhealthy eating behaviors, examined unhealthy eating
behaviors as mediators of sleep disturbance-CVD risk relationships, or explored sociodemographic factors as
moderators of these relationships. In this Diversity Supplement to the recently funded SHADES mechanistic
trial (R01 HL165115), we propose an observational ancillary study to address these knowledge gaps. The
proposed study will utilize data collected from a diverse sample of 200 primary care patients with insomnia
from a large safety net healthcare system. We will examine eating behavior data (to be acquired through this
supplement) and baseline data from the SHADES trial (to be acquired through the parent award) to achieve
the following specific aims: (1) assess relationships between objective sleep parameters and unhealthy eating
behaviors; (2) assess relationships between unhealthy eating behaviors and CVD risk biomarkers; (3) examine
if unhealthy eating behaviors mediate relationships between sleep parameters and CVD risk biomarkers; and
(exploratory) explore whether the relationships of interest are moderated by sex, race, or socioeconomic
status. Filling these knowledge gaps will advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying the insomnia-
to-CVD relationship, could identify novel targets for interventions designed to lower CVD risk in people with
insomnia, and could inform future tailored interventions. The candidate for this supplement is Timothy Lipuma,
a qualified and promising graduate student in IUPUI’s Clinical Psychology PhD program. Through the
proposed activities and under the mentorship of Dr. Jesse Stewart (PI of the parent trial), Mr. Lipuma will
achieve the following training goals: (1) increase knowledge and experience in the design and conduct of
clinical trials in primary care settings, (2) increase knowledge of insomnia screening and treatment and CVD
risk screening and management in primary care settings, and (3) further develop leadership ability and skill set.
Completing the proposed activities will pave the way for Mr. Lipuma to achieve his long-term career goal of
becoming a prevention-oriented independent investigator committed to advancing our knowledge of the
connection between psychosocial factors and cardiometabolic diseases, particularly in vulnerable populations."
10995821,"Preterm infants born before 30 weeks gestation are at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a
leading cause of death and long-term pulmonary insufficiency. Both hydrocortisone and synthetic glucocorticoid
(sGC) are commonly used to prevent BPD in premature infants. Clinical trials have shown that hydrocortisone
targeted to infants with emerging lung disease does not prevent BPD, while inhaled sGC therapy has shown
mixed efficacy with potentially increased mortality. Dexamethasone (DEX) has been shown in clinical trials to
reduce BPD rates in premature infants but is associated with short term and long-term adverse effects including
cerebral palsy. There is an unmet need for efficacious GC therapy in premature infants to prevent BPD
without encumbering serious adverse events. To address this challenge, our group has been investigating
ciclesonide (CIC), a sGC pro-drug that in the inhaled form is FDA approved for use in asthma and allergic rhinitis
in older children. We recently showed that DEX and CIC regulate GR transcriptional targets and several genes
implicated in lung protective effects in neonatal rats. Remarkably, CIC does not suppress somatic growth, IGF-
1 levels, induce hyperglycemia or cause neuroanatomical changes in the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats, which
are known pathologies caused by DEX in premature infants. Furthermore, ongoing studies reveal that CIC is as
efficacious as DEX in preventing lung injury in a hyperoxia-model of experimental BPD. We hypothesize that
CIC will have minimal systemic absorption and a favorable safety profile in premature infants at risk of
developing BPD. In Aim 1, we will determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of inhaled CIC in preterm
infants that does not trigger adverse systemic side effects characteristic of GCs. An open label dose escalation
study will be done in preterm infants born at <31 weeks gestation using a 3+3+3 study design. Infants requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation between days of life 14 to 35 will be treated with inhaled CIC for 2 weeks. Data
pertaining to growth, hyperglycemia, blood pressure, and adrenocortical suppression will be compared between
infants treated with CIC and controls. In Aim 2, we will quantify serum levels of CIC metabolites and changes in
the GR transcriptome after CIC therapy. Blood samples collected at days 3, 7 and 15 post-initiation of inhaled
CIC will be used to measure CIC and des-CIC by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry.
Whole blood RNA will be subjected to qRT PCR analysis of GC responsive genes to assess activation of GR.
 The fear of long-term neurological adverse effects has limited optimal use of sGC therapy to prevent
BPD. This application is significant as it proposes to repurpose CIC, an existing sGC, for novel therapeutic
use in preterm infants to prevent BPD (PAR-23-131). We believe our study is impactful and translationally
relevant as it addresses an unmet need for efficacious GC therapy to prevent BPD in premature infants without
encumbering the neurological and somatic adverse effects. Successful testing of our hypothesis will pave the
way for a large, multicenter randomized control trial of CIC therapy in premature infants to prevent BPD."
10979840,"Cervical cancer remains the second most common cancer killer of women worldwide, with an
annual incidence of more than 600,000 and an annual death rate of 300,000. Further, cervical
cancer disproportionately affects communities of medically underserved and minority women
within the US and abroad, and improved therapies are urgently needed. Primary and secondary
prevention approaches are also variably effective – even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, just 1
in 8 girls was vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), the cause of 90% of cervical
cancers. Vaccination rates also dropped sharply during the pandemic, even in the United
States. Current World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of HPV vaccine uptake rates is
21%. The vast majority of cervical cancers that are diagnosed after primary and secondary
prevention fail are locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Approximately 40% of women
diagnosed with LACC will relapse and die of disease even with standard-of-care curative
treatment, cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). CRT has remained the standard-of-care
for more than two decades, and novel approaches have failed to improve outcomes. We have
identified a critical prognostic factor, a bacteria called Lactobacillus iners (L. iners), in the
cervical tumor microbiome, which rewires tumor metabolism to utilize lactate and is associated
with treatment resistance and poor survival. Further, commensal Lactobacilli (lactic acid
bacteria) in other tumor sites often driven by lactate, such as head and neck and lung cancers,
also appear to lead to treatment resistance and poor survival. Our objective is to understand
specifically how L. iners and other lactic acid bacteria influence cancer cell and immune cell
metabolism using state-of-the-art proximity proteomics and mass cytometry (Aim 1). We will
also test novel therapeutic approaches to target either tumor resident bacteria by eliminating or
replacing specific bacterial species (Aim 2), or metabolic effects of tumor resident bacteria via
local bacterial engineering or systemic metabolism targeting anti-cancer therapies (Aim 3).
Targeting cervical tumor bacteria as a therapeutic (“Bugs as Drugs”) is a paradigm-shifting idea,
capitalizing on the relative simplicity of the cervicovaginal microbiome and its tendency to be
dominated by Lactobacillus species, and not only will this study lead to improved microbiome-
based therapeutics to improve outcomes in cervical cancer, but this proof-of-concept model
could be used to inform tumor microbiome-based therapeutics across cancer types."

Abstract.
OUD is the primary cause of substance abuse related overdoses, resulting in a significant rise in mortality rates,
with over 80,000 deaths in 2021 [1][2]. Overall, the alarming increase in opioid use, addiction, and overdose
has led to a national epidemic [3]. Current pharmacological therapies to treat addiction [4, 5] are inadequate
due to limited efficacy and adverse events [6]. Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) has shown promise in
treating some forms of addiction [7-14]. NIBS is thought to induce changes in brain activity that revert
maladaptive plasticity associated with addiction [15-17]. However, past NIBS studies have shown limited
efficacy in treating opioid addiction [7, 8]. Highland Instrument's Electrosonic Stimulation (ESStim) is an
improved NIBS technology that combines independently controlled electromagnetic and ultrasonic fields [18-
20]. The combined fields focus and boost neurostimulation currents via tuned electromechanical coupling in
neural tissue. ESStim was shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of OUD in our Fast Track Phase I
feasibility studies [21, 22]. As part of our Phase II work, we are conducting a double-blinded, multi-center,
placebo-controlled study to investigate ESStim for OUD treatment. Based on FDA guidance, received as part
of the FDA Q-sub process that was completed as part of our Phase II grant activities (see R44DA049685
RPPR Summer 2023), we propose to update our Phase II study protocol via this Supplement. As part of this
vital work, and as guided by the FDA, ESStim will be administered to 100 participants (50 Active, 50 SHAM) to
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 20 min/day across 4x five-day cycles interspersed with 6-
week follow-up periods over 6-months. We will administer a battery of clinical/safety, drug use,
electrophysiology, behavioral, and psychosocial assessments in the OUD patients, evaluated over 6 months.
As guided by the FDA, the primary endpoint for our trial will assess participants' percentage abstinence from
opioid use, defined as the percentage of each participant's negative urine samples and self-reports of illicit
opioid use during timeline followback interviews. In addition to supporting a new primary endpoint, the
proposed Supplement will support additional sites, a larger sample size, longer trial duration, and an extended
testing protocol. Overall, the proposed supplemental studies are specifically designed to support FDA
clearance of ESStim for treatment of OUD as guided by the FDA. These studies are pivotal in our goal of
improving treatment OUD and addiction across the U.S."
10995745,"Abstract
 Transcriptional regulation is an essential process for proper development that a host of cellular machinery
orchestrates. Among these cellular factors is the Integrator complex (INT), a 17-subunit complex that associates
with paused RNA polymerase II and is responsible for the 3'-end processing of non-coding RNAs and premature
termination of promoter-proximally paused RNAPII. Consistent with a fundamental role of Integrator function,
mutations within INT subunits cause neuronal dysfunction, including complex neurological syndromes marked
by cerebellar ataxia, intellectual defects, and seizures. Similarly, three zinc finger proteins comprising the ‘Z3
Complex’ (ZNF592, ZNF687, and ZMYND8) thought to be associated with INT also have diverse neurological
phenotypes when genetically perturbed. Despite a fundamental requirement of Integrator for gene expression
and apparent overlap of neurological symptoms in patients with mutations in INT and Z3 subunits, the molecular
basis of this profound connection between Z3-INT and brain disorders is unknown. My preliminary biochemical
purifications and proteomics described below indicate that the Z3 complex is strongly bound to INT. The formation
of a Z3-INT complex indicates that specific DNA binding proteins can potentially influence INT recruitment to
promoter-proximal regions in the genome. Consistently, my RNA-sequencing analyses from cells depleted of Z3
subunits reveal broad transcriptional changes that significantly overlap with changes observed upon depletion
of INT subunits. Nothing is known about Z3-INT subunit occupancy during neurogenesis nor how perturbation
of Z3-INT expression would affect neural development. This is despite the compelling human patient phenotypes
caused by their mutation revealing their importance to brain development. Based on these data, I hypothesize
that Z3 interacts with INT to modulate its recruitment and occupancy to promoters, and perturbation of this
process leads to disrupted neuronal differentiation. To address this, I will first determine expression and
occupancy of Z3-INT during neuronal differentiation. Second, I will elucidate the functional role of Z3-INT
neuronal fitness. Third, I will uncover biochemical interactions between Z3 and INT. Completion of these aims
will converge to uncover the link between INT and associated transcription factors, Z3."
10979477,"Mobile CT scanners are routinely used in the neuro intensive care unit (ICU) for critically ill patients to avoid
morbidity and adverse events associated with patient transport. The image quality of mobile CT is inferior to a
fixed MDCT in terms of image noise, spatial resolution, soft tissue contrast, and susceptibility to artifacts from
beam hardening, motion, metallic implants, and truncation. Reduced image quality may compromise care and
necessitate transport to a fixed scanner. For example, on a mobile CT scanner, it is difficult to diagnose small
infarcts or hemorrhage, or to differentiate between intracranial hemorrhage and contrast extravasation after
endovascular processes.
 In this project, we will leverage the benefits from an FDA-approved mobile photon counting CT (PCCT), as
well as deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithms to improve the image quality of the mobile PCCT
to or beyond that of a fixed scanner. The multi-spectral and high-resolution features of the mobile PCCT will be
explored and combined with deep learning algorithms for noise and artifacts reduction.
 In this project, the following aims will be investigated to achieve our goal to match the image quality of a
mobile PCCT to a fixed scanner: (1) We will develop low-dose, high-resolution deep learning-based
reconstruction algorithms to reduce the noise and improve gray-white matter contrast in the mobile PCCT; (2)
We will develop methods for material decomposition with reduced noise amplification and spectral optimization
to overcome beam hardening artifacts and achieve discrimination between calcium/contrast/hemorrhage; (3) We
will develop deep learning-based algorithms for image artifacts correction to tackle artifacts that are more
frequent on a mobile CT, including motion and metal artifacts; (4) To validate the methods, the optimized mobile
PCCT images will be compared with fixed CT images by trained radiologists."

 Type I interferons (IFNs) are important innate cytokines that influence local and systemic
immune responses. They can play beneficial roles through their antiviral properties and ability to
augment host immune responses; however, IFN responses can also have detrimental outcomes
for the host. The factors that determine these differential outcomes are poorly understood.
 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus that causes severe, febrile arthritis
and myositis. Type I IFNs are a key host response during alphavirus infection. Mice lacking the
type I IFN receptor develop severe and rapidly fatal disease following infection with CHIKV or
other alphaviruses. In studying this response, we have made several interesting observations.
First, IFNs exert both beneficial and detrimental effects during CHIKV infection. Second, IFNs
regulate the host response to CHIVK by signaling on non-hematopoietic cells, likely stromal cells
and other structural cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The contribution of stromal
cells to in vivo host immune responses remains poorly defined, even though these cell types are
among the first cells to respond to vaccinations and vector-borne infectious diseases.
 Our proposed research will test the hypothesis that type I IFNs play distinct roles throughout
the course of CHIKV infection due to the responses of distinct stromal cell populations. The
studies proposed will utilize mouse genetics to conditionally delete IFN signaling from different
stromal cells, temporal antibody blocking strategies, and RNA sequencing techniques to
interrogate how IFNs impact these specific cells at different times during CHIKV infection. These
findings have the potential to greatly expand our understanding of stromal cells IFN responses
and how these cells contribute to shaping the tissue-specific immune response during infections
and vaccinations."
10979970,"This grant application responds to PAR-18-812: Occupational Safety and Health Research (R01).
Exposure to airborne biological agents is known to cause a wide range of negative health effects in
occupational and general populations. Thus, advanced exposure assessment tools are needed. The proposed
project will complete the development and testing of a novel, standalone, battery-operated personal
electrostatic bioaerosol sampler (PEBS) featuring a high sample concentration rate. In the completed PEBS,
bioaerosols will be drawn into an open channel collector at 20 L/min, electrically charged, and deposited inside
a removable cartridge with a hydrophobic collection plate. The collected particles will be eluted into 0.5 mL of
liquid using a newly designed elution station. The eluate can then be analyzed by various techniques, from
culturing to molecular tools, sequencing, and rapid analysis kits. In the exploratory research, we demonstrated
the feasibility of this personal sampler concept and built its prototype. This R01 project will complete the
sampler’s development, including integration with electronic components and controls and the elution station.
The completed sampler version will quadruple the sample concentration rate compared to the prototype. The
performance of PEBS will be validated using different microorganisms, including coronavirus OC43, and
multiple microbial analysis techniques. The standalone PEBS will be rigorously tested against other personal
samplers, including its use in the field to determine actual personal bioaerosol exposures in various
occupational environments. We hypothesize that the standalone PEBS is advantageous over current personal
bioaerosol samplers in determining bioaerosol exposures, especially at low microorganism concentrations.
 This proposal responds to NORA’s Priority Research Agendas National Agriculture, Forestry, and
Fishing; National Services; National Transportation, Warehousing, and Utilities by answering their call to
improve exposure assessment to occupational agents (e.g., biological agents) and to prevent and reduce
work-related illnesses, including respiratory infectious diseases and asthma. The proposal also responds to
several cross-sector programs, e.g., Respiratory Health and Immune, Dermal & Infectious Diseases.
 This proposal responds to the NIOSH r2P initiative by developing an innovative tool that will enable an
improved assessment of personal exposures to biological air contaminants, leading to worker health
protection. The new personal sampling technology will eventually be transferred into the workplace.
 The study output will be an advanced standalone personal bioaerosol sampler for occupational
environments and publications/presentations describing the technology and its performance and application.
We expect that intermediate outcomes will include a patent, citations in the literature, and, finally, adoption of
the sampler in practice. The end outcome is expected to be a better understanding of personal exposures to
hazardous biological particles, eventually leading to better health protection."

 Opioid alternative analgesics that would kill pain potently without the respiratory side effect will be of
specific importance in addressing the opioid crisis. The medicinal herb kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) produces
natural products (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) that selectively activate analgesia only, which are
promising “biased” opioid alternatives. Elucidating the kratom biosynthetic pathway composed of enzymes
catalyzing sequential reactions toward the syntheses of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, or other kratom
products is important to the development of “biased” non-opioid analgesics. We propose to identify and
reconstruct both the kratom biosynthetic pathways and the plant enzyme complexes organizing plant
biosynthesis in yeast by integrating plant functional genomics analysis and synthetic biology. The research will
provide new chemical and plant biology knowledge to a broader community, develop a post-translational level
understanding of plant pathway regulation in yeast, and highlight the possibility of using synthetic biology to
understand how nature achieves complicated natural product biosynthesis.
 This proposal will develop the conceptual framework to understand how nature organizes the specialized
metabolism in plant toward high efficiency and complexity. The development of high-throughput protein-protein
interaction method in yeast for plant complex identification will provide new methods and knowledge for plant
pathway discovery and reconstruction. The methods and knowledge we develop toward these goals will also
enable the structural elucidation, biological activity evaluation, and microbial production of biased opioid
alternatives, leading to the development of next-generation painkillers to address the opioid crisis."
10982332,"ABSTRACT
Pediatric treatment-induced high-grade glioma (HGG), also known as radiation-induced glioma (RIG), is an
incurable secondary cancerous brain tumor that affects children who have previously received cranial
radiotherapy (RT), most commonly for leukemia or a separate, primary brain tumor (the two most common
childhood cancers). They affect up to 4% of children who have received cranial RT and account for up to 10%
of pediatric brain tumor deaths. They have no known effective treatment, and research on these uniformly fatal
tumors has been unacceptably limited. We recently broadly characterized these tumors’ molecular features in
a large patient sample cohort. We found that while RIG and primary pediatric HGG share histological
similarities, their genetic alterations and gene expression profiles are different. RNA-seq analysis of treatment-
induced HGG shows they form two expression subgroups (A and B) of approximately equal incidence.
Findings in both groups suggest the presence of germline DNA repair defects that may place some patients at
increased risk of developing these tumors after receiving RT. We have characterized these tumors’ cells of
origin through single-cell RNA-Seq. We have also developed a world-first set of patient-derived cell culture and
orthotopic xenograft (PDX) models of these tumors. We found that RIG is vulnerable to many clinically relevant
therapies, including DNA disruptors and MEK inhibitors. For this proposal, we hypothesize that germline
susceptibility to DNA disruption from RT contributes to oncogenesis of these tumors, but this origin in DNA
disruption in turn renders them susceptible to DNA disrupting treatment like RT and specific chemotherapies,
so that combining DNA disrupting treatment with targeting of tumor-specific molecular dependencies will
improve outcomes. Our first aim is to discover and validate germline risk factors for RIG through DNA
sequencing of the germlines of patients and controls and then testing putative genetic variants conferring risk
through an in vitro stem cell model. Second, we will inhibit predicted pathways of tumor growth in three types of
RIG cells of origin to establish pathways key to tumor growth and treatment resistance. We will supplement the
predicted pathways with screens based on orthogonal functional genomic techniques in vitro and in vivo.
Lastly, we will use our patient-derived models of these tumors to test combinations of effective chemotherapies
and RT in cell culture and take the most successful treatment plans for validation in our PDX models. We will
also conduct orthogonal assessment of treatment efficacy through our newly opened RIG patient registry.
Through these aims, we will lead research on these tumors from current limited biological understanding to
advanced understanding of tumor origins with a pathway to prevention, with implications for other secondary
cancers as well. Critically, we will also understand rational, combination treatment susceptibilities. We will be
able to translate this knowledge to a RIG-specific clinical trial to finally improve outcomes for these tragic
patients currently dying of brain tumors caused by treatment that helped cure their primary cancer."
10981610,"Project Summary
A limited understanding of clinically relevant signaling pathways has limited the development of therapeutic
agents for human glomerular disease. Our long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment
of glomerular disease by elucidating the details and functional significance of key signaling pathways that
regulate podocyte injury and survival. Our preliminary data have shown that YAP silencing disrupts podocyte
focal adhesion architecture and actin cytoskeletal integrity. Using RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptomic profile
of control and YAP knockdown mouse podocytes, the most significantly enriched gene ontology molecular
function term among the differentially upregulated genes is “potassium channel regulator activity”. YAP silencing
significantly increases KCNN4 gene and encoded KCa3.1 (intermediate-conductance calcium-activated
potassium channel) protein expression. KCa3.1 inhibitors decrease podocyte actin cytoskeletal disruption,
pathogenic intracellular calcium signaling and potassium efflux along with decreasing podocyte injury in an acute
in vivo model of glomerular disease. The overall objective of this application is to define the role of YAP in
podocyte survival and as a potential therapeutic target in proteinuric kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that YAP
nuclear expression is essential for maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, including through
repression of KCNN4 gene expression. The loss or inactivation of YAP enhances pathogenic KCa3.1 signaling
in podocytes. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: Aim 1 will define the mechanism of
Hippo-YAP regulation of podocyte KCa3.1 function. We will define the mechanism by which Hippo-YAP regulates
KCa3.1 channel function in podocytes and the mechanism of podocyte injury induced by calcium-activated
potassium channel activity. We will also test the in vivo interaction and functional role of YAP inhibition of
KCNN4/KCa3.1 function. In Aim 2, we will develop and test the efficacy of KCa3.1 inhibitors for podocyte
protection. We will use rational design and medicinal chemistry to optimize KCa3.1 inhibitors for podocyte
protection, test the ability of novel KCa3.1 inhibitors to protect podocytes from injury while decreasing pathogenic
potassium efflux and intracellular calcium signaling, and test the ability of KCa3.1 inhibitors to decrease
albuminuria and slow kidney disease progression in relevant in vivo glomerular disease models. Currently, there
are no KCa3.1 inhibitors in clinical development for podocytopathies, FSGS or proteinuric kidney disease. The
work proposed is expected to characterize the role of Hippo-YAP signaling in regulating KCa3.1 function in
podocytes while developing a novel therapeutic strategy for proteinuric kidney disease."
10980586,"One path towards generating new therapeutic avenues to induce regeneration is understanding fundamental
differences between a regenerative and scarring response to injury. When tissue regeneration in spiny mice
(Acomys) is studied in parallel with rodent models of scarring (e.g., laboratory mice - Mus), this comparative
approach can uncover fundamental cell states and molecular signals that explain how identical injuries follow
one healing trajectory, instead of the other. At the outset of either healing type, tissue trauma stimulates sterile
inflammation that first protects, and then resolves the injury. Inflammation is orchestrated by macrophages
whose phenotypic states can have diverse functions. While current data supports that macrophages are
required for proper wound healing, whether macrophages specifically regulate musculoskeletal regeneration is
poorly understood. The long-term goal of our research is to uncover key molecular signals and cell states that
direct mammalian musculoskeletal injuries towards regenerative healing. The objective of this proposal is to
understand how tissue resident macrophages (TR-MFs) and their secreted products specifically regulate
regeneration in spiny mice and to manipulate the wound microenvironment in laboratory mice to enhance
regenerative healing. The central hypothesis we will test is that TR-MFs are required separately during the
wound healing and tissue generation stages of regeneration to first regulate inflammatory magnitude and
oxidative stress, and then to facilitate cell proliferation. This hypothesis is based upon our published and
preliminary studies demonstrating that when spiny mouse TR-MFs are depleted prior to injury, regeneration is
inhibited, and Acomys TR-MFs uniquely produce secreted molecules such as VEGFc and lactoferrin (LTF)
that are important for regeneration. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Asses how TR-MFs separately regulate cellular inflammation
and new tissue formation during regeneration by depleting TR-MFs in spiny mice and using established
assays to assess re-epithelialization, inflammation, extracellular matrix production and proliferation. Single cell
RNA-sequencing will also be deployed to analyze how loss of TR-MFs alters resident cell states and behavior.
(2) Define the species-specific epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of TR-MFs during regeneration
(Acomys) versus scar formation (Mus) to discover the genetic program controlling TR-MF identity in spiny mice
and (3) functionally assess if exogenous lactoferrin delivered to Acomys injuries in the absence of TR-MFs can
control inflammation and permit cell proliferation and when delivered to mouse injuries, enhance healing. The
approach is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it explicitly focuses on understanding how complex
tissue regeneration occurs naturally in an adult mammal. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to provide new and fundamental insight into how TR-MFs regulate musculoskeletal healing and
because our discoveries can inform novel clinical interventions to reduce fibrosis and stimulate regeneration."

Protection of stalled replication forks is crucial for cells to respond to replication stress and maintain genome
stability. Recent research has provided strong evidences that genome instability can trigger inflammatory
response when chromosomal or short stranded nuclear DNA are released into the cytoplasm and detected by
a cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the cGAS-STING-dependent pathway. Emerging evidences indicate that
DNA repair or replication fork processing in the replication stress response is connected with activation of the
innate immune response. However, much remains unknown about the link between stalled replication fork
protection and innate immune response. In addition, the physiological consequence of replication stress-
induced innate immune response in vivo remains to be defined. Our recent study reveals a role of Abro1 and
FANCD2 in linking replication fork protection with restriction of innate immune response. We found that stalled
replication fork degradation induced by Abro1- or FANCD2-deficiency leads to accumulation of cytosolic single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) and activation of cGAS-STING-dependent innate immune signaling. Increased
cytosolic ssDNA including ribosomal DNA (rDNA) binds to cGAS activating cGAS-dependent innate immune
signaling and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In addition, Abro1 and FANCD2 limits
replication stress-induced Processing bodies (P-bodies) formation and P-bodies are capable of modulating
activation of the innate immune signaling upon replication stress. We propose to determine the underlying
mechanism by which replication fork protection limits the induction of innate immune response and define fork
degradation-induced innate immune response in vivo. We will carry out the following specific aims: (1) to
delineate stalled fork degradation-induced activation of innate immune signaling; (2) to determine the
involvement of P-bodies in stalled fork degradation-induced activation of innate immune signaling; (3) to
determine the physiological effect of Abro1 deficiency-induced replication fork degradation associated
secretory phenotype in vivo in mice. Overall, this project will provide novel insights into the link of replication
fork protection and innate immune response, contributing to establishing new possibilities for the treatment of
inflammatory disorders and cancer in the future."

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large, eukaryotic ion channel superfamily that control diverse
physiological functions, and are therefore attractive drug targets. To date, more than 210 structures from over
20 different TRP channels have been determined, all are tetramers. Despite the wealth of structural information
there are many open questions, including the pore-dilation phenomenon, whereby prolonged activation leads to
an increase in conductance, permeability to large ions, and loss of rectification. Using HS-AFM, we have
discovered a hitherto unobserved pentameric state for TRPV3 that is in in a dynamic equilibrium with the
tetrameric state through membrane diffusive exchange of protomers. Simple geometric considerations to
estimate the pore size, as well as the similar timescale of seconds-to-minutes we observed necessary to achieve
both the pentameric state and pore-dilation currents, suggest that the pentameric state may be the structural
correlate to the so far elusive pore-dilation phenomenon. In this project we will therefore aim to (1) correlate the
pentameric TRPV3 state with pore-dilation. (2) Determine an atomic structure of the pentameric state, and (3)
investigate gain-of-function TRPV3 disease mutations which we hypothesize have increased occurrence of the
pentameric state. To complete these aims we will: (1) Use HS-AFM and NanoDSF to assess whether there is
an increase in the population of pentamers, and a decrease in the stability the tetramers, following the addition
of different well-known pore-dilation agents (diphenylboronic anhydride (DPBA) and heat (45°C)), and other
pore-dilation agents that we will discover. (2) Use molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) for equilibration of an
initial pentameric model and determine the experimental pentameric structure using cryo-EM to achieve a high-
resolution understanding of the pore structure and protomer interfaces in the pentamer. (3) Study two gain-of-
function mutations (M572I and Q580P) associated with the Olmsted syndrome, located at the TRPV3 protomer
interface, and use HS-AFM, cryo-EM and electrophysiology measurements to assess whether these mutations
increase the likelihood for the pentameric and pore-dilated state. Completion of these aims will allow us to assess
whether the increased conductance, permeability to larger ions, and loss of rectification associated with pore
dilation are indeed related to a change in the oligomeric state of TRP channels, and thus provide a correlate to
the yet structurally undetermined phenomenon of pore-dilation. Additionally, this work will provide a structural
explanation and mechanism for the increased channel activity following different TRPV3-related mutations and
will thus further the development of drugs and therapeutic tools for treatment of TRP-channel related diseases.
The results from this project are expected to provide answers to some long-standing and unresolved questions
in the field of TRP-channel research, and to pave the way for new avenues in membrane protein research in
general, considering membrane diffusive protomer exchange as a process for conformation variability."

During embryonic development, extracellular proteins, known as morphogens, play a key role in conveying
positional information and establishing cell fates. While theoretical descriptions have posited plausible models
for how morphogens might shape embryonic development, until recently, quantitative experimental data have
been lacking. The Nodal pathway is essential for early development, and is necessary for stabilization of the
epiblast, specification of the mesendoderm, and formation of the left-right axis. Nodal and its inhibitors Lefty1/2
have long served as a model for tissue patterning by signaling activators and their cognate inhibitors, with several
studies suggesting that the Nodal-Lefty system generates self-organizing patterns via a Turing mechanism.
Unlike other TGFβ family members, Nodal has been found to signal as an obligatory heterodimer with a cofactor
(GDF1/3), and signaling requires a coreceptor (Cripto) in receiving cells in addition to the standard receptor
complex. There is some evidence for long-range dispersal of Nodal, particularly from overexpression studies,
and from studies of left-right axis specification, while recent studies of germ layer patterning in Zebrafish have
suggested that it functions at fairly short range over only a few cell tiers. We have taken advantage of CRISPR
editing in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to tag the Nodal gene with a fluorescent protein allowing us to
visualize it at endogenous concentrations for the first time. Using a self-organizing hPSC system that forms
patterns of different germ layers along the radial axis of an hPSC colony, we demonstrated that, in this context,
Nodal signaling is primarily autocrine and juxtacrine, signaling only to the immediate neighbors of producing
cells. This short-range signaling activity spreads via a relay mechanism in which Nodal producing cells signal to
their neighbors which causes them to transcribe Nodal protein and signal to the next layer of cells. This mode of
relay signaling has received much less attention than Turing mechanisms, even though it may operate in a
number of contexts in which signaling is short range. Here, we will build upon these tools and findings to perform
quantitative experiments and mathematical modeling to understand how the system of Nodal, and its inhibitors,
cofactors, and coreceptor functions in patterning. We will pursue three aims. (1) Understand how the relay
signaling system of Nodal and Lefty1/2 establishes dynamic patterns of signaling activity and cell fate (2)
Understand the role of cofactors and coreceptors in ligand dispersal and patterning. (3) Uncover how crosstalk
between Wnt and Nodal regulates signaling and cell fate. Together our studies will quantitatively probe how a
paradigmatic signaling system shapes fate patterns in the embryo during early development. As our experiments
are performed in human cells, our findings will shed important light on the role of these pathways in patterning
defects, as well as provide a foundation for manipulating signaling to created patterned tissues for regenerative
medicine."

The Bragg peak serves as the foundation for proton radiotherapy (RT), providing particular benefit to reduce
treatment toxicity and improve quality of life for patients with cancers that are very close to multiple critical organs,
particularly for pediatric patients. However, anatomical changes often occur during RT treatment course, caused
by tumor shrinkage, patient weight loss, and daily treatment setup variations. Proton RT is very sensitive to
anatomical changes, as a small density change along the beam path can shift the Bragg peak, resulting in
significant underdosing of tumors and overdosing of adjacent critical organs. Adaptive proton RT (APT) offers a
general solution to account for anatomical changes. However, current APT workflow is resource-intensive in
terms of time and equipment and requires extensive work from the entire clinical team. It typically takes a few
days from the CT image acquisition of patient’s new anatomy to the time when the new plan is ready for treatment,
resulting in 1) interruptions of the treatment course, which can impair the local control and overall survival rate
due to tumor cell repopulation, particularly for cancers of fast tumor repopulation; 2) time delays between the
image acquisition of new anatomy and the treatment delivery of the new treatment plan, which can compromise
the plan’s efficacy due to the continual anatomical changes occurring during the gap. Online APT is much needed
to guarantee high treatment quality throughout the treatment course. While several commercial systems support
online adaptation for photon RT, there is no such system available for proton RT. This gap exists because online
APT requires superior contouring accuracy and more robust online adaptation algorithms that can account for
large anatomical changes due to the Bragg peak's sharp dose fall-off and its acute sensitivity to anatomical
changes. To fill this gap, we propose to develop an artificial intelligence-driven system for online adaptive and
personalized proton therapy (AID-ON-APPT). We envision that this system will calculate the actual daily dose
distribution of the treatment plan based on patient’s daily anatomy and treatment setup, quantify the actual plan
quality before the delivery of each treatment fraction and, if needed, generate a new optimal plan within minutes.
The proposed system will be developed via three specific aims, using head-and-neck cancer as a test bed: 1)
Build two patient-specific deep-learning (DL) models for automatic online delineation of tumor and organs at risk
(OAR) on daily cone-beam CT images; 2) Build a patient-specific virtual replanner network using deep
reinforcement learning and prior knowledge for automatic online replanning; 3) Conduct a clinical study of virtual
online APT on 100 HN patients to test system performance and its potential clinical benefits. Upon successful
completion, the proposed platform will enable online adaptive and personalized proton therapy, which is
expected to improve tumor dose coverage while reducing the dose to critical organs and lead to better local
control, reduced complications, and improved quality of life. This platform will revolutionize current clinical
practices of proton RT, substantially improving clinical efficiency and reducing the needed human interventions."
10981498,"Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and increases in severity with
disease progression. Unfortunately, treatment options for MS-related cognitive impairment are limited in that
they are not neurobiologically-based or personalized. Moreover, to date there are no approved pharmaceutical
treatments to manage chronic cognitive symptoms. Brain network studies using diffusion MRI (dMRI) to measure
white matter structural connectivity (SC) and functional MRI (fMRI) to measure functional connectivity (FC) have
identified specific networks related to cognitive impairment in MS. However, both increased and decreased FC
have been associated with lower cognitive performance, leading to unresolved questions regarding the response
of brain networks to the pathology of MS. There is an urgent, unmet need to understand the directionality of this
relationship, and mechanisms driving these brain activity changes, if we are to design neurobiologically-based
cognition-preserving therapies. Our overall objective is to utilize a multi-scale, multi-modal, longitudinal imaging
approach to examine the association of cognitive function with both macroscopic and microscopic changes in
brain function, anatomy, and neuronal integrity, and to create clinically applicable models that can identify
patients at risk for cognitive decline. We will utilize MRI to examine FC and SC brain networks (macroscopic)
and [11C] Flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) to measure concurrent receptor-level neuronal
integrity (microscopic). We our hypotheses are based on a three-stage trajectory of cognitive decline in MS i)
early “adaptive” stage where increased FC is related to intact neuronal integrity and cognitive resilience, ii) middle
“adaptive exhaustion” stage of cognitive decline wherein FC continues to increase but with decreasing efficacy
due to loss of neuronal integrity and continued SC damage and, finally, iii) “decline” or network collapse stage
wherein all imaging markers decline with cognition. Here, we focus on the first two stages of the trajectory, as
our aim is to identify mechanistic targets prior to overall decline. In Aim 1, we will examine the association
between cognition and each imaging modality (and their changes) over 4 years in 66 people with MS and 30
controls. Our hypothesis is that larger FC/FMZ-PET binding potential and more intact SC/gray matter volume
will be related to preserved cognition in the “adaptive” stage of cognitive decline, while higher FC and reduced
SC/FMZ-PET and gray matter volume will be related to worse cognition in the “adaptive exhaustion” stage. In
Aim 2, we hypothesize multi-modal, multi-scale imaging will reveal i) positive correlations between neuronal
integrity and FC and ii) negative correlations between neuronal integrity and SC in the “adaptive” stage; both of
these relationships will reverse in the “adaptive exhaustion” stage. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will use MRI-based
measures of SC/FC/brain atrophy to identify patients at high risk for future cognitive decline and provide a
clinically feasible tool for clinicians. The overall impact of this proposal is to create a clear path to develop and
deliver personalized, effective therapies to prevent cognitive decline in people with MS."

The aim of this R24 proposal entitled “Advancing, Expanding, and Streamlining University of New Mexico
Health Science Center Animal Resource Facility Rodent Housing Capabilities” is a request for $350,000 to: 1)
Support purchase of 10 ventilated rodent racks with cages/accessories and associated mechanical and
electrical construction to provide connection of these units to building exhaust and electrical in two rodent
housing rooms; 2) Purchase two Class II Type A2 animal handling biosafety cabinets for use in rodent
research suites. The total space affected by this project is 601 sq ft. This project builds upon improvements
from renovation projects completed in 2002, 2008, 2013, 2021, 2022, and 2023, including several expansions
and improvement in ABSL-2 housing capabilities. These past renovations upgraded mechanical (HVAC w/
DDC controls and environmental alarms), floors, finishes, roofing, replacing the tunnel and rack washers, three
cage and equipment autoclaves, and renovated all mouse housing rooms to accommodate individually
ventilated rodent racks in all mouse housing areas. This proposed project will add ventilated mouse racks to
expand and consolidate animal biosafety level-2 housing in G95, a mouse housing room adjacent to the
mouse breeding barrier, which supports 20 investigators. The racks that will be purchased will be compatible
with existing caging with the large cages (180 in2/cage – 36 cages/rack) that can be used in any rack in the
breeding barrier by interchanging with small cages (75 in2/cage) (2 small cages fit in the slot for 1 large cage).
We propose the large cages to allow us to support trio breeding with adequate space per breeding female, as
recommended under the 8th edition NIH guide. Second, we propose to renovate and add ventilated racks (5
racks/room) in G82B, a mouse room in the specific pathogen free (SPF) research suite. These proposed
ventilated racks are single sided units with capacity of 72 cages (75 in2 /cage) per unit. This rack format will
allow us to increase space in the breeding barrier by 25% (288 to 360 cages). This SPF mouse research suite
currently supports 18 PI laboratories. These rooms are currently near capacity and 3 new faculty with mouse
research programs have been hired and their mice breeding will be operational in ARF by January 2024. Third,
we will purchase animal handling equipment for each respective animal room (G95 and G82B) as Class II
Type A2 animal handling biosafety cabinets."
10984807,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Malignant glioma is a devastating brain cancer with no improvements in prognosis over
decades. One key mechanism for glioma progression is the dynamic metabolic communication between the
tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although extracellular acidosis is a pathological hallmark of
TME, the precise pH-dependent mechanisms underlying glioma metabolic reprogramming remain poorly
defined. This proposal’s overarching goal is to discover the genes and pathways regulating glioma metabolism
and glioma-vascular crosstalk. This proposal focuses on Slc4a4, a glial-enriched sodium-bicarbonate
cotransporter that was previously identified as an intracellular and extracellular pH regulator. Slc4a4-mediated
pH regulation is important for glial-vascular interaction after injury, but its role in glioma progression is undefined.
To begin addressing this gap in knowledge, I analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found
that high Slc4a4 expression correlates with prolonged survival in glioma patients. Corroboratively, my preliminary
data showed that Slc4a4 gain of function (GOF) drastically decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis in patient-
derived xenograft and CRISPR-mediated de novo mouse glioma models, which is further complemented by loss-
of-function (LOF) studies using glial-specific Slc4a4 knockout mice. These data suggest an inhibitory role of
Slc4a4 in glioma and associated aberrant vascular remodeling. Multi-omic profiling of Slc4a4 GOF/LOF mouse
glioma found that Slc4a4 negatively regulates the expression of a key lipid binding protein, fatty acid binding
protein 5 (FABP5), which is coupled with dysregulated lipid metabolism. Further analysis of the TCGA database
showed an inverse expression and survival correlation between Slc4a4 and FABP5 in glioma patients. In an
immunocompetent mouse glioma model, FABP5 overexpression reverses Slc4a4’s inhibitory effects on glioma
growth, suggesting an antagonistic Slc4a4-FABP5 axis in glioma. Finally, comprehensive transcriptomic profiling
of Slc4a4 GOF/LOF glioma revealed dysregulated gene signatures involved in acidic pH response, lipid
metabolism, and endothelial function. Based on these preliminary data, my central hypothesis is that Slc4a4
suppresses glioma progression, in part by regulating lipid metabolism and glioma-vascular interaction. To test
this hypothesis, I will first define Slc4a4’s role in glioma progression (Aim 1). Next, I will determine how Slc4a4
inhibits gliomagenesis via reprogramming intrinsic glioma lipid metabolism (Aim 2). Upon completion of Aims 1
and 2 in the K99 phase, I will establish Slc4a4’s role in glioma progression and associated lipid dysregulation. In
the R00 phase, I will determine how Slc4a4 mediates glioma-vascular interaction with a focus on endothelial
metabolism (Aim 3). The proposed studies will define the pH-dependent mechanisms by which glioma hijacks
brain vasculature to progress, ultimately establishing an independent research program bridging cancer, glial,
and vascular biology to decipher how glioma progresses with potential therapeutic implications."
10984809,"Project Summary Abstract
Nuclear speckles are an archetypal biomolecular condensates that are essential to either
activating or repressing target gene expression. Unsuccessful control of gene expression
is associated with development and progression of human cancers. Understanding the
mechanism underlying nuclear speckle formation and functions can uncover possible
modes of action for therapeutics.
The main scaffold of nuclear speckles is formed by RNA and RNA binding proteins
(RBPs), which have modular architectures of multiple domains, termed RNA recognition
motifs (RRMs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). I propose to develop a
comprehensive approach to study the specific arrangement of RRMs and IDRs in RBP
assemblies and how each of RRM or IDR affects nuclear speckle formation and functions.
Typically, RRMs can be readily identified by protein sequence that is evolutionarily
maintained and their functions can be predicted. However, function cannot be easily
predicted for IDRs from their sequences due to a large variability throughout evolution.
Using modern computational analyses, I have identified the distinct molecular architecture
and sequence features of the IDRs in nuclear speckle proteins that are obscured by
variability in sequence. These indicate that the proteins should undergo a specific
arrangement into assemblies with limited size. I will test these predictions by experiments
using isolated proteins and RNA, and in live cells. I will use model nuclear speckle
proteins, the SRSFs. In Aim 1, I will experimentally test how variations in the molecular
architecture contribute to nuclear speckle formation by studying SRSF family proteins that
naturally vary in the number of RRMs and IDR sequence features. Aims 2 and 3 will be
studied during the independent phase of this grant (R00). In Aim 2, I will investigate how
the individual assemblies of SRSF proteins are held together by a core of speckles. In
Aim 3, I will investigate how different nuclear speckle proteins are released and move
outside of nucleus under cellular stress.
This award will support training in computational simulations and advanced experiments.
Together these aims will support the long-term goal of uncovering the molecular
mechanism underlying assembly and functions of nuclear speckles from the distinct
features in the protein sequence."
10984811,"Project Summary: Characterizing the Function of Cyclic di-AMP on Chlamydial Growth and
Differentiation
 Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a range of serious diseases in
humans. In developed countries, Chlamydia trachomatis is the primary cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections (STI). Indeed, recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control highlight the increasing incidence
of STIs, with chlamydia infections consistently outpacing all other bacterial causes. In developing countries,
C. trachomatis is not only a significant cause of STI, but it is also responsible for the primary cause of infectious
preventable blindness, trachoma. The major concern of chlamydial infections is that they are often
asymptomatic and undiagnosed, which can lead to chronic sequelae. These include pelvic inflammatory
disease, tubal factor infertility, and reactive arthritis for C. trachomatis. Consequently, chlamydial diseases
remain a significant burden on health care systems around the world.
 In adapting to obligate intracellular growth, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and
eliminated genes from various pathways as it relies on the host cell for its metabolic needs. This suggests that
the presence of any particular gene(s) is critical, if not essential, for its growth and pathogenesis. Importantly,
Chlamydia also alternates between different functional and morphological forms during its normal growth, also
referred to as its developmental cycle. These observations, combined with its obligate intracellular
dependence, makes Chlamydia a difficult organism with which to work. However, recent development of
genetic tools to mechanistically study chlamydiae have significantly enhanced our understanding of this
pathogen. Related to this proposal is the observation that Chlamydia produces a second messenger
compound, cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), that is known to activate host cell immune-signaling pathways.
Interestingly, c-di-AMP is typically produced in Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria to regulate aspects
of their physiology and pathogenesis, yet Chlamydia is a Gram-negative bacterium. We propose to investigate
why Chlamydia produces c-di-AMP and how it functions in the physiology of the organism. The first project
goal is to characterize using genetic techniques the effects of altering c-di-AMP production on Chlamydia
growth and developmental cycle progression. The second project goal is to identify genes that are regulated
by c-di-AMP. Results from the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the function of c-di-AMP
in chlamydial physiology and identify new targets for development of Chlamydia-specific treatments."

 This is a resubmission application for a new U2C/TL1, requesting support to promote high quality,
collaborative training in kidney, urology, and hematology research in the San Diego area. The application
represents a collaborative submission from the 3 major academic research institutions in the region inducing
UC San Diego (UCSD), The Scripps Research Foundation (TSRI), and San Diego State University. This
U2C/TL1 is designed to address the KUH mission areas, foster collaboration, and comprehensively address
training and mentoring across the continuum of career stages.
 The San Diego U2C/TL1 builds upon the outstanding local resources and prior experience in pre- and post-
doctoral research training. It builds upon recent successes fostering nephrology training through a T32 (2016-
2021), and recent post-doc successes at TSRI and SDSU. TSRI in an outstanding research institute, with 2 of
the last 5 years’ Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, and is ranked in the top 10 for graduate training in biology and
chemistry and has an outstanding track record for recruiting and training both pre- and post-doctoral scholars.
SDSU offers a pool of over 30,000 undergraduate 3000 graduate students annually, with nearly 30% from
under-represented minority (URM) backgrounds, and is a federally designated Hispanic serving institutions. It
already has multiple joint programs with UCSD and is heavily invested in expanding pre- and post-doctoral
training. UCSD is also a top 10 graduate program, offers over 6000 graduate students annually, and the only

10995749,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is leading contributor to disability.
Many conditions that cause MSK pain have a higher prevalence in females. Females often report heightened
sensitivity and lower pain tolerance in conditions where their male counterparts do not. Ischemia with
reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of MSK pain and exercise intolerance (through altered exercise
pressor reflexes (EPRs)). Repeated I/R injury is often seen in complex regional pain syndrome and
fibromyalgia, both of which have higher prevalence and prolonged pain in females compared to males. Clinical
and preclinical research have linked sex hormones to pain. Prolactin (PRL) and the Prolactin receptor (Prlr)
play a prominent role in inflammatory pain in females through dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neuron sensitization.
However, it is not yet known what roles PRL and Prlr play in ischemic myalgia. Pilot data demonstrated that
prolonged behavioral hypersensitivity in females with repeated I/R correlates with upregulation in STAT3,
TRPV1 and IL1R1 mRNA in the DRGs, while males show different transcriptional mechanisms. This may be
due to sex-specific activation of AU-rich element RNA binding protein 1 (AUF1) in female DRGs. AUF1
regulates I/R-related behaviors and IL1r1 and TRPV1 expression and is known to be modulated by STAT3.
Finally, Prlr antagonists not only inhibited female pain-like behaviors after I/R, but they also blocked the
upregulation of STAT3, IL1r1, TRPV1 and AUF1. Therefore, we will test the central hypothesis that
prolactin receptor modulates prolonged hypersensitivity following repeated ischemic injury in a sex-
dependent manner. Transgenic and pharmacological approaches will be used to determine effects of Prlr on
nociception and cardiovascular reflexes through specific neuronal subpopulations following repeated ischemic
injury in males and females. Pain-related behavioral assays, EPR tests, ex vivo forepaw muscle/median and
ulnar nerves/DRG/spinal cord single unit electrophysiological recording preparations, and molecular analyses
(realtime PCR and RNA-Seq) of DRGs will be conducted. Aim 1 will determine the neuronal subtypes
containing Prlr that modulate hypersensitivity after repeated I/R injury through knockout (KO) of Prlr in
TRPV1+ sensory neurons. Aim 2 will determine the transcriptional mechanisms within sensory neurons
that modulate prolonged hypersensitivity following repeated I/R injury and test the working hypothesis
that neuronal (TRPV1+ vs all sensory neurons) STAT3, downstream of Prlr, regulates pain-like behaviors and
EPRs after repeated I/R injury in females through activation of AUF1. This research will be the first to assess
the sex-dependent role of Prlr in MSK pain and will provide some of the first evidence to support development
of sex-based, treatment strategies for ischemic myalgia."

Type I Diabetes (T1D) is a T cell mediated autoimmune which is dramatically increasing in incidence. The
pathogenesis of T1D is complex and involves the infiltration of β cell-specific CD8 T cells into the pancreas and
progressive destruction of insulin-producing b cells, resulting in loss of glucose homeostasis. Utilizing the
clinically relevant Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, the Schietinger lab recently discovered a β
cell-specific stem-like CD8 T cell population in the pancreatic lymph node (pLN) which self-renews and gives
rise to differentiated progeny that migrate to the pancreas and destroy β cells; pancreatic T cells are short-lived
and stem-like T cells in the pLN must continuously seed the pancreas to sustain β cell destruction. In this
application I aim to understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine autoimmune
T cell differentiation. In aim 1, I will determine how and where stem-T cells self-renew and differentiate, employing
imaging cytometry and spatial transcriptomics technologies. In aim 2, I will define the functional role of
transcription factors associated with T cell stemness through gain and loss of function approaches. Finally, in
aim 3, I will ask whether perturbation of pLN intranodal positioning or inhibition of stem-T cell associated signaling
molecules disrupt autoimmune T cell differentiation and prevent T1D onset. These proposed studies are
designed to obtain a deep mechanistic understanding of the spatiotemporal and molecular factors that determine
autoimmune T cell differentiation which could lead to novel therapeutic targets for T1D and other T cell-mediated
autoimmune diseases."

 The role of glymphatic system for brain health has been established in recent studies. Specifically, the
removal of brain waste from the brain parenchyma through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is the key
mechanism for maintaining brain health, and compromise of glymphatic activity is associated with
neuropathological conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury). It is of
great interest to identify interventional approaches to enhance glymphatic activity, specifically the CSF
circulation. The goal of this study is to modulate glymphatic activities through the use of oscillating
electromagnetic field, at the slow wave frequency (typically observed in non-REM sleep and anesthetized
states) that enhances CSF movement and brain waste clearance. The proposed animal study in pigs, if
successfully completed, is expected to create a new glymphatic modulation paradigm (translatable to humans)
with significant implications for brain health improvement and intervention of neurological disorders.
 In aim 1 of the study we plan to measure the global impact of slow wave entrainment on brain waste
clearance. Sub-aim 1-1: We will use MRI-gradient-based neuromodulation (termed MRI-stim) to achieve slow-
wave entrainment in propofol-anesthetized pigs, and then assess glymphatic activity improvement through
analyzing brain waste clearance in CSF samples (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, total tau, and phosphorylated tau). Sub-aim
1-2: We will use TMS-based slow-wave entrainment to modulate glymphatic activity, and assess changes of
brain waste clearance in CSF samples. Exploratory sub-aim: We will perform an exploratory study that
compares brain waste levels (measured from CSF samples) before and after applying glymphatic modulation
to pigs with pharmacologically induced elevation of amyloid beta level in the brains (specifically, with
intravenously injected amyloid beta entering brains through pharmacologically compromised blood-brain
barrier). EEG signals will be concurrently measured to confirm brain wave entrainment.
 In aim 2 we will measure the regional impact of slow wave entrainment on brain and glymphatic
physiology. Sub-aim 2-1: we will use unified MRI-stim and imaging pulse sequences, that are capable of
achieving slow-wave entrainment as well as acquiring multi-contrast MRI data, in pigs anesthetized with
propofol. Multi-contrast MRI data (dynamic diffusion MRI; phase-contrast MRI and ferumoxytol-based T2*-
weighted MRI) will be acquired at multiple time points before and after slow-wave entrainment, so that
neuromodulation induced dynamic changes in glymphatic activity (reflecting influx and clearance of CSF and
ISF) can be quantified. EEG and ECG data will be concurrently obtained throughout the neuromodulation-
neuroimaging sessions. Sub-aim 2-2: we will use our MRI-compatible TMS-based slow-wave entrainment to
enhance glymphatic activity in propofol-anesthetized pigs, and measure changes in glymphatic physiology with
multi-contrast MRI."
10991215,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The current standard measure of OSA, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) underestimates women’s OSA
severity compared to men, which may lead to missed diagnoses, thus increasing women’s risk for
cardiovascular disease, metabolic and mood disorders, and poor daytime functioning. Most of the early
evidence to support the use of AHI as a measure of OSA severity has been validated in men. There is a
pressing need to identify a reliable biomarker of OSA severity in order to minimize sex and gender inequities in
in diagnosis and management of OSA. We propose to assess night-to-night variability in novel OSA severity
metrics and assess their impact on day-to-day sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress towards characterization
of reliable biomarkers of disease severity. The proposed study will leverage cutting-edge sleep monitoring
technology (Cerebra Sleep System) supporting the data collection in the participant’s home over 7 nights. The
study will also collect daytime functioning information several times per day via ecological momentary
assessments (EMA). We will enroll participants from two Sleep Medicine Centers associated with the
University of Pittsburgh and the University of Kansas Medical Center which will allow for a robust recruitment of
300 participants, 100 men, and 200 women balanced by menopausal status. Using available multiple night
recordings, we will assess the within- and between-subject variability of key sleep-disordered breathing
physiological traits (total and sleep stage-specific AHI, hypoxic burden, and pulse rate responses to respiratory
events and to arousals) and determine the role of sex as a potential contributor of between-subject variability in
these traits (Aim 1). Next, we will assess the temporal relationship between novel OSA severity parameters,
sleep traits and daytime function using key objective (sleep duration, architecture, depth, microstructure) and
self-reported sleep traits, as well as EMA of daytime sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress (Aim 2). We will
assess the temporal effects of OSA severity parameters on daytime function, determine whether these effects
are mediated by objective sleep traits, and establish whether sex and gender moderate these associations.
Our central hypothesis is that men and women require distinct definitions of OSA severity, because the
mechanisms explaining how sleep disordered breathing impact daytime functioning will be different between
sexes. This study has the potential to create a new paradigm in OSA research that will lead to novel
approaches to OSA severity definitions and improve long term health outcomes for women and men."

Transgender women (TW) have the highest rates of new HIV infections in the US yet are less likely to be aware
of, use, or adhere to PrEP. This is especially worrisome as new modalities beyond daily oral (i.e. injectable,
longer acting pills) are quickly coming on the market, making decision making and clarifying preferences crucial
to uptake. Importantly, missing in much of the research on barriers to PrEP uptake are the voices of young (15-
24) trans women (YTW), who may also experience age-related barriers to PrEP decision making, such as
confidentiality and conflicts with family during transition, and lack of a supportive community with credible
spokespeople whom they trust. No interventions have developed decision support tools (DSTs) to help YTW
make decisions about PrEP in line with their individual preferences and cultural values delivered in non-
traditional venues that meet YTW where they are. The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability and promise of efficacy of an electronic health DST called QUEEN-P (QUestions to
Empower and ENgage with PrEP) to increase PrEP informed decision making among YTW in Philadelphia.
Using commercial marketing techniques – perceptual mapping and vector message modeling – and grounded in
the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, QUEEN-P will be delivered via tablets or other devices in novel
locations (mobile vans, house and ball events), working with community partners known to be trusted by YTW.
Specific aims are: 1. Assess YTW perceptions of PrEP, different delivery methods and potential barriers to
initiation and adherence. We will establish community and scientific advisory boards (CAB/SAB) made up of
YTW and healthcare providers and community advocates, survey YTW (n=100) and use perceptual mapping
analyses to develop targeted messages, elicit feedback from the CAB/SAB on content and delivery of QUEEN-P;
2. Develop the QUEEN-P eHealth DST and assess usability and acceptability. We will develop a prototype DST
and concept-test messages and features with our CAB/SAB for feedback on acceptability, revise it based on
feedback and conduct user testing with YTW (n=20); 3. Pilot the intervention to assess for promise of efficacy in
engaging YTW in PrEP informed decision making and assess interest in and outreach to community clinical
partners for PrEP. We will conduct a pilot test with YTW (n=60) in Philadelphia randomized to an “Enhanced”
(QUEEN-P + navigation to culturally competent PrEP providers) or “Basic” study arm (basic PrEP information
and a list of resources). To assess promise of efficacy, we will compare outreach to clinical partners and
decisional conflict (primary outcomes) at 3-month follow-up and assess decision preparation, self-reported
knowledge and attitudes, and PrEP uptake (secondary outcomes; immediate post, 3 month follow-up).
Qualitative exit interviews will inform feasibility and acceptability. This pilot study will examine the potential
impact of using technology based, salient, gender-responsive interventions to improve PrEP informed decision
making in a population at high risk of HIV acquisition."

cytotoxicity, as well as the persistence and safety of CD52-KO VSTs in vivo. In this study, we will address the
following specific aims: 1) To establish the biological activity of multivirus-specific CD52-KO T cells in comparison
with non-edited virus-specific T cells, and 2) To determine if CD52-KO enables T cell persistence and efficacy
in the presence of alemtuzumab in vivo. To evaluate CD52-KO as a preventative cellular therapy, we propose
to optimize CRISPR/Cas9 editing of rapidly-expanded multiviral T cells (targeting cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), and adenovirus) from healthy donors, followed by extensive characterization of the phenotype and
function of CD52-KO VSTs versus mock-edited VSTs, including surface markers, cytokine profile, single cell
RNA-sequencing, and T cell receptor sequencing. Using a mouse model, we will evaluate the persistence and
safety of CD52-KO VSTs in the presence of alemtuzumab. To assess function in vivo, we will test CD52-KO or
mock-edited VSTs against EBV-lymphoblastoid tumors in mice, in the presence or absence of alemtuzumab.
Finally, we will perform off-targeting analyses of the lead single guide RNA candidates by in silico and orthogonal
testing of CD52-KO and mock-edited VSTs. We hypothesize that CD52-KO will have negligible impact on VST
phenotype and function, and will enable persistence and activity in the presence of alemtuzumab in vivo.
Completion of this study would provide a novel antiviral therapy which could reduce virus-associated morbidity
in HSCT, and will develop a pipeline for production of a next generation of gene-modified VSTs to enhance
efficacy in immunocompromised patients."

 Mental illness is increasingly understood through the lens of brain development, as these disorders are
highly heritable and often emerge during the transition from childhood to adulthood. Thus, it is essential to
investigate functional brain development and its genetic underpinnings. The adult human cortex is organized
along a principal hierarchy indexed by functional MRI connectivity, anchored on one end by regions involved in
perception and action and on the other by regions responsible for abstract cognition. The extent to which the
cortex functionally aligns with this hierarchy has been associated with both development and diverse
psychopathology, suggesting that abnormal hierarchical development may be mechanistically related to broad
psychiatric vulnerability. Using a normative modeling framework, this proposal will test the overarching
hypothesis that deviations in the development of the principal hierarchy are associated with transdiagnostic
psychopathology burden and genetic risk. To do so, I will use four large-scale developmental datasets that
include fMRI and clinical data: the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC, N=1,559), the Lifespan
Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D, N=1,350), the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample
(NKI-RS, N=426) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD, N=11,878). This proposal
aims to 1) investigate how deviations in principal hierarchy development relate to transdiagnostic clinical
psychopathology., and 2) investigate the role of the principal hierarchy as an intermediate phenotype of genetic
risk for transdiagnostic psychopathology. This work will advance our understanding of functional cortical
development, its genetic basis, and its relationship to the emergence of psychiatric risk. Findings from this
study will lay a foundation for future endeavors to identify diagnostic markers, therapeutic targets, and
interventional windows of opportunity for neuropsychiatric disorders. Study feasibility will be ensured by expert
guidance from an integrated mentorship team comprised of Drs. Aaron Alexander-Bloch, Theodore
Satterthwaite, Dylan Tisdall, Monica Calkins, and Laura Almasy. Mentorship from these experts, along with a
coordinated program of coursework, seminars, workshops, conferences, and clinical training, will provide the
applicant with rigorous training in functional MRI, developmental psychopathology, and psychiatric genetics,
enabling him to pursue a future career as an independently-funded physician-scientist."
10995082,"The overarching goal of our proposal is to develop a pre-cancer atlas of skin cancer. Skin is an ideal model to
study the early phases of tumorigenesis because it is easily accessible for monitoring and non-invasive
sampling. As the primary barrier against the environment, skin cells acquire large numbers of somatic
mutations during each person’s life, fueling the growth of a diverse set of tumors from the various cell types in
the organ. Our atlas will focus on the evolution of melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which
respectively arise from melanocytes and keratinocytes, because these are the deadliest forms of skin cancer,
responsible for an estimated 20,000 deaths per year in the United States. Skin is also an immunologically
active organ, providing opportunities to study the role of the immune system in cancer development. The role
of immune surveillance in restraining skin cancers is illustrated by the dramatic increase of skin cancers in
immunosuppressed individuals and the therapeutic successes of immune-based therapies. There is a major,
unmet need to understand how the immune system interacts with tumors early in their development. To
address this need, we designed an atlas to deduce how the immune system shapes tumor evolution during the
transition from the pre-cancerous to cancerous stage. This will be accomplished through a series of molecular
assays, performed on precursor-associated cancers (i.e., skin cancers with an adjacent pre-cursor lesion).
Specifically, we will perform: 1. Bulk-cell DNA-sequencing, 2. T-cell and B-cell receptor clonotyping, 3. Bulk-cell
RNA-sequencing, 4 spatial transcriptomics (10X Visium), 5. Spatial transcriptomics (10X Xenium), and 6.
Spatial proteomics (IBEX) and compare the individual progression stages of each precursor-associated tumor.
Collectively, these assays will reveal the key genetic and immunological events occurring at the transition from
pre-cancer to cancer. Completion of these studies will reveal candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
and possibly novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our team has a collaborative track record of studying
the evolution of skin cancers with clinical impact. Our work has contributed to the World Health Organization’s
classification of melanoma, and we have discovered multiple biomarkers that have entered routine use in
clinical practice to diagnose melanocytic neoplasms. As another major component of our center, we will
establish a core, with dedicated personnel, charged with the goal of engaging with the HTAN network, the
broader scientific community, and the lay public."
10995132,"Asthma is one of the most common physical health conditions in World Trade Center (WTC) responders,
affecting approximately one third of individuals. Moreover, most WTC responders with asthma continue to
report substantial symptoms, experience poor disease control, and have high acute resource utilization and
healthcare-related costs. Thus, asthma remains a major cause of morbidity and compromised quality of life in
this population. Management of asthma in WTC-exposed individuals can be challenging. High prevalence of
physical comorbidities (e.g., chronic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea) and mental health problems (e.g., post-
traumatic stress disorder, depression) that contribute to increased asthma morbidity are common among WTC
responders. Active self-management is critical for achieving adequate long-term asthma control. Unfortunately,
low adherence to self-management behaviors (SMB) is a common problem and may involve unique pathways
(e.g., WTC-specific disease and medication beliefs) in WTC responders. Cognitive decline due to aging and
WTC exposures can further complicate asthma self-management. The complex constellation of medical,
cognitive, and mental health conditions accompanying asthma in WTC responders necessitates
comprehensive self-management support (SMS) interventions to improve their outcomes and quality of life.
Unfortunately, there are no available interventions to improve the outcomes of this population. We previously
developed and successfully tested the Supporting Self-Management Behaviors for Adults (SaMBA) program.
The SaMBA model of SMS is an evidence-based approach grounded in a theory of health behavior that is
unique among chronic illness SMS programs because its strategy involves comprehensively screening for
barriers to effective self-management and disease control and couples it with tailored, theory-based, barrier-
specific interventions. In this study, we propose to adapt the SaMBA model to the needs of WTC responders
with asthma. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Enhance and adapt an asthma SMS model for WTC responders with
asthma (SaMBA-WTC), with input from WTC responders and other stakeholders to validate content and
protocols and 2) Conduct a pilot RCT of SaMBA-WTC to determine feasibility and preliminary impact, in
preparation for a fully powered trial. We will conduct a pilot RCT (n=58) of the SaMBA-WTC model delivered to
WTC responders for 3 months vs. a time-matched asthma education attention control. Data will be collected at
the end of the 3-month intervention (3-month visit) at 3 months later (6-month visit to assess sustainability).
Clinical outcome measures will include asthma control, quality of life, resource use and measures of asthma
self-management. The intervention is significant for its attention to the full range of factors that contribute to
suboptimal self-management and poor outcomes among WTC responders with uncontrolled asthma. It is
innovative for its comprehensive and theory-based screening approach to identifying and addressing coping
strategies and barriers to effective SMB in asthma in this specific population."
10995139,"The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral
Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Ms. Ahrens, a third-year
doctoral student at the University of Washington School of Nursing. The long-term goal of this training is for
Ms. Ahrens to develop into an influential independent researcher in a research-intensive academic setting with
a research focus on improving Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium prevention and management for patients who
speak a language other than English (LOE) to improve health equity for LOE patients in critical care. ICU
delirium is a consequential sequela of critical illness that affects up to 70% of ICU patients and is associated
with increased length of stay, hospital costs, and risk of death. The primary preventative and mitigation
strategy for ICU delirium is the ABCDEF bundle, which includes: Assess and treat pain; Both spontaneous
awakening trial and breathing trial; Choice of sedation; Delirium assessment; Early mobility; and Family
engagement. Due to a language barrier, LOE critically ill patients may be at increased risk of not receiving full
ABCDEF bundle components, as four out of the six bundle components are reliant on effective communication
for task completion and accurate assessments. Previous literature finds that professional medical interpreters
are used less than 20% of the time when they are necessary in medical settings. Critically ill patients have
additional barriers to professional medical interpreter use, and additional tools to facilitate cross-language
communication are needed. The contributors to health disparities for LOE patients in ICU delirium care have
not been previously studied. To address this gap, the proposed study will use qualitative and mixed-methods
implementation science design to investigate determinants of fidelity to the ABCDEF bundle for LOE critically ill
patients, guided by the health equity implementation framework and the implementation fidelity framework. Aim
1 of the study will qualitatively assess the facilitators and barriers to ABCDEF bundle fidelity for LOE patients
from 32-48 key stakeholders in ICU delirium prevention, including healthcare workers who implement the
ABCDEF bundle in the ICU at the University of Washington Medical Center and LOE ICU survivors who
received ICU delirium prevention care. Aim 2 of the study will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
appropriateness of the VidaTalkTM application as a method to enhance communication between healthcare
workers and linguistically diverse patients while performing ABCDEF bundle tasks. The findings from this study
and associated training will provide foundational knowledge to generate a program of independent research for
Ms. Ahrens with the goal of improving health equity for LOE patients in critical care."
10995823,"SUMMARY
A hallmark of both embryonic and adult stem cells is their dependence on low translation rates to maintain an
active self-renewal and undifferentiated state independent of the cell cycle. As initiation is the rate-limiting step
of translation, currently, it is widely accepted that the accumulation of tRNA fragments (tRFs) negatively regulates
translation initiation leading to global translation attenuation. Notably, NSUN2, an RNA methyl-transferase that
converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (m5C), is required for decoding activity and stability of tRNAs and
coding/noncoding mRNAs. NSUN2 mutations have been broadly involved in developmental defects, including
male infertility, Dubowitz-like syndrome, and intellectual disability, as well as in cancer. Hypo-m5C-methylated
tRNAs accumulated in NSUN2 knockout (KO) or mutant somatic cells are cleaved by endonuclease angiogenin,
and the resulting tRFs inhibit translation initiation globally. Lower protein synthesis correlates well with lower
NSUN2 expression in somatic/cancer stem cells than committed or differentiated cells under homeostasis and
tumorigenesis. However, this cannot explain the translation attenuation in pluripotent stem cells, the versatile
cellular system for modeling diseases and early development, because NSUN2 is highly enriched under the self-
renewal and undifferentiated state of these cells. Moreover, our preliminary data show that NSUN2 KO ESCs
are well maintained without global translation reduction but with a hyper-pluripotent state concomitant with the
upregulation of the naïve marker NANOG protein expression. This proposal aims to study m5C RNA targets of
NSUN2 and understand how they are regulated at the translation level to dissect unique functions of NSUN2-
regulated epitranscriptome in the translation control of stem cell pluripotency, which is fundamental to
developmental biology and disease modeling. This proposal will explore the liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS) potential of m5C mRNAs and their readers for translation control. We will test the hypothesis that NSUN2-
modified m5C mRNAs are sequestered into P-bodies (PBs) through the RNA-binding protein YBX1-mediated
LLPS process, leading to translation attenuation of NSUN2 targets in pluripotent stem cells. Two aims are
proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) Identify m5C RNA targets of NSUN2 and YBX1 for translational control of
stem cell pluripotency. 2) Establish LLPS-mediated translation repression of m5C RNAs in pluripotent stem cells.
The proposed work will fill a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of NSUN2-mediated RNA
methylation for specialized translation control in pluripotent stem cells. It will also establish a novel paradigm for
translational attenuation through the phase separation potential of m5C-modified RNAs and their reader proteins."
10995910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major component of the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role
in the orchestration of immunosuppression, cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as in
resistance to cancer therapies. As the bulk of TAMs in established tumors arise from circulating monocytes,
targeting this differentiation process represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. Notably, the cytokines
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF) are both associated with TAM differentiation. Nonetheless, M-CSF and GM-CSF can also have distinct
functional effects as they stimulate different receptors and downstream signaling pathways. In recent years,
studies in the emerging field of immunometabolism have demonstrated that changes in intracellular metabolism
downstream of cytokine activation can actively regulate immune cell differentiation and function. Despite all this,
the differences in TAM-associated functions induced by M-CSF and GM-CSF in differentiated cells and whether
early differential metabolic changes in monocytes contribute to these functional differences remain poorly
understood. My preliminary data shows that GM-CSF derived macrophages have significantly higher expression
of the TAM markers CD206 and PD-L1 than M-CSF derived macrophages, and that these differences and others
are already conspicuous in monocytes after only 7 hours of cytokine stimulation. Interestingly, my preliminary
data also shows that GM-CSF, but not M-CSF, results in a transient 7-hour period of prominent glycolytic
oscillations in monocytes. Together, these results indicate that M-CSF and GM-CSF can produce unique effects
on monocyte metabolism and TAM marker expression in differentiated cells. Considering previous studies and
my preliminary findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that M-CSF and GM-CSF derived macrophages
exhibit significant differences in TAM-associated functional characteristics due to early differential metabolic
changes in monocytes. I propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize
differences in TAM-associated functional attributes and their regulation between M-CSF and GM-CSF at early
and end points of differentiation of monocytes into TAM-like cells; Aim 2: Investigate whether differences in early
metabolic changes induced by M-CSF and GM-CSF in monocytes contribute to differences in TAM marker
expression in differentiated cells. These aims will be achieved through a combination of immunology, cancer
biology, genome-wide profiling, and cell metabolism techniques with human monocytes isolated from healthy
donor peripheral blood and differentiated in in vitro cultures to TAM-like cells. Collectively, the results of this work
will advance our understanding of important functional differences between M-CSF and GM-CSF induced TAM-
like cells and potentially reveal novel metabolic mechanisms that control TAM-associated functions, which may
ultimately improve TAM-targeting cancer therapeutics."
10980062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fear of recurrence (FoR) is a pervasive, distressing concern among breast cancer survivors (BCS) that
persists for years after cancer treatment. Long-term survivors identify help with managing FoR as their most
pressing unmet need. Effective and scalable FoR interventions are needed to address the salient emotional,
cognitive, and behavioral components of FoR. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is well suited to address these
components, but patients face many obstacles to psychosocial care due to a lack of available providers, cost,
and time constraints. eHealth interventions can overcome these obstacles.
We developed, refined, and evaluated FoRtitude 1.0, a 4 week targeted eHealth intervention designed to teach
BCS CBT strategies to manage FoR through didactic content and interactive tools. We randomized 196 BCS
with moderate or severe FoR to CBT or an attention control (health management content, HMC) and observed
a significant reduction in FoR from pre-post intervention among all BCS. While we hypothesized CBT would be
superior to HMC, our qualitative data indicate CBT and HMC are mechanistically distinct in reducing FoR. We
also found BCS randomized to telephone-based motivational interviewing (telecoaching-MI) had higher
eHealth adherence and retention compared to no telecoaching.
The FoRtitude 2.0 trial addresses limitations from our last trial by enhancing intervention content through
delivering CBT and HMC, adding culturally responsive content, doubling intervention duration (8 week), long-
term follow-up, and more rigorously designed control conditions. We added secondary endpoints to assess
healthcare utilization and a physiological marker of chronic stress: allostatic load. This phase III, randomized
controlled trial (RCT) is designed to evaluate the efficacy of FoRtitude 2.0 augmented by telecoaching-MI to
reduce FoR among BCS compared to two controls: an attention control and a usual care control.
We will recruit a national, diverse sample of 800 BCS from NCI Community Oncology Research Program
(NCORP) Community and Minority/Underserved Sites. We will stratify accrual by race to enroll 300 Black BCS
and 500 non-Black BCS (Hispanic and non-Hispanic). Among female BCS with moderate or severe FoR
enrolled from NCORP Sites, we propose the following Aims: Aim I. Evaluate the efficacy of FoRtitude 2.0 to
reduce FoR at 3 months (1 month post-intervention) compared to attention control and usual care. Aim II.
Evaluate the efficacy of FoRtitude 2.0 to improve psychological and behavioral consequences of FoR,
including anxiety, depression, HRQL, and health care utilization. Exploratory Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of
FoRtitude 2.0 to reduce allostatic load from baseline to 3 months compared to attention control and usual care.
Findings will contribute to establishing an evidence-based scalable eHealth intervention targeting FoR that can
be widely disseminated at low cost, leading to future research on the dissemination and implementation of
FoRtitude among survivors of all cancer types and improving the quality of cancer survivorship."
10979598,"ABSTRACT
The present crisis of opioid addiction in the United States highlights how an initial exposure to opioids, often
oxycodone, as a medical patient can lead to escalation of use, misuse and eventually addiction. Chronic
exposure to oxycodone produces tolerance to many of its effects, and it is this development of tolerance that
leads to taking increasingly higher doses and to withdrawal upon abstinence. Drug-induced adaptations in gene
expression and neuronal function are thought to underlie the development of tolerance and withdrawal, but the
mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear. We have found that the habenula-interpeduncular nucleus
(IPN), which plays a prominent role in limiting nicotine intake and in nicotine withdrawal responds to chronic
nicotine by upregulating nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), and that this same adaptation occurs in response to
chronic oxycodone exposure. Acute exposure to oxycodone is not sufficient to upregulate NOS1 in the IPN.
Using viral approaches, purification of tagged ribosomes followed by next gen sequencing and oral oxycodone
in the drinking water of adult male and female mice, we will examine gene expression in the IPN – both in the
presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic IPN neurons - and correlate neuronal calcium dynamics with intoxication
and withdrawal behavior. We will also examine the contribution of NOS1 to drug-induced changes in gene
expression in neuronal activity and axon terminals from the medial habenula within the interpeduncular nucleus.
Together these aims will establish a preclinical model of opioid tolerance that may provide a basis for evaluating
potential new therapeutics in the treatment of opioid use disorder."
10979822,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Different sensory modalities elicit distinct neural signatures in the brain, however, a fundamental subset of
circuits for perception is shared across modalities. Subcortical arousal systems are known to influence long-
lasting states such as sleep/wake and levels of vigilance, but their role in dynamic short-term modulation of
arousal shared across perceptual modalities has been little studied. Subcortical systems are increasingly
recognized as playing an important role in cognition. Recent work suggests that multiple parallel arousal
systems in the thalamus, upper brainstem and basal forebrain contribute to phasic modulation of perception
through a transient increase in activity following sensory stimuli. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that a
transient pulse of activity in the intralaminar thalamus, upper brainstem and basal forebrain occurs after
sensory stimuli across diverse modalities, augmenting perceptual awareness. If confirmed, this may identify
both fundamental circuits for normal perception and potential therapeutic targets for disorders where
perception is impaired. We will investigate shared subcortical arousal circuits in perception using techniques
with complementary strengths based on promising initial studies. We found that large fMRI data sets showed
shared transient activation in thalamus, midbrain and basal forebrain with visual, tactile and gustatory tasks. To
investigate this further, our first aim will contrast perceived vs not perceived visual, auditory and tactile stimuli
to study shared fMRI signals in subcortical arousal areas with both whole brain and high-resolution subcortical
methods. In our second aim, we will leverage recent findings that pupil, blink and microsaccade measurements
combined with machine learning can isolate the components of subcortical perception-related fMRI signals
which are independent of task report. These methods will be used to identify shared fMRI signals in subcortical
arousal systems with visual, auditory and tactile perception independent of report. Finally, direct access to the
human intralaminar thalamus through devices implanted in epilepsy patients, provides a unique opportunity for
both thalamic recording and stimulation. In our third aim, we will use this approach to record and stimulate the
intralaminar thalamus to determine the role of this key subcortical arousal area in perception. Understanding
the role of transient increases in subcortical arousal shared across perceptual modalities will both shed light on
fundamental mechanisms of perception, and provide new treatment avenues for perceptual disorders."

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is an oncogenic driver that is
frequently overexpressed or mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many EGFR inhibitors are
used to treat NSCLC, but drug resistance is common. Necitumumab (Neci), an EGFR-directed monoclonal
antibody, is approved for a subset of NSCLC harboring wild type (WT) EGFR but its efficacy is very limited.
Patients whose tumors harbor mutated EGFR often derive significant benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), but resistance invariably develops. Mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors is complex
and not fully known. Our objective in this project is to evaluate a new agent for overcoming drug resistance
in NSCLC using preclinical models. The project builds on our recent discovery that a recombinant human
protein, PEPDG278D, induces the degradation of EGFR and HER2 by binding to their extracellular domain.
HER2 is closely related to EGFR and a key contributor to drug resistance in NSCLC. PEPDG278D is an
enzymatically inactive mutant of human peptidase D, also known as prolidase important for collagen
metabolism. We also find that PEPDG278D induces the degradation of mutated EGFR and HER2 that occur in
NSCLC and strongly inhibits NSCLC cells and tumors resistant to current EGFR inhibitors. We envision that
targeted degradation of EGFR and HER2 is more effective than only inhibiting the activation or activity of
their tyrosine kinase, as kinase-independent functions are also important for their oncogenic signaling. Our
overall hypothesis is that NSCLC cells and tumors resistant to current EGFR inhibitors are vulnerable to
targeted degradation of EGFR and HER2 by PEPDG278D and that PEPDG278D induces the degradation of not
only WT EGFR and HER2 but also a broad spectrum of clinically relevant mutants. We will test the
hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) to assess PEPDG278D for inhibition of oncogenic signaling and antitumor
activity in NSCLC cells and tumors expressing WT EGFR, and to compare PEPDG278D to Neci; 2) to
determine if PEPDG278D inhibits the oncogenic signaling of a broad spectrum of EGFR and HER2 mutants in
NSCLC cells by inducing their degradation and to compare PEPDG278D to osimertinib (Osi) which is a third
generation EGFR TKI and the preferred EGFR TKI for NSCLC patients; and 3) to determine if Osi-resistant
NSCLC cells and tumors are sensitive to PEPDG278D and if combining the two agents enhances therapeutic
outcome. PEPDG278D and Osi complement each other mechanistically in targeting EGFR mutants. The
proposed research is significant, because it addresses drug resistance in NSCLC which remains a major
clinical problem. We expect 1) to show that PEPDG278D is therapeutically superior to Neci and Osi; 2) to
establish the novel concept that inducing the degradation of EGFR and HER2 is an effective strategy for
overcoming drug resistance in NSCLC. These findings may generate strong enthusiasm for clinical
evaluation of PEPDG278D in NSCLC and stimulate research of other EGFR and HER2 degraders."
10979609,"Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Interventions that ameliorate PAE’s impact are a high priority. One such intervention is the micronutrient choline, a one-carbon (1C) donor essential for healthy brain development; choline improves cognitive outcomes in both FASD and its preclinical models. However, its benefits are not always clear, and an important modulator of these responses are the known polymorphisms in choline- and 1C-metabolizing genes that affect the metabolism, transport, and utilization of choline and its methyl groups and thus choline needs. We recently reported that for one such gene, the choline transporter SLC44A1, minor alleles known to increase choline needs are associated with greater memory improvement in alcohol-exposed children who received supplemental choline; that is, those who carry the effect alleles have a higher choline need that is met by the supplement. Moreover, in a separate study of control and alcohol-exposed children who never received choline supplements, those same alleles are again associated with greater cognitive impairment, indicating that alleles that increase choline needs also increase the vulnerability to PAE, likely because their greater needs went unmet by current dietary practice. Here, we further explore the choline genetic landscape of those with PAE to identify additional choline-related polymorphisms that modulate cognition and behavior. Specifically, we hypothesize that select polymorphisms in additional genes that affect choline needs significantly influence behavioral outcomes in FASD. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that there exist polymorphisms in additional choline-related genes that influence behavioral outcomes in those with PAE who consume normal dietary choline (Gene x Exposure). This aim utilizes an existing dataset from those with PAE who were deeply genotyped and phenotyped with respect to neurobehavior. Aim 2 directly tests the influence of a strong candidate gene identified in our preliminary data, ALDH1L1, on cognition and behavior. ALDH1L1 controls the size of choline-derived 1C pools and therefore choline levels. Using an established haploinsufficient mouse model, we will establish 1L1’s role in affecting behavior and vulnerability to PAE. These findings (i) provide novel insight into how alleles affecting choline needs impact behavior in any population; (ii) further informs how choline improves outcomes in FASD; and (iii) informs the optimization of future choline interventions for at-risk pregnancies and individuals. This study represents an early application of Personalized Medicine to FASD."

Lateral patellar dislocation is a common traumatic injury for young, active subjects. Approximately 50% of
patients progress to symptomatic patellofemoral post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) by 25 years after
dislocation. Reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is currently the most popular approach
for surgical patellar stabilization. Stabilizing the patella to prevent additional dislocations is generally considered
preventative for progressive cartilage degradation that can initiate post-traumatic OA, but preliminary data
indicates ongoing patellofemoral cartilage degradation out to multiple years following MPFL reconstruction.
Preliminary data indicates over constraint of the patella following MPFL reconstruction adversely influences
cartilage. Aim 1 will characterize cartilage degradation for fifty patients following MPFL reconstruction for
comparison to twenty-five healthy controls. The MPFL reconstruction patients will be recruited at least five years
following surgery. All subjects will be evaluated at two time points, separated by two years. MRI-based T1ρ/T2
relaxation time mapping will quantify cartilage properties. Long T1ρ/T2 relaxation times indicate cartilage
degradation. The hypothesis for Aim 1 is that cartilage T1ρ/T2 relaxation times for the MPFL reconstruction group
will be longer than the control group and increase more dramatically over two years. Also, long T1ρ/T2 relaxation
times will be significantly correlated with morphological progression toward OA as well as pain and poor function
based on patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). Morphological grading will be based on comparisons
between post-operative MRI and previously acquired pre-operative MRI. PROMs will be quantified at each
evaluation and compared to an existing database of PROMs one year following MPFL reconstruction. Aim 2 will
correlate cartilage properties vs. patellofemoral constraint to determine if over constraint of the patella following
MPFL reconstruction contributes to progressive cartilage degradation. Measurements of knee alignment and
anatomy will characterize patellofemoral constraint. Changes in alignment from pre-operative to post-operative
MRI scans will be quantified. Weight-bearing cone beam CT will provide assessment of loaded alignment. The
hypothesis of Aim 2 is that measures indicating patellofemoral constraint will be significantly correlated with long
cartilage T1ρ/T2 relaxation times at least five years following MPFL reconstruction and progression of T1ρ/T2
relaxation times over the next two years. The data generated will immediately help guide patient selection and
surgical parameters for MPFL reconstruction to limit the risk of progressive cartilage degradation. The data will
also be used to design future clinical studies and trials focused on comparing MPFL reconstruction to other
treatment options and comparing between surgical parameters within MPFL reconstruction for patients at highest
risk of progressive cartilage degradation. The overall goal is to create a treatment algorithm for patellar
dislocations that emphasizes cartilage preservation."

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS)
from harmful substances such as plasma proteins and inorganic solutes. A non-invasive MRI
technique to detect subtle BBB dysfunction could be an extremely valuable tool for early diagnosis
of neurodegenerative disorders. Our team has developed a diffusion prepared pseudo-continuous
arterial spin labeling (OP-pCASL) technique for mapping BBB water exchange rate (kw), which
has been validated by preclinical studies and found to be associated with aging, small vascular
disease, APOE epsilon4 genotype, amyloid PET, and CSF Aβ-42 in cognitively normal subjects.
However, the OP-pCASL technique currently has low spatial resolution and cannot estimate the
permeability surface area product of water (PSw) due to a lack of venous compartment in its
modeling. Mapping both kw and PSw is significant because they assess different aspects of the
BBB and provide comprehensive information about its function. Changes in PSw can indicate a
combination of changes in capillary surface and permeability, making it a potential biomarker for
subtle BBB leakage across endothelial cells. In contrast, kw measures the exchange rate between
blood and tissue and can be more sensitive to transport mechanisms, e.g. AQP4 function, and
potentially linked to the glymphatic function. However, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms
of kw and PSw are still unclear. The proposed project aims to develop and optimize a highresolution
diffusion-weighted arterial spin labeling (OW-ASL) technique and mathematical models
to non-invasively quantify BBB kw and PSw simultaneously. The individual BBB kw and PSw
measurements will be evaluated for test-retest repeatability. The age-related changes of BBB
function and BBB dysfunction in cerebral small vessel disease (cSVO) will be investigated by
measuring kw and PSw in a cohort of healthy subjects across the lifespan of 18-90 years and
elderly subjects (age> 60 years) with cSVO from USC VCIO study. Finally, the mechanisms of
BBB water exchange will be studied in AQP4-knockout mice and in models of mannitol-induced
BBB disruption. The outcome of this project will be a cutting-edge OW-ASL pulse sequence and
post-processing pipeline that allows for high-resolution mapping of kw and PSw, with an
understanding of their neurophysiological mechanisms."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), but the
underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Despite efforts to control blood glucose levels, patients with
T1DM who meet glycemic targets (i.e., HbA1c ≤ 6.9%) are still at a 3-fold increased risk of CVD death. By
contrast, studies of a different type of diabetes called glucokinase maturity onset diabetes of the young (GCK-
MODY) have found that these individuals do not have an increased risk of CVD, despite having a similar level
of long-term high blood glucose.
Our previous research suggested that one important difference in CVD risk is that people with T1DM have
insulin resistance and those with GCK-MODY do not. Our data suggested that the presence of iatrogenic
hyperinsulinemia in T1DM—not hyperglycemia—was the principal factor contributing to the decreased insulin
sensitivity. This iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia occurs because patients with T1DM must deliver insulin into the
peripheral circulation rather than more physiologically into the hepatic portal circulation. Because this delivery
route bypasses first-pass hepatic clearance, people with T1DM have 2½-fold higher peripheral insulin levels
than people who have normal insulin secretion. These studies imply that reducing iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia
can improve insulin sensitivity and possibly other aspects of cardiometabolic risk. Insulin adjunctive therapies
may facilitate the needed reduction in hyperinsulinemia.
We will conduct paired experiments to investigate the effects of modifying iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia on three
markers of cardiometabolic risk: nitric oxide bioavailability (Aim 1), insulin sensitivity (Aim 2), and thrombotic
potential (Aim 3). We will compare the effect of lowering iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia in T1DM to the effect of
raising insulinemia by the same amount in individuals at low risk for cardiometabolic disease: those with GCK-
MODY and those without diabetes (control).
We will compare the three cardiometabolic risk markers in T1DM patients (n=13), GCK-MODY patients (n=7),
and those without diabetes (n=7) under conditions of high insulin levels (Hi-Ins, 20-25 μU/mL as seen in
T1DM) and normal insulin levels (Eu-Ins, 5-10 μU/mL, as seen in CGK-MODY and control). To allow T1DM
participants to acutely lower peripheral insulinemia to normal levels without consequent hyperglycemia, we will
use a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) as a research tool.
Overall, our goal is to determine how much reducing iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia using insulin adjunctive
therapy can improve CVD outcomes, and to understand the underlying mechanisms behind this effect. This
small, mechanistic pilot study will provide needed data to inform the development of larger trials of insulin
adjunctive insulin therapy in T1DM."

SUMMARY: Childhood obesity is one of the most common pediatric chronic diseases in the US. We have shown (HL136643) that over one year, children with obesity (CWO) can add four times as much fat weight as children without obesity (CWOO). However, it is unknown if this rate of increase in fat weight continues into adolescence, and whether respiratory function, exercise tolerance, or dyspnea on exertion (DOE) are progressively worsened by increasing obesity. Furthermore, there could be a sex difference in the effects of obesity, given the different growth characteristics for boys and girls. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the changes in body composition, lung function, exercise tolerance, and DOE after 6 years of aging in CWO and CWOO. In CWO, excess fat exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory system, particularly during exercise, potentially reducing exercise tolerance and leading to DOE. We have found that most of the respiratory effects in CWO are the result of low lung volume breathing, which exposes children to breathing limitations like expiratory flow limitation, gas exchange impairment, and greater perception of dyspnea. Our study approach will be to re-examine body composition, respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in CWO and CWOO who were originally studied as 8–12-year-olds (i.e., originally Tanner score ≤ 3; 90 participants; 26 CWOO & 64 CWO). Specific Aims: We will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1) CWO originally studied at 8-12 years old will demonstrate a greater increase in fat weight and lower respiratory function (i.e., altered pulmonary function & breathing mechanics at rest) than in CWOO originally studied at 8-12 years old; Aim 2) CWO originally studied at 8-12 years old will demonstrate lower exercise tolerance measured during graded cycle ergometry (peak V•O2 in ml/min/kg) than in CWOO originally studied at 8-12 years old, but not lower cardiorespiratory fitness (peak V•O2 in % of predicted based on ideal body wt.); and Aim 3) CWO originally studied at 8-12 years old will demonstrate greater DOE as evidenced by increased ratings of perceived breathlessness during constant load exercise cycling than in CWOO originally studied at 8-12 years old. These novel longitudinal results will have broad mechanistic relevance to our understanding of the effects of worsening obesity as children age."
10979730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are a mainstay for the chemotherapeutic regimen of BRCA
mutant ovarian and breast cancers. Despite initial positive responses, long -term clinical success with PARPi
therapy is limited owing to the inevitable emergence of resistance and the side effects associated with the
current dosage. We and others recently reported that loss of a nucleosome sliding enzyme, Amplified in
Liver Cancer 1, (ALC1), hypersensitizes BRCA mutant cancer cells to PARPi. Notably, ALC1 loss permits
killing of BRCA mutant cancer cells at sub-nanomolar PARPi dosage and restores PARPi sensitivity across
various engineered models of chemoresistance. Based on these observations, our overarching goal is to
employ ALC1-deficient BRCA mutant cancer cells to define the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that
can be exploited to circumvent clinical hurdles associated with PARPi. Our preliminary data highlight a role
of ALC1 mediated nucleosome sliding in promoting the repair of base damage lesions called abasic sites.
However, it is unclear how ALC1 loss generates abasic sites and how this contributes to PARPi
hypersensitivity in BRCA mutant cancer cells. The proposal addresses this knowledge gap via the following
Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will integrate in vitro reconstitution, genetic complementation analysis
and DNA repair and replication assays to define the mechanism(s) that lead to increased abasic sites on
the chromatin upon the loss of ALC1. These experiments will provide new mechanistic insights into how
perturbing chromatin remodeling involved in base damage repair can be leveraged for augmenting PARPi
sensitivity in BRCA mutant cancers. In Aim 2, we will use single-molecule replication tract labeling assays,
electron microscopy and CRISPR-based genetic editing of patient-derived primary cells to determine how
abasic sites results in remodeling of replication forks and generation of lesions that accentuate PARPi
sensitivity. These experiments will uncover how the communication between base damage repair and
replication forks can be exploited to enhance the therapeutic potential of PARPi. Our studies will provide the
foundation to develop new approaches to improve the efficacy and toxicity profile of clinically used PARPi
while simultaneously highlighting new biomarkers that can effectively predict PARPi responses in BRCA
mutant patients."
10979732,"Summary
Antitumor immunosurveillance by cytotoxic lymphocytes is generally conceived as a biochemical process in
which tumor specific markers are recognized by activating receptors on the lymphocyte surface. We have found,
however, that cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells also respond to the mechanical properties of cancer cells,
preferentially destroying targets that are physically stiffer. This mechanical form of immunosurveillance, which
we call mechanosurveillance, appears to be particularly relevant during metastasis, when cancer cells remodel
their cytoskeleton to invade new organs. In this proposal, we will investigate the interplay between
mechanosurveillance and the physical properties of the metastatic microenvironment. Cellular mechanics are
modulated continuously by cell-extrinsic biophysical signals. A particularly important manifestation of this
crosstalk, called mechanoreciprocity, induces cells in stiffer environments become stiffer themselves, and those
in softer locales to become softer. Whether environmentally-induced stiffening might sensitize cancer cells to
mechanosurveillance in vivo, however, has not been explored. This an interesting question because metastatic
microenvironments vary widely in their physical properties, ranging from very rigid (e.g. bone) to very soft (e.g.
lung). Enhanced mechanosurveillance in rigid microenvironments would establish a regime in which cytotoxic
lymphocytes control the spectrum of metastatic site preference by disproportionately suppressing outgrowth in
organs like the bone. Using a mouse model of metastasis, we have found that cancer cells colonizing the bone
are significantly stiffer than cancer cells colonizing the lung, and that the in vivo expansion of bone metastasis is
exquisitely sensitive to cytotoxic lymphocytes. Building on these preliminary observations, we propose that
microenvironmental stiffness dictates the efficacy of mechanosurveillance and that this relationship shapes both
metastatic site preference and the power of anti-tumor immunotherapy. We will investigate this hypothesis in
three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine how distinct metastatic microenvironments affect cancer cell
biomechanics and immune vulnerability in mice and humans. Aim 2 will determine if environmental stiffness can,
as an independent variable, control the efficiency of mechanosurveillance. Finally, Aim 3 will apply state-of-the-
art rigidity dependent cell sorting technology to identify novel mechanoregulators of metastasis in vivo. Our
proposed studies are organized around the conceptually innovative idea that crosstalk between environmental
mechanics and cellular cytotoxicity determines where metastases grow. In addition, we will employ highly
innovative technologies, including suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) devices that rapidly measure cell
deformability and sort cells based on stiffness. The successful completion of our Specific Aims could identify
biomarkers for guiding antitumor immunotherapy and aid development of novel strategies for treating metastatic
growth in specific target organs. As such, this work is highly relevant to the NIH mission in that it will contribute
to the advancement of knowledge that could improve human health."
10979881,"Project Summary:
Adipose tissue is a dynamic energy depot that supports metabolic function and survival during fasting. When the
ability of adipocytes to dynamically release energy in the form of fatty acids is impaired, fat cells become
hypertrophied and develop ER stress, insulin resistance, express hypoxic signaling programs and inflammatory
mediators, all of which contribute to the pathobiology of cardiometabolic disease. The canonical view of
adipocyte energy balance is that insulin drives energy storage in lipids with feeding, while counterregulatory
hormones drive release of three fatty acid chains from each triglyceride molecule with fasting through the
sequential action of three lipases, including the rate-limiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). In preliminary
data contained in this grant proposal, our laboratory discovered evidence that fasting-lipolysis is largely
preserved when the canonical ATGL-dependent lipolytic pathway is targeted during prolonged fasting. Instead,
our preliminary data points to a critical role for a complementary, alternative pathway involving lysosomes and
the lysosomal lipase (lysosomal acid lipase-LIPA). Our preliminary data further demonstrate that members of
the MiT/TFE transcription factor family, including the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB, are
required for lipolysis with fasting. These preliminary data support the central hypothesis of this project: lysosomal
digestion of lipid in adipocytes is a critical mechanism of fatty acid release during fasting. In this proposal we
seek to leverage innovative methods, including inducible adipocyte targeted loss of function studies in vivo, state
of the art multi-omics studies of MiT/TFE transcription factor regulatory circuitry, and high-resolution imaging
mass spectrometry—which enables quantitative tracking of stable isotope lipid labels at the sub-organelle level—
to examine the underlying mechanisms and the physiological implications of this novel lipolytic pathway in
adipocytes. In Aim 1, we will define the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that govern mobilization of
fatty acids from adipocytes with fasting. In Aim 2, we will define the role of the lysosomal lipolysis pathway in
systemic lipid homeostasis and energy balance in the context of fasting and disease-relevant stressors of aging
and diet-induced obesity. Decades of data suggests that lipolysis in adipocytes, which is a major determinant of
circulating fatty acids and systemic lipid metabolism, is important to cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes
mellitus. If our central hypothesis is correct, that an alternative lysosomal pathway is operative with fasting, then
our understanding of systemic fatty acid metabolism is incomplete. Completion of this project holds promise to
reorient our understanding of how adipocytes regulate systemic lipid metabolism and to determine whether this
core function is a determinant of metabolic disease."
10979882,"There is an urgent need to identify effective treatments for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a highly
desmoplastic tumor of the bile ducts with a five-year survival rate of 5%. Over half of iCCA cases are diagnosed
after metastases are present, when treatment choices are limited and minimally effective. The long-term goal of
our work is to identify novel therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes for this devastating malignancy. This
proposal leverages our exciting preliminary data suggesting that the immune checkpoint protein B7-H4 is over-
expressed in more than 60% of iCCA cases where, in addition to its known T cell immunosuppressive role
mediated by its membrane-bound form, it exerts a critical role in the control of tumor growth and stromal
deposition through a previously unknown cooperation of its intracellular form with the TGFβ pathway. Genetic
ablation of B7-H4 in murine models generated by the co-expression of Notch1 intracellular domain and activated
Akt1 (Nicd1/Akt1) using sleeping beauty transposon/transposase and hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVI)
significantly prolongs survival and profoundly alters the surrounding desmoplasia. Mechanistically, B7-H4 over-
expression increases the levels of the docking receptor for latent-TGβ1, GARP, and thus promotes the release
of active TGFβ1 and activation of the downstream SMAD2/3-dependent pathway. We herein propose three aims
to validate our hypothesis that, through activation of the TGFβ pathway, B7-H4 shapes a unique desmoplastic
response and promotes tumor growth of iCCA, so that pharmacologic inhibition of this cross-talk will contribute
to tumor inhibition through several complementary ways. In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms
through which B7-H4 promotes cancer cell growth and motility by performing in vitro functional studies in iCCA
cell lines (murine and human) and patient-derived organoids upon genetic manipulation of the B7-H4/TGFβ axis.
Furthermore, we will unveil the full interactome of intracellular B7-H4 and its exact subcellular localization. In
Aim 2, we will clarify how the newly identified axis shapes the desmoplastic reaction, immune infiltration and
composition, and instructs other cell types, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts, to deposit and organize
collagen, in the genetically versatile HTVI-based Nicd1/Akt1 mouse model, which - as supported by our
preliminary data - highly resembles human iCCA with endogenous expression of B7-H4. In Aim 3, we will assess
the efficacy of pharmacologically modulating the B7-H4 axis using clinically-relevant drugs blocking TGFβ1 and
other identified vulnerabilities in combination with a monoclonal antibody directed against B7-H4 in genetic and
orthotopic murine models . Here, by combining our large collection of cell lines/organoids, human samples,
mouse models with single cell-based approaches and a single-fiber artificial intelligence-based platform, we will
dissect a previously unknown B7-H4/TGFβ cross-talk and yield new insights into iCCA biology. The proposed
research is highly significant since its successful completion would establish the B7-H4 axis as a novel target for
iCCA therapy that could improve the clinical outcome of this deadly cancer."

Post-cesarean surgical site infections (SSIs) contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality globally; as rates of
cesarean delivery increase, so will the number of SSIs. Timely SSI diagnosis and treatment can improve
maternal outcomes. However, in many settings, particularly in rural areas, postoperative wound monitoring is
challenging due to physical and financial barriers.
The overall goal of this proposal is to improve strategies for post-cesarean SSI monitoring by validating and
updating two existing image-based diagnostic algorithms. The original algorithms were trained on image-SSI
diagnosis dyads collected on women delivering via cesarean in rural Rwanda. One algorithm, using visible
images (photographs), had a 83% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The second algorithm, using thermal images,
had 95% sensitivity and 84% specificity.
In this proposed research, we will prospectively follow 6,000 women in Rwanda, Ghana and Mexico (2,000 per
site) and collect wound images and SSI diagnoses at postoperative day (POD) 10. These sites were chosen
because of: a) high SSI rates; b) the potential to integrate an accurate SSI diagnostic algorithm into existing
community health worker follow-up programs; and c) the diversity in skin tones across the study sites. Using this
data, we will assess the generalizability of the existing visible image and thermal image algorithms, evaluating
the sensitivity and specificity overall and by country (Aim 1). We will then retrain the algorithm to improve
predictive properties across diverse populations, and we will explore adding clinical data to the algorithms to
improve accuracy (Aim 2). Finally, for a subset of 1,200 women who are SSI negative at POD10, we will
reevaluate at POD20 and POD30, and use these image-SSI diagnosis dyads to explore the need for later SSI
monitoring and the ability to predict delayed SSIs with images captured at POD10 (Aim 3).
The culmination of this research will provide strategies for home-based monitoring of cesarean-related SSIs that
can accommodate a range of skin tones."

The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool."
10980161,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from mutations in the CFTR Cl- channel resulting in diminished transepithelial Cl-
secretion. The most common CFTR mutation, F508del, results in a channel that fails to correctly fold/traffic.
Thus, compounds were sought to improve the folding/trafficking of this misfolded CFTR - referred to as
correctors. Vertex pioneered the identification of CFTR correctors, and in 2019 introduced Trikafta, consisting of
the correctors, VX-661 (Tezacafor) and VX-445 (Elexacaftor), together with the CFTR potentiator VX-770
(Ivacaftor). This highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) has proved to be highly efficacious. Unfortunately,
real-world studies have reported adverse events (AE) in a subset of CF patients taking these HEMT, including
headache, hypertension and mental health issues, such as anxiety, low mood, insomnia and “brain fog”. The
mechanisms by which HEMT induce these AE remain unknown and thus represent a critical gap in our
understanding of drug action. Herein, we demonstrate the CFTR corrector VX-445 (Elexacaftor) inhibits the
intermediate (KCa3.1) conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa), resulting in an inhibition of Cl- secretion
across WT and F508del CFTR-expressing primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs). Further, we
demonstrate these CFTR correctors potentiate the large (BKCa; KCa1.1) conductance KCa. As KCa channels
are widely expressed, including in neurons, where they control neuronal excitability, and vascular smooth
muscle, where they regulate vascular reactivity, understanding how CFTR correctors modulate KCa activity is
crucial to understanding these AE. Thus, the rationale for our studies is by defining the mechanisms by which
CFTR correctorsinhibit KCa3.1 and potentiate BKCa channels, and how this affectsthe physiology of cells where
these channels are expressed, we will better understand the AE induced by HEMT. Based on this, we propose
the following aims: (1) Define the mechanism(s) by which CFTR correctors inhibit KCa3.1 and KCa2.x channels
and the effects on HBE function. (2) Define the mechanism by which CFTR correctors potentiate BKCa channels
and the effects on HBE function. (3) Define the effects of CFTR corrector-mediated KCa3.1/KCa2.x inhibition
and BKCa potentiation on vascular reactivity and neuronal action potential firing. To carry out these studies, we
will utilize a combination of in vitro and ex vivo techniques, including electrophysiological, molecular, protein
biochemical, live-cell fluorescence imaging, as well as wire- and pressure-myography on mouse aortic rings and
microvascular arteries, and patch-clampingon primary cultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Our studies
will be the first to demonstrate CFTR correctors directly inhibit KCa2.x/KCa3.1 and potentiate BKCa channels and
how this affects ion transport across HBEs, vascular reactivity and neuronal action potential firing. As HEMT
represent the standard of care for CF patients it is highly significant to understand the mechanisms underlying
the AE reported, both in the short-term, so they may be mitigated, and in the long-term such that next-generation
HEMT may be developed – improving the lives of CF patients."

10984186,"Aberrant protein synthesis is associated with a variety of disease states such as cancer and
neurodegeneration. The protein output per mRNA is strongly affected by a combination of cis elements and
trans factors that together control the rate of recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR).
Different 5′-UTRs are sufficient to confer a thousand-fold range of translation output both in vivo and in vitro,
but the mechanisms underlying these large effects are unknown in most cases. This R00 Pathway to
Independence Award seeks to understand the 5′-UTR regulatory code controlling mRNA translation by
answering two fundamental questions: (1) what are the components of the code? And (2) what is the
mechanism by which the components affect translational activity? To answer these questions Dr. Niederer will
take advantage of a cellular condition where widespread changes in 5′-UTR usage have been observed-
cancer. During the K99 phase, Dr. Niederer Used a novel technical approach to directly measure ribosome
recruitment levels to thousands of differentially expressed 5′-UTR sequences (previous Aim 1). While the
changes in 5′-UTR usage are well known, their effect on ribosome recruitment is more or less completely
unknown. In this R00 phase, Dr. Niederer will use a combination of biochemical and genetic studies to identify
the readers of these functional RNA elements (new Aim 1). This work will be extended by the efforts of Cesar
Martinez, who will be performing mutagenesis to delineate the functional boundaries of the identified elements.
This will be critical for identifying candidate readers that are specific to the newly identified translational
repressors and enhancers. Dr. Niederer will then characterize the candidate readers and determine their role in
supporting translational reprogramming in cells exposed to oncogenic insults or undergoing stress response.
Additional work will measure ribosome recruitment to additional 5′-UTRs of interest, including those (1)
containing pathogenic SNPs and (2) exhibiting tissue specific expression (new Aim 2). The results of this work
are likely to reveal novel mechanisms of translation regulation, which will not only further our understanding of
a fundamental cellular process but will also have implications for human health and disease."

Neurodegenerative diseases, as age-dependent disorders, represent a rising hazard to human health in
America, given the rapidly growing number of seniors in its population. For this reason, the development of novel
therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases has become a national priority. These disorders are often
characterized by the incorrect folding of certain proteins, accumulation of cytotoxic macromolecular structures,
and changes in intracellular stress response capacity - our proposal aims to identify a means to resolve these
conditions. Numerous labs over the last decade have elucidated mechanisms underlying selective autophagy -
the process by which damaged organelles, protein aggregates, or misfolded proteins are targeted to the
autophagosome for degradation in the lysosome. Our understanding of autophagy is that it controls a large
fraction of regulated protein homeostasis in human cells, particularly post-mitotic cells (i.e., a cell that does not
divide) like neurons. While autophagy is broadly associated with the turnover of proteins or organelles, several
autophagy-related genes have been specifically genetically linked with aging and neurodegenerative cellular
signaling pathways. Despite these advances, our understanding of how neuronal cells use and rely on specific
forms of autophagy via specialized proteins called receptors is incomplete for several reasons. First, most studies
have focused on a small number of well-studied receptors, and systematic approaches aimed at uncovering the
global contribution of known and other possible receptors are lacking, leaving major gaps in our understanding
of the many roles these proteins may play. Second, the majority of studies have focused on processes in cancer
cell lines in culture, and we know very little about the cell type-relevant roles of selective autophagy receptors in
neuronal homeostasis. Third, although we know that selective autophagy receptors are regulated dynamically,
we still have a relatively rudimentary understanding of the signaling pathways that control receptor engagement
in physiological or stress-induced states. Here, we propose a series of experiments that seek to address
limitations in our understanding of the neuronal selective autophagy pathways, their regulation, and their
function. In the first series of experiments (AIM 1), we will build on preliminary data to elucidate the role of an
endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound receptor we identified to be regulated upon nutrient stress in neurons,
and reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation and the nature of the substrate turned over. A
second series of experiments (AIM 2) will be focused on investigating the cellular specificity across neuroimmune
cell subtypes, response to pathological cues modeled in iPSCs, and functional and physiological relevance using
knock-out mouse models. Together, these studies will quantitatively, mechanistically, and functionally address
gaps in our understanding of the neuronal relevant functions of this selective autophagy pathway and the
mechanisms by which substrates are selected for lysosomal recycling."

Natural product therapeutics remain critically important in the treatment of cancer, with most patients diagnosed
with cancer receiving natural product-based chemotherapy, such as microtubule disrupting agents and DNA
intercalators. Select chemotherapeutic small molecules, the majority of which are natural products, have an
additional therapeutic benefit in their ability to stimulate a productive form of natural immunity against the cancer
cells that they injure or kill. For example, chemically induced damage associated molecular pattern expression
can recruit antigen presenting cells to phagocytose damaged cancer cells and display cancer cell antigens to
prime and activate T cells for adaptive immunity. Notably however, natural product induced anti-tumor immunity
properties of these select compounds were only discovered subsequent to their clinical application. We
hypothesize that the pathways by which such immunogenic natural products injure and kill cancer cells
determines the production of damage associated molecular patterns and ensuing innate and adaptive immune
responses against treated cells. We propose to develop and apply a high throughput, multiplexed, single cell
chemical biology assay platform for the discovery of chemically induced antitumor immunity. Using this system,
we will map the associations between regulated cell death and injury signaling in treated cells to functional
cellular markers of immunogenicity for several classes of known and new natural products. This goal will be
accomplished through three aims: (1) Discover and characterize secondary metabolites via regulated cell death
and injury cytometric phenotypes; (2) Define the relationships between cell injury and death signaling phenotypes
and damage associated molecular patterns, and immunogenic cell signaling in cancer and immune cells; (3)
Validate chemical agents inducing immunogenic cell injury and death via antigen cross priming assays and deep
cellular profiling using flow cytometry. Relevance: The successful completion of the proposed research is
relevant to human health because it will provide methods to accelerate the identification of potential anticancer
natural products, which have had and continue to have a large positive impact on human health. Furthermore,
the discovery of the multiplexed cell-targeting immuno-oncological structure-activity relationships within newly
discovered compounds and known but not commercially available compound families, may provide new targeted
therapeutics, with greater efficiency and reduced clinical toxicity."

The premise of our proposal is that by characterizing the in vitro response of different types of cardiac single cells to
different cancer drug treatments, we will be able to identify biomarkers that can help us classify patients at risk for
cardiotoxicity.
By applying single-cell sequencing to a novel system of cardiac guided differentiation cultures, we are proposing to study
the effects of the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and bevacizumab (BVC) in multiple relevant
cell types from a genetically diverse panel of 70 individuals. Our goal is to build a genetic-based classifier that can stratify
cancer patients by their susceptibility to drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity (CT). To achieve this goal, we need to first
identify candidate loci that underlie the functional differences between individuals. This is required, because whole-genome
approaches to predict complex risk (such as polygenic risk scores) have generally shown not to be effective beyond the
sample in which they were developed. A classifier based on relevant functional loci (the response eQTLs, in our case) is
more likely to be generally effective and transferable. The premise of our study rests on two assumptions. The first is that
inter-individual variability in response to chemotherapeutic drugs is at least partially mediated by genetic variants that affect
gene regulation in a drug-dependent manner. In other words, genetic variants respond to chemotherapeutic drugs by
regulating the activity of specific genes. The second assumption is that different cell types vary in their response to
chemotherapeutic drugs. That is, a regulatory variant that affects gene expression in cardiomyocytes, for example, may have
a different effect (or none at all) on gene expression in endothelial cells.
To achieve our goals, we propose to collect single cell RNA-seq data from a panel of 100 cardiac guided differentiation
cultures in control and drug-treated conditions (aim 1); to identify genetic variants that regulate the transcriptomic response
of cardiac culture cell types to each drug (aim 2); and to test whether response QTLs identified in cardiac in vitro cultures
can be used to retrospectively classify patients as resistant or sensitive to drug-induced cardiotoxicity (aim 3)."

Dr. Hyun Ah Yoon proposes a mentored clinical and translational research project and career development plan
to identify antibody (Ab) biomarkers of risk for cryptococcosis in organ transplant recipients being started on
immunosuppression. Her study will test the hypothesis that immunosuppression induces changes in plasma
immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM)-binding,
and/or naturally occurring laminarin-binding Ab levels, and that these changes correlate with the risk of
cryptococcal disease in relation to the presence of absence of Ab functionality. Her published data support the
hypothesis and aims demonstrating that compared to controls, relative differences in plasma Igs, GXM- and
naturally occurring laminarin-binding Ab levels were associated with cryptococcosis. To test her hypothesis, In
Aim 1, Dr. Yoon will retrospectively identify kidney transplant candidates from an ongoing longitudinal
prospective study at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) who are about to start immunosuppression and do not
have cryptococcosis. She will then determine Ab levels over 3 years as a function of immunosuppressive drug
type, dosage, blood level and duration. In Aim 2, she will analyze the plasma Ab function of organ transplant
recipients diagnosed with cryptococcosis at MMC and University of Alabama at Birmingham to identify Ab
correlates of protection against disease or progression over a year. Her study will generate new knowledge on
the effect of immunosuppression on Ab markers and how Ab functional attributes correlate with cryptococcosis
risk and/or disease outcome in high-risk organ transplant recipients. The long-term goal is to identify HIV-
negative patients at risk for cryptococcosis or poor clinical outcome earlier, intervene, and reduce morbidity and
mortality by testing the proposed Ab biomarkers in a multi-center prospective clinical trial. The proposed training
plan includes a combination of didactic training and mentored clinical and translational investigation that will
allow Dr. Yoon to build on the preliminary data and essential laboratory and analytic skills she started to develop
during her master’s degree in clinical research methods at Einstein, which she completed with distinction in May
2022. Her career development plan proposes mentored training in 1) laboratory techniques in Ab immunology,
2) longitudinal study design and analysis of comprehensive clinical and translational data, 3) leveraging her data
to develop an independent grant proposal to conduct a clinical trial applying the biomarkers. Additional training
will be accomplished by enrolling in advanced didactic courses and presenting at national and international
conferences. Dr. Yoon will be mentored and guided by renowned mentors and collaborators with extensive
experience in cryptococcal pathogenesis, Ab research, fungal immunology, clinical and translational research,
and epidemiology/biostatistics, which will allow her to develop her own distinct research trajectory. Upon
completing this project, Dr. Yoon will have acquired substantial breadth and depth of clinical and translational
research training and be well-positioned to begin an independent research career and pursue extramural funding."

SUMMARY
Tumor-Associated
immune
 Macrophages (TAMs) are a metabolically and functionally heterogeneous population of
cells that play critical roles in both anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth.Importantly, the type of TAM
infiltrate within a neoplasm has been shown to be a prognostic factor for tumor growth and sensitivity to cancer
immunotherapies. Hence, elucidating the mechanisms that determine the differentiation of pro-tumor and anti-
tumor TAMs within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to novel therapeutic approaches. For nearly 40
years, it has been known that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which is composed
of five multiprotein complexes, is critical for the anti-tumor activity of TAMs. However, the mechanisms by which
the activity of the ETC is controlled in TAMs and how this process determines the functions of these immune
cells within the TME are largely unknown. Interestingly, the terminal enzyme of the ETC, Complex IV (CIV), is
the only ETC complex in which its core protein subunits are replaced by closely related isoforms to tune its
activity in response to signals from the tissue microenvironment. Using single-cell transcriptomics and 7 novel
mouse strains that we generated, we demonstrated that type I and II interferons (IFNs) potently induce a single
transcript encoding the peptide NDUFA4L3 and the microRNA miR-147 in human and mouse TAMs from
melanoma tumors. Notably, we also showed that NDUFA4L3 and miR-147 work in concert to remodel CIV
protein subunit composition in TAMs through the degradation and subsequent replacement of a core component
of CIV, NDUFA4. Importantly, NDUFA4 degradation as a result of NDUFA4L3 and miR-147 induction by IFNs,
or its genetic deletion, blocks tumor growth and leads to a dramatic accumulation of anti-tumor TAMs. Therefore,
we hypothesize that regulation of CIV subunit composition and activity in TAMs through the induction of
NDUFA4L3 and miR-147 by IFNs is a key evolutionarily conserved metabolic checkpoint by which TAM
differentiation is controlled, which could be targeted in the context of cancer immunotherapies. Thus, in aim 1 of
this project, we will use two novel conditionally knock-out strains for NDUFA4 and NDUFA4L3 that we generated,
single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and the humanized mouse MISTRG-6 that supports the development of
human TAMs, to establish how CIV subunit composition in TAMs regulate anti-tumor immunity and responses
to checkpoint blockade inhibitors. In aim 2, we will use a molecular model of CIV with an atomic resolution that
we generated, metabolomics, and novel technologies to measure cellular metabolism and mitophagy rates at
the single cell level to determine how CIV protein subunit composition and its activity contribute to the metabolic
and functional states of TAMs. As recent reports demonstrate that macrophages from patients with loss of
function mutations in NDUFA4 show a striking pro-inflammatory gene signature and several ETC inhibitors and
engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing macrophages are currently undergoing clinical trials for
cancer, our studies may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to complement existing cancer immunotherapies."
10995492,"ABSTRACT
Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer. It can be cured with surgical resection if detected early, so
advancing methods of prevention and early detection for melanoma is critical. To model human melanoma, the
Zon lab developed a zebrafish model with melanocytes expressing human BRAFV600E in a p53 null background
(BRAFV600E;p53-/-). The tumors formed with this zebrafish model genetically and histologically resemble human
melanoma, and the transparency of zebrafish makes them optimal models for studying melanoma initiation. We
can image melanocytes in zebrafish using Tg(mitfa:mCherry) to express mCherry fluorescent protein under the
control of the promoter for mitfa, the zebrafish ortholog of the human MITF gene. When imaging BRAFV600E;p53-
/- zebrafish over time, we initially observe high areas of mitfa expression, which we call cancer precursor zones
(CPZs). Some CPZs progress to form tumors, while others remain growth arrested. CPZs that form tumors
reactivate an embryonic neural crest progenitor state. Incredibly, imaging the fluorescent reporter
Tg(crestin:EGFP) allows for the identification and tracking of the single cell initiating melanoma since 100% of
melanocytes expressing crestin go on to form tumors. Because neural crest reactivation is the defining
transformative step for CPZs to become tumors, understanding the mechanism of this transition is crucial, and
it may reveal targetable pathways to prevent melanoma. I am interested in the extracellular microenvironment’s
role in the neural crest reactivation of CPZs. By transplanting CPZs, I observed that CPZ melanocytes with high
mitfa:mCherry expression appear to have lower mitfa expression following transplant. One possible cause for
this is the absence of ligands known to regulate mitfa activity when melanocytes are removed from their CPZ
microenvironment. Upstream pathways known to regulate mitfa gene transcription include c-Kit, Wnt, and cAMP.
I hypothesize that mitfa expression changes during neural crest reactivation due to the absence of c-Kit, Wnt,
and cAMP regulatory ligands. In Aim 1, I will test this by looking at protein and RNA changes to mitfa after
transplants, chemically providing CPZ melanocytes with ligands for c-Kit, Wnt, and cAMP pathways, and using
a temperature sensitive mitfa mutant. A second preliminary observation was CPZ melanocytes expressing
crestin within seven days of transplant, faster than usually observed in zebrafish. Since melanocytes are
transplanted in growth-factor rich Matrigel, I hypothesize that specific growth factors in Matrigel direct
melanocytes to initiate melanoma. In Aim 2, I will test this by performing proteomics and single cell RNA
sequencing to identify proteins that contribute to crestin induction and their cellular sources. These proteins will
be further investigated with chemical and genetic approaches to test their sufficiency for neural crest reactivation
from CPZs. Collectively, investigating the contribution of mitfa and growth factors to neural crest reactivation will
advance understandings of the mechanisms underlying melanoma initiation and contribute to a broad effort to
understand the drivers of this complex process in vivo."

Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) are aggressive pediatric brain cancers that lack standardized
treatment regimens. After radiotherapy treatments, survivors suffer from long-term neurocognitive defects. Thus,
there is a critical need for dissecting the underlying biology of ATRTs to identify novel therapeutic strategies.
ATRTs are driven by a differentiation block caused by biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1 with no other recurrent
mutations, resulting in dysregulated cells that fail to terminally differentiate and consequently acquire oncogenic
states. Naturally, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are suspected to be the cells of origin for ATRTs, as their stalled
differentiation has been implicated in pediatric brain tumorigenesis. However, ATRTs present unique features
that imply a cell of origin that is not restricted to the central nervous system (CNS). Despite being driven by only
SMARCB1 loss, ATRTs are comprised of three molecular subgroups, with different clinical outcomes, of which
only one displays neural features: ATRT-Sonic hedgehog (SHH). Furthermore, ATRTs are molecularly identical
to extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs). As a potential explanation for these nonneural features, the
neural crest cell (NCC) is a putative cell of origin for both ATRTs and extracranial MRTs, as it emerges from the
neuroectoderm but then migrates throughout the embryo. Therefore, the hypotheses of this proposal are that
SMARCB1 loss interacts with cell identity and anatomical location during tumorigenesis, and that there are
targetable vulnerabilities that can enable SMARCB1-depleted cells to overcome their differentiation block.
Previously, the Furnari lab engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with DOX-inducible
SMARCB1 knockdown (KD hiPSCs). NPCs derived from these hiPSCs, that were differentiated without
SMARCB1 expression (KD NPCs), exhibited an ATRT-SHH transcriptome, presented a block in neuronal
differentiation, and formed orthotopic tumors. This hiPSC-derived SMARCB1 knockdown platform will be
leveraged to investigate the hypotheses of this proposal. To unveil interactions between cell identity and
SMARCB1 loss, RNAseq analyses will be performed on hiPSCs that were differentiated, with or without
SMARCB1 expression, into NPCs and NCCs. To characterize interactions between anatomical location and
SMARCB1 loss during tumorigenesis, KD NPCs and NCCs will be engrafted intracranially and subcutaneously.
Resulting tumors will be analyzed via RNAseq. Since KD NPCs are unable to differentiate further into NCAM+
neurons, a high-throughput, pooled CRISPR screen will be performed on KD NPCs to identify targetable
vulnerabilities that can overcome their differentiation block. Candidate genes will be validated in vitro via IPTG
inducible knockdown and drug treatment studies, followed by in vivo validation by treating orthotopically
engrafted KD NPC brain tumors with candidate drugs. If successful, this proposal will provide novel insights into
the underlying biology that drives intertumoral heterogeneity of ATRTs and identify novel drug targets that
overcome stalled differentiation, a fundamental feature of ATRTs."

Sepsis, a syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction associated with the host response to infection, afflicts
approximately 50 million people worldwide annually. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of
sepsis, contributing to morbidity, mortality, and increased costs, yet we still do not understand why some septic
patients develop AKI while others do not. This clinical heterogeneity has been a major barrier to progress in
clinical practice and research. In both animal models and humans, the bacterial communities of the gut are
associated with the severity of systemic injury and risk of death in critical illness. Yet, to date, the contribution
of gut microbiota to the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated AKI has been unexplored in both experimental
models and human cohort studies. In pilot work, I have discovered that among genetically-identical but
microbiologically-divergent mice with sepsis, the community composition of cecal microbiota is significantly
associated with the severity of AKI. A single bacterial family (Lachnospiraceae) explains 25% of the variation in
kidney injury severity. Further, in a retrospective cohort study of patients with suspected sepsis, I have found
that early exposure to anti-anaerobic antibiotics (which deplete the gut of anaerobic commensals) increases
patients’ risk of developing AKI (odds ratio 1.68, adjusted for confounders). Therefore, in this proposal, I seek
to establish and interrogate the gut microbiome as a source of biological heterogeneity in sepsis. My rationale
is that the gut microbiome is an unexplored therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of AKI. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated
AKI. I will test this hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Identify and interrogate the gut bacteria in human
patients that predict the onset and outcomes of sepsis-associated AKI; and 2) Determine the microbially-
derived mediators of AKI in a murine model of sepsis. Experiments for these Aims will be completed with the
use of 1) a large biorepository of human rectal swabs collected at the University of Michigan from 2016 to 2020
and 2) a well-established murine model of sepsis and experimental gut microbiome modulation techniques.
The results from these innovative studies may identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and
treatment of AKI and its complications. In executing this research plan, I will receive rigorous training in
experimental design, implementation, and interpretation that will help me become a successful, independent
scientist."
10994767,"Project Summary: The objective of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) Mid-Year
Workshop is to provide a vital platform for scientists and clinicians to optimize the use of cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR) in the treatment of heart failure (HF). As a versatile imaging test, CMR is a crucial diagnostic
and prognostic imaging tool applicable to over 6 million adults in the United States living with HF. Recent
advancements in CMR technology, such as T1/T2/extracellular volume fraction mapping, quantitative myocardial
blood flow imaging, 4D flow, cine derived cardiac strain, and late gadolinium-enhancement, have piqued the
interest of clinicians specializing in HF. These topics and educational objectives align closely with the mission of
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to provide global leadership in research, training, and
education for the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. Scientific presentations will shed light
on new discoveries regarding the causes of HF, contributing to the translation of these findings into clinical
practice. Dedicated hands-on sessions (CMR data analysis, CMR live scanning) as well as case presentations
will provide attendees with knowledge on how to establish a clinical CMR service in the setting of HF. Additionally,
the proposed educational activities and participant discussions will foster the training and mentorship of early
career scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will facilitate collaborative research infrastructure,
engaging participants from academic institutions and industry. We plan to achieve these workshop objectives
through the following aims: (1) Bring together scientists, clinicians, technologists, clinical staff and industry from
varied backgrounds, including cardiology, radiology, physics, bioengineering, applied mathematics, computer
science, and biology to promote cross-fertilization of ideas on technical developments and clinical applications;
(2) provide an effective workshop format by integrating summary lectures from established, internationally
recognized investigators with hands-on sessions and oral and poster presentations on new research; (3) foster
collaborative relationships among researchers from multiple centers to work on multi-center clinical trials using
CMR; (4) challenge established expert centers to innovate time efficient comprehensive CMR protocols that can
be easily disseminated and provide examples of innovative practice highlighting translation of research into the
clinical arena; (5) educate young scientists, including students, postdocs, residents, fellows, and junior
investigators, as well as underrepresented minority (URM) investigators, on the fundamentals and state-of-the-
art in CMR technology. The primary goal of this application is to secure support to enable early career
investigators, with a specific focus on female investigators and URM from various backgrounds, to attend the
Mid-Year SCMR Workshop in 2024. The active involvement of students and early-career scientists and clinicians
and URM investigators has the potential to achieve key objectives crucial for the ongoing advancement of
medical imaging and cardiovascular medicine."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disease, affecting over 27 million people in the US. Its
risk factors include aging, joint injury, obesity, and the female sex.
It is characterized by the degeneration of
weightbearing joints, which is exacerbated by localized and persistent inflammation. However, there is not a
single FDA-approved disease-modifying treatment for OA, posing an urgent need for designing new treatment
options. Typical anti-inflammatory therapies have not successfully halted OA progression in clinical trials,
suggesting that perhaps OA has an inflammatory signature different from other types of arthritis and requires a
strategy to specifically target this signature. In this grant, we will address this critical need for the understanding
the inflammatory milieu unique to OA.
One of the predominant types of immune cells increased in human OA joints is the mast cell (MC). Mice deficient
in MCs had diminished joint damage in injury-induced OA, suggesting that MCs are required for OA progression.
This notion is further supported by our gain-of-function data showing that promoting MC activity exacerbated
joint damage, thus warranting mechanistic investigation of MCs in OA. One special feature of MCs is their
capacity to store inflammatory mediators in their numerous granules. When stimulated, MCs release them over
time; and since MCs are long-lived, they also replenish these inflammatory mediators for future use. Thus, the
MC is a strong candidate for sustaining chronic inflammation in OA. Another intriguing property of the MC is it
demonstrates a level of heterogeneity that is altered under disease conditions and in a tissue-specific way. In
the synovium, there are two known subtypes, based on histological analysis of the two key proteases: (i) MCTC
that expresses both chymase and tryptase and (ii) MCT that expresses only tryptase. While these two enzymes
have their own substrates, the two subtypes also likely to differ in the expression of other genes. However, little
is known about the nature of MC heterogeneity in OA joints. Our central hypothesis is that MC heterogeneity
constitutes a unique inflammatory signature of OA to promote OA pathogenesis. The objective of this grant is to
investigate the genetic basis and functions of MCTC and MCT subtypes in the OA synovium, through performing
advanced proteomics and single cell RNAseq technologies as well as testing them in the mouse model of
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Transection (ACLT).
From this investigation, we will uncover a new level of regulation that may elucidate a key aspect of OA-specific
inflammatory microenvironment and inspire the design of more effective strategies to target OA. Thus, this study
has the potential of being highly impactful and paradigm-changing for combating OA in our ever-aging society."

Blood gas analysis is a cornerstone of modern critical care medicine, providing essential insights into a patient's
respiratory and metabolic status. Measurements of blood pH as well as oxygen and carbon dioxide levels enable
diagnosis and management of a wide range of life-threatening medical conditions, including respiratory failure and
acid-base imbalances due to circulatory shock or metabolic derangement. The accurate and timely assessment
of blood gases is essential for effective treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly for mechanically
ventilated patients where adjustment of ventilator settings depends upon these measurements. Blood gas mea-
surements are typically made by drawing blood from an indwelling arterial or venous catheter and sending this
blood to a central core laboratory, where the analysis is run on calibrated machines and results then reported back
to the point of care. This process leads to delays in interpretation and clinical action and limits the availability of
blood gas analysis in many healthcare settings, including critical care patient transport and disaster medicine
scenarios involving ﬁeld hospitals. Existing point of care blood gas analyzers suffer from limitations in accuracy
and cost and do not allow for high-frequency of measurements.
 The proposed program leverages novel physiologic sensors developed at the Wellman Center for Photo-
medicine to create and validate new technology for accurate, rapid, point-of-care, and high-frequency blood gas
analysis. Aim 1 will create a miniaturized and automated device that attaches externally to a standard arterial
catheter setup and allows direct sampling and immediate blood gas analysis from a small volume of blood at the
bedside. This device will be ﬁrst tested in a preclinical swine model and subsequently validated using human sam-
ples from the intensive care unit, with results benchmarked against gold-standard hospital laboratory blood gas
analyzers. Aim 2 will develop next-generation continuous blood gas sensing technology leveraging miniaturized
ﬁber optic devices incorporated into an insert compatible with existing arterial catheters. This simple-to-operate,
continuous sensor will be similarly tested in a swine model system against current point-of-care devices. Together,
these Aims will signiﬁcantly expand the accuracy, efﬁciency and accessibility of blood gas analysis and augment
the clinical utility of these measurements for many high-stakes scenarios in modern medicine."

Background: Suicide in people with HIV (PWH) is an unaddressed public mental health concern in South Africa.
Research on suicidal ideation and behavior is scant in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), despite
evidence suggesting that PWH are confronted with synergistic psychosocial and situational stressors that
increase their risks for suicide and adversely affect HIV care engagement, including delayed treatment initiation,
poor adherence, and viral instability. Yet, there has been no research investigating behavioral interventions for
suicide in PWH in South Africa. Research: The study’s specific aims are to 1) explore primary healthcare-level
suicide treatment practices, gaps, needs, and ideal intervention characteristics among stakeholders and PWH;
2a) develop a brief behavioral intervention addressing suicide and HIV care engagement (MI-Cope-Care); 2b)
refine MI-Cope-Care in an iterative, sequential pre-pilot study; and 3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary effectiveness of MI-Cope-Care in a pilot randomized controlled trial. If found to be feasible and
acceptable, MI-Cope-Care will be the first suicide intervention for PWH in South Africa. This study supports NIH
HIV/AIDS Research Priorities to reduce mental health comorbidities of HIV and strengthen the HIV care
continuum. Candidate: I am a research psychologist with expertise in cross-cultural psychology and community-
based behavioral interventions in resource-constrained settings. This career development award will afford me
the necessary skills, training, mentorship, and protected time to become an independent, NIH-funded
investigator developing interventions that address suicide and HIV care engagement among PWH in South Africa
and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Mentorship: Dr. John Joska will serve as my primary SA-
based mentor given his experience in mental health and HIV and implementing behavioral interventions in South
Africa. Dr. Kathleen Sikkema will be my primary US-based mentor due to her expertise in trauma and HIV, and
experience in trial design and intervention development in resource-limited settings. My co-mentors will be Dr.
Jason Bantjes given his expertise in suicide research in South Africa, and Dr. Ewa Czyz because of her
experience in developing brief interventions for suicide risk. I have assembled a strong team of study consultants:
Dr. Duleeka Knipe (social determinants of suicide); Dr. Jessica Magidson (Motivational Interview-informed
interventions); Dr. Martina Pavlicova (biostatistics); and Dr. Duovandre Jansen (suicide risk management).
Training: I propose to obtain training in intervention development using the NIH Stage Model, gain expertise in
treatment frameworks for suicide ideation among PWH, and obtain competency in clinical trial design and
longitudinal data analysis. Not only will these training goals provide the necessary skills to develop, evaluate,
and implement suicide interventions, but also provide the platform to emerge as a global leader in suicide in
LMIC."

Small GTPases of the Arf and Rab families are master regulators of intracellular trafficking in eukaryotic
cells that direct the key trafficking events of vesicle formation, cargo recognition, and transport. Cells exert
tight spatiotemporal control of these GTPases through a network of GTPase effector proteins (GEFs) and
GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Perturbations to these key regulators give rise to numerous human
diseases. Despite their importance, many GEFs and GAPs have yet to be identified — meaning we lack a
comprehensive understanding of how cells manage the flow of materials between different membrane-
bound compartments. There is a critical need, then, to study the modulators of GTPase activity and
determine their roles in membrane homeostasis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify and
characterize novel regulators of GTPase activity. I have recently identified a novel family of GAPs using
structural prediction approaches. The specific aims of this proposal are to characterize the physiological role
of these new GAPs. Using a combination of genetic and live-cell imagining techniques, Specific Aim 1 will
focus on identifying the target substrate for each of the GAPs. I will knock out and overexpress the novel
GAPs and subsequently monitor fluorescently-tagged GTPases. The rationale being that improper
regulation of GTPases will cause their mislocalization. Aim 1 will also determine how these proteins localize
to distinct subcellular locations and how this ultimately drives their regulation of GTPases. Together, this
specific aim will elucidate the biological niches in which each of these proteins function. Specific Aim 2 will
investigate the structure and function of these novel GAPs to better understand how they act to regulate
GTPase activity. Using in vitro GAP assays, the enzymatic activity of purified GAPs will be reconstituted on
synthetic membranes — quantifying their activity and substrate specificity in vitro. In order to validate my
structural predictions, the structure of GAPs in complex with their substrate GTPase will be determined
using cryogenic electron microscopy. Crucially, these structural studies will involve proteins bound to
synthetic membranes, providing unique insights into the molecular architecture of membrane-bound
GTPase inactivation. Completion of the research in this fellowship proposal will provide valuable insight into
the regulation of the secretory pathway and, by extension, will have broad impact in cell and membrane
biology."

The delicate gas-exchange surface of the lung is the site of many burdensome diseases, including COVID-19-
induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Old age is a well-established predictor of the incidence and severity of these
diseases. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which acts as the guardian of the gas exchange surface against injury and
natural turnover via their progenitor cell activity, are detrimentally impacted by aging. AT2 cell self-renewal and
differentiation to produce new alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, the cells that exchange gas with the capillaries, is
compromised in old age. In contrast, other progenitor cell populations in the airways of the lung show little
evidence of age-related stem cell exhaustion. Why AT2 cell regenerative capacity is reduced in old age is still
an open question. Our preliminary studies in mice supported by a single nuclear RNA and ATAC sequencing
dataset demonstrated that old AT2 cells have an IFNγ-inducible transcriptional signature, a cytokine critical for
many functions in innate and adaptive immunity. IFNγ is elevated in the aged mouse lung, and evidence exists
that IFNγ represses AT2 cell growth in human alveolar organoids and mouse disease models. Resident and
infiltrating lymphocytes, which act to surveil the lung epithelium for infectious cells, are often the main source of
IFNγ during an immune response. Additional preliminary studies demonstrate that there is an enrichment of
resident lymphocytes and resident natural killer cells in aged mouse lungs, indicative of more interactions and/or
paracrine signaling within the aged lung parenchyma. It is not known whether elevated IFNγ and/or the changes
in lymphocyte populations observed in the healthy aging lung influence AT2 cell regenerative decline. We
hypothesize that resident natural killer cells contribute to elevated IFNγ in the aging lung which induces AT2 cell-
specific regenerative decline. A variety of approaches will be taken to determine if elevated IFNγ or aging
lymphocyte populations are 1) necessary for aging AT2 cell regenerative decline and 2) whether they are
sufficient to block AT2 cell regeneration. In vivo alveolar injury from bleomycin, alveolar organoid forming assays,
and BH3 profiling will be used to assess AT2 cell regenerative capacity and apoptotic potential. Additionally, flow
cytometry and multiple imaging techniques, such as RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent staining,
will be used to quantitate and localize lymphocytes or cells releasing IFNγ in the aging lung. Using these
strategies, this proposal will answer pertinent questions about shifts in aged AT2 cell-immune interactions, the
origins of aging AT2 cell exhaustion, and the role of the aging microenvironment in the causation of age-related
disease. This knowledge could prove crucial for proper preventative care and targeted therapies in individuals
with age-related lung disease in the future."
10995148,"Paranoid ideation is a significant contributor to disability for individuals living with psychosis spectrum disorders
such as schizophrenia. Despite its profound clinical significance, the factors which drive increases in paranoid
ideation in daily life remain incompletely understood. Over the past decade, there has been an accumulation of
compelling evidence demonstrating that neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood deprivation,
disorder, crime, and lack of green space contribute to psychosis spectrum symptomatology, including paranoid
ideation. While informative, there are several limitations to the current literature on neighborhood environment
and paranoid ideation. Most research in this area relies on aggregate diagnostic measures or broad positive
symptoms ratings rather than specifically examining paranoid ideation. Additionally, novel strategies which
combine methodological approaches to assess neighborhood-level risk factors for paranoid ideation, including
using both geocoding and publicly available databases, have been called for. Finally, there is a need to directly
examine whether increases in threat perceptions resulting from neighborhood factors are merely secondary to
psychosis or whether the environment has an independent role in increasing paranoid ideation. In response to
NIMH Strategic Objective 3.2 “developing strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,”
this study aims to illuminate how neighborhood environmental factors contribute to momentary paranoid
ideation so that these factors can be considered when tailoring interventions to optimize outcomes. The
proposed study will leverage data from an ongoing NIH-funded research study of the sponsor (Blanchard) to
address the current gaps in our understanding of how neighborhood environment impacts momentary paranoid
ideation. An innovative multimethod approach which combines geospatial data, smartphone ecological
momentary assessment, virtual neighborhood audits, virtual neighborhood visits by naïve raters, and self-
report data will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1a) Examine how exposure to neighborhood
characteristics as defined by census block contributes to momentary paranoid ideation, 1b) assess the
contribution of hyperlocal neighborhood characteristics on paranoid ideation, and 2) determine whether
neighborhood factors evoke threat perceptions among non-clinical observers. Findings from this project have
the potential to deepen our understanding of the role that neighborhood environment plays in the maintenance
of paranoid ideation. This study builds upon my extensive experience collecting diagnostic and behavioral data
from individuals with psychosis along with experience working with EMA data. Additionally, this project provides
an exceptional vehicle for training in spatial epidemiological data collection, management, and analysis
techniques necessary to examine environment as a social determinant of mental health and for developing the
program of research, professional skills, and publication record to flourish as an independent clinical
psychological researcher."
10990808,"Obesity is expected to affect nearly 50% of adults in the United States by 2030 and is a major risk factor for type
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancer. Obesity is characterized by an accumulation of
white adipose tissue, which can become dysfunctional in the setting of chronic overnutrition, contributing to the
sequelae of excess adiposity. Mice and humans also possess thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes, which
convert chemical energy into heat and have been associated with potent anti-diabetic and cardioprotective
benefits. The metabolic effects of thermogenic adipocytes extend beyond energy dissipation, with these cells
also serving as a sink for toxic metabolites, suppressing inflammation and fibrosis, and secreting paracrine and
endocrine mediators. Murine beige fat shares significant similarities with brown fat described in adult humans,
with both displaying highly cold-inducible activity and a common molecular program. Thus, beige adipocytes in
mice are an attractive model system for dissecting the mechanisms underlying the broad benefits of thermogenic
fat. However, fundamental questions regarding the origin, dynamics, and function of these cells remain
unanswered. In studying crosstalk between the sympathetic nervous system and beige fat, we found that beige
adipocytes form at postnatal day 10, independent of sympathetic innervation and cold stimulation. Starting at
postnatal day 28, these cells suppress their thermogenic properties and become dormant, but can be reactivated
upon cold exposure in adults. We also discovered that dormant beige adipocytes possess heretofore
undescribed functional properties, protecting against tissue inflammation in obesity. Based on these findings, we
propose that postnatal beige adipocytes are developmentally hard-wired cells that become thermogenically
dormant in early adulthood and are reactivated to provide the major source of inducible beige adipocytes in
adults, while also serving as a central regulator of adipose tissue homeostasis. We will address this hypothesis
through two specific aims: (1) We will elucidate the origin and dynamics of beige adipocytes, using lineage tracing
models coupled with in vitro characterization and in vivo transplantation experiments to define the committed
postnatal beige fat cell progenitor and the tissue niche factors triggering these cells’ development. (2) We will
dissect the function of postnatal beige adipocytes in normal physiology and obesity using mouse models with
temporally regulated ablation of active or dormant postnatal beige adipocytes, along with single nuclear
transcriptomic datasets to define the molecular properties of these cells. We will also employ a new approach to
monitor and characterize interactions between active and dormant postnatal beige adipocytes and other adipose
tissue cell types. This proposal will provide a new conceptual understanding of beige adipocytes and the first
insights into the role of dormant beige adipocytes in adipose tissue and whole-body homeostasis. In addressing
key knowledge gaps in the field, findings from these studies could serve as the framework for targeting postnatal
beige adipocytes for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and associated diseases."

 RNA interference (RNAi) using short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising strategy to block disease-
causing targets that are difficult to selectively and/or potently block with conventional small molecule drugs. Five
siRNA drugs are now in clinical use, all gaining FDA approval since 2018. The first siRNA drug was a lipid
nanoparticle, but subsequent drugs are “carrier-free” molecular conjugates enabled by chemical modifications
to the RNA that provide nuclease stability. Carrier-free technologies are of great interest due to manufacturing
simplicity and reduced risk of carrier (cationic polymer or lipid) associated side effects and toxicities.
 siRNAs can be readily designed and optimized for hitting any gene in the body and, therefore, have
tremendous therapeutic potential. However, all siRNA drugs currently approved by the FDA aim to silence gene
expression in the liver, and no new siRNA drugs have been approved for treatment of diseases localized to or
emanating from other sites in the body.
 We are optimizing siRNA conjugates for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease
that is a leading cause of physical disability in the United States. Current OA treatments, such as steroids, reduce
pain but can cause side effects and do not halt or slow progression of the disease. siRNA therapeutics offer the
option to block the genetic underpinnings of the disease and have the potential to yield the first disease modifying
osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs).
 The proposed project aims build from our recent work developing siRNA molecules end-modified through
a PEG linker with a diacyl lipid (siRNA-L2), which spontaneously forms a molecular complex with albumin
(alb/siRNA-L2) in situ following intravenous injection. We have shown this albumin “hitchhiking” siRNA-L2 to be
safe and to have a high level of accumulation and on-target gene silencing activity in injured joints.
 Cells residing in OA-afflicted joints produce inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) that initiate and propagate the joint degenerative process. The overall goal of this proposal is to
implement siRNA-L2 to systemically treat and block progression of PTOA and to build from promising data
showing that silencing of MMP13 has therapeutic benefit in post-traumatic OA. Specifically, this project will (1)
elucidate the mechanism of action of siRNA-L2 against MMP13 in OA, (2) test new chemical modifications for
improving joint retention and activity of siRNA-L2, (3) test for efficacy of siRNA-L2 targeting MMP13 in a larger
(non-rodent) animal model, and (4) establish the platform nature of siRNA-L2 against other gene targets
associated with pathogenesis of OA.
 The investigative team for this interdisciplinary project spans RNA chemistry/therapeutics (Duvall), OA
biology and single cell RNA sequencing (Maerz), and OA clinical care (Crofford). These successful scientists
cover the areas of expertise required for the proposed work, assuring high probability of the project’s success."

Antibiotic resistant Gram-negative infections pose a serious threat to human health. The outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria is a unique structure essential for survival; it also functions as a physical barrier to block
entry of many classes of antibiotics and thereby render them ineffective. This research is directed towards
understanding the structure and function of two multi-protein machines responsible for the biogenesis of two
major components of the outer membrane, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane proteins (OMPs). To
understand the protein-protein interactions within each machine and their molecular structures, biochemical and
structural studies will be undertaken. To dissect the functions of the individual components of these machines,
intermediates in transport and assembly of LPS and OMPs will be characterized structurally, biochemically, and
in cells. A better understanding of the protein machinery and the processes in which they are involved may lead
to the discovery of inhibitors that could ultimately be developed to treat Gram-negative infections."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired disability in children. The evidence available to
guide TBI management is disproportionately low relative to its medical and societal burden. Recovery from TBI
is determined by the interaction of a multitude of dynamic biological, psychosocial, and therapeutic factors.
DNA methylation (DNAm; the methylome) is a major epigenetic regulator of gene expression that responds
dynamically to an individual’s internal (e.g., tissue insult) and external (e.g., psychosocial adversity)
environment. Initial preclinical and adult clinical studies show differential DNAm both acutely and months after
TBI; however, little is known regarding pediatric TBI. Because the methylome is dynamic over time and
responsive to both internal and external factors associated with TBI recovery, we hypothesize that the
methylome confers risk or protective effects on long-term neurobehavioral recovery through the regulation of
genes involved in the brain’s response to TBI. Therefore, interrogation of the methylome could reveal critical
information about the biologic complexity underlying recovery, with significant potential for improving future
clinical management of pediatric TBI. To further interrogate the methylome as an untapped source of biologic
complexity underlying recovery from pediatric TBI, we will generate methylome-wide DNAm data from an
ongoing longitudinal study of children aged 3-18 years with complicated mild to severe TBI or orthopedic injury
(OI; comparison group). Our two-tiered analytic approach will involve: Tier 1. Comprehensive examination of
brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) DNAm (~55 DNAm sites), grounded in our strong preliminary data;
and Tier 2. Unbiased discovery-based analysis of the entire methylome (>935,000 sites), revealing the most
significant methylomic signals for future targeted biomarker research. Both Tiers will be examined within each
of the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the association between pediatric TBI and acute DNAm; (2)
Identify associations between acute DNAm and long-term neurobehavioral outcomes; (3) Identify associations
between acute DNAm and disparities in neurobehavioral outcomes as a function of psychosocial adversity;
and (4) Explore associations between longitudinal DNAm and neurobehavioral recovery. Exemplifying rigor
and reproducibility, our approach includes analysis of a discovery cohort (235 TBI, 179 OI) followed by
replication in an independent cohort (105 TBI, 105 OI). Finally, we will conduct clinical feasibility testing to
ensure that only the most rigorous, reproducible, and clinically translatable findings advance for further
scientific inquiry. The overall impact of this work will be to advance the field of pediatric TBI towards precision
medicine and health equity through an improved understanding of the biologic complexity underlying recovery
and its intersection with psychosocial adversity; revealing biologic signatures of risk for poor recovery; and
identification of DNAm sites with potential for clinical translation as methylomic biomarkers that could
revolutionize TBI management."

Biocompatible chemical transformations that are promoted by light have become powerful tools in chemical
biology by virtue of enabling spatiotemporal control over activity. Whilst genetically encoded photoactivatable
tools have become mainstays in the bio-orthogonal toolbox, light driven conjugation methods that effectively
interface with native biomolecular structures (no genetic encoding) under biologically relevant conditions, are
comparatively limited. In this project, we will evolve a method recently developed by our group for the
photobioconjugation of Tryptophan (Trp) residues using redox-active N-carbamoylpyridinium salts that engage
Trp in photo-induced electron transfer. We will show that, by carefully modulating the optical and electrochemical
properties of these reagents, that we will be able to both (1) dramatically enhance the kinetic capabilities of this
labelling reaction and (2) enable the discovery of new mechanistic paradigms that promote this labelling
chemistry. Moreover, we will demonstrate that, through careful manipulation of optical and electrochemical
properties of the N-carbamoyl pyridinum salt reagent, that we will be able to invoke mechanistic control over Trp
labelling in a wavelength-dependent fashion (i.e. we can control reaction mechanism with a given wavelength
of light). This, in turn, will allow us to design new application-based experiments that can both command precise
reaction outcomes and markedly expand the capabilities of photobioconjugation chemistry. Specifically, we will
harness this optical and mechanistic control for the design of new activity-based sensing applications as well as
through the design of proximity labelling approaches that we apply to the study of poorly understood processes
in mitochondrial dynamics."

The goal of this K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr.
Miriam Vos to train, mentor, and support new investigators in patient-oriented research in the field of early
cardiometabolic disease. The wide accessibility of dietary sugars in childhood has contributed to the childhood
onset of insulin resistance, central weight gain, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. One of the most important
questions is the reversibility of cardiometabolic disease in children – particularly with interventions in the pre-
pubertal time period before adult phenotype weight gain occurs. My short-term research goals are to understand
the physiologic changes in children that lead to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD,
formerly named NAFLD) onset and to test sugar reduction as a prevention for MASLD and the accompanying
insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. My long-term research goals are to develop an evidence base that will lead
to public health campaigns to reduce the prevalence and severity of MASLD in children and to advance the field
toward precise nutrition recommendations for children, targeted to their physiologic and genetic propensities.
These goals align with the NHLBI Strategic Vision Objective 3, including identifying the causes of CVD health
differences. My prior experience in clinical trials in children, with embedded mechanistic studies, my leadership
in clinical and translational research, and my collaborations with leading experts in body composition
assessment, omics, machine learning, and genetics provide an exceptional milieu for new investigators. This
K24 application will provide protected time to devote specifically to mentoring new investigators in patient-
oriented research (POR) in the prevention of cardiometabolic disease in children, to support mentee career
advancement, and to nurture their growth into independent investigators. This proposal describes an existing
portfolio of funded research including the R01-funded clinical trial “Prevention of Pediatric MASLD in Hispanic
Children” that creates opportunities for ancillary research projects for mentees. New research is proposed to
explore genetic-environment interactions as drivers of cardiometabolic health in Hispanic/Latino children. The
Aims of this proposal are: 1) To increase mentoring of new investigators, particularly clinical fellows, and early
career faculty, 2) To facilitate patient-oriented research addressing childhood onset cardiometabolic disease and
MASLD, and 3) To support career development activities for the applicant including experience in NIH training
grants, training in leadership and the advancement of persons underrepresented in medicine and training in the
application of genetics in POR. Together, the proposed research, mentoring activities, and career development
activities will expand the discovery of effective prevention strategies for cardiometabolic disease in children."
10979675,"Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) genomic RNA is detected by host cells to induce an innate immune response. Detection of MRV RNA also contributes to the induction of cell death. Because viral genomic RNA remains contained within particles throughout infection, how the RNA becomes exposed and accumulates to the level that induces a host response remains unknown. In this proposal, we will uncover how viral RNA becomes detectable by the host cell. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will build on the data that specific endosomal uptake pathways, endosomal protease activity, and endosomal maturation are required for exposure of viral genomic RNA from incoming particles. We will identify how these endosomal properties influence genomic RNA exposure. We will also determine how viral determinants control exposure and transport of viral genomic dsRNA for detection by cytoplasmic sensors. In Aim 2, we will determine how the assembly of the viral µ1 capsid protein on progeny cores blocks excessive accumulation of viral RNA. We will perform biochemical and virological experiments to identify structure-function relationships in µ1 that mediate these effects. We will also define the structural basis of µ1-mediated shut down of viral RNA transcription by solving the structure of a MRV assembly intermediates. In Aim 3 of the proposal, we will follow up on our preliminary data indicating that cellular RNA transporter SIDT2 controls MRV RNA levels. We will define whether the RNautophagy function of SIDT2 governs its antiviral effect and determine whether viral RNA turnover is influenced by RNautophagy. Finally, we will define how RNAs are specifically recognized by the RNautophagy machinery. Completion of this work will reveal viral and cellular factors that control the detection of MRV and other related dsRNA viruses by host cells."

Malaria in pregnancy poses significant threat to the wellbeing of the mother, fetus, and neonate and in sub-
Saharan Africa, it kills 100,000 infants annually and accounts for about 20% of stillbirths. These fetal adverse
outcomes are mainly due to the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in placental
intervillous spaces, resulting in placental malaria (PM). This happens even when malaria infection is
asymptomatic and undetectable in maternal blood. The burden of PM is worsened by rising resistance to
intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), which is recommended for
malaria chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy. Indeed, our data show that many women on IPTp-SP who test
malaria negative and are asymptomatic, still have PM. PM is associated with several adverse effects on the
fetus, including fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The adverse
outcomes are mainly due to placental injury and not fetal infection by Plasmodium falciparum, which is rare.
Since the placenta is inaccessible during pregnancy, the impact of PM on placental biology is unclear, and there
are no tools for PM detection during pregnancy, representing a critical research gap. These factors and the
limited understanding of the effects of PM on placental function and physiology significantly hamper the
development of effective PM interventions and diagnostic tools. However, the placenta sheds vast amounts of
extracellular vesicles into maternal circulation, offering a non-invasive readout of the fetal environment. To
comprehensively understand the cellular and molecular processes that underlie PM-driven placental
pathobiology, we propose to leverage our well-defined placental biobank to, 1) identify the transcriptomic
signatures of PM-induced placental pathobiology, and 2) identify PM-associated transcriptomic signatures in
maternal circulation. The latter will be implemented by profiling the transcriptome of maternally circulating
placental extracellular vesicles and by identifying placenta-originated cell-free RNA in maternal circulation. These
analyses will uncover processes/factors underlying PM-induced placental pathobiology and those that can be
targeted to prevent or mitigate PM. The identified PM biomarkers will be leveraged to develop effective
point-of-care tools for PM diagnosis in low-resource settings, which have the potential to significantly
improve maternal and child health outcomes. The proposed work will also build a strong foundation in research
networks, infrastructure, skills, and data for follow up studies on the pathobiology of PM and its consequences
for the developing child. Moreover, the strategies, experience, knowledge, tools, and platforms used in this study
can be extended to other common placental infections in sub-Saharan Africa."

The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool."
10979939,"Neuropathic spontaneous pain, a main symptom of neuropathic pain, is often a particularly intractable clinical
problem. While much has been done to understand the sensory sensitization to evoked pain, the mechanisms
underlying neuropathic spontaneous pain are less understood and believed to be different from evoked pain
mechanisms. Our collaborator Dr. Xinzhong Dong’s lab in Johns Hopkins University created Pirt-GCaMP6 mice,
mice in which a genetically encoded Ca²+ indicator GCaMP6 is specifically expressed in >95% of dorsal root
ganglion (DRG) neurons under the control of the Pirt promoter. With these mice, we were able to examine DRG
neuronal activity in vivo, still in its original environment and spatial arrangement. We found that after nerve injury,
spatially clustered neurons with sporadic spontaneous activity formed within the DRG (Zheng et al., Neuron,
2022). Mice that displayed increased spontaneous pain behavior after nerve injury were found to highly correlate
with presence of these ectopic ‘cluster’ neurons. We further discovered that cluster firing of DRG neurons and
neuropathic spontaneous pain could be triggered by sympathetic activation - effects blocked by both α- and β-
adrenergic antagonists. However, the main target of sympathetic activation is not clear since adrenoceptors are
expressed in sensory neurons as well as the blood vessels in the DRGs. Results from our preliminary studies
show that cluster firing and spontaneous pain behaviors are enhanced by local or systemic administration of
vasoconstrictors (e.g., phenylephrine or angiotensin II), and that evoked and spontaneous cluster firing as well
as spontaneous pain are decreased by blocking the Piezo2 mechanoreceptors in the DRG pharmacologically or
genetically. We thus hypothesize that neuropathic spontaneous pain and cluster firing of sensory neurons after
peripheral nerve injury are triggered by the mechanical movement (i.e., vasoconstriction and/or vasodilation,
blood vessel displacement) of the blood vessels within the DRGs. The somata or axons of all neurons in the
clusters are physically associated with branches of blood vessels supplying the DRG. We further hypothesize
that Piezo2 receptors expressed in the majority of hyperexcitable DRG neurons mediate such effects. The
above-mentioned findings that sympathetically evoked cluster firing and spontaneous pain can be blocked by
both α- and β-adrenergic antagonists support our hypothesis since blocking α- and β-adrenoceptors would block
vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively, and both would result in stabilization of blood vessel movement.
In this application, using established mouse and rat neuropathic pain models, we propose to test the hypothesis
in 3 Specific Aims (SA). SA1 will characterize the role of local vascular movement in triggering neuropathic
spontaneous pain. SA2 will determine how mechanoreceptors in sensory neurons contribute to vascular
movement-evoked spontaneous pain. SA3 is to identify additional key risk factors for vascular movement-evoked
spontaneous pain. The proposed experiments will investigate a novel mechanism for neuropathic spontaneous
pain and provide a mechanistic basis for developing better therapeutics for this often-intractable clinical problem."

Revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction represents an infrequent but clinically important
challenge in orthopaedic practice. It is commonly reported that the results of revision surgery remain inferior
to primary ACL reconstructions, while the etiology of these poorer outcomes compared with primary
reconstructions remains unknown. With this in mind, the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS) group was
established as an 83-surgeon multicenter consortium to perform a prospective longitudinal cohort analysis of
revision ACL reconstruction outcomes. This is a mixed group of academic and private practice physicians
and has been supported and endorsed by the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM).
Over 1,200 patients were enrolled and have now been followed beyond ten years.
Our previous grant built on previous 2 and 6-year follow-up and obtained 10-year follow-up on the entire
cohort (patient-reported outcome measures and incidence of subsequent surgeries), as well as collecting 10-
year onsite follow-up within a nested cohort for radiographic and clinical measures. Radiographic onsite
follow-up demonstrated structural post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA; Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3-4) in 56%
of the onsite cohort. Previous meniscectomy proved to be a predictor for this severe structural OA, but 60%
did not have a previous medial or lateral meniscectomy. Thus, this proposed grant will utilize genomics
targeted for OA predictors to seek to determine a more comprehensive risk profile for patients for symptomatic
and structural PTOA. Predictors of risk will guide revision surgical decisions and post-surgical activity and
lifestyle guidance, as the spectrum of resulting PTOA may be influenced by genetic variation. Additionally,
predictors and outcomes for total knee arthroplasty in these young active patients will be assessed. Validated
patient-reported outcome measures will assess outcome at 20 years with analysis for predictors to continue
to build upon 2, 6 and 10-year follow-up in order to shape the care of these challenging patients."

A role for B-cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis has been implicated by clinical, histopathologic and
immunologic studies. The precise role they play in pathology is debated and impact could be mediated through
antibody (Ab) production, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or antigen presentation to T cells. To study
Abs produced by MS CSF B cell clones, we developed protocols to produce recombinant antibodies that
duplicate the fidelity of CD138+ plasmablast clones expanded in the CSF compartment of early active MS
patients. We identified a subset of antibodies that bound to myelin and induced complement-mediated
oligodendrocyte cell death and demyelination in vivo. These lesions spontanelusly repair and have guided
independent studies to investigate the role of microlgia in remyelination. Myelin-specific MS rAbs bind to
membrane lipid complexes anchored by the myelin protelopid 1 protein (PLP1) that is enhanced by sulfatide and
cholesterol. We have further identified a new pathogenic MS rAb that binds myelin complexes independent of
PLP1, but still causes extensive oligodendrocyte loss and CNS demyelination. A semi-quantitiative CSF binding
assay employing PLP1 protein, myelin glcyolipids and choleserol have identified antibodies to PLP1 complexes
in approximately 60% of MS patients but not in inflammatory and neurologic disease control CSF. Hence, we
hypothesize that pathogenic myelin-specific MS rAbs encompass an array of epitope specificities targeting
PLP1 protein, myelin glycolipids and PLP1 binding partners. We further suppose that antibodies to this complex
contribute to type II MS lesions and represent a measurable and specific disease relevant response that can be
quantified in patient CSF and serum. To test our hypothesis, we propose three complementary specific aims. In
Aim 1, we will employ our quantitative PLP1 Ab binding assay to screen biobanked serum and CSF samples
collected from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients, relapsing MS patients, progressive MS patients, and
healthy and inflammatory controls to determine the prevalence of PLP1 Abs across the MS disease spectrum
and to correlate positive binding and titer to clinical correlates of disease activity. Aim 2 will evaluate the
distribution of PLP1 myelin complex pathology in human MS lesions and determine association between
identification of PLP1 complex antibodies from plaques and types of MS lesion histopathology. Lastly in Aim 3
we will identify and confirm the epitopic targets of MS rAbs through a combinantion of immunochemistry and
studies in gene-targeted transgenic knockout mice. We will utilize our established models to independently
evaluate the contributions of PLP1 and glycolipids to CNS demyelination and to develop improved
immunoassays reflecting the complexity of antigen recognition. Together, our results will establish the role of
complex PLP1 antibodies in disease pathogensis and should lead to improved bioassays for disease
identification and reveal optimum therapeutic approaches to treat disease."

 With worsening food insecurity in the COVID-19 pandemic and rising food prices, a 2022 White House initiative
sought to address diet-related diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) and disparities through
food and nutrition insecurity interventions. However, Policymakers lack critical evidence on the effects of
promising interventions to address food and nutrition insecurity because of no available evidence on long-term
population health, effects on health disparities, and cost-effectiveness. This proposal seeks to fill these gaps by
improving our understanding of the health equity and economic effects of different food and nutrition interventions
and providing important evidence to support national priorities around diet-related diseases and health disparities.
 Based on three criteria: (a) strategies outlined in the 2022 White House report, (b) conceptual framework based
on a health impact pyramid and NIMHD research framework regarding the domains of influence (population- vs.
individual-based), and (c) availability of supporting evidence, we have identified four highly promising
interventions to address food and nutrition insecurity: (1) expanding the USDA-supported Gus Schumacher
Nutrition Incentive Program and (2) expanding the SNAP benefits and eligibility, (3) accelerating uptake of
food/nutrition security screening and (4) enhancing access to nutrition/obesity counseling. Using our NIH-funded,
validated, state-of-the-art, and dynamic microsimulation model, this project will measure the longer-term health
outcomes, health equity, and economic impact of these four highly promising policy interventions to address food
and nutrition insecurity on the US adult population and across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Through
robust sensitivity and scenario analyses, our analytic framework allows us to examine the heterogeneous effects
of these diverse interventions on long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness across population subgroups
and whether such heterogeneous effects reflect differences in baseline risks (e.g., food insecurity) or vulnerability
to the risk (e.g., effects of food insecurity on outcomes) or intervention’s effects across subgroups. Our innovative
approach and multidisciplinary expert research team uniquely position us to measure long-term population health
effects of food and nutrition insecurity interventions (Aim 1), estimate long-term effects on health disparity across
population subgroups of food and nutrition insecurity interventions (Aim 2), quantify economic effects and cost-
effectiveness of food and nutrition insecurity interventions (Aim 3). An independent dissemination aim will
improve knowledge translation to end-users by conducting legal and administrative feasibility analysis and
developing a web-based interactive platform (National Food and Nutrition Policy Impact Simulator).
 With the growing need for more robust evidence to address food and nutrition insecurity, our project will
generate policy-relevant evidence on optimal policy choices that may depend on how different interventions
affect long-term population health, certain key groups (i.e., reducing disparities), and overall cost-effectiveness.
Using such evidence, policymakers can prioritize evidence-based national food and nutrition policies."
10981959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) is a tumor suppressor gene best known for is function in DNA
repair. Early studies suggested that genome instability within the mammary epithelial system of BRCA1
mutation carriers (BRCA1+/mut) promotes a cascade of cell autonomous, genetic events ultimately giving rise to
cancer initiation within a population of luminal epithelial progenitor cells. However, a major gap in knowledge is
whether germline BRCA1 mutations lead to cell state aberrations within the cellular microenvironment
surrounding the epithelium, which may act in trans to promote pre-cancerous changes in the epithelial system
thereby promoting breast cancer initiation.
 In this renewal, we will expand on the provocative findings from our currently funded project, which
identified dramatic precancerous changes in both breast epithelium and surrounding microenvironment of
human BRCA1+/mut. Our work identified the expansion of epithelial cells with basal-luminal intermediate (BLI)
phenotype as well as a population of epithelium-surrounding precancer-associated fibroblasts (preCAFs)
expressing copious amounts of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and immunoregulatory factors (e.g.,
neutrophil-attracting CXCL8). Based on our progress and preliminary data, we will address the hypothesis that
preCAFs emerge in a cell-intrinsic manner due to fibroblast-specific BRCA1 deficiency leading to an aberrant
form of fibroblast differentiation. In this context, we will test whether cell-intrinsic NFkB activation in BRCA1+/mut
acts as a central signaling node towards the preCAF state. We will also determine whether BRCA1mut
fibroblasts establish a precancerous immunosuppressive microenvironment during breast cancer initiation
through MIP-2, a mouse homologue for CXCL8. Addressing these major gaps in knowledge about the function
and origin of preCAFs may pave the way towards novel therapeutic approaches to block the cancer-promoting
function of preCAFs or reverse their phenotype as precision cancer prevention strategies."

The challenge of repairing extensive bone injuries remains an unmet clinical challenge. Our research is
dedicated to exploring a novel mouse model of large-scale bone regeneration to unravel the intricate cellular and
molecular events necessary for the large-scale regeneration. While the outer periosteum and the inner
endosteum are recognized as sources of new osteoblasts during normal bone homeostasis, the precise
mechanisms governing the initiation and coordination of repair are not well-understood. We hypothesize a two-
phase repair process following large-scale injury. Initially, a sentinel-type cell population marked by the
expression of Sox9 transitions from quiescent to activated state. In the second phase, we propose that this
subpopulation orchestrates the recruitment of other cells, including bone marrow-derived subpopulations, and
culminating in a callus spanning the injury site. Building on our previous work, which has shown the requirement
for Sox9-lineage cells in large-scale repair, in Aim 1 we investigate the mechanisms that trigger activation of
these cells in response to injury. Specifically we test that the gene Fos is required for their activation and for the
transcription of genes important for coordinating repair. In Aim 2 we determine if these Sox9-lineage cells recruit
bone marrow stromal cells expressing Cxcl12, with this interaction being vital for robust bone callus generation.
Finally, In Aim 3, we determine if Sox9-lineage cells originating from the rib possess distinctive features that
enable them to facilitate the healing of critical-sized femur injuries, possibly through recruiting Cxcl12-lineage
cells from the femur bone-marrow niche. The successful completion of these experiments will provide invaluable
insights into the critical cell types and mechanisms driving large-scale repair in a mammalian model. These
insights could lay the groundwork for future pre-clinical studies targeting challenging skeletal injuries in patients."

The long-term goals of this project are to uncover molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and to design
inhibitors as therapeutics against disease-causing bacteria. Widespread antibiotic resistance among hospital
and community associated bacteria, coupled with the lack of new antibiotics, poses an urgent threat to global
public health. For these reasons, antibiotic resistance is the silent pandemic, which has been mounting since the
introduction of antibiotics in the clinic. The situation is urgent for several pathogens and will become more acute
for other pathogenic bacteria in the coming years. There is no magic bullet solution to solve the antibiotic
resistance problem; rather, a concerted effort is required that includes new antibiotics, tackling resistance
mechanisms head-on, and better stewardship of antibiotics and antiseptics. Bacteria possess several
mechanisms to confer resistance to the host organism, including modification of the antibiotic, mutation to the
target site, reduced uptake of antibiotics, and the presence of membrane protein efflux pumps. This proposal is
aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms of efflux, which is a first-line resistance mechanism used by
bacteria to lower the intracellular drug concentration, thereby facilitating pathogen survival. Inhibitors of efflux
pumps have therapeutic potential as antibiotic adjuvants by directly targeting a central mechanism of resistance
in pathogenic bacteria. However, the lack of clinically approved efflux pump inhibitors underscores a key
challenge in the field: how to design specific inhibitors of a substrate binding pocket that promiscuously binds
structurally diverse drugs? We recently uncovered a promising solution to this problem through the discovery of
antibody inhibitors to B. subtilis Bmr and S. aureus NorA where a loop inserts into the substrate binding pocket.
We hypothesize the substrate binding pockets of transporters can be systematically targeted for inhibition by
peptide mimics of the antibody paratope. By using efflux pumps within the Bacillus genus, Bmr and Blt, this
proposal will probe how efflux pumps recognize multiple substrates (Aim 1), will reveal cryptic pockets within the
substrate binding pocket of efflux pumps by using antibodies as tools (Aim 2), and develop a systematic approach
for creating conformationally defined mimics of the antibody b-hairpin paratope (Aim 3). Since Bmr and Blt share
~80% sequence homology yet display different substrate specificities, this system serves as a good comparative
group for determining whether transporter-selective inhibitors can be designed. The approaches developed in
this grant will establish the long-term viability of novel efflux pump inhibitors to the treatment of antibiotic resistant
organisms."
10980805,"Summary: The goal of this revised proposal is to develop a novel therapeutic approach for overcoming
resistance to radiation therapy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to investigate the mechanism
involved. There is an urgent unmet need to develop strategies to overcome resistance so that the response of
TNBC patients to radiation therapy can be improved. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling through neuropilin-2 (NRP2) in a population of tumor cells present in
TNBC contributes significantly to radiation resistance, and that inhibition of VEGF/NRP2 provides a novel
therapeutic approach for overcoming resistance. The feasibility of this approach is strengthened considerably
by the availability of a mAb that blocks the binding of VEGF to NRP2 specifically and that is available for clinical
use. The approach used benefits from the availability of a large collection of well-characterized organoids
derived from breast cancer patients and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC. The first aim will
investigate the mechanism by which VEGF/NRP2 signaling promotes radiation resistance based on the
observation that VEGF/NRP2 signaling promotes the transcription of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and
increases the level of nitric oxide (NO). Based on this finding, the hypothesis will be investigated that
VEGF/NRP2 signaling sustains the S-nitrosylation of key proteins that contribute to radiation resistance,
including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an
antioxidant transcription factor. The second aim will test
the hypothesis that targeted inhibition of the interaction of VEGF with NRP2 increases the radiosensitivity of
TNBC to a level that is clinically significant by a mechanism dependent on NOS2 inhibition. This goal will be
accomplished by assessing the response of a large panel of TNBC organoids of different subtypes that exhibit
inter-tumor heterogeneity to radiation and anti-NRP2 therapy using the function blocking mAb. RNA-seq will be
performed to identify potential biomarkers of resistant populations and this information will be used to identify
small molecule therapeutics that can be used to target those populations and improve the clinical viability of
aNRP2 treatment in combination with radiation.
This aim will also investigate the impact of this approach in vivo
using syngeneic and metastatic PDX models of TNBC. Overall, the work proposed in this proposal could
significantly improve the therapy of TNBC by selecting those patients who could benefit from anti-NRP2-
enhanced radiotherapy and, consequently, reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with TNBC."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, yet the disease remains highly preventable by
eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke and radon. As rural communities lead the nation in lung cancer
incidence and mortality, there is urgency to lower radon exposure in rural areas. Radon on the RADAR
(Residents Acting to Detect and Alleviate Radon) 1.0 uncovered disparities in access to and affordability of
radon mitigation, and low testing and mitigation rates despite access to radon detectors in public libraries,
and geologic impacts on home radon exposure that warrant further investigation to reduce exposure to the
deadly gas in rural areas. RADAR 2.0 will strengthen partnerships with citizen scientists, public libraries, and
local radon coalitions to increase access to affordable radon mitigation, develop effective radon risk
communication messaging, automate report-back using a novel website platform, and translate geologic
and residential data to builders and policymakers to educate and inform radon resistant new construction
policy. Aim 1 will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a radon
measurement and mitigation curriculum developed and implemented by Kentucky Community and Technical
College System Construction Technology faculty and students. Aim 2 will develop and test the effects of radon
risk messages with rural homeowners who have never tested for radon and those with high radon who have
not mitigated. Aim 3 will design and test the effects of My Radon Report, a novel automated, personalized
radon report-back tool, on intention to test and mitigate for radon, environmental health literacy, and efficacy
for radon testing and mitigation among rural homeowners, and track usage and website metrics for scalability.
Aim 4 will examine the association among geologic, soil, and residential characteristics and indoor radon
values to guide education and better inform radon resistant new construction policy. RADAR 2.0 is innovative
in several ways: 1) partnering with the community college system to build capacity for certified radon mitigators
in rural Kentucky by offering and evaluating a radon measurement and mitigation certification and training
curriculum; 2) evaluating radon testing and mitigation messages with key target groups; 3) developing and
testing a user-initiated, personalized report-back website platform to accompany the radon detector library loan
program; and 4) performing in-depth analyses of soil processes and characteristics that relate to elevated
indoor radon levels, closing a critical gap in our understanding of the role of geologic factors on radon risk
potential. RADAR 2.0 will address gaps in radon risk reduction in rural communities by designing and
evaluating a novel approach to increasing access to certified radon professionals, expanding our
understanding of radon risk messaging and report-back, and conducting in-depth geo-assessment to guide
education and inform radon resistant new construction policy through citizen scientist engagement."
10981459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiac fibrosis is a hallmark of nearly all forms of heart disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. However, despite the intensive research, there is no effective therapy for fibrosis, highlighting an
urgent need to identify better therapeutic targets. As cardiac fibroblasts are the principal mediators for TGFβ
induced fibrosis in heart diseases, targeting a fibroblast-specific molecule which is involved in TGFβ induced
fibrosis would be an ideal target. However, fibroblast specific molecules are yet to be discovered. We previously
demonstrated that TRPM7 is a major functional Ca2+ permeable channel in cardiac fibroblasts and plays a key
role in TGF induced fibrogenesis cascade in cultured fibroblasts. TRPM7 is a unique Ca2+-permeable channel
which possess a kinase domain. We have recently discovered that deletion of Trpm7 effectively reduces cardiac
fibrosis thereby protecting hearts against pressure-overload induced heart failure. Interestingly, we found that
deletion of Trpm7 in fibroblasts is necessary to produce the protective effects, indicating that Trpm7 deletion
produces protective effects in a fibroblast-dependent manner. As targeting fibroblasts to inhibit fibrosis has
recently been defined as a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac fibrosis, we propose that TRPM7 may serve as
a promising therapeutic target for fibrogenesis. Since TRPM7 has both channel and kinase function, one critical
question is whether the channel function or kinase function should be the target for mitigating cardiac fibrosis.
We propose two specific aims to investigate whether TRPM7 channel and/or kinase functions contribute to
TRPM7 mediated fibrogenesis, and how inhibiting channel and/or kinase functions will protect hearts against
fibrosis associated heart diseases. We will apply multidisciplinary approaches including mouse transgenic and
knockout models, molecular biology, biochemistry, patch-clamp, Ca2+ imaging, and various in vitro and in vivo
disease models, as well as fibroblasts from heart failure patients. The results of this proposal will not only answer
the critical questions regarding whether the channel function or kinase activity should be the therapeutic target
for fibrogenesis, but also will reveal novel mechanisms of TRPM7-mediated fibrogenesis in fibrosis associated
heart diseases. More importantly, this proposal will provide translational insights into therapeutic potential of
TRPM7 for pressure overload and ischemic injury induced heart failure."
10984195,"Voltage-gated calcium ion channels are critically important proteins that regulate release of glutamate and
substance P from nociceptors in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. As such, they serve as the
gatekeepers, at the junction of the periphery and central nervous system, conveying information about touch,
heat, mechanical stimulation and more to the brain. High heat or strong mechanical stimuli are noxious and
perceived in the brain as painful. Neurons that detect potentially harmful signals, such as high heat, are
essential for protecting the body against damage. In response to continued stimulation, such as occurs in
tissue injury, these neurons can sensitize as part of a protective response, but their sensitivity usually returns
to normal after healing. In certain chronic pain conditions, such as after peripheral nerve injury, the sensitivity
of nociceptors fails to return to pre injury levels and normal heat and touch continue to be perceived as painful.
This persistence of sensitization combined with ongoing spontaneous activity of pain circuits can result in
unrelenting, chronic pain. Understanding the molecular and cellular changes that occur during the transition
from normal to chronic pain states are the key to improving current – inadequate – therapies. This proposal
builds on our recent discoveries and our unique expertise to determine the role of voltage-gated calcium ion
channels in sensory neurons that contribute to chronic pain. We study Cacna1a and Cacna1b genes that
encode the core subunits of two calcium ion channels, CaV2.1 and CaV2.2, that control transmitter release at
the majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system. We tackle two critically important questions in our
overall objective to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate Cacna1a and Cacna1b processing
and their actions in different subtypes of sensory neurons that transmit information about thermal and
mechanical stimuli: Aim 1. What cellular factors control the expression of the major forms of CaV2 channels in
thermal and mechanical signaling? What molecular changes disrupt the normal pattern of expression of these
calcium ion channels in chronic pain? Aim 2. How do different calcium ion channels function in thermal and
mechanical signaling at peripheral nerve endings in skin? And do the abnormal expression patterns of different
forms of ion channels contribute to the induction and maintenance of abnormal signaling? Our research
addresses major gaps in our understanding, and the results will contribute to new strategies and reveal new
targets for pharmacological or genetic approaches, to mitigate certain forms of chronic pain experienced by
millions of people in the United States."
10985434,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
African Americans are at a significantly elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to the non-Hispanic
white population. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of this health disparity are significantly understudied. Recently,
a variant in Apolipoprotein E (APOE), APOE R145C, was identified as significantly increasing the risk of AD
among individuals of African ancestry. Despite this association, the underlying mechanisms of how the presence
of this APOE variant exacerbates AD onset and progression in aging adults have yet to be elucidated. As such,
we will use our collective experience in stem cell bioengineering, neurodegenerative disease modeling, and
genome editing to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which the APOE R145C variant modulates AD risk. To
that end, in the first aim, we will use our recently developed highly efficient gene editing approach to introduce
the APOE R145C variant into isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from both non-demented
control (NDC) and AD patients including those derived from African American subjects. In turn, in the second
aim, biochemical, cellular, and genetic analysis of neuronal, astrocytic, and microglia cultures will be used to
determine the effect of the APOE R145C variant on the presence of AD-related phenotypes. In particular, we
will determine if APOE R145C exerts its risk modifying effects through (i) modulation of Aβ processing, secretion,
or uptake and (ii) alteration in tau hyperphosphorylation and uptake. In addition, whole transcription analysis will
be used to identify signaling pathways and transcriptional targets that are modified by the presence of the APOE
R145C variant and disease status. Overall, the data obtained as part of this proposal will set the stage for future
hypothesis-testing studies to probe the mechanisms by which the African American-associated APOE R145C
variant accelerates AD onset. Such investigations will have a significant impact on the design of molecularly
targeted therapies to treat AD in the high-risk African American population."

10995575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is the 15th leading cause of death in the United States with a ruptured
aneurysm resulting in an 80% likelihood of mortality. AAAs are typically diagnosed as an incidental finding and
managed via follow-up imaging modalities to track aneurysm size and growth rate. If the aneurysm reaches a
critical diameter of 5.5 cm in men or 5.0 cm in women, a surgical repair is recommended. Despite numerous
promising preclinical studies, all medical therapies have failed to attenuate the progression of established
AAAs in patients. This situation creates a serious gap in therapeutic aneurysm care as a significant number of
patients suffer a fatal rupture before surgical repair.
 Our failure to identify an effective therapeutic is likely due to our poor understanding of the molecular
mechanisms influencing AAA initiation and progression. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is a
ubiquitously expressed cytokine initiating complex signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation,
differentiation, and inflammation. Researchers have shown that TGFβ1 is a crucial mediator of aortic
homeostasis. Antibody-mediated targeting of TGFβ1 has resulted in consistent worsening of AAA in multiple
rodent models while overexpression of TGFβ1 attenuated aneurysm progression. These studies provide strong
evidence for TGFβ1 playing a protective role, however the source and mechanism of protective TGFβ1
remains unknown. We need to understand how this key signaling pathway is affecting this disease to develop
a clearer picture of AAA progression.
 The primary goal of this proposal is to evaluate platelets as a source of protective TGFβ1 and aortic
adventitial fibroblasts as the mediating cell type. Thus, we hypothesize that platelet-derived TGFβ1 mitigates
pathologic aortic expansion by binding to adventitial fibroblasts, stimulating extracellular matrix formation, and
reinforcing the aortic wall. Our two specific aims will (1) evaluate platelet-specific depletion of TGFβ1 in
multiple models of murine AAA and (2) assess adventitial fibroblasts as the mediator of protective TGFβ1
signaling. Successful completion of this F31 proposal will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by
which TGFβ signaling protects AAA initiation and progression and may generate new avenues of research
directed towards therapies for AAA patients. The experience gained from completing this proposal under the
mentorship of Dr. Owens and my thesis committee at the University of Cincinnati will facilitate my growth into
an independent investigator."
10995742,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use is common in the United States and more frequent use is associated with individual and societal
consequences. The use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches is useful in alcohol research
to identify strategies that may reduce alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences in the moment they would
otherwise occur. The role of stress in alcohol use has received considerable attention, and some EMA studies
have found momentary associations between stress and alcohol craving and use. Parenting is one common
source of stress for adults, and mothers in particular may be more likely to drink in response to stress. Both
parent stress and parent alcohol use can impact children’s well-being and alcohol use. Therefore, it is important
to understand these associations in mothers, in the moments they occur, as they have potential to impact the
health and well-being of both mothers and their children. It is also important to understand moderators that might
disrupt associations between stress and drinking to inform alcohol interventions. Mindfulness is broadly
associated with stress reduction and less alcohol use. Therefore, mindfulness may be one useful target for
alcohol interventions that seek to disrupt stress-related drinking. However, no studies to date have tested
mindfulness buffering against stress-related drinking in EMA, and no studies have looked at this in mothers. The
proposed study will address these gaps by investigating momentary associations between stress and alcohol
craving and use in the daily lives of mothers and whether mindfulness moderates this association using EMA.
This study will leverage an ongoing R01 study of highly stressed parents (R01DA052427) by recruiting a
subsample of 75 mothers to complete an additional EMA component. EMA surveys will assess momentary stress
and stressors, alcohol craving, alcohol use, and mindfulness in mothers’ daily lives across two weeks.
Knowledge from the proposed F31 study will elucidate processes underlying stress-related drinking in mothers
that can be used as targets for future interventions, including smartphone-based just-in-time interventions that
are sensitive to gender and social context (e.g., parenting). The proposed study will be completed within a
research training plan that provides training in design and implementation of EMA studies, analysis of intensive
repeated longitudinal data, knowledge of stress and alcohol and alcohol measurement, intervention science, and
research dissemination. This training will be supported by a mentorship team with expertise in EMA, stress and
alcohol use, alcohol measurement, mindfulness-based intervention, and longitudinal statistical methods.
Completion of the proposed research project will provide in-depth conceptual knowledge and hands-on training
that would prepare me to independently conduct EMA studies of alcohol use after the completion of the F31
award. Altogether, the training and mentorship afforded through the proposed study would greatly support my
development toward a career as an independent alcohol researcher, integrating cutting edge methods to
contribute meaningful knowledge to the field that can inform future alcohol interventions."

This grant proposal, Microbiome Targeted Treatment of WTC- Lung Injury, builds upon the success of the
Food Intake Restriction for Health Outcome Support and Education (FIREHOUSE) trial, a groundbreaking dietary
intervention targeting improved lung health in firefighters exposed to World Trade Center dust. Preliminary
findings identified a correlation between weight loss and elevated levels of bacteroides ovatus, associated with
enhanced pulmonary function. This proposal aims to delve deeper into the potential of bacteriotherapy by
investigating antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory proteins in sera collected during the FIREHOUSE trial.
Additionally, a murine model will be developed to further explore the therapeutic potential of bacteriotherapy
using bacteroides ovatus (b. ovatus).
We propose 2 AIMs to explore the hypothesis that b. ovatus can be potentially used as bacteriotherapy to
ameliorate the persistent lung disease in WTC-exposed firefighters. AIM1 will identify the inflammatory and
health profile changes in those with higher abundance of b. ovatus compared to those with lower abundance.
AIM2 will explore the potential of B. ovatus as a therapeutic supplement for PM-induced lung disease using a
murine model.
Through meticulous analysis of collected specimens and innovative murine models, we aspire to unravel the
intricate mechanisms of the microbiome and its role in promoting pulmonary health. We will assay for IL-17 and
RAGE, key mediators in particulate matter-related disease, and inflammation in pulmonary and gastrointestinal
disease. This research is significant in contributing to the burgeoning field of microbiome studies and may provide
crucial insights for developing targeted interventions and therapeutic strategies. By elucidating these pathways,
we aim to mitigate the impact of World Trade Center-lung injury on firefighters and similarly exposed populations.
The proposed K01 funding not only supports the investigation of this vital health condition but also facilitates the
continued professional development of the principal investigator, ensuring the longevity and impact of WTC
research.
Data generated by this proposal will provide novel insights into central mediators that control the interactions
between PM, microbiome, and metabolomic health. We will focus on b. ovatus, but will generate data that can
be generalized to identify other related pathways that may be important in other exposed cohorts. These studies
will bring us closer to development of bacteriotherapy for lung health. Woven throughout this proposal is a
continued training component of advanced bioinformatics and translational techniques that will allow me to seek
further independent funding to study the potential of bacteriotherapy in lung disease, a topic of considerable and
urgent importance."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of 5% of all human cancers, including 25% of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). HPV-driven disease progression requires both persistent infection and
evasion of the host immune response. One mechanism of immune evasion employed by many cancers, including
HPV+ HNSCCs, is the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on the surface of
tumor cells. MHC-I antigen presentation is crucial for recognition of tumor cells by CD8+ T cells during the
antitumor response and is a major contributor to lack of patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Our lab has previously shown that an E3 ubiquitin ligase upregulated in HPV+ HNSCCs, MARCHF8,
ubiquitinates immune surface receptors, including MHC-I, for subsequent degradation. Further, a genome wide
CRISPR screen identified genes involved in autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway, as candidates for
negative regulators of MHC-I. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that MARCHF8 upregulation by
papillomaviruses promotes immune evasion by directing MHC-I for autophagic degradation. To test this
hypothesis, I will 1) investigate the mechanism of MARCHF8-mediated MHC-I ubiquitination and degradation via
the autophagy pathway and 2) evaluate inhibition of autophagy as a novel treatment for HPV+ HNSCC. With
these aims, this project will uncover a mechanism of immune evasion during papillomavirus-induced
carcinogenesis."
10996049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Stroke is the third leading cause of disability globally, and the number of incident strokes is expected to
increase substantially as the size of the population aged 65 and older grows. After a stroke, some patients
experience an accelerated decline in cognitive and functional ability, while disability stabilizes for other
patients. However, little is known about why cognitive trajectories vary widely after stroke. One theory of
cognitive aging is that a more complex living environment is potentially protective against cognitive decline by
allowing for opportunities for exercise, recreation, and social activities. One way to measure individuals’ living
environments is through studying their life-space, which is the size and pattern of the physical area in which
they spend their time. Studies have found that life-space is associated with better cognitive function in older
adults. However, there is a lack of research in identifying the mechanisms by which life-space is protective
against cognitive decline post-stroke. We will leverage two studies to evaluate the relationship between life-
space and long-term cognitive decline after stroke. Here, we propose a study that aims to (1) estimate the
effects of components of life-space on cognitive decline in the years following stroke in a large observational
cohort from the Cardiovascular Health Study (n=5,888), (2) characterize the life-space of stroke survivors using
geolocation data in the StrokeCog cohort (n=270) and (3) prospectively evaluate the effect of components of
life-space on cognitive change after stroke. Our findings will advance our understanding of factors that affect
the long-term cognitive trajectory after ischemic stroke. This award will also support the career development of
Sylvie Dobrota Lai, a doctoral student in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the
Stanford School of Medicine. Through completing the proposed research, the applicant will pursue training in
(1) the epidemiology of aging, (2) clinical issues in stroke patients, (3) geospatial data collection and analysis,
and (4) career development. The applicant will be supported by a mentorship team comprising of experts in
aging epidemiology, statistics, and neurology. Through this fellowship, the applicant will develop strong
methodological skills, gain subject expertise, and become a more independent epidemiologic researcher. The
proposed study will provide a strong foundation for the applicant’s future academic research career and
position her to become a leader in aging research."
10995030,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) is swiftly expanding in the United States. Ideally, such policy shifts
are informed by evidence; however, little is known about the effects of RCL. This is particularly true for long-
term effects. Data from states that were the first to legalize cannabis can help understand RCL’s long-term
effects. With public opinion indicating that further RCL expansion is likely, it is imperative to clearly understand
its public health consequences. Our original grant suggested that adults living in RCL states used cannabis
20% more frequently (than those in non-RCL states) but had virtually no other psychosocial consequences.
However, increasing evidence suggests that cannabis use is most consequential when it is frequent and
persistent. In the context of this literature, it is worth noting that our original grant assessed behavior within
approximately five years of legalization. It is unclear whether continued access to cannabis in RCL
environments increases persistent use, leading to negative consequences. We propose a renewal grant to
examine the long-term impact of RCL in approximately 4,500 participants from two large, prospective twin
cohorts in Colorado (CO; full RCL since 2014) and Minnesota (MN; RCL passed in 2023, dispensaries
expected to open in 2024). Both CO and MN participants have been assessed at least three times before RCL
began in CO (adolescence, emerging adulthood, young adulthood) and twice since RCL began in CO. The
proposed project would collect the third post-RCL assessment in CO and the first since RCL began in MN. We
will leverage this study design to control important familial confounds related to cannabis use and its potential
consequences. Further, we will incorporate the longitudinal nature of these cohorts to control prior behavior
(e.g., cannabis use, mental health) while examining the effects of RCL. Thus, we will use these data to address
whether years of RCL access affect cannabis use, alcohol use, mental health, and physical health (Aim 1). We
hypothesize that having more years of RCL access is associated with greater cannabis use and
consequences. Further, we will determine whether pre-RCL mental and physical health problems predict
increased post-RCL cannabis use (Aim 2). This aim is based on evidence, including our preliminary data, that
suggest health problems are a common motive for cannabis use. Thus, we hypothesize that pre-RCL health
problems are associated with greater post-RCL cannabis use. Finally, we will identify individual differences
uniquely related to post-RCL cannabis use and consequences (Aim 3). We hypothesize that post-RCL
cannabis and its consequences are associated with greater perceived cannabis benefits, greater ease of
access, and personality factors that may have impeded cannabis use in non-legal contexts (higher harm
avoidance, lower rule-breaking). In summary, this study will equip key stakeholders with well-controlled, rich
evidence on the consequences of RCL."
10976658,"Age-related cognitive changes: Effects of combined flavonoid intake and
physical exertion mediated by the gut microbiome
Age-related cognitive changes can be the first indication of the progression to dementias, such
as Alzheimer's. These changes may be driven by a complex interaction of factors including diet,
activity levels, genetics, and environment. Recent in vivo experiments and human clinical trials
have shown that flavonoid-rich foods can inhibit neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive
performance. Improved cognition has also been correlated with a physically-active lifestyle, and
with the functionality, composition, and diversity of the gut microbiome. Research has
established that 1) the great majority (+90%) of dietary flavonoids are biotransformed into
phytoactive phenolic metabolites at the gut microbiome level prior to absorption, 2) prebiotic-
like dietary flavonoids alter microbiota profiles, functionality and diversity, 3) health-relevant
outcomes from flavonoid ingestion may only be realized in the presence of a robust microbiome
and 4) physical exertion (moderate aerobic exercise) dramatically accelerates the uptake of these
gut-derived anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory phenolic metabolites into circulation.
This project's hypothesis is that the combination of flavonoid-rich diet and routine physical
activity may potentiate cognitive benefits and reduce cognitive decline in an aging population,
via mechanisms mediated by the gut microbiome. Aim 1 will examine the effects of routine
flavonoid-rich blueberry intake (12-weeks), combined with or in the absence of regular
moderate exercise, on cognitive function in a clinical population of older participants identified
as experiencing age-related cognitive changes. Aim 2 will investigate, using shotgun
metagenomics, the extent to which observed cognitive function is associated with intervention-
induced changes in the microbiome and explore synergies. This Aim will leverage a unique and
extensive in-house library of gut-derived phenolic metabolite standards. In Aim 3, the ability to
abrogate the microbiome in test animals, unlike humans, will clarify its role in linking diet and
physical exertion to cognition in aging brains. A mouse cognitive decline model employing
antibiotics will isolate and interrogate the role of the microbiome as a mechanistic target by
which dietary flavonoids and/or exertion improve cognitive outcomes. We will humanize the
mice using fecal samples collected at baseline from human clinical subjects exhibiting age-
related cognitive changes. The overall result of this project will determine how dietary
flavonoids (e.g. berries) and moderate physical exertion, as reasonable diet and lifestyle
modifications, can impact cognitive change in the aging population via the gut microbiome."

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common hematological malignancy and the leading cause of
cancer-related death in children in the United States. Multi-drug chemotherapy has vastly improved 5-year event-
free survival by over 80%; however, the prognosis for children with refractory or relapsed disease is less positive,
with complete remission rates dropping to 30%.
 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are conserved across eukaryotes from
yeast to humans. These enzymes play a central role in regulating cellular activities from survival and proliferation
to stress response, differentiation, motility, and angiogenesis. MAPK pathways couple diverse extracellular
signals (growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and environmental stresses) to distinct intracellular gene programs
via a series of activating phosphorylation events. Providing direct input to these kinases are the MAPK/ERK
kinase (MEK) family enzymes, also called mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAP2K or MKKs).
Currently, there are four FDA-approved MEK inhibitors which block inputs to the ERK1/2 arm of the pathway, all
of which inhibit MEK1/2. Loss of MAP2K7 (a.k.a. MEK7) repression and consequent amplification of downstream
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is thought to contribute to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL) pathology. Currently, the only known function of MEK7 is the phosphorylation of JNK, its downstream
signaling partner in the MAP kinase signaling cascade. However, its structurally and functionally homologous
isoform MEK4 also functions to phosphorylate this downstream kinase. The relative inputs of MEK4 and MEK7
seem to be variable and context dependent. This gap in the knowledge is currently a major impediment to fully
understanding MEK signaling pathways in the context of cancer. Although both MEK4 and MEK7 activate JNK,
only MEK7 appears to mediate JNK-dependent inflammatory responses in immune cells. Likewise, it is possible
that inhibition of MEK7 in the context of T-ALL may lead to compensatory upregulation of MEK4-promoted JNK
phosphorylation. Equipped with highly selective MEK7 inhibitors, we are uniquely enabled to dissect this critical
kinase cascade for the first time. Herein, we propose the further development of new molecular tools to attenuate
MEK7-mediated JNK phosphorylation. These new probe compounds will then be applied to the cellular
dissection of the JNK arm of the MAP kinase signaling cascade in the context of T-ALL. Clinically relevant mouse
models will then be employed to identify the optimal drug target(s) in T-ALL."
10990878,"The proposed study employs a randomized, controlled design to assess the immediate and long-term effects of
task-specific balance training for reducing environmental falls in at-risk community-dwelling older adults. >33%
of older adults fall at least once each year, leading to serious injuries (e.g., hip fractures, head injuries) and
comorbidities (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias). Most falls occur due to environmental
disturbances which cause a loss of balance while walking (i.e., slips, trips). Overground perturbation training
(repeated exposure to unpredicted perturbations) improves both volitional/anticipatory and reactive balance
control and reduces real-life falls among older adults. However, overground perturbation training is not suitable
for routine clinical application due to its complex design, space, and technology requirements. An alternative
method for delivering perturbation training is commercial treadmill systems, which not only can enhance fall-
resisting skills but are more feasible for community-translation. However, the equipment is costly and the
translational effectiveness of treadmill perturbation training for reducing falls in community ambulatory older
adults is lesser than overground training, probably as it mainly only entrains reactive balance control. Falls
may also occur due to deficits in volitional balance control which affect gait stability during daily living. Training
paradigms focused on improving volitional balance control have primarily comprised of conventional balance
exercises delivered as a part of physical rehabilitation; however, conventional balance exercises generally do
not translate to improvements in reactive balance control when exposed to an unpredicted external perturbation
and have limited effects on reducing real-life falls. A fall prevention intervention that targets both volitional
and reactive balance domains could more effectively reduce falls than existing paradigms which only train a
single domain (e.g., treadmill perturbation training: reactive-dominant, or conventional balance: volitional-
dominant). We have developed a novel task-specific balance program that includes both functional tasks and
predictable perturbations specific to slips and trips and requires little set-up and equipment, making it a cost-
effective, feasible and accessible fall prevention intervention. We will compare the effects of 8 weeks (16
sessions) of task-specific balance training with established fall prevention paradigms including treadmill
perturbation training and conventional balance training. We will examine the immediate effects of task-specific
balance training on reactive balance (Aim 1) and volitional balance (Aim 2). Additionally, we will evaluate the
longer-term retention (18 months) of task-specific balance training and effects on real-life falls and falls efficacy
(Aim 3). In an exploratory aim, will also examine the neuromuscular adaptations induced through training using
simulation techniques (Aim 4). If successful, our novel intervention can be implemented as a feasible, safe, and
effective fall-prevention intervention and has large potential for direct dissemination to clinical settings."
10986728,"There is a significant gap in knowledge concerning the importance of protein kinases (PKs) in drug resistance
mechanisms of the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata. Our long-term goal is to identify key kinases in drug
resistance and exploit them for novel Candida drug development. Our overall objectives in the present
application are to (i) construct a C. glabrata PK deletion mutant library, (ii) systemically screen mutants in the
library for their roles in antifungal drug resistance, (iii) analyze their regulation networks, and (iv) examine their
functions in C. glabrata drug resistance isolates. Cna1, the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase calcineurin, is
essential in C. glabrata echinocandin drug tolerance. Through direct dephosphorylation, Cna1 activates the
transcription factor Crz1 which subsequently induces the expression of Fks2 (the target of echinocandins). In
addition, our preliminary data have indicated that loss of CNA1 also enhances C. glabrata susceptibility to
triazoles (a different class of antifungal drug). This works through a reduction in expression and function of
Pdr1, the key transcription factor in C. glabrata triazole drug resistance. Further analysis indicate that Pdr1
can, in fact, be phosphorylated and its phosphorylation level increases with triazole treatment. Together, these
findings indicate that protein phosphorylation is important in C. glabrata mechanisms of resistance against both
echinocandin and triazole drugs, and PKs present as potential therapeutic targets for enhancing the efficacy of
these two antifungal agents against this inherently resistant species. In Aim 1, we will construct and validate a
genome-wide barcoded set of C. glabrata PK deletion mutants using a transient CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. In Aim
2, we will examine the characteristics of PK deletion mutants in C. glabrata antifungal drug resistance. PK
candidates that have important roles in drug resistance will be identified by competitive fitness and minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. With transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq), we will also explore the
genomic networks of these PKs. Finally, their roles in drug resistance will also be tested among C. glabrata
drug resistance isolates. The proposed studies are innovative as they uniquely focus on the roles of C.
glabrata PKs in antifungal drug resistance. Furthermore, our approach is innovative as we will for the first time
generate a barcoded C. glabrata PK deletion library in a clinical isolate of the fungal pathogen C. glabrata. This
library will be a significant contribution to the fungal research community, since it is suitable for both in vitro and
in vivo future in-depth analyses of PK functions in C. glabrata biology."
10986735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The formation of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) is an important phenomenon in biology, creating transient
compartments that can accelerate biochemical reactions or sequester molecules during times of stress.
Aberrations in BMC formation are implicated in a growing number of diseases. Thus, molecular tools that enable
researchers to monitor and manipulate BMCs are in great demand. Ideally, these tools could be deployed without
engineering the biomolecules that drive BMC formation in order to avoid artifacts introduced by altering the
sequence of the RNA or protein components. Our proposal is focused on developing RNA-targeting probes that
can be used to (a) fluorescently label RNAs suspected of participating in BMCs and (b) disrupt specific RNAs
from entering BMCs. The molecular probes we will use for these experiments are based on peptide nucleic acid
(PNA), a synthetic version of DNA in which the natural sugar-phosphodiester backbone is replaced by an
extended peptide. Hybridization of the PNA to its RNA target will be used to introduce a fluorescent dye for
visualization in microscopy. Moreover, PNA hybridization should prevent that region of the RNA from either
binding to a protein or interacting with other RNAs, blocking its incorporation into a BMC. The advantage of this
approach is that the RNA target need not be modified in any way, i.e. we will target endogenous RNAs.
Additionally, the PNA can be introduced in a reversible manner, meaning it can be removed from the RNA at
any time, releasing the RNA to participate in BMC formation when the researcher deems it appropriate.
Our model system will be the C9orf72 gene bearing expanded repeats having the sequence G4C2/C4G2. The
resulting RNAs, both of which are present due to bidirectional transcription, have been implicated in numerous
toxic gain-of-function phenomena that are central to the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). PNAs that can block the entry of these RNAs into BMCs can help assign roles
to specific molecular components of these complex, multicomponent condensates. Moreover, since numerous
neurodegenerative diseases feature expanded repeats of other sequences, the tools we develop in this project
can be readily adapted to other targets and diseases, greatly enhancing the potential impact of our proposed
research. Finally, while antisense approaches targeting the C9orf72 RNA have not yet led to viable therapies, it
is possible that the high affinity of PNA and a focus on targeting both of the expanded repeat transcripts will offer
better outcomes."
10986513,"Goal: This R34 study will pilot the Family Navigator Plus (FN+) program for foster parents to
increase access to mental health (MH) services for children in foster care aged 6-17.
Background: Youth in care experience disparities in mental health symptoms and access to
treatment. Compared to the general child population, children in foster care are 4-5 times more
likely to attempt suicide, and about 3 times more likely to have experienced trauma or have a
diagnosed depressive or anxiety disorder. About half of children in foster care exhibit clinically
significant MH needs, but less than a quarter of those children receive MH services. Those who
do – experience delays in seeking treatment. Significance: This project will pilot the FN+
program to promote treatment engagement by building foster parent capacity to 1) recognize
their child’s specific MH needs and address any preliminary barriers to treatment; 2) work with
the child’s caseworker to engage the child in mental health services; 3) manage the child’s
difficult behaviors; 4) remove remaining barriers to treatment access and use digital mental
health tools during long waits for treatment, and 5) support treatment goals at home.
Innovation: The proposed project is innovative in five ways. First, we plan to conduct the first
pilot of a family navigator program in one of the highest-risk populations for developing
psychiatric disorders: children in foster care aged 6 – 17 years. Second, we will pilot the use of
a trained Community Health Worker in the family navigator role as a sustainable and cost-
effective method to promote early MH treatment access. Third, we will provide rapid feedback
regarding MH assessment results to promote foster parent understanding of child functioning
and early treatment engagement. Fourth, we will use telehealth to facilitate family navigator
access in areas with less access to support services. Fifth, we will help parents to find digital
mental health tools to use during long waits for treatment. Design: Human-centered design and
an open trial will inform a subsequent small randomized controlled clinical pilot to test the
feasibility of the study protocol in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Population: Foster parents of youth in care aged 6 to 17-years. Outcomes: All aspects of the
study protocol (e.g., condition allocation, treatment and control condition procedures, data
collection, etc.) will be operationalized in preparation for the subsequent RCT. The primary
outcome is increased foster parent activation in the foster child’s mental health care. Secondary
outcomes include reduced barriers to treatment access and perceived change in child behavior."
10988063,"ABSTRACT
Transcription coupled-nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) plays a critical role in the maintenance of genome
stability by removing DNA lesions that would otherwise block RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. The
importance of TC-NER to human health is highlighted in Cockayne syndrome (CS), in which an inherited
genetic defect in a TC-NER factor (CSA or CSB) results in a severe neurodegeneration, rapid aging, and UV
sensitivity syndrome. Recently, a new TC-NER factor known as ELOF1 in humans and Elf1 in yeast has been
identified. ELOF1/Elf1 are required for efficient TC-NER in both yeast and human cells. In human cells, ELOF1
functions to recruit the key TC-NER factor UVSSA, which is required for TFIIH recruitment, by promoting RNA
polymerase II ubiquitination. However, yeast and many other species lack UVSSA, so the function of Elf1 in
promoting TC-NER in these species is unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that a unique C-terminal domain
(CTD) present in Elf1 plays a critical role in TC-NER by recruiting TFIIH. Our preliminary data also suggest the
hypothesis that the Pol II elongation factors Spt4/Spt5 (Spt4/5), which normally function to repress TC-NER, do
so by inhibiting the Elf1 CTD. We hypothesize that eviction of Spt4/5 from the Pol II elongation complex (EC)
by the CSB homolog Rad26 initiates repair by releasing the Elf1 CTD so it can recruit TFIIH. In Aim I, we will
use a combination of yeast genetics, genome-wide mapping of DNA damage and repair, and in vitro
biochemistry to test this hypothesis. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-sequencing (CPD-seq) method will be used
to investigate the interplay of the Elf1 CTD and Spt4/5 in genome-wide repair of UV damage in yeast and
characterize key functional residues in the CTD. We will also use in vitro protein interaction studies to
determine the key CTD residues in Elf1 that are required to bind and recruit TFIIH, and test whether this
interaction is inhibited by Spt4/5. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that Drosophila homologs of Elf1 are
responsible for TC-NER activity in this species, despite the absence of Drosophila homologs of CSA, CSB, or
UVSSA. In Aim II, we will investigate the role of phosphorylation of the Elf1 CTD in regulating its activity in
TFIIH recruitment and TC-NER. Previous studies and our preliminary data indicate that the Elf1 CTD is
phosphorylated at multiple residues, in many cases by casein kinase II (CKII). In this aim, we will
systematically mutate Elf1 phosphorylation sites and determine their impact on TC-NER. In parallel, we will
screen for new UV-induced phosphorylation sites in the Elf1 CTD. We will also determine whether CKII
phosphorylation of the Elf1 CTD in vitro regulates its binding to TFIIH and/or Spt4/5 and determine the
potential role of CKII in TC-NER. These studies should elucidate a new molecular mechanism by which
CSB/Rad26-dependent modulation of the Pol II EC regulates TFIIH recruitment and TC-NER."
10987961,"The desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) remains one of the most lethal adolescent/young adult
(AYA) sarcomas. The EWSR1-WT1 gene fusion is the primary and defining genetic driver alteration in this
sarcoma but a better understanding of EWSR1-WT1 oncogenic mechanisms is needed to identify novel,
rational therapeutic strategies that will be more effective. We propose to address these knowledge gaps
by establishing the first genetically engineered mouse model of DSRCT and to define its pathobiology
more fully by harnessing two recent novel observations in DSRCT, namely induction of neotranscripts
and recurrent ARID1A loss as a frequent additional genetic alteration in these cancers.
Aim 1: Developing a mouse model of DSCRT by germline and somatic genome editing. We will use the in
vivo somatic chromosomal engineering method pioneered by our laboratory (A.V.) to induce the
EWSR1-WT1 translocation in mice, based on co-expression of Cas9 and two gRNAs targeting the desired
translocation breakpoints. As p53 is mutated in approximately 10% of DSRCT cases, we will induce the
translocation concomitantly with p53 deletion in a cohort of mice to enhance tumor development.
Prompted by the recent finding that ARID1A mutations are commonly observed in DSRCT patients (see
Aim 3), we will also test the consequences of Arid1a loss on DSRCT initiation and progression in vivo.
Aim 2. Defining the landscape of EWSR1-WT1-associated neotranscripts in DSRCT. We (J.W., O.D.) have
recently reported that, in addition to dysregulating the expression of many target genes, oncogenic
fusions such as EWSR1-WT1 also drive the expression of completely novel sequences which we have
termed neotranscripts (J.W., O.D.). These are unannotated multi-exonic, polyadenylated RNAs not
expressed in any healthy tissue but directly induced by the altered localization patterns and co-factor
associations of the oncogenic fusion protein. A subset of neotranscripts are actively translated into
protein products, representing potential neoantigens. We will build upon our initial discovery of these
sequences and use them as a model system for dissecting EWSR1-WT1 mediated gene regulation as well
as determining what role these neotranscripts or their encoded proteins play in tumor biology.
Aim 3. Determining the role of recurrent ARID1A loss in DSRCT. While DSRCT displays one of the lowest
somatic mutation rates of any human solid cancer, intriguingly, inactivation of ARID1A, a subunit of the
canonical BAF complex, is the most common secondary mutation in DSRCT (about 6-12% of cases), being
more common than even TP53 alterations (M.L.). We propose to use isogenic models of ARID1A loss in
DSRCT cell lines to define the phenotypic and epigenetic effects of this recurrent secondary alteration in
DSCRT and use chemical and functional genomic screens to identify novel vulnerabilities associated with
ARID1A loss which may also yield more general insights into DSRCT pathobiology."

Transgender youth face a high risk for serious mental health problems (e.g., suicidality, depression, anxiety)
relative to cisgender youth due to their disproportionate exposure to transphobic discrimination and trauma,
and significant barriers to mental health care. mHealth interventions have been developed to address the
needs of transgender youth and their caregivers, but are underutilized. Lay health worker (LHWs) are
individuals who use their lived-experience, language and/or culture to support patients and/or families in
mental health service access and engagement. In response to PAR-22-109 and NIMH Strategic Objective 4:
Strengthen the Public Health Impact of NIMH-Supported Research, we seek to increase mental health care
access for transgender youth by enhancing the dissemination of evidence-based mHealth interventions
through the design of a gender-affirming training intervention for LHWs, with cultural tailoring for transgender
youth of Color and their caregivers. Specifically, we will use human centered design (HCD) to adapt a gender-
affirming mental health provider training intervention (developed by MPI Price K23MH124670) based on data
from MPI Barnett (R01MH117123-02S1) on the needs of transgender youth of Color and their parents
receiving LHW services. The proposed R21 study involves working with community partners (i.e., transgender
youth, their parents, and LHWs) to (Aim 1) co-design a mechanism-driven gender-affirming training
intervention for LHWs, then (Aim 2) build the gender-affirming LHW training intervention via usability testing.
This study will result in an acceptable and refined training intervention ready for testing in a large, multisite R01
study."
10987581,"Project Summary
 ATP1A3-related disorders are a group of disorders caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene that encodes
the α3 catalytic subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase transmembrane ion pump. Three classic phenotypes are known,
which are alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP), and cerebellar
ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). These conditions all carry
significant neurological morbidity and there is no effective treatment. They are rare disorders but the prevalence
of AHC may be as high as 1/100,000. Development of novel therapies is urgently needed.
 In order to achieve disease-modifying treatment in this condition, we need to: 1) fully understand the
genotype-phenotype correlation and natural history of the disease, 2) have a patient population that is ready for
clinical trial, and 3) have a novel treatment modality. In this project, we will achieve these goals by studying
ATP1A3-related disorders in Brazil. Taking advantage of a large clinical whole-exome database in Brazil, we aim
to build a first large cohort of patients with ATP1A3-related disorders in Latin America. We will analyze genotype-
phenotype correlation and collect biospecimens from patients for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation
and biomarker identification, and two-year natural history study will prepare the population for future clinical trials.
At the same time, we will develop allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs) against pathogenic ATP1A3 mutations
or benign single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to pathogenic ATP1A3 mutations to knockdown
mutant ATP1A3 mRNA. iPSCs from Brazilian patients will be used as a platform for ASO development. All
aspects of this project will be done in close collaboration between the Brazilian and US researchers.
 This proposed project holds great significance because: 1) ATP1A3-related disorders are a condition with
significant morbidity and mortality without effective treatment, 2) this first systematic clinical study of the condition
in Brazil will lead to new insights into natural history and genotype-phenotype correlation of the disease, 3) the
study will prepare the Brazilian patients for future clinical trials, 4) novel ASO treatment will be applicable not
only to patients in Brazil but also worldwide, and 5) the study will help build research capacity for precision
medicine in Brazil. Further, this proposed project is highly innovative because: 1) the unique, little studied patient
population in Brazil fills the existing geographical gap in the study of this condition, 2) subject identification
through a clinical exome database will allow enrollment of individuals with atypical and novel phenotypes and
informs the pathogenesis, 3) this study develops neurons differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs as an in vitro
model and uses them as a platform for therapeutic development, which has not yet been commonly done in
ATP1A3-related disorders, 4) allele-specific ASOs represent a novel therapeutic approach for this condition,
and 5) we will develop ASOs targeting pathogenic mutations as well as benign polymorphisms linked to
pathogenic mutations, expanding the drug’s target population."
10987661,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal is to establish a state-of-the-art vivarium, which will be dedicated exclusively to the UTRGV Laboratory
Opossum (Monodelphis domestica) Research Resource, and which will provide expanded opportunities for
biomedical research with this unique laboratory animal to investigators and students at UTRGV and other
institutions. This resource is the only large research colony of any marsupial species, and it contains the only
genetic stocks and inbred strains that have been developed for any marsupial species. The resource is widely
shared with investigators from other institutions, and it serves as the only readily accessible source of research
animals, breeding nuclei, and biological materials from this species, and of opportunities for investigators from
other institutions to conduct hands-on (or remote) research with this species without establishing their own
colonies. State funds were secured for construction of the building that will contain the new vivarium, and the
building will be ready for occupancy early in 2024. Use of the funds was restricted to the building and fixed
equipment; the funds could not be used for caging. To fill the gap in funding, the single specific aim of this
proposal is to purchase and install ten racks of a state-of-the-art IVC system. Sixteen racks currently in
use are available to be moved to the new vivarium. The complete caging system will include 13 Optimice racks
(1,300 cages) for individually housed opossums and 13 Optirat racks (546 cages) for mated pairs, mothers with
litters, and groups of littermates. Six racks of each type will be installed in each of two breeding/holding rooms;
and one rack of each type will be installed in a smaller room for research with infectious agents or for quarantine
purposes. The breeding/holding rooms will house the 20 genetic stocks and inbred strains that comprise the
breeding colony, as well as animals used in research that does not involve infectious agents. The current
opossum resource has a steady state of 1,200 animals, which are housed in an overcrowded vivarium with many
deficiencies. The new vivarium and caging system will enable the steady state of the colony to increase to 1,726
animals, which will be maintained under optimal conditions for animal welfare and for financial and operational
efficiency. That number of animals will be sufficient in the intermediate-term future for maintaining the 20
breeding groups and providing sufficient animals and research capacity to meet the national need. The IVCs will
provide maximal protection from the transmission of infectious diseases, high air quality for the animals, and
minimal exposure of staff to allergens that emanate from the animals. Moreover, the selected caging system is
the ultimate in green technology design; it depends on filtered room exhaust air being pulled through the cages
and out of the building by the HVAC system, rather than on motors and blowers. The overarching outcome
will be to establish an efficient, high-quality, high-capacity laboratory opossum research resource that
is capable of meeting current demand for laboratory opossums for biomedical research, and of fulfilling
the increasing institutional and national need for this species well into the future."

The enclosed application seeks to enhance the animal housing facilities at the University of Illinois Chicago
(UIC). UIC's animal care and use program consists of eight centrally managed animal facilities totaling
approximately 135,000 sq. ft. of animal housing and support space. The facilities support the research efforts of
approximately 300 investigators and covers housing and husbandry of approximately 40,000 animals. The
program is supported by a staff of ACLAM board certified veterinarians, post-doctoral fellows in laboratory animal
medicine, certified veterinary technicians, and a strong animal care staff. Towards our efforts to modernize
university research facilities, we are seeking to add environmental monitoring to the Biological Resources
Laboratory (the institution's centralized animal facility) as well as 7 other centrally managed animal facilities at
UIC. Specifically, we will purchase and install a Rees Scientific environmental monitoring system in the UIC
animal facilities. The requested wired and wireless monitoring will provide temperature, humidity, and light
monitoring. Real-time 24/7 monitoring of animal room temperatures requires a robust environmental monitoring
system capable of not only identifying when temperatures fall out of an acceptable range but also capable of
notifying multiple response team members through a variety of communication methods, such as phone, text or
email. Once in place and operational the Rees Scientific environmental monitoring system will monitor in real-
time 24/7 common extrinsic factors known to affect animal research including temperature, humidity, and light. In
addition, the system will track pressure differentials in select bio and chemical hazard rooms. In all cases the
system will notify animal care, research and facilities management staff when parameters fall outside the
designated range for an animal species, research model and/or functional room use. In summary, this project
will address a fundamental need in improved animal husbandry, minimize variables and facilitate state of the art
biomedical research."
10987749,"Abstract
Walking recovery is a top rehabilitation goal for many individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (ISCI).
Accordingly, there are extensive resources invested into understanding ISCI-induced walking impairments and
developing interventions to advance recovery. While these efforts target lower extremity control, functional
walking is a full-body activity requiring rhythmic, coordinated movements of the limbs and trunk. After ISCI,
individuals often demonstrate trunk control deficits: aberrant trunk movements during stepping, impaired posture,
and consequently, reliance on assistive devices and ongoing walking impairment. Despite the importance of the
trunk in walking control, it is rarely an intervention target and clinical assessments of walking do not consider
trunk control. Instead, trunk control is assessed in sitting or static standing, which provides limited insight into
control during walking. Understanding of trunk control is critical to address the severe and persistent impairments
that limit walking function. Our long-term objective is to quantify trunk control during walking to inform critical
next steps in clinical assessment and future walking research. This initial study will quantify coordination of trunk
movements and underlying muscle activation. We will address following aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis
that individuals with ISCI demonstrate impaired coordination of trunk movements during walking. We
predict individuals with ISCI will demonstrate reduced counter-rotational trunk movement across the gait cycle.
The primary outcome will be the phase relationship between movements of the thorax and lower extremities,
quantified by continuous relative Fourier phase, an established approach to quantify phase relationships during
cyclic activities. Additionally, trunk kinematics (i.e., range of motion, accelerations) in all planes will be quantified
and differences between those with ISCI and controls will be calculated. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that
individuals with ISCI demonstrate impaired intermuscular coordination of trunk and lower extremity
muscles during walking. We predict that individuals with ISCI will demonstrate a reduced number of co-active
muscle patterns to achieve the biomechanical sub-tasks of walking (i.e., limb loading, swing initiation). The
primary outcome will be the number of motor modules (i.e., groups of consistently co-activated muscles) required
to account for activation of 32 trunk and lower extremity muscles during walking. Additionally, timing of module
activation and relative muscle contributions will be quantified. Achievement of these aims will address a critical
gap in understanding walking control after ISCI. This 2-year study will provide initial evidence to develop larger,
more definitive investigations of trunk control during walking, a critical step for advancement of research and
care for people with ISCI."
10979912,"Pain-sensing sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and dorsal horn (DH) can become sensitized
(hyperexcitable) in response to surgically induced peripheral tissue injury. Because of insufficient knowledge
about the mechanisms for this sensitization, current treatment for postoperative pain has been limited to
somewhat non-specific systemic drugs (opioids) having significant side effects or potential for abuse. The
important role of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in pain processing has been recognized for a while
since calcium (Ca2+) is the major trigger for the release of synaptic vesicles from neuronal presynaptic terminals
in response to noxious stimulation. An increase of intracellular Ca2+ in pain sensing neurons (nociceptors) can
also influence the excitability of these cells. We established that CaV3.2 (T-type) calcium-channels make a
previously unrecognized contribution to sensitization of pain responses by enhancing excitability of peripheral
nociceptors. We also showed that the blockade of CaV3.2 currents in nociceptive DRG neurons by 5-reduced
neuroactive steroids (NASs) underlies their potent peripheral anti-nociceptive effects in a clinically relevant
rodent model of perioperative pain model of plantar skin incision. In addition, we have shown that NASs that
inhibit CaV3.2 channels are effective in alleviating mechanical hyperalgesia post-surgery when administered
preemptively whereas morphine provides dose-dependent pain relief only when administered once the pain had
developed. However, limited aqueous solubility and potent hypnotic/sedative effects linked to their direct or
indirect (via metabolic pathways) effect on GABAA receptors may hinder future development of NASs for novel
pain therapies. Hence, we will follow up on our exciting findings that inhibition of neuronal CaV3.2 in pain
pathways underlies effective post-operative analgesia with novel analogues of NASs that have more favorable
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, as well as better solubility. The Specific Aims are: Aim #1:
To develop NAS CaV3.2 inhibitor analogues with diminished potential for conversion to GABAA positive allosteric
modulators and test hypothesis that their analgesia is mediated via inhibition of CaV3.2 channels. Aim #2: To
study analgesic potency of novel analogues of NASs and their interactions with morphine using a rodent model
of postoperative incisional pain and chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of sciatic nerve. Aim #3: To define the role
of novel NASs in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability of nociceptive dorsal horn (DH)
neurons using optogenetics. The proposed work is innovative and medically significant because we anticipate
that our studies will identify novel therapies for perioperative pain that may greatly decrease the need for
narcotics and potential for drug abuse."
10985792,"Summary/Abstract: Initial cocaine abstinence is associated with severe sleep disturbances. Poor sleep is one
of the strongest predictors of return to use (relapse), suggesting potential overlap in brain arousal and reward
networks. Separate literatures link orexin (hypocretin) neurons in lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the regulation of
wake and drug motivation, yet how these neurons might commonly contribute to sleep disturbances and
subsequent drug use in CUD is not well understood. In rats, the intermittent access (IntA) schedule of cocaine
self-administration increases cocaine demand, a behavioral economics measure of drug motivation. These
motivational changes are persistent and are further enhanced following protracted abstinence. We showed that
cocaine IntA is associated with an increase in the number and activity of orexin producing neurons, and that
these increases are causally linked to cocaine demand. Our preliminary studies indicate that cocaine IntA rats
also exhibit sleep dysregulation during initial abstinence, characterized by excessive wakefulness and a
corresponding reduction in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. In Aim 1, we test if these sleep disturbances
persist throughout protracted (28d) abstinence following cocaine IntA, and how they are related to population
activity of orexin neurons throughout the inactive period. Using a chemogenetic approach, we predict that
normalizing orexin neuronal activity during the inactive period will improve sleep outcomes and reduce cocaine
demand following protracted abstinence. In Aim 2, we test if orexin projections to ventral tegmental area (VTA)
are involved in mediating excessive wakefulness during cocaine abstinence. This is based on our preliminary
data showing that waking is associated with increased orexin binding in VTA, as determined by the novel
OxLight1 sensor. We predict OxLight1 signal in VTA will be enhanced in IntA rats during early and protracted
abstinence, and that chemogenetic inhibition of VTA-projecting orexin neurons will normalize both sleep and
cocaine demand outcomes at both timepoints. We will also determine how IntA changes levels of orexin 1 (Ox1R)
vs orexin 2 (Ox2R) receptors in VTA and their functional role in mediating arousal and cocaine demand during
abstinence. Finally, in Aim 3, we test the potential utility of repurposing the FDA approved dual Ox1R/Ox2R
antagonist suvorexant for use in CUD. We predict that daily dosing with suvorexant, administered immediately
prior to the inactive period, will normalize sleep and reduce drug motivation in IntA rats. Based on data indicating
that suvorexant can persistently reduce orexin levels, we also predict that chronic suvorexant will normalize
orexin cell numbers and their input to VTA, and thus reduce drug demand beyond the treatment period. Together,
these studies combine several cutting-edge approaches to determine how orexin neurons, and their inputs to
VTA, might serve as a neurobiological link between sleep disturbances and drug motivation during abstinence.
This project is therefore an important step forward in the development of an orexin-based treatment for CUD."
10980097,"SUMMARY: The proper execution of transcriptional programs in retinal progenitor cells is
extremely critical for retinal formation as dysregulation of this process leads to severely
compromised retinogenesis and the development of ocular disorders, including anophthalmia or
microphthalmia. The wiring and rewiring of chromatin landscape constitutes an essential
mechanism to precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression during retinal
differentiation, yet our understanding to this process remains inadequate. Our goal is to utilize
state-of-the-art genomic technologies to provide a deep understanding to the genetic and
epigenetic circuits that underlie retinal transcription programs and how perturbations in the retinal
core regulatory networks lead to congenital syndromes. In the first aim of this proposal, we will
use mouse models to dissect the molecular, cellular, and genomic effects of genetic mutations on
retinal development. In aim 2, we will elucidate how the chromatin landscape is wired by
transcription factors in retinal progenitor cells. In aim 3, we will explore how coordination among
components of the core regulatory network drive retinogenesis epigenetically and
transcriptionally. When completed, the results of this proposal will bridge a gap in our
understanding to the chromatin-based regulatory mechanism underlying retinal genesis, a
necessary knowledge to enhance strategies to diagnose, treat or prevent the devastating

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) are aggressive, high-grade

cancer is the most common solid tumor and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among men in
the US. More than 20% of males with advanced prostate cancer eventually develop the highly aggressive NEPC
form. Both SCLC and NEPC are characterized by similar genetic (RB1 and TP53 loss) and phenotypic features,
as well as substantial intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which is implicated in therapeutic resistance. Identifying and
developing novel treatment targets and strategies for SCLC and NEPC is a critical unmet need. Delta-like ligand
3 (DLL3) is an antigen expressed on the cell surface of HG-NENs, whereas in normal tissues expression is
restricted to intracellular compartments, predominantly confined to the Golgi apparatus. DLL3 expression
correlates with neuroendocrine marker expression, RB1 loss, and aggressive clinical features. Based on the
over-expression of DLL3 in HG-NENs, we propose to utilize a DLL3-targeted radiolabeled monoclonal
antibody (mAb) for non-invasive diagnosis using PET imaging (89Zr-DFO-SC16.56 Ab) as well as for
image-based therapy (177Lu-DTPA-SC16.56). Our central hypothesis is that the overexpression of DLL3 on
HG-NEN lesions can be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To examine this hypothesis, our
phase I study will evaluate patients affected by HG-NENs with 89Zr-DFO-SC16.56 mAb PET/CT. Those who
exhibit sufficient target expression in at least 80% of the growing lesions will be treated with 177Lu-DTPA-
SC16.56. A key issue in such aggressive malignancies is the need to objectively determine treatment efficacy
by quantifying the radiation dose delivered to the target and assessing tumor radiosensitivity, which engenders
susceptibility to treatment. We will use molecular genomic tools to identify DLL3 transcripts and compare these
with known molecular signatures in blood and tissue that can define neuroendocrine and prostate cancer tumors
and correlate with response. The proposed study will investigate the safety and mechanistic basis of the efficacy
of radiotheranostics specifically targeting DLL3, a novel target for lethal malignancies for which currently limited
therapeutic tools exist. Our extensive experience in the development of DLL3-targeting PET agents and
validation in SCLC and NEPC models, along with our preliminary clinical PET data in SCLC and NEPC patients,
as well as our expertise in the ancillary use of molecular genomic tumor markers position us to successfully
complete the aims of this study."
10979940,"Repeated exposure to low doses of an allergen prevents adverse reactions upon subsequent exposure to the
same allergen. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been effectively practiced to treat a broad spectrum of
allergic diseases although examples of AIT in asthma are rare because of safety concerns. There is hence an
unmet need for useful animal models for airway tolerance to common aeroallergens for future translation.
Many studies suggest a critical time window in early life for achieving tolerance (Tol) to prevent development of
allergic disease. We have established a new model of allergen-tolerance (Tol) initiated by repeated exposure
of newborn mice to a low dose of the common household allergen, house dust mite (HDM). Using older mice,
we previously demonstrated PPARg-mediated production of H2O2, a reactive oxygen species (ROS), from the
mitochondria of lung CD11c+ cells in the context of inhaled Tol to the model allergen ovalbumin. Since ROS
can be generated from mitochondria as well as from non-mitochondrial sources, using newborn MCAT
transgenic mice that overexpress the enzyme catalase specifically in mitochondria to selectively deplete
mitochondrial H2O2 (mt H2O2), we have recently published that Tol to HDM is abolished in MCAT mice.
Functionally, we observed an impact of Tol in constraining numbers of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in
the lung and correspondingly scRNA-seq data show a significant decrease in expression of the gene Marcksl1
implicated in cellular apoptosis and cell migration in Tol MCAT mice. Analysis of recently published human
scRNA-seq data of endobronchial biopsies from asthmatic individuals subjected to segmental allergen
challenge has revealed suppression of Marcksl1 expression relative to baseline in human lung cDC1s upon
allergen challenge. At the other end of the spectrum, in studies of asthma, we and others have identified tissue
resident memory (TRM) cells in the lungs of humans and mice. In our ongoing work we have found that the
TRMs can be reactivated after a prolonged period of rest highlighting the importance of suppressing allergen
sensitization in early life to minimize emergence of TRMs. These observations lead us to hypothesize that
persistent exposure to low doses of allergens such as HDM programs lung cDCs to express Marcksl1 requiring
mt H2O2 that is important for Tol establishment. Early life allergen Tol suppresses the development of TRMs to
provide long-term protection from disease. We propose the following 3 aims, to address these hypotheses:
Aim 1. To dissect the impact of cDC-specific deletion of Marcksl1 on loss of HDM-induced Tol.
Aim 2. To determine ROS production in the presence or absence of Marcksl1 and the role of fatty acid
oxidation in cDC1s in Tol induction.
Aim 3. To analyze scRNA-seq data from mice and humans to understand DC subset-specific
programming during Tol vs inflammation."
10979947,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability without a cure that affects 20+ million US adults
and leads to large financial burdens. While the etiology of OA is unknown, it is thought to be related to altered
biochemical or biomechanical function of the joint. OA is slow to develop; the current treatment strategies for OA
are pain control using lifestyle or therapeutic interventions, until the patient requires a total knee replacement.
 The progressive loss of periarticular muscle mass and function reduces joint stability and health. Loss of
muscle mass and function is associated with aging, as is OA development and progression. While many OA
studies examine the bone, cartilage, synovium, and meniscus in the knee, the interplay between muscle function
and structure, and the initiation and progression of OA is unclear, despite recommendations of exercise as a
conservative treatment.
 In this study, we seek to build new imaging tools to sensitively measure the effects of muscle strength,
quality, and function on OA initiation and progression. This is an appealing area to study because disease-
modifying treatments such as exercise, physical therapy, and muscle-building drugs could both manage pain
and change disease progression. Toward this goal, we will build imaging tools to provide unparalleled insights
into exercise-induced microstructural changes in the muscle, subtle compositional changes in OA, and
biomechanically inspired biomarkers of how joint loads affect cartilage pressure.
 In Aim 1, we will build and validate a multi-vendor, highly accelerated, multi-parametric whole-bilateral-
limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol that will enable acquiring high-resolution quantitative imaging
of both knees, thighs, and calves in under 20 minutes of scan time. In Aim 2, we will compute fully automated
and novel biomechanics-inspired imaging biomarkers for the cartilage, bone, and muscle. These will include
cartilage pressure maps to assess spatial joint loading profile, as well as neural shape models to model the
complex shapes of bones and muscles. In Aim 3, we will assess the responsiveness of these imaging measures
in a two-year longitudinal study in patients with early OA undergoing a walking-based muscle strengthening
intervention. We will quantify the impact of exercise on muscle structure, tissues in the knee, pain relief and OA
progression. We hypothesize that our novel imaging biomarkers have stronger association than current
functional tests on pain relief and OA progression, and that our baseline imaging can predict subject-specific
pain relief.
 Overall, our novel tools will elucidate the mechanistic interplay between exercise and OA physiology,
towards developing precision muscle strengthening programs. These insights will help accelerate the elusive
quest towards developing disease-modifying strategies for OA."
10980808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of the proposed research is to optimize a readily scalable online behavioral intervention
that will prevent and reduce substance use (SU) among young adults. Rates of SU escalate rapidly after 12th
grade among both college students and nonstudent young adults, peaking between ages 20-25 years, yet
there are few preventive interventions for nonstudent young adults. Further, existing interventions for college
students and nonstudent young adults occur after rates of SU jump. Thus, there is a critical need for new
interventions that can prevent alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use among young adults, as well as address
the growing public health crisis of vaping. We will address this need by targeting high school seniors during a
critical transition period. Our intervention is grounded in a developmental, social influences perspective and
targets multiple social influences, which are the strongest predictors of SU among adolescents and young
adults. Building on the success of past norms-based interventions, we propose using normative education in a
novel way to change norms about bystander intervention strategies and norms about protective behavioral
strategies. Further, we will use Human Centered Design (HCD) and the Multiphase Optimization Strategy
(MOST) to iteratively engage key stakeholders in designing and strengthening the first ever optimized SU
intervention for high school seniors. In addition, we will also test individual (e.g., demographic; behavioral
characteristics) and contextual (e.g., social network and school characteristics) moderators of component
efficacy. To increase the generalizability of our findings, we will recruit a diverse population of high school
seniors, including those who do and do not plan to attend college, from over 50 high schools. Our Specific
Aims are to: (1) design an initial set of six theory-based online intervention components targeting social
influences linked to SU; (2) Evaluate the effect of each component on its targeted mediating variables using a
fully powered cluster-randomized optimization trial (Trial I); (3) Revise less effective components; and 4)
Evaluate the long-term efficacy of each revised component on its targeted mediators, SU, and secondary
behavioral outcomes using a second cluster-randomized optimization trial (Trial II). By using HCD to identify
and address stakeholders needs and by using MOST to evaluate individual intervention components, our
research will result in an efficient, optimized, readily scalable SU intervention that can be quickly disseminated
to high schools across the U.S. Our work will advance prevention science in three important ways: (1) We will
demonstrate that a brief universal online intervention for high school seniors can prevent SU among young
adults; (2) We will test several novel intervention strategies (i.e., using normative education to change norms
about other behaviors linked to SU; targeting anticipatory socialization), allowing future researchers to create
stronger, more efficient interventions; and (3) We will clarify how individual and contextual factors shape
intervention responsiveness, allowing us to identify who needs additional, or different, intervention strategies."
10980870,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The progression of bladder cancer from non-invasive to muscle invasive disease represents a critical
step that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, yet is poorly understood at the molecular level. However,
there is increasing evidence from us and others that progression is often associated with lineage plasticity, in
which the tumor phenotype undergoes a switch from a luminal to a basal subtype. Therefore, we will pursue a
comprehensive molecular analysis of luminal-basal lineage plasticity to elucidate the mechanistic basis for this
phenotypic switch. In preliminary studies, we have shown that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent
a model system for studying tumor plasticity, and that this plasticity is reversible. We have identified the KMT2D
histone methyltransferase and the KDM1A histone demethylase as having opposing activities in modulating
luminal-basal plasticity in organoids, consistent with their effects on histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Modulation
of luminal-basal plasticity affects outgrowth of tumor organoids in culture, consistent with a role in progression
to invasive disease, and can result in improved response to enfortumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate
approved for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer. Finally, using a cellular barcoding
approach for lineage tracing, we find that KMT2D mutations promote clonal expansion in organoids, suggesting
that clonal competition can drive the spread of phenotypic alterations due to plasticity during tumor progression.
 Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that luminal-basal plasticity and clonal competition in
human bladder cancer is driven by epigenomic reprogramming. To investigate this hypothesis, we will pursue
three complementary aims that integrate innovative in vitro, in vivo, molecular, and bioinformatic approaches as
follows: (1) Analysis of KMT2D function in modulating luminal-basal plasticity and drug response to establish the
precise roles of KMT2D in plasticity, invasiveness, and response to enfortumab vedotin; (2) Analysis of chromatin
landscapes in bladder cancer plasticity and progression to identify chromatin states associated with luminal-
basal phenotypic transitions; and (3) Investigation of KMT2D function in clonal evolution to examine mechanisms
by which KMT2D loss promotes clonal expansion in bladder cancer. Overall, our findings will have a strong
translational impact through the identification of epigenetic mechanisms that promote plasticity and tumor
progression in bladder cancer, and may lead to improved therapies for aggressive disease."
10981353,"Project Summary
Functional diversity of Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea is a fundamental feature of
mammalian auditory circuits thought to support the wide dynamic range of sound intensity coding. They were
classified recently into three molecularly distinct subtypes (Ia, Ib, Ic). Based on their synapse morphology and
location around the inner hair cell (IHC) circumference, these molecular classes correspond to SGN subgroups
with high, medium and low spontaneous firing rates (SR), respectively, defined previously. Selective loss of Ic
contribution to sound encoding is thought to underlie deterioration of hearing, particularly in noisy conditions,
after acoustic overexposure or due to old age. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms shaping SGN
identities is crucial for re-establishing the afferent response diversity needed for normal hearing. SGN
heterogeneity emerges through at least two major splits in their differentiation trajectory during embryogenesis.
The first one involves maintenance of the transcription factor Runx1 to Ib/Ic precursors and repression in SGNs
that become Ia, while Ib and Ic SGNs segregate further in a subsequent split. Final SGN subtype proportions
are then set postnatally in an activity-dependent manner; in mice lacking glutamatergic transmission from IHCs
to SGNs (Vglut3-/-), most develop as Ia. Runx1 is necessary embryonically and must also be maintained
postnatally to avoid a similar overproduction of Ia SGNs. Here we further characterize the regulatory logic of
SGN diversification in mice using single-cell genomic approaches. In Aim 1, we investigate mechanisms
underlying the first bifurcation of SGN subtype identities featuring downregulation of Runx1 in a subset of
neurons. In Aim 2, we study how heterogeneity in SGN spontaneous activity relates to their transcriptomic
identities and explore whether Ia SGNs can be converted back to Ib/Ic. In Aim 3, we map the gene regulatory
landscape supporting plasticity and stability of SGN identities by performing single-cell multiomic profiling of
SGNs. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of how SGN molecular identities emerge,
remain plastic, and ultimately become stabilized, thereby offering a powerful platform to explore the possibility
of interconversion of SGN identities. These goals are highly relevant for addressing hearing health-related
challenges such as synaptopathy, SGN degeneration, and genetic hearing loss."
10981356,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite the impressive clinical success of Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in cancer, therapy
resistance is common and only a small subset of patients mounts lasting antitumor responses, highlighting the
urgent need to identify strategies to overcome resistance and improve responsiveness to immunotherapy. Such
resistance is related with the fact that many tumors are immunologically ‘cold’. Activating innate immunity in
tumor cells is a potent means by which ‘cold’ tumors can be turned ‘hot’. One promising strategy to trigger an
innate immune response within tumors is by inducing the intracellular accumulation of endogenous ‘virus-mimetic’
nucleic acids in cancer cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that targeting the RNA/DNA helicase DHX9 is a
promising and unexplored strategy by which ‘viral mimicry’ can be triggered in tumors. DHX9 is an abundant
RNA/DNA helicase capable of unwinding both RNA and DNA duplexes, as well as more complex nucleic acid
structures. Its functions include regulation of DNA replication and transcription, RNA processing and transport,
and maintenance of genomic stability. Here, we provide data that ablating DHX9 induces the formation of double-
stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) derived from endogenous retroviral elements (EREs), provoking an antitumor immune
response in ‘cold’ tumors. Intriguingly, eliminating DHX9 also induced the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-
loops), leading not only to an antiviral immune response but also to DNA replication stress and DNA damage in
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) cells. In vivo, eliminating DHX9 causes a significant decrease in tumor growth
while inducing a more immunogenic Tumor Microenvironment (TME) in SCLC mouse models, dramatically
enhancing responsiveness to ICB. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the role of DHX9 on tumor
immunity and genomic instability and the identification of a novel viral mimicry-inducing strategy to enhance
antitumor immunity and boost cancer immunotherapy. Excitingly, we now present a first-in-class, orally
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of DHX9, which will allow us to evaluate the translational relevance of
targeting DHX9 in SCLC and in immunotherapy settings. Our overarching hypothesis is that targeting DHX9
induces dsRNA accumulation, causing antiviral signaling, while concurrently triggering the formation of R-loops,
compromising genome stability, and triggering these tumor-intrinsic events greatly improves ICB. In Aim 1, we
will determine which dsRNAs are substrates of DHX9 and whether they are immunogenic, as well as how DHX9
senses and suppresses R-loops. We will also delineate the mechanism by which DHX9 loss triggers cell death
in SCLCs. In Aim 2, we will dissect the impact of DHX9 loss or inhibition on the TME at a single cell resolution,
and we will evaluate whether DHX9 depletion or inhibition induces a robust antitumor immunity able to boost
cancer immunotherapy using murine immunocompetent SCLC models and a SCLC GEMM. The successful
completion of these Aims will outline an entirely new viral mimicry-inducing strategy with widespread application
in cancer treatment, as stand-alone anti-cancer therapy to improve responsiveness to immunotherapy."
10980842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA plays numerous roles in biology. In addition to its canonical role in the central dogma as an
intermediary between DNA genomes and protein products of translation, a myriad of roles have
been described for this molecule, including gene silencing (siRNA), regulation of translation
(bacterial riboswitches), and the translation machinery itself (rRNA). Despite the importance of
these roles in biology, tools for imaging RNA are not as robust as the suite of fluorescent proteins
that exist for readout of protein machinery. This project seeks to address this need by developing
new fluorescent aptamer tags for RNA visualization. This strategy has enjoyed considerable
success, particularly in bacterial systems, but deployment in complex systems (eukaryotic, whole-
organism) has been challenging. Recent work on RNA folding has shown that a noncanonical
RNA structure (a G Quadruplex) may impair the use of aptamers as tags in these systems. This
project seeks to select fluorescent aptamers that are not G-Quadruplexes. We will seek select
non-G-quadruplex-forming aptamers against a range of azo dyes (Aim 1) and endogenous
pigments (Aim 2) for robust live-cell imaging, and a long-range goal of whole-organism RNA
imaging. We will use these tags to characterize Lin28-mRNA interactions, which is not possible
with existing G-quadruplex-forming aptamers, because Lin28 is known to unfold G-quadruplexes
in RNA. We will also develop benchmarking tags for our selected aptamers by selecting non-G-
quadruplex-forming aptamers to known aptamer ligands, which we will use to compare our
selected aptamers."
10980903,"Mortality statistics in the United States show a steady increase in deaths due to prescription
opioids over the past two decades, accompanied by a steep increase in heroin-related deaths
from 2011 onward and deaths from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl from 2014 onward. An
unexpectedly steep rise in the drug-related overdose rate for middle aged to older adults (50-65)
in recent years has placed attention on the specific health risks for this population. Lethality data
are but the tip of the iceberg of a much larger problem of opioid misuse and opioid use
disorders. Therefore, these studies seek to explore how the middle age range of adulthood may
influence opioid reward and addiction. The proposed studies will first determine any age-related
differences in the involuntary effects of opioids on locomotion, nociception and
thermoregulation. Studies will also use well established rat models of intravenous self-
administration to model reward, initial acquisition and escalation of opioid drug seeking in
young-adult and middle-aged rats. Additional experimentation will determine how brain reward
may be modified across the lifespan and how these changes may produce liability for, or
resilience against, prescription opioid abuse. Together, the Aims will investigate how the middle-
aged adult developmental stage may influence in vivo sensitivity to oxycodone, heroin and
fentanyl, relative to younger adulthood, and ultimately will investigate if middle age conveys any
change in the propensity for self-administration of opioids."
10980699,"Flaviviruses, including dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses, pose significant threats as emerging diseases and potential bioterror agents. Despite the considerable impact of flavivirus infection on world-wide health, no antiviral therapies are available and existing flavivirus vaccines are of limited utility. Our long-term goal is to obtain detailed structural and biochemical information regarding the flavivirus replication process and to use this information for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. The flavivirus replication complex, consisting of virally-encoded non-structural proteins (NS), unidentified cellular proteins, and the viral RNA genome, is responsible for copying the viral genome. Viral replication begins with negative-strand synthesis from the positive-strand RNA genome, leading to dsRNA formation, which in turn is transcribed into positive- strand RNA. Because the positive-sense RNA genome is used for both viral translation and replication, flavivirus must be able to regulate whether the genome is used either as a transcript for viral protein synthesis or as a template for RNA synthesis. This decision tree depends on a reorganization of the genome from a linear to a circular form, which promotes RNA synthesis. Viral polymerase NS5 then recognizes an RNA promoter at the 5’-end of the circularized genome, called stem-loop A (SLA), and translocates to the 3’ terminus to initiate RNA synthesis. However, the mechanism by which NS5 selectively recognizes the circular genome for negative- strand RNA synthesis is not well understood. In particular, the viral genome has differently predicted 3’ terminal stem-loop (3’SL) structures in the linear and circular genome, yet how these differences relate to negative strand synthesis is not known. The goal of this project is thus to understand the molecular mechanism of negative- strand RNA synthesis. In aim 1, we will determine how the structural changes of 3’SL in the linear and circular forms of the viral genome modulate NS5 interaction and polymerase activity, and whether NS5 recognizes both 5’ SLA and 3’SL structures simultaneously. In aim 2, we will determine the structures of 3’SL in the linear and circular genomes using a tRNA-scaffold approach, and also characterize the NS5 initiation complex assembled on dengue virus mini-genome. The change from linear to circular genome is conserved in all flaviviruses. Thus, the combined structural, biochemical, and virological studies will help elucidate the mechanism for negative- strand RNA synthesis in flavivirus."

10995215,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is on track to become the second leading cause of cancer related
deaths in the United States. This dismal prognosis is in large part due to >80% of newly diagnosed cases being
advanced in stage. For the rare patients diagnosed early, stage I, the 5-year survival rate reaches over 80%.
Thus, for PDAC the mortality rates can be greatly impacted by the development of an earlier detection strategy.
Even though PDAC is a major health issue, there are still no effective screening tests approved for the general
population and only patients with family history and/or the presence of a pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in
relevant high-risk genes, referred to as high-risk individuals (HRIs), have published guidelines recommending
cancer surveillance. PDAC arises predominantly from microscopic Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasms (PanIN)
lesions categorized based on their morphological features as low-grade (LG), which are common and have a
very low probability of malignant transformation, or high-grade (HG), which are rare and are considered to be of
high risk for progression to invasive carcinoma, but the diverse routes of progression from LG to HG PanIN are
poorly understood. We hypothesize that the development of a comprehensive, molecular and cellular 3D atlas
that depicts the key events in the progression of PanIN to PDAC will be the first step in identifying much needed
early detection and interception strategies. Importantly, our pre-cancer atlas will focus on a common subset of
HRI patients in surveillance programs who carry PGVs in canonical DNA repair genes, BRCA1, BRCA2 or
PALB2 (referred to as gBRCA). This genetic subtype creates a genomic instability state that supports PDAC
development, yet the exact mechanisms are unclear. Through deep genetics and three-dimensional spatial multi-
omics mapping with computational modeling, we propose to create a 4D model of the molecular and cellular
trajectories that underly the evolution of gBRCA-driven LG to HG PanINs to malignant PDAC through three
integrated aims: 1) to design a gBRCA progression atlas; 2) to determine mechanisms underlying progression;
and 3) to forecast progression toward translational impact, supported by three functional units: i) Biospecimen
Unit: to collect, process and annotate biospecimens, ii) Characterization Unit: to perform molecular, cellular and
spatial characterization, and iii) Data Science Unit: to process, analyze, computationally model and visualize
data. We have assembled an exceptional team of experts (the BRCA Forecasting PDAC, BForePC team), with
complimentary, multi-disciplinary expertise in PDAC clinical pathology, computational biology and model
development, BRCA deficiency and DNA repair, cancer genetics, and tumor microenvironment, along with
cutting edge technology experts. We are uniting three universities, Oregon Health & Science University, Johns
Hopkins University, and Indiana University, all with strong ties to the PDAC research community, the HTAN, and
multiple NCI consortia. Together, we will leverage the atlas for translational detection and interception use cases
poised for clinical evaluation in HRIs and to inform future studies extending to all PDAC."

Throughout the central auditory pathway, the nervous system increasingly “colors” sensory representations
with non-sensory features, such as an animal’s arousal state. Fluctuations in arousal has been found to
influence sensory information processing and behavior. The Yerkes-Dodson law describes the relationship
between arousal and task performance as an inverted-U in that intermediate states of arousal coincide with
peak performance. While this has been shown in several auditory studies, the neural correlates of this
behavioral phenomenon are poorly understood. Correlations between pupil diameter, a well-established
biomarker of arousal state, and neural activity have been reported in the auditory system. Within the auditory
cortex (ACtx), arousal has been shown to modulate the response properties of layer (L) 2/3 cells. However, the
ACtx is composed of different subpopulations of cells that each differ with respect to their physiology, anatomy,
and projection patterns. Moreover, cells contained in deeper layers, such as L5, provide the primary means by
which the ACtx sends auditory information to major subcortical stations critical for decision-making. Layer 5
comprises two distinct projection cells types: intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) cells. The
distinct anatomy and connectivity profiles of IT and ET cells lead us to hypothesize that arousal states
differentially modulate their sensory tuning properties, which then influences behavior. Our preliminary data
suggests that L5 cells are uniquely modulated by arousal. Aim 1 will characterize the arousal-dependent
changes to L5 IT and ET cell response properties in mice passively listening to pure tones. We will
simultaneously use a combination of in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and pupillometry to track neural
activity and pupil diameters, respectively. Aim 2 will discern the optimal arousal state in an auditory
categorization task and will relate L5 IT and ET cell activity at this optimal state to an animal’s performance. As
in Aim 1, pupillometry and two-photon imaging in awake mice will be used. Through a cell-type specific
approach, this research proposal will unveil the intricate relationship between arousal, distinct L5 neural
activity, and auditory-guided behaviors."
10990834,"Abstract
Excessive oxidative stress has been shown to be a potent pathophysiological mediator in multiple disease states.
Cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerve activity is increased in chronic heart failure, in part, due to augmented
neural inflammation and oxidative stress. Importantly, several major antioxidant enzymes and molecules are
decreased in the cytosol and mitochondria of pre-sympathetic neurons in chronic heart failure. A major regulator
of these antioxidant molecules is the transcription factor, Nrf2. Previous studies from our laboratories have shown
a reduction in Nrf2 in heart failure. Genetic knock down of Nrf2 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of normal mice
results in significant sympatho-excitation and hypertension. On the other hand, overexpression of Nrf2 results in
sympatho-inhibition in mice with chronic heart failure along with a reduction in oxidative stress and an increase
in several antioxidant enzymes. In order to determine if this mechanism plays a role in cardiac arrhythmogenesis
in the post myocardial infarction (MI) chronic heart failure model we propose here to evaluate the role of Nrf2 in
the stellate ganglia, a source of major sympathetic outflow to the heart. Three specific aims are proposed.
Specific Aim 1: We will determine the time-course changes in neural inflammation-Oxidative stress-Nrf2
signaling in the SG post MI. We will evaluate message and protein for the key molecules involved in maintaining
redox homeostasis in the SG, namely the Nrf2/Keap1 system and its target antioxidant enzymes, including
NQO1, HO1, Catalase, SOD and glutathione peroxidase. We will also assess neural inflammation in the SG by
measuring macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Correlations will be made between levels of
Nrf2 and cardiac sympathetic tone across a wide range of cardiac function. Specific Aim 2: We will determine
if selective knockdown and overexpression of Nrf2 in the SG alters cardiac sympathetic tone in normal and CHF
animals by altering ganglionic neuronal excitability. Using Nrf2 and Keap1 floxed mice we will evaluate
antioxidant enzyme expression, redox homeostasis, inflammation and arrhythmia incidence. These molecular
alterations induced by Nrf2 will be evident in SG cell action potential generation. Specific Aim 3: We will
determine if pharmaceutic manipulation of Nrf2 signaling in the SG by local SG delivery of micelle conjugated
dynamic hydrogels with encapsulation of two Nrf2 activators (i.e., Curcumin and sulforaphane) reduces
arrhythmogenesis and improves cardiac function in the post-MI rats. We hypothesize that the redox status and
electrophysiological activity of SG neurons in CHF rats will be partially restored following treatment with Nrf2
activators. Furthermore, these effects will be abolished or attenuated in mice with stellate ganglia Nrf2 deficiency.
We believe that this proposed research will lay a solid scientific foundation for developing a new therapies for
the patients with CHF."

 IDHwt glioblastoma (GBM) patients still live an average of ~15-months, despite advances in multimodal
therapy. A central issue confounding treatment is the heterogeneous nature of this aggressive tumor.
Transcriptomics has defined three GBM molecular subtypes - proneural (PN), classical (CL), and mesenchymal
(MES).7 Individual tumors typically harbor mixtures of all three subtypes in spatially distinct subpopulations with
different mutation profiles, making mutation- or pathway-specific therapies less effective. While cell-intrinsic
mechanisms of therapeutic resistance have garnered considerable scientific attention, much less is known about
cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment that contribute to therapeutic recalcitrance. A hallmark
mutation in 60% of GBM is amplification and mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The most
common EGFR alteration, EGFRvIII, results from deletion within its extracellular domain, yielding a constitutively
active receptor that conveys tumor-enhancing and therapy-resisting functions.8 Genetic and pharmacological
data from our lab show that EGFRvIII activity, specifically in the context of PI3K pathway activation, results in
nuclear localization of the NF-kB subunit RelA (p65), its association with members of the BET (bromodomain
and extra terminal domain) family of acetylated lysine-binding proteins, and transcriptional activation of
inflammatory genes.6,9 The requirement of RelA acetylation at lysine 310 (acK310-RelA) for BET bromodomain
interactions10 and the central role of NF-kB in driving a PN/CL to MES phenotype transition (collectively MES
transition – MESt),6,11 immune evasion,3 and therapy resistance12 leads us to postulate that the acK310-
RelA:BET protein complex is a druggable regulatory switch mediating MESt and treatment resistance.
 The goal of this project is to dissect and target mechanisms whereby tumors undergo MESt and acquire
therapeutic resistance through the acK310-RelA:BET switch. We have identified a druggable node of specific
bromodomains, through precise drug targeting, that controls the pro-inflammatory activity of the acK310-
RelA:BET complex.6 The following lines of experimentation will be employed in the newly diagnosed and
recurrent GBM settings. SA1 will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to determine upstream effector
mechanisms mediating RelA K310 acetylation and associated MESt, including abundance of tumor-associated
microglia and macrophages (TAM), and resistance to standard-of-care (SOC) therapy. SA2 will functionally
analyze BET family members BRD2-4 through gene knockout, gene editing, inducible protein degradation,
selective bromodomain (BD1, BD2) drug targeting, and assessment of acK310-RelA:BET induced transcription
programs and associated epigenomic rewiring. SA3 will specifically focus on the recurrent GBM setting, where
we will investigate direct drug targeting of the acK310-RelA:BET interaction to mitigate resistance to salvage
radiation and promote phagocytotic recognition by TAM. These studies will be central to identifying a
therapeutically tractable node promoting MESt and nominate a specific drug for further development."

 Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an essential diagnostic tool in cardiology. There are over one
million TEEs performed annually in the United States. A major advantage of TEE over transthoracic echo
(TTE) is superior resolution of posterior structures such as the mitral valve and the left atrial appendage (LAA).
TEE also substantially reduces ultrasound scatter from the lungs, which provides better images than
transthoracic imaging, making TEE an essential imaging modality in critically ill patients. Examples of the
clinical usefulness of TEE include diagnosing and managing infectious endocarditis (infection of the valves of
the heart), diagnosing acute cardiovascular events in critically ill patients, trauma patients, and patients before
and after cardiovascular surgery.
 TEE requires the use of sedation (anesthesia). Sedation requires specialized procedural space and skilled
providers, which increases procedural cost, burdens the workflow, increases the risk to the patient, and overall
limits the availability of TEE. Sedation accounts for the majority of the harm associated with TEE including
cardiovascular (hypotension, arrythmia) and respiratory compromise. The serious risks of anesthesia are
amplified by the high prevalence of co-morbidities in patients undergoing TEE. Alternative TEE methods that
do not require anesthesia, will reduce cost, enhance workflow, expand availability, reduce risk, and in some
cases will provide more accurate information compared to conventional TEE in such cases as non-sedated
exercise mitral valve assessment, and assessment of cardiac causes of cryptogenic stroke.
 The nasal orifice is an alternative to the oral approach, and nasal-TEE can eliminate the need for sedation.
Hence, nasal-TEE represents a unique opportunity to reduce cost, improve workflow, expand availability, and
improve safety. However, prior attempts utilizing nasal-TEE systems have considerable gaps to making nasal-
TEE an effective tool over traditional TEE. Prior attempts at nasal-TEE resulted in poor image quality,
unacceptable rates of nasal bleeding, and thermal burns to the esophageal wall from overheated ultrasound
probes. Therefore, innovative strategies are needed to overcome previous limitations of nasal-TEE. We are
proposing to develop a novel, innovative nasal-TEE system to acquire high quality cardiac imaging without the
need for anesthesia.
 The overall objective of this project is to develop an innovative nasal-TEE prototype with the potential to
revolutionize cardiovascular diagnostic imaging. The proposed nasal-TEE platform will be faster, less
expensive, expand availability, safer, and in some cases provide more accurate information compared to
conventional TEE."

While the microbiota has emerged as an important aspect of mammalian health, the vast majority of
current studies have focused on the bacterial component of the microbiota, despite the presence of
fungi, archaea and viruses. The virome has recently just begun to become characterized and while
there are eukaryotic viruses present within a healthy individual, the overwhelming majority of the
viruses on the human body are bacteria infecting viruses called bacteriophages (phages). Changes
in these phage communities have been reported in animal and humans during a variety of diseases
including inflammatory bowel disease and obesity, however we known very little about these
populations during the healthy state. Our recent work has demonstrated that bacteriophages, despite
being unable to actively infect mammalian cells, are capable of inducing immune system
development. These data suggest that bacteriophages represent an unappreciated microbe that is
capable of shaping immune system responses. Recent studies on the bacterial component of the
microbiota, have revealed that identifying what bacteria the immune system reacts to, can provide
insight into specific bacteria that influence disease, novel biomarkers and unique antigens that can
influence natural immune system development. However, this has yet to be performed with the
virome. Antibodies, including IgA and IgG, and are highly abundant at mucosal surfaces and sera,
respectively and are known to have high reactivity to commensal bacteria. We present data within
this application that both sera and mucosal antibodies have high reactivity to commensal
bacteriophages in both humans and mice. Based on this, we propose to characterize and identify the
commensal viruses that are targeted by IgA and IgG. We will propose three distinct aims. Aim 1 will
catalog the mucosal IgA/IgG reactivity against commensal viruses from stool samples obtained from
healthy humans. To do this, we have optimized a strategy to purify and sort viral particles allowing
us to capture IgA bound DNA and RNA viral particles. As sera antibody reactivity can often reveal
unique commensal organisms of interest, Aim 2, will characterize the sera reactivity against the gut
resident viral communities using paired sera and stool samples from humans. Finally, to understand
how antibodies can influence these human associated viral communities, Aim 3 will utilize gnotobiotic
mice that lack adaptive immunity and IgA and colonized with healthy human microbiota to understand
how viral communities are controlled by mammalian immunity. These studies will be the first to
catalog how the human immune system reacts to commensal viruses of healthy human intestine and
will provide a rich resource of data that has the potential to identify novel viruses of interest and
establish paradigms how the immune system establishes homeostasis with the resident viral
community."

Representation of minority groups in biomedical research, including research on substance use is low; and
individuals who identify as members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs) pursue such careers at far
lower rates than expected considering the demographics of the U.S. This project will focus on cultivating the
interest of undergraduate students in substance use-related research to increase the pool of diverse applicants
pursuing substance use-related research careers. We have established a partnership between Duke University
(a private, R1 university) and North Carolina Central University (NCCU; a public HBCU). Our program, entitled
NCCU Duke – Substance Use Research & Education (ND-SURE) will provide educational, research training,
and intensive mentoring for undergraduates from both institutions. ND-SURE will: 1) Focus entirely on
undergraduates; 2) Pair laboratories and an academic course from Duke and NCCU to provide innovative
substance use-related academic and research opportunities to URM students from both institutions; 3) Provide
intensive mentoring, a seminar series, and a wide range of professional development opportunities (including
IDPs); and 4) track the progress of participants as they complete their undergraduate training and move
forward into graduate or professional education. A primary goal of the program will be for students from each
institution to study and train with students from the other, thereby leveraging the distinct strengths of each
university. Aim 1 will promote in-depth understanding of the biomedical, public health, social and cultural
impacts of substance use through didactic training in a semester-long course focused on substance use and its
various biological, clinical, and social impacts, and engage students with the Research Triangle substance use
research community. This Aim will also establish a rich professional network through which ND-SURE
participants will acquire specific skills and guidance toward careers related to substance use research. Aim 2
will provide an immersive summer substance use research experience in Duke and NCCU laboratories that
includes personalized research mentoring, and both group and individualized professional development
education. Aim 3 will provide continuing professional development and mentoring opportunities for
participants, and an empirical evaluation component to document participants' progress toward career goals
and follow their progress beyond their undergraduate experience. The program will continue to support
participants by providing monthly meetings with program mentors throughout the following academic year. In
addition, meetings and resources will be provided to support participants' specific research endeavors
including advice on poster construction, presentation/publication planning, graduate school/employment
applications, and evolving career development considerations. The program will also provide specific
preparatory advice and support for participants attending scientific conferences in the academic year following
the summer research experience."

 At the turn of the millennium, the cost of sequencing one megabase of DNA exceeded 10 million
dollars. Today, decoding that same megabase costs less than a penny. This dramatic reduction in the cost of
sequencing has catalyzed a genomics revolution and resulted in petabases (millions of billions of bases) of
DNA and RNA- sequences from human cells and tissues. We hypothesize that this transformational capacity of
next-generation sequencing will now catalyze our understanding of the human virome—both by illuminating the
set of DNA viruses in human tissues and by profiling the host (human) cells that are infected.
 Here, we outline new computational and experimental methods to realize the unique potential of
petabase-scale sequencing data in studying human DNA viruses. Our work will uncover foundational aspects
of the human virome, including tissue tropism and cellular reservoirs for all DNA viruses. Further, we present
complementary strategies through host genetics analyses and single-cell multi-omics to define and
characterize the molecular interactions of human cells associated with viral infections and latency.
 First, in Aim 1, we will develop methods to quantify latent viral features from petabases of unmapped
whole genome sequencing reads from hundreds of thousands of individuals. These new molecular variables
will reveal the degree of latent viral DNA in blood and will be paired with comprehensive host genotyping and
phenotyping. We will determine host genetics factors associated with high viral levels and nominate
phenotypes, including complex disease, that may be driven by long-term latent infection in individuals.
 In Aim 2, we will extend our petabase-scale resource (Serratus) to create a ‘Digital Human Virome’ by
uniformly processing billions of dollars of public sequencing data from human cells and tissues to identify and
quantify all DNA viruses. Our resource will aggregate meta-data to extract sex, cell/tissue of origin, disease
status, and geographic location to create a Digital Human Virome for DNA viruses, revealing tissue tropism
that can be mined for clinical associations, such as our recent discovery of HHV-6 reactivation in CAR T cells.
 Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a new high-throughput single-cell multi-omics technology termed
‘Latent-seq’ that will identify individual human cells that harbor latent viruses with paired high-quality cell state
measurements. We will first establish and benchmark the assay using a set of well-defined cell lines before
extending applications to primary human tissues in collaboration with the Human Virome Program Consortium.
 Together, these workflows will define human DNA virome in health and disease by leveraging this
unique moment in the capacity of genomics technologies. As every human gets infected by endemic eukaryotic
DNA viruses, but only some individuals ever show symptoms, our systematic approaches will uncover new
associations between molecular interactions and human phenotypes intertwined with the human virome."
10987830,"The development and function of individual neurons are defined by their unique transcriptomic properties, but
despite recent efforts cataloguing single neuron transcriptomes, there remains a gap in our understanding of
the causal mechanisms by which gene regulatory factors specify individual neuronal transcriptomes. In
particular, little is known about how factors regulating various layers of gene expression, e.g. transcription
factors (TFs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), coordinately control the transcriptomes of single neurons. This
proposal aims to fill the gap by leveraging unique properties of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to
mechanistically investigate coordinated transcriptomic regulation of specific model neurons in vivo. The well-described and invariant lineage of the C. elegans nervous system, combined with powerful genetic techniques,
will enable detailed dissection of TF-RBP control over neuronal development. Additional tools recently
developed and adapted in the lab, including combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9, single-neuron in vivo alternative
splicing reporters, and neuron-specific FACS sorting followed by RNA Seq, will reveal mechanisms and
consequences of coordinated regulation of single neurons in vivo. The objective of this proposal is to define
TF-RBP pairs that genetically interact and combinatorially shape neuron-specific transcriptomes. The
hypothesis is that cell-specific combinations of TFs and RBPs converge on specific target networks to define
neuronal transcriptomes. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary in vivo data in C. elegans showing that
(a) certain TFs and RBPs combinatorially define splicing choices including splicing of the conserved neuronal
kinase sad-1 in individual neurons such as the touch-sensing neurons, and (b) neuronal TFs and RBPs
genetically interact to affect neuronal function and behavior. The hypothesis will be further tested by the
experiments proposed in the following aims: 1) Determine molecular mechanisms by which the neuronal TFs
and RBPs we have identified coordinately control sad-1 alternative splicing in touch neurons, 2) Define
functional consequences of dysregulated touch neuron transcriptomes when these regulatory factors or their
target transcripts are lost, and 3) Systematically identify neuronal TFs and RBPs coordinately controlling
neuron fate and function in specific tractable neuronal cell types. The expected outcomes of the proposed work
are to determine mechanisms and functional consequences of coordinate TF-RBP control over single neuron
transcriptomes. The proposed approach is innovative as it departs from the status quo by examining causal
mechanisms and consequences of single-neuron transcriptomic regulation across multiple layers of gene
regulation in vivo. It is significant because it is expected to advance the field of single-neuron transcriptomics
into causal mechanisms, functional consequences, and coordinated regulation in single neurons in vivo.
Ultimately, these findings will inform our understanding of how nervous systems develop and are specified."

Many important cellular processes are regulated through the formation and dissolution of the biomolecular
condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS enriches specific factors in the biomolecular con-
densates while excluding others, thereby creating a unique environment that either promotes or restricts certain
biochemical reactions. To investigate how the dynamic process of LLPS and the reverse process that results in
the dissolution of biomolecular condensates, biosensors capable of survey the biophysical properties of conden-
sates as they form and dissolve within cells are highly desirable. The stability of a biomolecular condensate
depends on electrostatic forces as well as hydrophobic interactions between the molecules residing in the con-
densate. Currently there are no known biosensors for real-time monitoring of environmental hydrophobicity in
living cells, limiting our understanding of how hydrophobicity changes over the lifetime of biomolecular conden-
sates. Here we propose to develop a genetically encoded hydrophobicity biosensor, consisting of a pair of fluo-
rescent proteins that can undergo Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). This hydrophobicity sensor will
report FRET efficiency as the readout of hydrophobicity value. As proof of concept, we will create a recombinant
protein in which the fluorescent profiting pair is fused with paxillin, an important protein in neurite growth, migra-
tion of neuron and microglial cell, as well as endocytosis in cells of the neural system. We plan to first establish
a calibration curve by which hydrophobicity can be quantified. Then we plan to demonstrate that this hydropho-
bicity sensor can be used intracellularly to monitor the hydrophobicity changes in biomolecular condensates to
which paxillin partitions. If successful, our design principle can be readily applied to measure hydrophobicity of
condensates containing other molecules."

Puberty is a transformative developmental process resulting in sexual and reproductive maturity. Both the onset
of puberty and fertility in adult life depend on the activity of neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone-
1 (hereafter referred to as GnRH-1ns). Originating in the nasal placode during embryonic development, GnRH-
1ns migrate along axons to the hypothalamus, where they take up residence in the brain and regulate the release
of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland throughout life. Defective GnRH-1 neuronal development can cause
congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), and sex hormone deficiencies that can cause delays or the
absence of puberty, resulting in infertility. HH can manifest clinically as either (i) Kallmann syndrome (KS),
wherein HH is associated with different levels of olfactory deficits, or (ii) normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (nIHH), wherein HH occurs with a normal sense of smell.
The migration of GnRH-1ns proceeds along the axons of the terminal nerve and is known to depend on an
additional cell type, the olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). However, what cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlie the development of the olfactory ensheathing cells, and the terminal nerve of mammals is still largely
unknown. The long-term goal of our research program is to discover the molecular mechanisms leading to
Kallmann syndrome and normosmic forms of niHH. By screening a cohort of human patients, we recently
discovered that a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator Gli3 was associated
with KS. Moreover, our preliminary data show that Gli3 loss-of-function affects both OECs and terminal nerve
development in mice. Our central hypothesis states that Gli3 controls the development of the terminal nerve and
the development of the OECs in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, we postulate that and that the expression
of inductive factors in the developing olfactory system controls the formation of the OECs. Guided by our strong
preliminary data, we will here test our hypothesis through three specific aims: 1) To determine the dose-
dependent effects of Gli3 on terminal nerve development and gene expression. 2) To identify Gli3 gene targets
in the developing nose. 3) To discover the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of OECs. Our
innovative approach will exploit advanced single-cell transcriptomics, mouse genetics, imaging, CUT&RUN, and
bioinformatics to discover mechanisms underlying the development of the terminal nerve and OECs and the
formation of a functional GnRH-1 system. The proposed research is significant to human health since it will
advance and expand our understanding of KS and nIHH disease mechanisms in humans. The results from these
studies will improve diagnostic criteria and stimulate the development of novel treatments and therapeutic
strategies to improve the human condition."

Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show severe deficits in self-agency (i.e., the experience of being the agent of
one's own thoughts and actions), that directly contribute to debilitating psychotic symptoms and distort reality
monitoring (i.e., defined as distinguishing self-generated information from externally-derived information).
Current medications are inadequate with up to 40% of SZ remaining symptomatic, thus compelling the need to
understand the neurobiology underlying self-agency deficits which we believe drives psychotic experiences in
SZ. Here, we test for the first time a novel causal cognitive and neurobiological model underlying self-agency
with the aim of developing new effective treatments in SZ. In particular, we examine whether the resulting
experience of self-agency is driven by the fundamental ability to make reliable predictions about the outcomes
of one's own self-generated actions. This self-prediction ability is critical for the successful encoding and memory
retrieval of one's own thoughts and actions during reality monitoring to enable accurate self-agency judgments
(i.e., accurate identification of self-generated information). This self-prediction ability is also critical for speech
monitoring where we continually compare what we hear while we speak with what we expect to hear. Prior
studies have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a potential neural substrate that mediates both
lower-level self-predictions during speech monitoring, and higher-level self-agency judgments during reality
monitoring in healthy controls (HC). Here, we now test whether mPFC activity can causally modulate this self-
prediction ability to impact self-agency on two different tasks of reality and speech monitoring. We propose a
longitudinal randomized controlled trial in which HC and SZ are assigned to 5 daily sessions of either active high-
frequency 10Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to increase mPFC activity or to sham TMS. We use
repeated measures of magnetoencephalography imaging (MEGI) to assay neural activity underlying self-agency
on reality and speech monitoring tasks from pre-to-post TMS at time-points: (i) baseline, (ii) proximal post-TMS
(i.e., right after TMS intervention), and (iii) distal post-TMS (i.e., 1 week after TMS intervention). The specific
aims are to delineate with MEGI, proximal and distal mechanisms of how active 10Hz TMS modulates mPFC
activity in HC and SZ to induce neural network and behavioral changes in self-agency in reality and speech
monitoring tasks, compared to baseline and sham. The overall hypothesis is that high frequency TMS will
increase mPFC excitability and enhance self-predictions to improve self-agency on distinct tasks of speech and
reality monitoring. If successful, this project will establish mPFC as a new biological target for TMS therapies in
SZ, and will show that mPFC provides a unitary basis for self-agency driven by reliance on self-predictions. The
long-term objective is to delineate mechanisms of durability and generalizability of how improvements in critical
self-agency abilities after TMS of mPFC, can generalize to improvements in cognition, symptoms and life quality
in SZ for future TMS treatment development."

Pediatric clinical trials are important for discovering effective medicines, treatments, devices, and
interventions designed for children and adolescents. However, recruitment and retention in pediatric clinical
trials remains a challenge. Enrollment in clinical trials requires both consent of the parent and assent of the
youth and the roles that each takes and the contributions that each makes in the decision-making process can
vary, especially across development. When children are younger, parents are more likely to decide whether or
not their child will participate in a clinical trial. As children mature, the decision-making process typically
shifts to become more collaborative between parents and adolescents. There is evidence that both parents and
adolescents prefer a shared decision-making (SDM) approach to clinical trial participation; however, there are
few studies that directly examine the parent-child communication behaviors that are a part of the decision-
making process. The proposed project will address this gap through the use of videotaped observations,
questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. A diverse sample of parent-adolescent pairs (N=80) will be
observed making the decision whether to participate in two different types of hypothetical pediatric clinical
trials (i.e., high-risk; low-risk). Following each discussion, pairs will complete self-report questionnaires about
the experience. Positive (e.g., complimenting) and negative communication (e.g., sarcasm) behaviors will be
coded. Aim 1 will examine how positive and negative communication behaviors relate to parent and adolescent
decision-making involvement, communication satisfaction, and likelihood to participate in the trials. Given the
dyadic nature of the decision-making process, an Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model framework will be
applied to explore the unique and dyadic effects of parent-child communication on pediatric clinical trial
decision-making. In addition, a subgroup (N=20) of parent-teen pairs from the observational study will be
purposively sampled to participate in follow-up interviews. Adolescents’ report of communication satisfaction
will be used to identify pairs that experienced the most positive and negative decision-making experiences.
This approach will allow us to gather the most information-rich data from experiences on both sides of
spectrum. The proposed project will provide novel information about the specific communication behaviors
that parents and adolescents engage in as part of the decision-making process and how these behaviors impact
their final decisions and satisfaction with the process. The findings from this project have the potential to
inform the development of education resources or decision aids that can support families in engaging in more
effective shared decision-making practices with their developing adolescent when provided with the
opportunity to participate in a pediatric clinical trial."

Up to 95% of diabetic population suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D) with its prevalence rising rapidly. A gradual
decrease in β-cell function closely associated with hyperglycemia is the critical determinant to progress to T2D.
Globally, obesity is the major driver of T2D.
Energy expenditure and fat oxidation, rather than the appetite control
with multiple fundamental concerns, are considered the key determining factors of weight loss to enhance
glycemic control. Nonetheless, many of the drugs stimulating energy expenditure have failed in clinical
development or been withdrawn from the market due to lack of efficacy or side effects.
The non-canonical IkB kinases (IKKs), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its homolog IkB kinase e (IKKe),
are key players responding to obesity-dependent inflammation to regulate glucose and energy metabolism.
Nevertheless, a well-known TBK1/IKKe inhibitor amlexanox demonstrated modest efficacy in obese mice and
humans; acute amlexanox treatment led to noticeably reduced food intake in obese mice; it was effective in
lowering blood sugar only in a subset of obese patients with T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease without
significant body weight-reducing efficacy. To date, no synthesized analog of amlexanox has displayed a greater
response than amlexanox in vivo. Our published studies identified a cinnamic acid derivative (E)-3-(3-
phenylbenzo[c]isoxazol-5-yl)acrylic acid (abbreviated PIAA) as a novel TBK1/IKKe inhibitor showing higher
efficacy than amlexanox in diabetogenic condition in vivo; we further provided the first evidence that the
expression of TBK1 and IKBKE (encoding IKKe) was elevated in islets of obese T2D patients
. Treatment of PIAA
augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and expression of pivotal β-cell functional markers in multiple
animal and cell models, including human T2D islets. Our preliminary data demonstrated that while PIAA
improved glycemic control with significant weight loss in diet-induced obese mice, its oral administration was
found to be ineffective. To overcome orally inactive efficacy of PIAA, we developed a new orally active analog of
PIAA based on our structure-activity relationship studies. Oral treatment of a new analog produced substantial
weight loss without altering food intake in obese mice.
Based on these preliminary supportive findings, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of a new orally active small molecule in obesity-linked diabetic models. First, we will analyze the
pharmacokinetic profiles of a new small molecule; investigation of the efficacy and mechanisms of a new small
molecule in improving pancreatic islet cell function and mitigating adiposity via stimulating energy expenditure to
enhance glycemic control will be performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese and overtly hyperglycemic/diabetic
mice. Second, we will evaluate the efficacy of a new small molecule in ameliorating β- and α-cell dysfunctions in
human islets exposed to a diabetic milieu. We will examine whether the inherent anti-hyperglycemic effect of a
new small molecule translates from animal models to humans."

A key function of the nervous system is to transform sensory information from the environment into actionable
percepts. In a classic hierarchical representation framework, signals from peripheral receptor neurons with
simple tuning properties are transformed in primary sensory cortex to represent sensory objects. However,
recent data suggest that neural activity in primary sensory cortex strongly correlates with behavior, and that
sensory representations undergo large scale changes over time. We here test the hypotheses that behavioral
tuning of neurons in the olfactory (piriform) cortex supports the ability to filter out signals predicted by behavior,
and that coupling odor exposure to behavior stabilizes representational drift. Olfaction is an ideal model system
to study sensory-behavior interactions. Mice exhibit a rich repertoire of olfactory-driven behaviors, including
behaviors critical for survival and reproduction, and piriform cortex receives direct sensory inputs from the
olfactory bulb and is reciprocally interconnected with higher cognitive and motor areas.
We have implemented state-of-the-art experimental approaches to chronically record piriform neural activity
while synchronously monitoring behaviors. Our preliminary data suggests that sniffing, facial movements, and
locomotion can strongly modulate piriform neuronal activity.
Aim 1: To determine whether behavioral signals in piriform cortex subserve predictive processingWe
will combine two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice with detailed behavioral monitoring of sniffing, facial
movements including whisking, and locomotion, and we will quantify the extent to which piriform odor responses
differ across spontaneously occurring behavioral states. We will then use a closed-loop experimental design to
directly test whether behavioral signals in piriform cortex serve to filter out expected sensory information. We
predict that neuronal responses to behaviorally coupled odors will decrease over time, while responses to
behaviorally uncoupled odors will remain unaltered. Aim 2: To determine whether representational drift in
piriform cortex is explained by behavioral change. We will quantify the stability of odor representations in
piriform cortex, and we will test the extent to which changes in odor tuning (representational drift) can be
explained by changes in behavioral state. We predict that representations of odors that consistently occur during
defined behavioral states remain stable over time, while responses to behaviorally uncoupled odors will drift.
Successful completion of the proposed project will provide new insight into how animal behavior shapes olfactory
processing and the generation of odor representations in the mammalian cortex. Our studies will set the stage
for future projects aimed at characterizing the neural circuit mechanisms underlying complex odor-behavior
representations in the olfactory cortex, and the investigation of complex olfactory-driven behaviors in freely
moving mice in naturalistic environments."

AD is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia in the United
States. It is characterized by a progressive decline of memory and cognitive impairment,
ultimately leading to dementia. Currently, more than 5.7 million Americans are affected by AD,
and this number is projected to be 16 million by 2050. Although a tremendous effort has been
devoted to AD research, there are no effective disease modifying drugs available for AD, largely
due to the lack of understanding of the complex etiology of AD. Although the ultimate damage in
AD brain is neuronal loss, multiple cell types in brain are involved in AD development and
progression. Glia cells, e.g. microglia and astrocytes, are crucial for brain healthy brain. Other cell
types, e.g. vasculature cells including pericytes and endothelia cells, the major components of
brain-blood barrier, and oligodendrocytes, which is responsible for myelination of axons, are all
implicated in AD. How these key cell types interact during AD development, and in particular how
glia cells, e.g. microglia and astrocytes, interact with neurons to lead to neuronal death, are poorly
understood. In this application, we propose to develop novel analytic approaches to dissect cell-
cell communication (CCC) among microglia, astrocytes and neurons, and how the
communications are dysregulated during AD progression, and validate the candidate CCC in
human iPSC-derived cortical organoids. Specifically, we will develop novel network-based models
and statistical methods to identify CCC linked to AD pathogenesis (Aim 1), apply the developed
methods to analyze public single cell -omics data to identify CCC linked to AD pathology and
cognitive function (Aim 2), and validate the candidate CCC in human iPSC-derived cortical
organoids to decipher the multi-cellular communications underlying AD development (Aim 3)."

involves delicate regulation by a group of small RNAs named microRNAs. MicroRNAs can inhibit gene
expression by binding to mRNAs and prevent them from being translated into proteins. MicroRNA
levels in cancer cells are usually different from the microRNA levels in healthy cells, leading to
differential expression of certain cancer-related genes. Controlling microRNA levels therefore offers a
promising target for cancer treatment.
Recently, we found that when T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are treated with
dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in leukemia chemotherapy, two highly related
and pro-cancer microRNAs (miR-221/222) are degraded by their target mRNA (BIM). This is surprising
because microRNAs usually control the levels of their targets, but not the other way around. This is also
exciting because it represents an emerging gene regulation mode carried out by the mRNAs and opens
up strategies for cancer intervention.
In this proposal, we first aim to understand how BIM mRNA triggers miR-221/222 degradation. Our
second aim is to explore how miR-221/222 degradation enhances killing of T-ALL cells during
chemotherapy. In the final aim, we will develop an innovative biochemical and computational protocol to
globally identify sequences in different target mRNAs that can induce miRNA degradation in T-ALL
patient samples.
Collectively, our efforts will examine a new mechanism of gene regulation in T-ALL, in which mRNAs
counteract microRNAs. Because resistance to glucocorticoid is a serious limitation for T-ALL
chemotherapy, elucidating the underlying mechanism of resistance may provide the basis for improving
current therapeutic interventions. Given that we have discovered a potentially widespread occurrence
of the mRNA-induced microRNA degradation pathway in cancer, identifying the mRNAs that can
degrade miRNAs and the proteins involved in this process would help develop new therapies to combat
T-ALL."

Tau, coded for by the gene MAPT, can aggregate in the brain and is associated with many neurodegenerative
diseases. Evidence suggests that the level of expression of MAPT (tau) can be genetically associated with
disease risk. Furthermore, simply reducing the level of tau may be beneficial. There are many ways this may be
done, but one drawback of current approaches has to do with drug delivery. The brain can be difficult to reach
with therapeutics effectively, and some therapies for the brain can require invasive procedures that are not ideal
for a vulnerable population such as for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. So, it may be better to find
a way to reduce tau with something that could be used in pill form, or a small molecule drug. One way to affect
tau levels with a small molecule drug may be to target transcriptional networks involved in MAPT expression.
There is now data available on the cis-regulatory environment around the MAPT gene that provides information
on how MAPT is expressed in the central nervous system. What controls this process, though, are trans-
regulatory elements such as transcription factors. The field does not yet know what these key transcription factors
are. This proposal would use the most comprehensive technologies available to find out which transcription
factors control expression of MAPT. Once these transcription factors are known, it may be possible to find a way
to target them therapeutically by developing or modifying drugs that affect their function, or specific drugs that
affect the interactions between transcription factors needed for MAPT expression. In this study, the investigators
will: (1) Identify transcription factors that, when activated or repressed, can modulate the transcription level of
MAPT using CRISPRi/a screens with follow-up validations, (2) Determine which trans-regulatory elements are
directly associated with the MAPT promoter (either directly or through cis-regulatory element looping) using
proteomic approaches, and (3) Determine targetability of candidate transcription factors affecting MAPT
expression by assessing their genome wide and cell type–specific binding profiles, expression, and variability
level between AD cases and controls. Using these approaches provides a clear direction for comprehensively
understanding the trans-regulatory elements needed for MAPT expression supported by a combination of
unbiased and hypothesis-driven approaches. These data will support new approaches to target MAPT
expression therapeutically by targeting transcriptional networks responsible for its expression while also
assessing cell type specificity, off-target effects, and disease state relevance. The principal investigators include
leaders in the gene regulation field (Myers), tau biology and MAPT cis-regulatory elements (Cochran), and mass
spectrometry, including in application to tau biology (Swaney). The orthogonal approaches proposed in this study
will provide a foundational dataset of the comprehensive landscape of trans-regulatory elements controlling
expression of MAPT and will provide new avenues to pursue for treatment of tauopathies."

The parent grant (R01AG074359) specific aims are to estimate the effects of early-life social and
environmental exposures on late-life cognitive health (Aim 1-2), estimate their synergistic effects (Aim 3), and
evaluate the extent to which the early-life factors modify the effects of APOE-e4 on late-life cognitive health
(Aim 4). To complete all four aims, we have a methodological goal to estimate 1940 social and environmental
exposures at the community level for Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants. This involves using
1940 US Census data at the enumeration district level and numerous measures of environmental exposures at
different spatial resolutions, including traffic-related air pollution, fine particulate matter, power plant exposure,
and oil and gas well exposure. Currently, HRS has information on the enumeration districts where participants
lived in 1940. This information is supplied with the enumeration district code. However, the spatial locations of
the enumeration districts are not currently available. In order to link our social and environmental exposures to
HRS participant locations, we require digitized and georeferenced information on enumeration district locations
and boundaries across the US in 1940. The maps necessary to provide this information are available in paper
format at the National Archives in College Park, MD. This proposal will allow us to digitize county or city-level
1940 Census enumeration district maps containing 1940 residences of HRS participants and then
georeference the enumeration districts with HRS participants. We will also use previously digitized and
georeferenced information from 53 cities as part of the Urban Transition Project. Final output from this proposal
will consist of a spatial data frame containing enumeration district identifiers, centroid latitude and longitude,
and the enumeration district polygon. We will document our methods and share the spatial data files with the
HRS team to make them available to other HRS restricted data users. The dataset will be foundational in the
parent R01, allowing us to link a host of social and environmental data to participant residential locations in
1940. Analyses using this dataset have the potential to uncover new early-life predictors of Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and cognitive decline."

Ableist discrimination is pervasive in healthcare and negatively affects the US organ transplant system, resulting
in patients with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) often being unjustly excluded from life-saving
transplantation. To address this inequity, thirty-nine states have passed laws prohibiting disability-based
discrimination in organ transplantation. Currently, we do not know the extent to which anti-discrimination laws
mitigate ableism against patients with IDD, nor do we know which patient factors compound with ableism to
exacerbate disparities in transplantation access. Focusing on kidney transplantation, the most commonly
transplanted solid organ in the US, we will leverage our team’s unique expertise in IDD, transplant equity,
population-level claims data, and policy evaluation to achieve our specific aims: (Aim 1) determine the efficacy
of state laws prohibiting ableist discrimination in closing the equity gap between kidney transplant candidates
with vs. without IDD; (Aim 2) identify patient factors that compound with ableism to disproportionately reduce
kidney transplant access and increase dialysis time for patients with vs. without IDD; (Exploratory Aim 3)
compare reasons for exclusion among patients with vs. without IDD to understand how ableism impacts access
to kidney transplantation. We will achieve these aims through the synergistic use of national Medicare claims
data and local electronic health records (EHR) data. In Aim 1, we will use staggered adoption difference-in-
difference models to assess the impact of anti-discrimination laws on kidney transplant access for propensity
score matched samples of patients with and without IDD. In Aim 2, we will use multi-level regression and time-
to-event models with interaction terms and contrast statements to quantify the compounding effects of
comorbidities and social determinants of health with ableism for patients with IDD relative to propensity-score
matched patients without IDD. Last, in Exploratory Aim 3, we will leverage EHR data from four large academic
transplant centers to compare the stated reasons for kidney transplant denial between patients with and without
IDD. Findings will have practical applications for healthcare providers, regulatory agencies, and legislators
responsible for mitigating ableism against people with IDD in organ transplantation. This study is responsive to
RFA-HD-24-007 in that we will “examine the impact of existing efforts to address ableism (e.g., laws) on the
health of individuals” with IDD and how patient factors mediate the “impacts of ableism on health.” This project
will have a high public health impact yielding new, actionable information to further mitigate ableism against
people with IDD in organ transplantation and improve equitable access to this life-saving care."

The Motherhood Biographies and Midlife Women’s Health R01 project maps how divergence in motherhood experi-
ences contributes to growing midlife health disparities. About 85 percent of midlife women today are mothers, but path-
ways to motherhood—what we call motherhood biographies—are increasingly diverse across many dimensions relevant
to health, including age at first birth and spacing of children. The parent project tests how motherhood biographies mat-
ter for midlife women’s health with a specific focus on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We compare mothers
and non-mothers as well as mothers with differing motherhood biography profiles using nationally representative data
from the 1979-2018 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79; N=4,951 women). We are testing the
following aims with this diversity supplement and Crutchfield’s efforts focused on Aims 2 and 3: AIM 1: Identify how
motherhood biographies—including childlessness—relate to midlife health. AIM 2: Identify how the impact of mother-
hood biographies on health depends on characteristics of child-mother relationship at midlife. AIM 3: Identify the heter-
ogeneous effects by educational attainment and race/ethnicity of motherhood biographies on midlife health. Given
Crutchfield’s research and career interests, the proposed supplemental project will be beneficial to all parties, as well as
to the broader field of health disparities research across the life course. Crutchfield will specifically look at two questions
that fall within the goals of the Parent R01’s Aims 2 and 3: (1) Do the dynamics/quality of mother-adult child relation-
ships at midlife shape the impact of motherhood biographies on health outcomes at the intersection of socioeconomic
status (SES) and race-ethnicity? and (2) Specifically among Black women, how does the impact of mother-adult child
relationship dynamics/quality at midlife on the association between motherhood biographies and health differ by SES?
Throughout the duration of the administrative supplement, which will be Crutchfield’s 4th and 5th years in the Doctoral
program, she will work with the entire team to obtain training specifically on aging and life course theories and meth-
ods;, take courses to advance her statistical training, especially related to longitudinal data analysis and causal inference
methods;, conduct research for publications, presentations, and other research activities public scholarship; and receive
career and professionalization training, including related to writing grants and applying for jobs in the aging and life
course field. Life course training will include rigorous training in an interdisciplinary Aging Certificate at Ohio State; sta-
tistical training will focus on course work on longitudinal data analysis and other life course methods. In addition, in Y2
of the grant (year 5 of her doctoral training), the entire mentorship team will also assist Crutchfield in developing an ag-
ing-related NIH F32 post-doctoral application for her post-doctoral training, which will facilitate Crutchfield’s eventual
goal to obtain a tenure-track position in an aging and health field. In doing so, this supplement is designed to improve
women’s health and reduce racial-ethnic health disparities in midlife and beyond, a key goal of NIA, while contributing to
the development of a minority junior scholar specifically in the area of aging."
10979895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-traumatic joint contracture (PTJC) causes debilitating loss of motion following joint injury and is particularly
impactful in the elbow. Clinical treatment is limited due to a poor understanding of key mechanisms leading to
motion loss, making treatment targets elusive. This study will use a validated preclinical animal model of PTJC
to identify the key aspects of physical- and biological-based interventional strategies that best limit PTJC
following injury. Early joint remobilization improves range-of-motion (ROM); however, clinical practice requires a
period of joint immobilization following injury to reduce instability and prevent joint overloading. The parameters
of active therapy (i.e., initiation, duration, intensity) that best limit PTJC after an initial immobilization period
without destabilizing or overloading the healing joint remain unknown. In addition, while studies have shown that
modulation of the inflammatory response can improve healing after joint injury, and that T-cell-mediated signaling
might represent a particularly effective target, protocols guiding inflammation-based therapeutic approaches for
PTJC remain poorly defined. Overall objective: identify fundamental aspects of physical and biological treatment
strategies (i.e., initiation, duration, intensity, synergy) that prevent the development of PTJC using a preclinical
animal model and multi-modal, machine learning (ML)-based analyses. Aim 1: Identify parameters of
voluntary active physical therapy that are most critical to minimizing PTJC while promoting healing after
joint injury. This study will determine the optimal implementation of active physical therapy protocols to best
preserve ROM yet limit load-induced damage. Image-based ML algorithms will be used to automate/accelerate
spatial analysis of joint tissues and advance clustering analyses to elucidate cell- and tissue-level responses to
physical treatments. Hypothesis: moderate intensity/duration physical therapy will maximize motion and limit
joint damage, with additional benefit achieved by implementing a slightly staged increase in intensity after joint
remobilization. Aim 2: Develop biological strategies to reduce PTJC using anti-inflammatory intervention
and targeted modulation of the T cell mediated immune response following joint injury. Anti-inflammatory
prevention strategies will be developed and strategically combined with physical therapy to target multiple
phases of immune-mediated biological activity. ML algorithms will combine multi-modal experimental data to
explore spatial relationships in PTJC pathophysiology. Hypotheses: (i) reducing inflammation in the post-injury
and post-remobilization periods will help preserve ROM; (ii) improved outcomes from blocking T cell activity will
demonstrate a key mechanism of PTJC etiology; (iii) ML-driven data analysis will determine that abrogation of
capsule fibrosis, reduced remobilization-induced ligament hypertrophy, and limited T cell activity will be most
predictive of preserved joint function. While results obtained using an animal model aren’t directly translatable to
human care, this study will greatly advance understanding of PTJC pathophysiology and elucidate key principles
of physical and biological interventional strategies that can be leveraged to inform future treatment of PTJC."

 The overarching goal of this K08 research project is for Dr. Ethan Abbott, principal investigator (PI), to
establish himself as an independent physician-scientist whose research addresses healthcare-related
disparities and improves survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. He has prepared with
assistance of his multi-disciplinary mentorship team a compelling and innovative research project with
matching career development training components that enables him to conduct this research, prepare and
submit his subsequent R01-supported project from the preliminary data, and launch his research career.
 Dr. Abbott’s K08 research project aims to improve OHCA survival and clinical outcomes by identifying
important individual-level health-related social needs (HRSN) domains to improve prediction of 30-day survival
after OHCA and survival to hospital discharge. Despite the importance of individual-level HRSN in health
outcomes, current OHCA predictive models only account for clinical variables, resulting in significant limitations
towards advancing health equity and improving care for patients. Use of data science techniques, such as
natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to identify and extract HRSN for
inclusion in predictive models, could lead to interventions that decrease OHCA mortality.
 The specific aims of Dr. Abbott’s K08 research project are to: (1) Create a baseline predictive model to
identify key pre-hospital, patient-level, hospital-level and clinical predictors of 30-day survival after OHCA and
survival to hospital discharge; (2) Evaluate the efficacy of NLP and LLMs to extract individual-level HRSN for
the OHCA cohort; and (3) Determine if inclusion of individual-level HRSN increase performance of the baseline
predictive model in predicting 30-day post-OHCA survival and survival to hospital discharge, and if the HRSN-
inclusive model performs better than the prior models NULL-PLEASE and CAST. He will rigorously develop the
models using mediation analyses, multivariable regression, and machine learning algorithms.
 Dr. Abbott’s career development plan builds on his experience as an emergency medicine physician and
junior faculty researcher to develop and acquire new skills and expertise in: (1) formal mediation analysis; (2)
application of NLP algorithms and LLMs for electronic health record information (EHR) extraction, particularly
for HRSN; (3) predictive analytics for clinical outcomes using machine learning algorithms; and (4) research
independence through professional development activities, including committee leadership positions,
grantsmanship, dissemination of research findings. The results of this K08 will generate preliminary data to
form the basis of Dr. Abbott’s subsequent R01 application submission. His R01 study will externally validate a
predictive model for OHCA and extraction using LLMs for individual-level HRSN. The public health importance
of this work is that it will contribute overall to improved OHCA clinical care and survival for patients and
evaluating best practice for inclusion of HRSN data in clinical care."

The heterogeneity of pancreatic β-cells has been reported in many studies, but the field still lacks a consensus
about its molecular signature and disease relevance. Our recent single cell multiome analysis suggested that
HNF1A is a principal driver of a T2D-associated heterogeneity among the -cells from the same individual. By
leveraging single cell Patch-seq data, we also discovered that HNF1A activity is associated with lower Na+
currents in β-cells and nominated a HNF1A target, FXYD2, as the primary mitigator. Since mutations in HNF1A
are known to cause early onset diabetes (MODY3), there is a strong likelihood that HNF1A plays a causal role
in T2D via governing -cell heterogeneity. In fact, many literatures studied HNF1A and its mutations due to the
connection to MODY3, but little is known about its role in common diabetes in the context of -cell heterogeneity.
It should be noted that although our previous work has demonstrated the power of single cell multiome to study
-cell heterogeneity, the data did not allow us to directly compare the HNF1Ahi and HNF1Alo -cell populations
due to technical difficulties. In this project we will develop new single cell multiome integration strategy to directly
survey HNF1A function in -cell heterogeneity. We will establish stem cell models to manipulate HNF1A dosage
in hESC-derived -cells, which will not only provide mechanistic insights into how HNF1A mediates MODY3 and
-cell heterogeneity, but also offer new opportunity to improve the functionality of hPSC-derived -like cells for
therapeutical benefits. We will also develop new cell line model to allow genetic and chemical screens for the
upstream regulators of HNF1A in -cells. Taken together, our project will establish a new concept linking MODY3
gene HNF1A to common diabetes in the context of -cell heterogeneity."

The main goal of this project is to assess the contribution of epigenetics to cardiovascular risk in African
American women. Cardiovascular disease substantially impacts African American women, who are at high-risk
for mortality and complications. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci for
coronary heart disease and stroke, but the epigenetic contribution to cardiovascular disease has been less
studied, especially in African Americans and women. Epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may
better reflect lifestyle and environmentally induced risks, including risk due to lifestyle and behavioral factors,
biological aging and environmental toxins. We propose to study epigenetic biomarkers of cardiovascular
disease in a large sample of African American participants the Women's Health Initiative, a cohort of
postmenopausal women with comprehensive clinical and lifestyle data, and large numbers of adjudicated
clinical outcomes. We will identify epigenetic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and its environmental
determinants, and evaluate if epigenetic biomarkers contribute to risk prediction assessments of cardiovascular
disease. The proposal aligns to goals set forth in the 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategy Plan for Women's Health
Research and the NHLBI mission to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in populations with
disparities in disease risk."
10980175,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an almost uniformly fatal disease most often diagnosed after the
development of metastases. The tumor suppressor gene, TP53, is the most commonly altered gene in human
cancer and has been recognized as a genetic driver of PDAC in up to 75% of patients. While the functions of
TP53 mutations within cancer cells continue to be studied, knowledge of its non-cell autonomous roles in the
primary tumor microenvironment remain limited. The ultimate goal of our work is to exploit targets that arise in
PDAC tumor cells or in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a consequence of p53 mutation for translation into
patient therapies. Recently, our laboratory discovered a cooperative signaling node between the top genetic
PDAC drivers, oncogenic KRAS and mutant p53, engaged through interactive binding between mutant p53 and
CREB1. This mutant p53/CREB1 complex subsequently activates multiple pro-metastatic transcriptional
networks within tumor cells. Our preliminary data indicate that mutant p53/CREB1 GOF also drives non-cell
autonomous functions through the activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling elements that direct cancer associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) to curate the primary TME into pro-metastatic landscapes. We hypothesize that targeted
disruption of the mutant p53/CREB1 complex is a viable opportunity to reverse cell- and non-cell autonomous
functions of mutant p53 for therapeutic translation in PDAC. Accordingly, the objective of this grant proposal is
to gain additional mechanistic insight into how p53 mutations in tumor cells drive pro-metastatic interactions with
cancer associated fibroblasts and to test if disruption of the mutant p53/CREB1 complex subverts vitals steps in
the metastatic cascade. Using genetically engineered mice and patient derived model systems, in aim 1 we will
confirm essential elements of the mutant p53/CREB1-WNT/β-catenin signaling axis that consort with cancer
associated fibroblasts to enhance migratory and invasive phenotypes. Moreover, we will test the efficacy of
combined targeted approaches to disrupt multiple levels of the mutant p53/CREB1-WNT11 signaling axis to
mitigate metastasis. In aim 2, we will clarify the role of the mutant p53/CREB1-WNT/β-catenin signaling axis in
the curation of the fibrotic TME as it relates to chemoresistance and metastasis while testing its reversibility using
genetic and pharmacologic strategies. In Aim 3, we will use human PDAC biospecimens and derived organoids
to correlate our findings from Aims 1 and 2. The proposed research is significant because p53 mutations are
present in 70 percent of PDAC patients and remain untargetable. As such, our approach to disrupt non-cell
autonomous mutant p53 gain of function could expose new therapeutic vulnerabilities or inform rational
combinatorial treatment strategies. The proposed research is innovative because we will study and modulate a
novel mutant p53/CREB1-WNT/β-catenin signaling axis to undermine multiple checkpoints in the metastatic
cascade. Given the prevalence of mutant p53 in human cancers, knowledge gained from this proposal also has
broad application to other malignant disease sites and entirely aligns with the overarching mission of the NIH."

 This is a continuation application for the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) Diagnostic Center of Excellence (DCoE) of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). In phase I and II of the UDN, we provided patients with undiagnosed diseases (UDD) access to state-of-the-art diagnostic methods, accelerated discovery of new biological mechanisms linking genetic variants with disease causation, identified potential treatment approaches, and engaged with the UDN and broader community to share best practices and innovations. We have implemented innovative technologies like RNA sequencing- “first” directed genomic analysis on both whole blood and fibroblasts to complement exome and genome sequencing. This RNAseq- first analytical approach is now widely used in the broader community. In the current bridge phase III year, we have established collaboration with other NIH (NCATS Project GIVE, NHGRI Texome, and All of Us Evenings with Genetics Scholars) and community health programs (Texas Association of Community Health Clinics) to increase referral of under-represented and underserved communities to our site. We achieved this by leveraging an integrated genetics program housed within the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics (DMHG). This includes a full spectrum of service, teaching, and research activities spanning from adult, pediatric, and prenatal care, to gene discovery and study of disease mechanisms to clinical trials, to a leading medical genetics diagnostic laboratory joint venture (Baylor Genetics), to community engagement via the DMHG Office of Community Engagement and Equity. We propose to continue this remarkably integrated approach to discovery and care to achieve the objectives of the phase III UDN with 1) expansion of our hybrid- 3rd party payor/research supported, tiered evaluations, 2) focus on under-represented and under-served populations referred by our NIH program/community partners, 3) efficiencies afforded by our virtual Consult a gene platform, 4) application of ultra-low cost sequencing in partnership with Ultima Genomics to empower newer multi-omic analyses, and 4) data and resource sharing widely via the UDN DMCC. The Specific Aims of this BCM UDN DCoE are to: 1) Expand and scale our current model of integrated, tiered clinical and research assessments that leverages institutional infrastructure, resources, and previous programmatic successes; 2) Expand UDN access to underserved and under-represented communities by expanding pilot activities established during the current phase III bridge year; 3) Extend on our innovative multi-omic approaches from phase I and II; 4) Implement initiatives and contribute to DMCC and network wide protocols and governance as we have successfully done in our phase I and II activities."
10979274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Thousands of abasic sites form daily in each of our cells. Many types of environmental toxins that cause
alkylation or oxidation of DNA bases to form N7-guanine adducts and 8-oxoguanine induce abasic sites.
For example, N-nitrosamines that are found in foods, detergents, solvents, plastics, and agricultural
chemicals as well as chemicals like carbon tetracholoride, potassium bromate, and chloroform that induce
oxidative stress all increase the frequency of abasic sites in DNA. Failures in managing this ubiquitous form
of DNA damage can cause a variety of diseases including cancer. The known mechanisms of repair require
an intact DNA duplex; however, abasic sites form more readily in single-stranded DNA where they are
impediments to replicative polymerases. We recently discovered a new pathway that detects and process
abasic sites in single-stranded DNA. This pathway utilizes HMCES (hydroxyl-methyl cytosine embryonic
cell specific) to detect and shield these abasic sites from deleterious processing. HMCES contains an
evolutionarily conserved domain (SRAP) that binds DNA and forms a covalent crosslink to abasic sites.
This DNA-protein crosslink prevents endonucleases from cleaving the single-stranded DNA, thereby
preventing double-strand breaks. In this proposal we will further characterize how this pathway acts to
maintain genome stability, and more broadly define how abasic sites are tolerated and repaired in the
context of DNA replication. We will utilize state of the art biochemical, genetic, and structural approaches in
human cells and cell extracts. Completing these studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of how
cells cope with a ubiquitous form of DNA damage generated by important environmental genotoxins."

Background: Chronic orofacial pain (COP) conditions are common, costly, and debilitating. These conditions are unified
by high levels of pain-related activity limitations, maladaptive coping and emotional distress, which are most often
unaddressed and worsen each other over time. The majority of COP treatments are biomedical, often ineffective, involve
adverse side-effects, misdiagnoses, and can entail unnecessary and painful procedures that may lead to irreversible damage.
Available psychosocial interventions are limited in effectiveness, accessibility, scalability, scope, availability of trained
providers, and insurance coverage. They also rely on talking, posing a significant barrier to participation for many
patients with COP. “Talk-free” psychosocial web-based platforms are needed to bypass these limitations and make
psychosocial treatment accessible, scalable, and generalizable but do not exist for adults with heterogenous COP.
The goal of this R21 proposal is to adapt the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP), an evidence-based program,
for the unique needs of people with COP and for asynchronous delivery through a web-based platform. We have shown that
the 3RP improves pain-related activity limitations and emotional distress among people with refractory temporomandibular
joint disorder (TMD) when delivered in person. However, to assure accessibility, generalizability, scalability, and future
efficacy, it is essential to adapt the 3RP to a “talk-free” web platform tailored to unique unmet challenges in COP.
Our guiding hypothesis (to be tested in future work) is that Face-Forward-Web will be an effective, efficient and
scalable strategy to improve pain-related activity limitations and emotional distress among patients with COP.
Specific Aims and Research Design. We will conduct live video focus groups (N=4-5 groups/ N=20 individuals) with
people who have heterogeneous COP to understand treatments needs and preferences and adapt the intervention for
asynchronous delivery via a web-based platform - Face-Forward-Web, the first of its kind for this population (aim 1); and
(2) iteratively optimize Face-Forward-Web through a series of open pilots with exit interviews (2 with N=5 and 1 with
N=10) until critical Go/No-go feasibility and acceptability benchmarks are met (aim 2).
This project aligns with NIDCR’s stated priorities of supporting research promoting craniofacial health, alleviating
discomfort, and embracing technology as a driver of discovery.
Impact: Our interdisciplinary team of psychologists, a dentist and a neurologist has partnered with the national Facial Pain
Association to collect preliminary data and facilitate recruitment for this project. We have extensive expertise with mixed
methods, development of web platforms, and remote clinical trials. Results of this study will directly inform a subsequent
UG3/UH3 NIDCR application. In the UG3 we will conduct a small pilot RCT (NIH 1B) to ensure our ability to randomize
and finalize our study protocol, including fidelity measurement. In the UH3 phase we will test the efficacy of Face-Forward-
Web in improving pain, activity limitations and emotional distress, and test theory-driven mechanisms of improvement
through adaptive coping. Face-Forward-Web, adapted specifically for the needs of this population and delivered through
their preferred modality, has the potential to improve pain, activity limitations, and emotional distress in this population."
10980257,"Project Summary/Abstract. Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects 1 in 3 of the over 90 million people
currently enrolled in Medicaid, and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the U.S. While
multiple effective anti-hypertensive (AH) drugs are widely available in the U.S., they require high (≥80%) life-
long medication adherence to successfully counter cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, AH
medication adherence is lowest among Medicaid enrollees compared to other insured populations, and
nonadherence is a major barrier to controlled blood pressure. The mechanisms of present bias and habit
strength have been shown to maintain behavior change in several settings, but have not been tested for
maintaining high AH medication adherence. Incentives are effective for improving medication adherence in the
short term, and may reduce present bias by helping people better internalize the future benefits of their actions,
which in turn could maintain AH medication adherence. Therefore, we propose to partner with the widely-used,
commercial Wellth smartphone app, where app users can earn incentives for sending photographic evidence
of their daily pill taking. After withdrawing the Wellth-delivered incentives, we will measure adherence
maintenance. Habitual pill-taking is another key strategy for maintaining behavior change, since habits
performed in response to the same contextual cue for roughly four months are executed with high habit
strength, i.e., are performed with little or no cognitive effort. Existing habit formation interventions have had
difficulty effectively supporting participants, but behavioral economics suggests that providing small incentives
for cueing the new behavior can effectively support habit formation. Thus, this study proposes to also adapt the
Wellth app to reward cued AH pill taking. In a Stage III, 24-month 3-arm real-world efficacy trial, hypertensive
adults with low (<80%) adherence from Arizona Complete Health’s Medicaid plan (n=600; 200 per group) will
be randomly assigned to: 1) ‘Control’ group; 2) ‘Wellth Only’ that will receive daily incentives for submitting a
picture of their AH pill taking; or 3) ‘Wellth+Cue’ that will be asked to describe the cue that will trigger their AH
pill taking and send a second picture of the contextual cue, such as a coffee mug. A 4-month intervention will
be followed by a 20-month post-intervention period to measure maintenance. The Primary Outcomes are mean
AH medication adherence (days covered measured via Medicaid claims) and blood pressure (via at-home
readings at baseline and months 4, 8, 12, and 24). Secondary Outcomes are healthcare utilization (emergency
and inpatient visits) and the costs incurred by Medicaid (via claims data). After the study ends, interviews with
stakeholders and participants (using a positive/negative deviance approach) will ask about potential
implementation barriers to inform intervention refinements and cultural adaptation to prepare for Stage V
implementation research in a future study. If found effective, the study has the potential for immediate scale-up

 The proposed studies will clarify the mechanisms by which glucose metabolism is dysregulated following
consumption of a diet high in fat and fructose (HFHF; i.e. “Western diet”). Studies will be carried out in normal
and diet-induced glucose intolerant dogs. The canine model is unique in that it allows infusion into the hepatic
portal vein (e.g., insulin, glucagon, glucose, amino acids, etc.), as happens with feeding, something that is not
possible in the human or rodent. In the transition from feeding to fasting the liver switches from glucose
production to uptake (HGP→HGU), a process critical to the maintenance of normal glucose tolerance. Hepatic
glucose metabolism is regulated by three principal signals: insulin, glucose, and neural input (portal glucose
signal [PGS]). The latter occurs when the glucose concentration in the hepatic portal vein is greater than in
arterial blood, as occurs when glucose is absorbed from the gut. Consuming a HFHF diet severely impairs
HGU. Although this is due, in part, to liver insulin resistance, we recently found that hepatic glucose resistance
plays an even greater role. In this proposal we: 1) explore the impact of the route of insulin delivery on the
compromised liver. Patients with diabetes are normally treated with subcutaneous insulin injection, which
results in a very different distribution in the body (enriching the liver with insulin) than when insulin is secreted
by the pancreas. We will determine the metabolic consequences of peripheral insulin delivery on liver glucose
metabolism in the HFHF dog. This will shed light on the need for ways to insulinize the liver preferentially. 2)
We will determine how the signals that regulate mealtime HGU interact with each other in HFHF fed animals
and the relative importance of the loss of insulin action and the loss of the PGS in the regulation of HGU. 3)
Like with the PGS, there are sensors in the hepatoportal region that detect when protein (amino acids) has
been consumed. The body responds to amino acids and glucose by producing insulin and glucagon, hormones
that regulate the liver's response to nutrients. While the HFHF diet causes severe hepatic glucose dysfunction,
less is known about how it affects the liver's handling of amino acids and protein metabolism. Likewise, the
interaction between liver glucose and protein metabolism in the HFHF fed liver will be examined. 4) Glucagon
has a complex role in metabolism. It counters the hypoglycemic effects of insulin (its levels increase as glucose
levels fall). On the other hand, glucagon also increases when protein is consumed. While this might be
expected to negatively impact the glucose lowering effects of insulin, recent evidence suggests that high levels
of glucagon might somehow work together with insulin to clear ingested amino acids from the blood and to
reduce glucose levels. We will determine if this is the case under more physiological circumstances. We
believe that the knowledge gained from the proposed experiments will assist in the development of new
therapeutic approaches in the treatment of metabolic disorders."
10980004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this research project is to develop optical redox imaging (ORI)-based medical instruments to guide
surgical and therapeutic approaches in early cartilage damage. Osteoarthritis (OA), for which cartilage pathology
is a central aspect, remains a challenging clinical problem without disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. This
challenge is exacerbated by the inability of current diagnostic methods to accurately classify cartilage damage
early in the OA disease process.
Redox imbalance occurs in the OA disease process. Mitochondrial dysfunction is of particular importance,
occurring in OA and after traumatic injury. Therapeutic strategies that target mitochondrial dysfunction and
metabolic imbalance to treat OA show potential for modifying the disease trajectory. Therefore, measuring
cartilage metabolic imbalance has strong potential for early OA diagnosis and for evaluating therapeutic
strategies.
This research program will use ORI as a diagnostic and evaluative tool for OA. ORI is a label-free, real-time
method that captures the autofluorescence of electron donors and an electron acceptor, thereby providing insight
into the metabolic balance of a tissue. ORI has been used in the cancer field to identify organoid responses to
treatments and distinguish cell subgroups, thus suggesting its utility as a diagnostic and screening tool. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that ORI metrics in cartilage are mechanoresponsive, oxygen sensitive, and are
correlated with pathology. We will extend our preliminary data to further develop ORI as a tool to diagnose
metabolic imbalances associated with pathology and evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies in cartilage.
This proposal includes three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a stress test that can be used to diagnose cartilage
disease based on changes in ORI metrics following a mechanical stimulus. In Aim 2, we will develop an ex vivo
test platform to rapidly evaluation emergent therapeutic strategies. In Aim 3, we will develop a medical instrument
that captures ORI for staging cartilage disease. At the conclusion of this research, we will have developed ORI
as an instrument to diagnose cartilage pathology, investigated ORI as a platform to test interventions, and
generated a preliminary arthroscopy medical instrument ready for clinical translation."

The majority of patients with low-risk thyroid cancer undergo total thyroidectomy – the riskiest treatment option.
Safer, less invasive alternatives offer patients equivalent recurrence and survival with lower risks of debilitating
fatigue and serious adverse outcomes. To reduce the long-term morbidity of thyroid cancer and the improve
health-related quality of life of survivors, it is imperative to prevent overuse of total thyroidectomy. We have
shown that surgeon- and practice-level factors are the most potent actionable contributors to total
thyroidectomy overuse. Patients with thyroid cancer would benefit from an intervention that targets known
causes of total thyroidectomy overuse at the surgeon and practice levels.
In this proposal, our experienced research team will adapt existing evidence-based interventions into a multi-
component, multi-level intervention to promote “less extensive surgery by surgeons” (LESS). The intervention
components are theoretically-based and grounded in the Behavior Change Ball, a practical tool for designing
and evaluating behavior change interventions and policies. After packaging the intervention and completing
user testing, we will test the intervention’s effect on rates of total thyroidectomy in an established state-wide
value collaborative with a history of successfully implementing surgeon- and practice-level interventions. We
will also assess key mechanistic outcomes as the surgeon, practice, and patient levels.
The results of the proposed research will provide crucial evidence for a future, large-scale multi-site hybrid type
2 effectiveness—implementation trial to test the effectiveness of LESS on reducing total thyroidectomy rates
while simultaneously examining implementation strategies. The intervention will be built on an existing platform
designed by physicians and be easily tailored to user needs while remaining scalable. Intervention components
will include disease-specific strategic education, communication skills training, and audit-feedback strategies
that will have broad applicability for patient-doctor treatment decisions in other cancers. This research is
significant because decreasing rates of unnecessary total thyroidectomy in patients with low-risk thyroid cancer
will reduce patient harm and improve long-term outcomes—the mission of the NCI. Our experienced
multidisciplinary team’s history of successful collaboration and experience in behavioral intervention design
and testing with cluster-randomized stepped wedge designs make us well positioned to achieve the aims of
this award. This proposal is critical to supporting the long-term health of thyroid cancer survivors and our long-
term goal of reducing overtreatment by intervening on surgical decisions."
10980392,"SUMMARY
Trisomy 21 (T21) occurs in ~1 in 700 live births resulting in Down Syndrome (DS), where pulmonary
complications are the main cause of hospitalizations in children and adults. These include tracheobronchial
diseases presenting as decreased upper airway muscle tone, tracheobronchial malacia and airway obstruction
with wheezing, particularly in babies and children. There is currently limited to no information regarding the
pathogenesis of primary lung disease in DS. Thus, understanding early, perinatal factors leading to lung disease
in neonates and children with DS becomes clinically relevant and innovative with potential for substantial lifelong
impact. Senescent (Sen) cells in G1 cell cycle arrest secrete factors (Sen-associated secretory phenotype;
SASP) that mediate paracrine effects on naïve cells. Sen can be induced by DNA damage, oxidative stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which are increased in T21. While Sen can be beneficial in growth and repair, it
becomes detrimental when Sen cell numbers exceed immune clearance (defective in T21), and secrete a pro-
inflammatory, pro-fibrotic SASP that maintains and expands detrimental Sen. Maintenance of SASP, known as
late Sen, is modulated by IFN-I signaling, a pathway consistently activated in T21. Thus, if DS is seen as a form
of progeria (early aging) involving Sen, there is strong premise to link Sen, IFN-I and T21. These relationships
are entirely unknown in the DS lung, especially in prenatal/early postnatal life when the potential for impactful
intervention is high. Here, drugs that kill Sen cells (senolytics) such as Dasatinib + quercetin (D+Q), or fisetin
(flavonoid in strawberries), or even SASP modulators (senomorphics) represent novel therapies that are only
recently being tested in lung diseases. Our key preliminary data show increased baseline Sen in T21 fetal lung
tissues and mesenchymal cells (FLMC). We hypothesize that detrimental Sen/SASP present in T21 initiates in
utero and promotes lung disease in DS; effects alleviated by senolytics and senomorphics. Our approach will be
to use developing human lung tissues, mesenchymal cells and ex vivo explant models from T21 and non-T21
fetal, neonatal and pediatric samples to determine the impact of Sen in T21, the interplay between T21 and IFN-
I and the possible effects of senolytics and senomorphics towards therapies for lung disease in DS. Our proposal
represents a novel approach to understanding and treating lung disease in a highly vulnerable population where
pulmonary disorders represent a major healthcare issue, yet with little to no information regarding disease
pathogenesis."
10980926,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common bone tumor in the pediatric population and is defined by a
pathognomonic translocation, most frequently EWS::FLI1, which leads to the expression of a novel, yet not
presently targetable oncogenic transcription factor. The treatment regimen for ES includes cytotoxic
chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation, which have improved overall survival rates to approximately 70%.
However, despite intensification of therapeutic regimens, long-term outcomes for patients with metastatic or
relapsed Ewing sarcoma remain extremely poor, with overall survival rates dropping to 20-30%. Thus, alternative
targeted therapies, or combination therapies, are essential for improving patient outcomes. This proposal
addresses a significant gap in the knowledge towards treatment for high-risk ES. Our laboratory has recently
identified p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are activated and promote metastasis in ES. PAKs are a family of
serine/threonine kinases that regulate key cell processes involved in metastatic progression and drug resistance
and are imminently emerging as candidate anti-cancer targets. We recently reported that PAK4, which has
oncogenic properties and is a nidus for critical signaling cascades including Ras/MAPK, Wnt, and PI3K signaling,
is significantly overexpressed in metastatic ES, and is negatively correlated with patient outcomes. In vitro and
in vivo molecular and pharmacological perturbations of PAK4 in ES models demonstrated significant anti-tumor
and anti-metastatic activity. In addition, we have preliminary evidence that PAK4 is a novel regulator of alternative
splicing and subsequently modulates EWS::FLI1 activity. Using our innovative, state-of-the-art approaches and
unique in vivo and ex vivo models, the overarching goals are to gain additional molecular insights into PAK4-
mediated mechanisms in ES and investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting PAK4. We will examine PAK4’s
role as a novel regulator of alternative splicing and PAK4-mediated downstream proteo-transcriptomic signatures
that contribute to ES progression. We will also investigate and assess the efficacy of biologically rational and
clinically applicable synergistic therapeutic regimens. We hypothesize that PAK4 integrates signaling events
critical for ES development and progression and regulates novel downstream effectors, including spliceosome
components that significantly contributes to its oncogenic properties. Our aims include the following: Aim1.
Defining the PAK4 direct substrates and functional subcellular signaling networks in primary and metastatic
Ewing sarcoma. Aim2. Evaluation of PAK4 as a novel splicing regulating protein kinase and its direct effects on
EWS::FLI1 function and downstream gene regulation in ES. Aim3. Assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting
PAK4 in combination with mechanistically rational targeted agents using orthotopic and metastatic ES models.
Completion of these studies will provide new insights into ES biology and impact ES therapy by providing novel
therapeutic strategies that can be moved towards clinical trial for the treatment of high-risk ES."

Hematopoiesis produces ~300 billion blood cells daily. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give
rise to lineage-committed progenitors (e.g., the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP)), which
differentiate into mature cell types. Understanding mechanisms required for HSPC and MEP fate determination
has important implications for pathologies such as leukemia, chronic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), as all can be caused by mutations and misregulation of HSPC and/or MEP activities. I identified that
the sterile alpha motif protein-1 (SAMD1) protein is expressed highly in HSPCs and MEPs. My preliminary data
indicates that SAMD1 promotes Kit signaling, impairs erythropoiesis and HSPC activity, and modulates the
expression of multiple genes required for hematopoiesis/erythropoiesis, including GATA2. In other contexts,
SAMD1 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor with LSD1 to control transcription. I hypothesize that SAMD1
directs transcription and signaling during hematopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo and ex
vivo loss-of-function approaches. First, I will perform bone marrow transplantation experiments in mice to
examine the requirement of Samd1 for HSPC activity. Second, using CRISPR-Cas9, I will knock out human
SAMD1 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and test SAMD1-dependent changes to the progenitor phenotype
(using colony and cell signaling assays). Finally, I will establish the role of SAMD1 in modulating GATA2 gene
expression using the human umbilical cord-derived erythroid progenitor-2 (HUDEP2) cell line. These
experiments will determine whether and how SAMD1 expression is needed to promote HSPC and MEP cell
phenotypes, including progenitor potential, cell signaling, and transcription. Linking Samd1 function to signaling
and transcriptional mechanisms opens the door to translational avenues for studying the contribution of Samd1
in hematologic pathologies. The University of Nebraska Medical Center, the parent institution of this research
proposal, is rapidly developing as a biomedical research leader. The scientific environment in which the
proposed studies are to be performed will directly contribute to the probability of the project’s success. UNMC
is an intellectual and collaborative environment with ample resources to facilitate training and career
development. The training plan includes learning fundamental skills in the field of hematopoiesis, including
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With the presentations, career workshops, and writing opportunities
this fellowship will provide, the career goal of becoming an expert in the field of hematopoiesis working in an
academic environment will be achieved by the applicant."

Broad/Long Term Objectives: The goals of this application are to: 1) conduct a novel test of the Acquired
Preparedness Model (APM) examining the moderating role of reward-related impulsivity on the relationship
between familial alcohol exposure and alcohol expectancies in early adolescence and 2) utilize advanced
statistics to identify latent profiles of trait, behavioral, and neural indicators of impulsivity in early adolescence.
Specific Aims: The proposed project aims to 1) identify the latent structure of a reward-related impulsivity
neuroimaging measure in early adolescence, 2) test the role of reward-related impulsivity in the proposed
developmental pathway of the APM, and 3) utilize person-centered heterogeneity analyses to identify distinct
profiles of impulsivity in early adolescence. To complete the proposed project, the applicant will receive training
in multivariate statistical methods, secondary neuroimaging analysis, and scientific writing. Training will be
obtained via 1) meetings with expert consultants, 2) coursework, and 3) conference and workshop attendance.
Method: The project will consist of secondary data analysis of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
(ABCD) study dataset. Latent variable modeling will be utilized to examine the latent structure of the Monetary
Incentive Delay (MID) task in the ABCD sample and identify neural coactivation patterns associated with
developmental risk factors for AUD. Structural equation models will be used to test the APM, looking at multi-
method reward-related impulsivity variables as moderators of the relationship between familial alcohol exposure
and alcohol expectancies. Supplementary analyses will also be conducted with all available questionnaire,
behavioral, and neural indicators of impulsivity to explore distinct profiles of impulsivity in the ABCD sample.
Significance: The proposed project will advance understanding of the developmental mechanisms contributing
to risk for early alcohol use initiation, clarify the organization of heterogeneous impulsivity constructs in early
adolescence, and identify distinct neural underpinnings of reward impulsivity in early adolescence associated
with alcohol risk. The results of the project will allow for more effective tailoring of prevention and intervention
efforts for adolescent alcohol use.
Training Plan and Environment: The training plan will provide the applicant with quantitative, substantive, and
practical training to facilitate a successful career as an independent addiction scientist. The applicant will receive

training program funded by an NIAAA training grant (T32 AA013526; PI: Denis McCarthy). The mentoring team
consists of experts in developmental psychopathology (Dr. McCarthy), neuroimaging (Drs. Froeliger, Squeglia)
and quantitative (Dr. Steinley) research on addiction, providing a strong collaborative training experience for the
applicant."
10996929,"Tumor blood vessels are dysfunctional and irregular, impairing immune cell infiltration and drug delivery
and creating areas of severe hypoxia that select for aggressive cancer cells. Recent therapeutic strategies aim
to normalize the tumor vasculature by targeting angiogenic factors, but this often results in a small window of
efficacy due to resistance or over-pruning. Our lab discovered a mechanism during normal vascular development
that may be dysregulated and targetable in tumors. Using mice that express the fluorescent, ubiquitination-based
cell cycle indicator (Fucci2) to distinguish cell cycle states (early G1, late G1, S/G2/M), we found that distinct
endothelial cell cycle states (early G1 vs. late G1) are required for endothelial cell specification into venous vs.
arterial subtypes, respectively. In addition, we found that endothelial cell cycle control and specification are
dysregulated in vascular malformations that resemble tumor vasculature. These malformations were prevented
by treatment with a cell cycle inhibitor, Palbociclib, an FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitor for advanced breast
cancer treatment. Yet, the effects of Palbociclib, or other cell cycle inhibitors, on tumor vasculature are unknown.
We hypothesize that endothelial cell cycle state is dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment, leading
to impaired endothelial cell specification and immature vessels, and that treatment with a cell cycle
inhibitor will enable endothelial cell specification and normalize the tumor vasculature. To examine tumor
endothelial cell cycle and specification, I induced mammary tumors in Fucci2 mice and found tumor endothelial
cell proliferation is significantly increased with less endothelial cells in late G1. Additionally, tumor endothelial
cells exhibit decreased expression of arterial-, venous-, and capillary-enriched genes, indicating immature
vessels. Thus, Aim1 will further quantify endothelial cell cycle state and subtype markers in Fucci2 mice with
mammary or melanoma tumors compared to healthy mammary fat pad (MFP) or skin controls. Thus far, I treated
Fucci2 mice with mammary tumors with Palbociclib, which significantly decreased the proportion of proliferative
endothelial cells and increased the proportion in late G1. Aim 2 will further test the hypothesis that Palbociclib,
and other cell cycle inhibitors, increases tumor endothelial cells in G1 states to resemble healthy tissues and
enable arterial-venous specification. We will quantify changes in Fucci2 expression and analyze single-cell RNA
sequencing of endothelial and other cells from MFPs and tumors isolated from vehicle- or Palbociclib-treated
mice to identify changes in specification and cell-cell signaling. Finally, we will quantify changes in vessel
permeability and maturation and tissue hypoxia after cell cycle inhibitor treatment. I will test delivery of a contrast
agent to the tumors to model drug delivery and use microCT to quantify changes in vessel density and structure
before, during, and after treatment. These studies will elucidate how the tumor microenvironment affects
endothelial cycle state and specification, and mechanisms by which pharmacological cell cycle inhibition can
normalize tumor vasculature, indicating a new use of such drugs for cancer and pathological angiogenesis."
10996986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chemical modifications of RNA have been seen to have numerous biological consequences including regulation
of development. Ribosomal RNA is heavily modified by 2’O methylation (2’O-Me). There is increasing evidence
that regulation of rRNA modification impacts developmental programs including neuronal differentiation.
Fibrillarin (FBL) is known to be the canonical 2’O methyltransferase that applies 2’O-Me to ribosomal RNA. While
total loss of FBL is lethal as it is critical to ribosome biogenesis, modulation of FBL expression can regulate stem
cell differentiation. Overexpression of FBL extends mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency, while partial
knockdown induces neural stem cells marker expression. Additionally, altering FBL expression can cause
changes in 2’O-Me of rRNA. Changes in 2’O-Me of rRNA have been seen to alter translational levels of select
mRNAs and modulate cap-independent translation. The role of additional methyltransferases in shaping
ribosomal function in neurogenesis is unknown. FBL has a mammalian-specific paralog FBLL1. The function of
FBLL1 is unknown, though its structural similarity to FBL suggests that it is also a methyltransferase. Its role in
neuron differentiation has not been studied. Unlike FBL which is expressed throughout all adult tissue types,
FBLL1 is specifically expressed in the brain and testes. Within the brain, FBLL1 is expressed exclusively in
neurons. While FBL expression decreases, FBLL1 expression increases through neuronal differentiation. We
hypothesize that FBLL1 may act as an additional RNA methyltransferase that applies distinct 2’O-Me to
ribosomes to shape translation through neuronal differentiation. Indeed, our preliminary results show that,
when ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells, FBLL1 binds 18S rRNA and localizes to the nucleolus, the site of
rRNA modification. In neurons, FBLL1 localizes to the nucleolus. Additionally, we observed reduction in 2’O-Me
of specific sites on rRNA with genetic loss of FBLL1 in neurons. The goal of this project is to understand the
function of FBLL1 and its impact on translational regulation through neuronal differentiation through two Specific
Aims. Aim 1 is to characterize the protein and RNA binding partners of FBLL1 that it may use to function in
neurons. Aim 2 is to determine the role of FBLL1 in regulation of rRNA 2’O methylation and effects on ribosome
function. We will examine how translational changes induced by FBLL1 promote gene expression needed for
neurogenesis. This work may reveal an enzyme that creates cell type-specific rRNA modifications to fine tune
translation in neuronal development."

The objective of this proposal is to provide financial support for the inaugural ""Vasoregulation: Signaling and
Multicellular Inputs"" FASEB Scientific Research Conference (SRC) scheduled for August 4-8, 2024, at the Loews
Ventana Canyon Resort in Tucson, Arizona, USA. The conference focuses on vasoregulation, the physiological
process responsible for regulating the diameter of small muscular arteries and arterioles to maintain optimal
blood flow and blood pressure. Dysfunctional vasoregulation is associated with numerous cardiovascular
disorders, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, small vessel diseases, and other pathologies. Discovering
important physiological and pathological elements of essential vasoregulatory processes will significantly
contribute to our understanding of cardiovascular health and disease. Derived from the successful Smooth
Muscle FASEB SRC series held triennially from 1982 to 2019, the 2024 Vasoregulation conference
acknowledges the evolving research landscape emphasizing the roles of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes,
neurons, and other factors in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle contractility. Our new name and format
reflect this shift, encompassing intercellular regulatory mechanisms alongside smooth muscle functionality. The
conference promotes inclusive engagement, encouraging participation from diverse disciplines such as genetics,
neuroscience, and biophysics, enriching intellectual discourse and scholarly exchange. The event will be a
pivotal platform for disseminating cutting-edge research findings, fostering mentorship initiatives, and cultivating
collaborative networks within the vascular regulation community. The meeting will be co-organized by Dr.
Jonathan Jaggar, Dr. Scott Earley, and Dr. Madeline Nieves-Cintron. Dr. Anne Joutel, renowned for discovering
the molecular basis of a common genetic form of cerebral small vessel disease, will deliver the keynote lecture.
The conference will include eight thematic platform sessions, two poster sessions, and two crucial career
development activities aimed at early-stage investigators. The scientific sessions prioritize diversity, with 44.2%
women, 32.6% underrepresented minorities, and 25.6% early-stage investigators among the 43 invited
speakers. Short talks selected from abstracts submitted by early-stage researchers contribute to a balanced
blend of established experts and promising investigators, representing a global cross-section from North
America, Europe, and the UK. This medium-sized conference (~100 attendees) emphasizes informal
discussions during various activities to encourage collaboration, particularly among early-stage scientists. To
ensure broad participation, the organizers aim to subsidize registration and travel costs for trainees and early-
stage investigators, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, using support provided by NIH/NHLBI."

10999370,"Dissecting divergent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ontogeny during development
Project Abstract
 1 The hematopoietic and immune landscape is complex. The diversity is generated and sustained by the function
 2 of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells that arise independently during embryonic development.
 3 HSCs are characterized by their robust, lifelong self-renewal ability and differentiation multipotency, while HSC-
 4 independent progenitor capacities and lifespans are more limited. HSC and HSC-independent derived progeny
 5 can have distinctive functions with defects in the cells resulting in different disease states. Their important and
 6 unique properties are inherent and programmed during ontogeny. Currently, the functional differences between
 7 HSCs and HSC-independent progenitors are largely dissected with assays that require the removal of cells from
8 their native microenvironment, with the measured differentiation outputs reflecting potential but not true
 9 endogenous functionality. Several studies have revealed discrepancies between native and transplantation-
10 based assessments of HSPC function, underscoring the critical importance of examining a cell’s function within
11 its native environment. We have developed several tools in zebrafish that discriminate HSC and HSC-
12 independent progenitor functions within their endogenous embryonic/larval environments to fill this knowledge
13 gap. We are now positioned to deploy the advantages of the zebrafish model to identify regulators influencing
14 the formation and function of different HSC/HSC-independent progenitor subsets. In Aim 1, we will test the
15 hypothesis that there could be unexpected connections among hematopoietic and immune cells and unrealized
16 differentiation potentials of HSC/HSC-independent progenitors. We will use approaches that allow visualization
17 and transcriptional characterization of HSCs, HSC-independent progenitors, and their progeny throughout the
18 entire organism. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that functional differences between HSCs, HSC-
19 independent progenitors arise from their distinct spatiotemporal origins and via distinct genetic regulation. We
20 will utilize temporal and spatial lineage tracing, whole mount in situ hybridization, in vivo genetic screening, and
21 our new native hematopoiesis functional assays to uncover the when, where, and how uniquely controlling the
22 embryonic generation of HSCs, but not progenitors. In this project, we will address many unresolved questions
23 related to HSC and HSC-independent progenitors arising during development including the differentiation
24 repertoire of their progeny, the connections among lymphoid and myeloid immune effectors found throughout
25 the organism, and the programs underlying the formation and functions of the diverse stem and progenitors
26 arising embryonically. This work will provide fundamental knowledge on the early establishment of hematopoietic
27 and immune hierarchies relevant to understanding immune disorders and for the directed production of HSC and

10976195,"Summary: Asthma is a common chronic airway disease that affects 21 million adults in the US with substantial
morbidity and healthcare costs. Black and Latinx adults bear a disproportionate share of that burden of
disease, partly due to an inequitable distribution of social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH have 5
components: 1. economic stability, 2. education access and quality, 3. health care access and quality, 4.
neighborhood and built environment and 5. social and community context. Attempts to improve asthma
outcomes in these populations have mostly been unsuccessful partially because the relationship between
SDOH and in Black and Latinx adults with asthma is insufficiently understood. These groups have been vastly
underrepresented in research intended to mitigate health disparities, limiting the ability to disentangle the
complex relationship that these racial and ethnic groups have with SDOH in the US. The few studies that did
so were conducted in children, had limited, retrospective, or cross-sectional asthma outcomes data, or
unidimensional SDOH data. Addressing this knowledge gap is critical to the implementation of high-yield policy
and interventions that will reduce the burden of disease for these vulnerable populations. In a large pragmatic
randomized controlled trial (the PREPARE study), our group collected extensive demographic, clinical, and
phenotypic data in addition to prospective asthma morbidity outcome data through monthly surveys. We
successfully showed that a ‘Patient-Activated, Reliever-Triggered Inhaled CorticoSteroid’ (‘PARTICS’) strategy
plus usual care reduced asthma exacerbations in 1,201 Black and Latinx adults with moderate-severe asthma
vs. usual care alone. We also showed that low socioeconomic status (SES) associates with worse asthma
morbidity using a multidimensional SES latent variable (defined by poverty, low educational attainment, and
unemployment), structural equation modeling and mediation analysis on retrospective baseline data among
Black and Latinx PREPARE participants. We also found that Caribbean Latinx adults experience greater
asthma morbidity vs. other Latinx subgroups, supporting our overall hypothesis that a distinct set of SDOH
exposures (an SDOH exposome) within racial or ethnic groups may impact asthma outcomes. The richness of
our PREPARE dataset, enhanced with our ability to analyze geocoded data on all 5 SDOH components,
uniquely enables us to address these Specific Aims: Aim 1a: To determine whether Black vs. Latinx adults
with moderate-severe asthma have unique SDOH exposomes that distinctly associate with worse asthma
morbidity. Aim 1b: To determine whether African American vs. non-African American Black adults experience
greater asthma morbidity. Aim 2: To determine baseline SDOH exposomes and clinical characteristics that
predict optimal PARTICS responders. Results from this R21 award may identify unique SDOH exposomes for
Black and Latinx adults that lead to high-yield interventions, plus facilitate our work implementing the PARTICS
strategy, both of which may reduce morbidity in these highly impacted populations."
10976089,"Abstract
Acute respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating disorder with a high mortality. Prior studies have
focused mainly on its hyper-inflammatory state and yet anti-inflammatories for ARDS have not shown benefit.
Mounting data suggest that immune suppression partakes in this disorder, the molecular mechanisms of which
remain unclear. This application investigates a unique molecular model whereby we discovered an
immunosuppressive protein called Fbxo24, that disposes of a key transcriptional protein, called ELF2, that is
indispensable for critical cytoprotective functions of epithelia including innate immune function and preservation
of cell proliferative activity. By targeting the C-terminal molecular signature present in Fbxo24, we designed,
synthesized, and tested a novel small molecule Fbxo24 antagonist that restores ELF2 levels and innate immune
responses in ARDS models. Our hypothesis is that Fbxo24, in part, mediates immunosuppression in
experimental ARDS through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ELF2, a protein essential for host
epithelial cell innate immune and reparative responses. Hence, in this application we will first elucidate if
Fbxo24 targets ELF2 for its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in experimental ARDS (Aim 1). We will specifically
elucidate the biologic relevance of reduced Fbxo24 levels in preclinical models of ARDS as an immune
suppressor using gene transfer in our Fbxo24 knockout mice and the mechanisms by which Fbxo24 mediates
ELF2 ubiquitination and degradation in a site-specific manner. Next, we will optimize the pharmacologic design
and test a novel small molecule that exhibits distinct, and yet complementary cytoprotective and innate immune
properties in ARDS models (Aim 2). We will employ complementary murine and 2-hit models of immune
suppression and an ex vivo isolated human lung system. These studies will provide a new pathobiologic model
of epithelial injury that will serve as a platform for generating small molecule modulators that optimize cellular
repair and modulate immunity in subjects with severe critical illness."
10976090,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a pediatric malignancy, which carries adverse prognosis in its metastatic form. Bone
metastases, although less common, associate with the worst clinical outcome. Yet, this form of the disease
remains understudied due to challenges in its modeling. Recently, we have shown that ES bone metastases are
triggered by severe hypoxia in primary tumors, which leads to the formation of polyploid cells, the progeny of
which, hereafter named HYP-4n cells, have a high propensity for bone metastasis. However, the mechanisms
underlying the ability of HYP-4n cells to colonize the bone remain unknown. This type of scientific question can
be addressed by functional genomics approaches, such as CRISPR screens. Yet again, such assays are challenging
in the setting of bone metastasis in vivo, due to the low number of osseous lesions developing in animal models
and their clonal nature. On the other hand, most of the existing in vitro models fail to faithfully recapitulate
heterocellular interactions occurring in the bone environment. Thus, we propose the 3D bicellular microfluidic
platform (3D-BMP), which mimics the conditions ES cell encounter during osseous dissemination, as a
research tool that will enable high-throughput genomic screens on bone metastasis. 3D-BMP consists of a
bioengineered microvessel covered with endothelial cells and embedded in the bone-mimicking matrix with
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. It allows for control of important parameters of the bone environment, i.e. matrix
stiffness, hydrostatic pressure and oxygen tension. As such, it enables testing for rapid structural and functional
changes occurring in the bone during the metastatic process and simultaneous analysis of multiple invading
colonies, both of which are not achievable in animal models. The goal of our project is to test the utility of 3D-
BMP in studies on the biology of ES bone metastasis, including large scale genomic assays. To this end, we will
use HYP-4n cells, with high propensity for bone metastasis, and their diploid counterparts derived from the same
ES cell lines cultured in normoxia (NOR-2n), which do not metastasize to bone, to optimize the experimental
conditions in the 3D-BMP to best reflect their differences in metastatic properties and test their interactions with
the bone environment (Aim 1). This model will be used to perform a focused CRISPRi drop-out assay targeting
genes the most highly upregulated in HYP-4n cells to select candidate molecules crucial for dissemination to the
bone tissues and survival in this environment (Aim 2). The selected targets will be first validated via 3D-BMP
and then tested in vivo, using an orthotopic xenograft model, to provide evidence for the biological relevance of
our platform. The proposed study will: 1) validate 3D-BMP as a model recapitulating key steps of osseous spread;
2) test the experimental pipeline involving CRISPR screen in 3D-BMP followed by in vivo validation as a research
tool for the identification of drivers of bone metastasis; and 3) pioneer research on the mechanisms of ES osseous
spread. In the future, our experimental setting can be used to study different aspects of bone metastasis biology
in ES and other tumors, as modeling this process in vivo remains a challenge in many cancers."

Kinase inhibitors targeting the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs) are being
developed to sensitize tumors to clastogenic (chromosomal-breaking) agents, such as radiotherapy. The
DNAPKcs kinase inhibitor M3814 (EMD Serono) is in clinical trials, and other new potent inhibitors have been
reported. Elucidating the role of DNAPKcs in the repair of chromosomal breaks is significant because it will
enable the identification of the contexts (e.g. tumor genetic background and treatment regimens) in which
DNAPKcs kinase inhibitors are most effective, and thereby develop biomarkers to predict tumor response.
DNAPKcs has long been recognized as important for promoting radioresistance, and is implicated in the
canonical non-homologous end joining pathway (C-NHEJ), but nonetheless its role in chromosomal break
repair has remained elusive. The goals of the parent grant, and the project in this supplement application, are
to define the role of DNAPKcs in chromosomal DSB repair and clastogen resistance, and thereby support
development of DNAPKcs as a cancer therapeutic target. To this end, our laboratory recently identified a
specific hallmark of C-NHEJ. Namely, we reported that several C-NHEJ factors (i.e. XLF, KU70, and XRCC4)
are required for EJ between blunt-ended DSBs (induced by the Cas9 nuclease) that are joined without causing
insertion/deletion mutations (indels), i.e. for accurate/No Indel EJ. We have been using this hallmark of C-
NHEJ to define the role of DNAPKcs in this process. Regarding the specific project for this supplement
application, the candidate for this application, Ms. Kaela Makins, has found that the factor RIF1 is particularly
important for No Indel EJ in cells treated with a DNAPKcs kinase inhibitor. She will develop these preliminary
findings to 1) test the hypothesis that RIF1 and DNAPKcs synergistically promote No Indel EJ, which includes
development of a RIF1 knockout (KO) human cell line to test this hypothesis, 2) test the genetic interplay
between RIF1 and DNAPKcs for radioresistance, 3) test for effects of RIF1 on DNAPKcs autophosphorylation,
4) examine the interplay of RIF1 and DNAPKcs using double-knockout cell lines, and 5) develop a genetic
complementation assay for RIF1. Her training plan is to develop 1) key research design and experimental
skills, 2) manuscript and grant writing skills, 3) presentation and networking skills, 4) mentoring skills, and 5)
a breadth of knowledge in Cancer Biology. Altogether, this supplement to enhance diversity in health-related
research will further the goals of the parent grant to define the contexts that influence the role of DNAPKcs in
chromosomal break repair and clastogen response, as well as provide comprehensive training for the
candidate Ms. Kaela Makins to develop into an independent and impactful cancer researcher."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of aggressive and highly heterogeneous malignancies with poor overall
survival. Despite advances in identification of molecular prognostic factors, it remains challenging to predict or
tailor optimal individualized treatment options. We recently reported the application of a state-transition model to
view AML initiation and progression as trajectories of the transcriptome in an AML state-space characterized by
a leukemogenic potential. We successfully constructed a health-to-leukemia transcriptome state-space using
time-sequential RNA-seq data collected from a murine genetic model of AML driven by the CBFB-MYH11 (CM)
leukemogenic fusion gene that is created by inv(16)(p13.1q22), a cytogenetic/molecular subtype accounting for
approximately 8-10% of AML patients. Analysis of transcriptome trajectories in the leukemogenic potential
allowed us to mathematically identify state-transition critical points associated with key leukemogenic events and
to accurately predict disease development and outcome. We now propose to utilize the transcriptome movement
in the leukemia potential as a dynamic biomarker that can be used to design adaptive treatment approaches to
overcome treatment resistance and identify new therapeutic approaches. We have recently developed a
microRNA-126 inhibitor (miRisten) which effectively inhibits a highly treatment resistant leukemia stem cell
population in several leukemia models. Our preliminary time-series RNA-seq data pre- and post-chemotherapy
show that the transcriptome trajectory can accurately predict therapy response in murine models of AML. The
central hypothesis and theoretical concept of this proposal is that the dynamics of the transcriptome and the
leukemia potential can be used to predict therapy response and guide optimization of adaptive therapeutic
approaches to mitigate treatment resistance. Specifically, we will model the transcriptome dynamics following
treatment with anti-leukemia therapies, estimate state-transition critical points, and therapeutic force to optimize
therapy dose and combinations. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Quantify leukemia potential
dynamics driven by different oncogenic signals in murine models. Aim 2. Evaluate the effects of treatment on
the leukemia potential to design and test adaptive therapies in murine AML models. Aim 3. Construct a human
AML transcriptome state-space to identify opportunities for adaptive treatment approaches. Impact. Through
integration of experimental and clinical data, this work will accelerate the implementation of personalized therapy,
inform future clinical trial designs, and improve outcomes of AML patients."

There has been increasing emphasis on understanding the social-contextual factors that contribute to risk of
Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD). Although immigrants represent a growing, and aging, share
of the US population, the state of the science on dementia among immigrants is limited. The few studies
published show immigrant status and lower levels of acculturation (a process of adaptation to US social and
behavioral norms) to be associated with a higher prevalence of dementia and more cognitive decline. These
findings are intriguing as they appear to be at odds with the much larger body of evidence that shows immigrant
status and less acculturation to be associated with better health outcomes for obesity, hypertension, diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease (CVD), clinical precursors of dementia. However the measurement of acculturation
has been limited by the use of simplistic, cross-sectional, and individual-level proxy measures to characterize
what is an otherwise complicated process that evolves over the life-course, and is influenced by both individual-
level and contextual factors. The proposed study addresses this challenge by adapting a segmented assimilation
framework, and applying a life-course approach, to consider how immigrants' trajectories of integration can differ,
and are influenced by the interplay of multi-level factors to influence biological aging. We propose to leverage
comprehensive, longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and its associated
ancillary studies, MESA Neighborhood and MESA MIND, to identify unique life-course acculturation patterns,
based on individual- and neighborhood-level longitudinal data, and evaluate associations with cognition,
AD/ADRD biomarkers, and dementia in a population-based sample of diverse, older adults. We hypothesize that
individuals with acculturation trajectories characterized by factors such as improvements in socioeconomic status
over time, older age at migration, increasing English proficiency, and residence in supportive neighborhoods
(e.g. high walkability, high social cohesion), which remain stable or improve over time, will experience less
cognitive decline and dementia. With over 20 years of follow-up and extensive cognitive measures (including
fMRI), MESA is the ideal cohort to address major gaps in research on immigrants and dementia. We will attain
our main objective by characterizing longitudinal, life-course acculturation trajectories (Aim 1); and examining
associations of life-course acculturation trajectories with cognition and clinically-relevant ADRD outcomes (Aim
2). The proposed work brings together two large and powerful datasets (MESA Neighborhood and MESA MIND),
and lays the foundation for future projects to investigate the social, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms
underlying the patterns we observe. Through this, our goal is to contextualize the experience of immigrants to
promote supportive policies and environments for stemming cognitive decline and dementia."
10991541,"Mutations on the LRRK2 gene, which increase the encoded protein's kinase activity, are common genetic causes
of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Noncoding variants at the LRRK2 locus have also been linked to an
increased risk of sporadic PD. Thus, LRRK2 is a promising therapeutic target in familial and sporadic PD. While
small molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials, the precise pathological
mechanisms of LRRK2 mutations remain unknown. Several studies have supported the idea of non-cell
autonomous mechanisms leading to DA neuron death, a pathological PD hallmark. We observed elevated
astrogliosis in the caudate/putamen of postmortem LRRK2G2019S carriers and LRRK2G2019S knockin mice.
Together with a well-accepted role of LRRK2 in synapse and inflammation, this suggests that aberrant LRRK2
kinase activity increases the inflammatory burden in the nigrostriatal synapse by involving astrocytic activation.
A limited understanding of the astrocyte signaling pathways relevant to PD hampered progress in establishing
astrocyte dysfunction with PD pathophysiology. As our findings show a role of LRRK2 in the dopamine D2
receptor (D2R) signaling in the striatal astrocytes, the overarching goal of this study is to link astrocytic LRRK2-
mediated D2R signaling impairments to neuroinflammation in these mice representing prodromal PD. Overall,
we aim to explore if LRRK2-mediated striatal astrocyte D2R signaling perturbations exacerbate early synaptic
inflammatory processes that lead to PD.
We will utilize innovative genetic models and viral approaches to manipulate D2R signaling in identified
astrocytes, allowing us to dissect D2R signaling-mediated mechanisms with high specificity in a specific cell type
manner.
Aim 1 will mechanistically link impaired D2R signaling and inflammation in striatal LRRK2G2019S astrocytes.
In Aim 2, we will manipulate D2R signaling specific in striatal astrocytes and assess how this influences
inflammation, neurotoxicity, and behavior in vivo.
In light of the clinical testing of small molecule inhibitors against LRRK2 kinase and D2R agonists in the clinical
setting, our work is crucially placed to set the framework for developing disease-modifying strategies targeting
astrocyte dopamine signaling in the striatum."
10976915,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular drivers of Diffuse Midline Gliomas (DMGs)
including Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPGs), there are no viable treatment options resulting in certain
fatality of children with these brain tumors. The lack of understanding of pathogenesis of these pediatric brain
tumors is a significant barrier to developing effective treatments. More than 80% of DMGs bear a histone H3
mutation at lysine 27 to methionine (H3K27M). H3K27M causes global reduction in the repressive mark
H3K27me3, which is the preferred epigenetic state of these tumor cells. Our premise is based on reprograming
of cellular metabolism by oncogenes which is one of the fundamental mechanisms driving cancer cell survival
and growth. Our group has shown that H3K27M mutations drive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism to
enhance production of the metabolite α-ketoglutarate (αKG), a critical cofactor for the H3K27 histone lysine
demethylases. We have reported that αKG is required to maintain the preferred epigenetic state of H3K27
hypomethylation and interruption of this integrated pathway is potently therapeutic by increases H3K27me3 to
reverse the favored epigenetic state of H3K27M tumor cells. Our proposal is based on studies from a clinical
trial with the imipridone ONC201 in children with H3K27M DMGs at the University of Michigan. ONC201 shows
remarkable survival benefit with near doubling in overall survival in a subset of ONC201 treated H3K27M
DMGs. Our premise is also based on ONC201’s known effect to suppress mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation. Response to ONC201 in H3K27M DMGs was associated with suppression of key TCA cycle-
related genes. Moreover, ONC201 reversed the preferred H3K27 hypomethylated state by increasing global
and genomic H3K27me3 levels. These supporting data have led to hypothesize that ONC201 disrupts
integrated metabolic/ epigenetic pathways to reverse the preferred epigenetic state of H3K27M tumor cells.
Three specific aims address this hypothesis. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanisms by which ONC201
inhibits combined metabolic/ epigenetic pathways and interrogate downstream epigenetic alterations in
H3K27M tumor cells. Aim 2. Will understand the effect of hypoxic microenvironment on H3K27M cells and their
response to ONC201 treatment. Aim 3. Will delineate the mechanisms that govern intrinsic resistance to
ONC201 and elucidate the epigenetic state of ONC201 sensitive and resistant H3K27M DMGs, and begin to
define strategies to overcome ONC201 resistance. Our work is immediately translatable as it is based on our
ongoing clinical trial and will further our knowledge of mechanisms the govern response and resistance to
ONC201 to directly impact the treatment of children with lethal H3K27M DMGs."

Urinary stone disease (USD) is highly prevalent and contributes a substantial proportion of healthcare costs
related to kidney and urologic disease. Approximately half of children and adults suffer recurrent symptomatic
stone events, resulting in emergency department visits and surgery. More than a condition with episodic
occurrence of debilitating events, USD is a disorder of mineral metabolism with substantial morbidity, including
increased future risk of chronic kidney disease, fracture, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Despite the
high prevalence and burden of USD, advances in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of USD have
stalled due to deficiencies in available data resources. These critical gaps include lack of clinically important
information, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on single-center designs that segregate pediatric and adult
patients, and exclusion of key stakeholders in database design. To address this need, this proposal creates the
Urinary Stone Disease Hub (USDHub), a readily accessible research resource for the broad research community
that would support a wide range of impactful clinical investigation to improve the health of children and adults
with USD. USDHub will generated from 10 health systems in the United States that participate in STAR and
PEDSnet, two PCORnet clinical research networks that have standardized electronic health record data. We
will ensure that the content and structure of USDHub has value to the USD research community by including
stakeholders, including patients and caregivers. This work will include the following three Aims: First, we will
create a research cohort of >230,000 individuals across the lifespan with USD. We will link extant structured
data from the PCORnet common data model to 24-hour urine results and stone composition data. Second, we
will enrich USDHub with information extracted from CT images and clinical notes using natural language
processing and machine learning methods. Third, we will broadly disseminate USDHub to researchers using
sustainable data access model. We will partner the USD research community to user test and refine the data
access process. To maximize USDHub’s impact, we will provide pilot grants, clinics to orient researchers to
USDHub data, and partner with professional organizations to disseminate USDHub to the broader USD research
communities. The outcome of this work will be a new research ecosystem for investigators to generate impactful
real-world knowledge that will transform the way USD research is conducted and thereby improve care and
outcomes for the growing number of individuals living with the disease. This resource will spur and accelerate
hypothesis-testing research and lead to impactful and clinically meaningful discoveries that improve the health
of individuals and populations with USD across the lifespan."
10977990,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) often progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD) through
maladaptive repair. Hypoxia, present in both AKI and CKD, triggers a response mediated by the
oxygen sensing prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHD1-3), regulating Hypoxia-
Inducible-Factors (HIF). Despite the critical role of endothelial cells in responding to hypoxic injury,
the molecular mechanisms by which PHDs in these cells impact post-ischemic kidney repair
remain unclear. This knowledge gap is significant, given the pressing need for therapies
preventing AKI to CKD transition. Our recent studies on mice and humans revealed compartment-
specific differences in PHD isoform expression in the kidney vascular endothelium. Using genetic
approaches, we found that concurrent inactivation of endothelial PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3
promotes maladaptive kidney repair, leading to tissue injury, fibrosis, and inflammation. Single-
cell RNA-seq analysis showed endothelial hypoxic and glycolytic signatures, which were also
observed in severe human AKI. This metabolic program was coupled to upregulation of the
SLC16A3 gene encoding the lactate exporter monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). Strikingly,
treatment with the MCT4 inhibitor syrosingopine restored adaptive kidney repair and suppressed
EC-derived proinflammatory responses. Finally, among the three PHD isoforms, we identified
endothelial PHD3 as the critical isoform regulating post-ischemic kidney fibrosis. The goal of this
proposal is to build on these exciting discoveries and harness hypoxic signaling-dependent
mechanisms regulating endothelial cell glycolysis/MCT4 signaling to inhibit AKI to CKD transition.
Our central hypothesis is that endothelial PHD3 activity promotes adaptive kidney repair by
inhibiting endothelial pro-inflammatory responses through suppression of HIF-driven
glycolysis/MCT4 axis. We propose two Aims: (Aim 1) Inhibition of the endothelial MCT4 axis
promotes adaptive kidney repair following ischemic AKI by inducing favorable metabolic
reprogramming; (Aim 2) Endothelial PHD3 promotes adaptive kidney repair following ischemic
AKI by suppressing endothelial derived pro-inflammatory responses through HIF1. The proposed
research is innovative because it is the first to investigate the mechanistic basis and therapeutic
potential of endothelial hypoxic dependent glycolysis/MCT4 axis in post-ischemic kidney repair
using novel genetic models in conjunction with sophisticated transcriptomic and metabolic
approaches. Completion of this project will open new avenues of targeted therapeutic possibilities
to prevent AKI to CKD transition."
10978077,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 By single cell RNA sequencing we have identified multiple molecular states of fibroblasts that
emerge from normal alveolar fibroblasts in response to fibrogenic stimuli. Using lineage tracing with a
new line of mice we generated that specifically marks normal alveolar fibroblasts (Scube2-CreER), we
found that a subset marked by responses to inflammatory mediators (inflammatory fibroblasts) emerges
relatively early after injury in mice. ScRNA sequencing from lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis
suggest that inflammatory fibroblasts persist, even in the setting of advanced fibrosis. Computational
pseudo time analysis suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts give rise to fibrotic fibroblasts in both mice
and humans. We identified SAA3 as a highly expressed specific marker of murine inflammatory
fibroblasts and have generated a new murine line that allows us to mark, delete or genetically
manipulate inflammatory fibroblasts. We propose to use these mice, together with mice we have
generated to specifically target alveolar fibroblasts (Scube2-CreER) to determine the mechanisms that
lead to the emergence of inflammatory fibroblasts from alveolar fibroblasts and how these cells modulate
inflammatory responses and fibrosis. We will compare the timing of inflammatory fibroblastic emergence
and their persistence and fate in 2 different models of pulmonary fibrosis, induced by bleomycin or silica,
and in an inflammatory model, LPS, that we have found also induces inflammatory fibroblasts but does
not cause fibrosis (aim 1). We hypothesize that NF-kB signaling will be a critical driver of
inflammatory fibroblasts in all 3 models but that the upstream activators, specific inflammatory
genes induced and persistence of their induction will differ between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic
stimuli. We will then compare responses in all 3 models after we specifically delete inflammatory
fibroblasts or modulate their ability to respond to upstream inflammatory activators to determine the
functional role of these fibroblasts in driving fibrosis and the mechanisms underlying these effects. We
will delete TGFbR2 or the mechanical sensor, Piezo 2 from inflammatory fibroblasts to assess their role
in fate transition to fibrotic fibroblasts (aim 2). We hypothesize that in response to bleomycin and
silica (but not LPS) a subset of inflammatory fibroblasts will transition into fibrotic fibroblasts
through Piezo2-mediated responses to increased lung stiffness and TGF-b signaling, and that
this transition will be critical for the development of pulmonary fibrosis. We will utilize spatial
transcriptomics with single cell resolution (Xenium), immunohistochemistry and multi-color in situ
hybridization on tissue sections from normal and fibrotic human lungs to interrogate the relevance of
these findings to human pulmonary fibrosis. We expect that the insights gained from these studies could
lay the groundwork for developing novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."

 Mindfulness has been defined as accepting, open-minded attention to the present moment.
Mindfulness has been conceptualized as a trait (e.g., mindfulness disposition in everyday life) and a state (e.g.,
mindfulness in the moment). Greater trait mindfulness, as measured by self-report questionnaires like the
mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS) and the five-factor mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), is
associated with improved well-being and decreased psychopathology. The underlying brain bases, however, of
trait mindfulness or the state of mindfulness are as yet poorly understood. A promising research approach
is to correlate mindfulness trait measures with task-independent brain functions as measured by resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and to use cutting-edge fMRI methods to identify state
mindfulness.
 In our first aim, we aim to identify the most reliable brain network connections that predict trait
mindfulness, using three resting state datasets totaling more than 350 adults. We use connectome predictive
modelling, a data-driven machine learning approach that identifies whole-brain features that correlate with the
behavior of interest. In our second aim, we propose to examine state mindfulness independently in a sample of
100 high-rumination adolescents. We will look at fluctuations in brain networks over time using dynamic
functional connectivity methods. We will ask whether changes in behavior on a mindfulness-related task, as
well as responses to self-report experience prompts over three days, correlate with these dynamic functional
connectivity measures. Our hypothesis is that a state of attentional network anticorrelations (e.g. between the
default mode network and frontoparietal network) is associated with mindful attention. Lastly, we will assess
the relationship of the dynamic brain changes to rumination and other clinical symptoms in the adolescents.
This will shed light on brain-mechanistic links between mindfulness and decreased psychopathology.
 These conceptually related but independent aims may contribute to a shared understanding of
mindfulness, i.e., specific brain networks involved in predicting trait mindfulness may also be implicated in state
mindfulness. This research promises to deepen our understanding of mindfulness, paving the way for brain-
based insights into how it supports well-being."

 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impacts cognition and
memory, imposing a substantial burden on the aging population. While individuals generally need to display core
clinical and biological features to meet diagnostic criteria for AD, there is substantial variability among patients
regarding onset and the course of the disease. This poses significant challenges to early diagnosis of AD and
impedes the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Molecular subtyping of AD is of high importance
due to its potential to identify disease mechanisms and new therapeutic targets. Recent studies have uncovered
evidence indicating that molecular subgroups of AD display distinct disease characteristics aligning with key
clinical features. The identification of distinct AD subtypes has spurred research regarding their potential to be
identified using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, which holds promise for early detection. However,
progress towards this overarching goal has been impeded by studies lacking comprehensive data collected from
the same individuals. The goal of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the biological signatures that
distinguish subgroups of patients with AD. We will use state-of-the-art computational approaches to jointly
analyze multiple levels of data collected from the same individuals, encompassing a genetic, epigenetic, and
neuroimaging information, constituting an unprecedented cohort in which to investigate AD subtypes. The
proposed investigation will address the following gaps in the current scientific knowledge:
1) We will determine whether AD subtypes can be identified solely using neuroimaging-derived features.
To address this question, we will use using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict molecular
subtype of AD from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived phenotypes.
 2) AD is a multifaceted disorder in which epigenetic regulatory mechanisms play a crucial role. However,
prior studies on AD subtypes demonstrated limited or no integration of epigenetic information, thereby restricting
knowledge of variability between AD subtypes. To address this critical knowledge gap, we will integrate
epigenetic profiles previously associated with AD, encompassing expression levels of small non-coding RNAs
(miRNAs) and DNA methylation (DNAm) markers, to determine their contribution to AD subtypes. This multi-
omic approach has the potential to uncover new molecular signatures of distinct AD subgroups."

Mutations in the BRAF protein kinase are key drivers of melanoma, thyroid cancer, and colon cancer. Existing
drugs, like vemurafenib, that target the most common BRAF mutant (V600E) are initially effective in patients, but
clinical resistance invariably develops after a few months. V600E BRAF normally signals as a monomeric kinase,
which is readily inhibited by these first-generation drugs. Resistance to these drugs is mediated by BRAF
dimerization, which triggers a conformational change of the kinase from an “C-out to an “C-in” state and blocks
drug binding. New inhibitors have been developed to recognize the C-in state and thereby target BRAF dimers,
but these molecules exhibit a mysterious phenomenon called paradoxical activation in which they can increase
BRAF activity under some conditions, rather than inhibit it. Paradoxical activation is linked to induction of BRAF
dimers by inhibitors, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood, rendering it challenging to
design new inhibitors that avoid it.
 Using an integrated biophysical approach, we built a model for paradoxical activation that describes the
allosteric coupling between inhibitor binding and BRAF dimerization in quantitative thermodynamic terms. In our
approach, a dataset of FRET measurements that quantify inhibitor-driven BRAF dimerization are globally fit to
our dimerization model, yielding thermodynamic parameters that describe the allosteric coupling mechanisms
underlying drug-driven BRAF dimerization. Remarkably, the results show that inhibitor-driven dimerization is
asymmetrical, with the first drug binding event triggering dimerization strongly, and the second binding event
contributing little additional dimerization affinity. This model accurately predicts the shape of BRAF kinase
activation curves measured as a function of inhibitor concentration, demonstrating that it provides a realistic
physical framework for understanding paradoxical activation.
 We plan to use this approach to expand our understanding of paradoxical activation in RAF kinases. In Aim
1, we classify a large set of RAF inhibitors based on their allosteric coupling strengths and the conformation of
the C-helix they promote, unraveling the mechanistic connection between inhibitor binding, conformational
change, and BRAF dimerization. In Aim 2, we apply this approach to oncogenic mutations of BRAF to understand
how these mutations are coupled to inhibitor-driven dimerization and activation. In Aim 3, we extend our studies
to higher-order complexes of BRAF, including the scaffolding protein 14-3-3, which can either weaken or
enhance BRAF dimerization depending on the mode of interaction, and BRAF/CRAF heterodimers, which are
an important signaling species in cells with catalytically-inactive oncogenic BRAF mutations. Collectively this
work will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying paradoxical activation of RAF complexes and aid the
design of new inhibitors that avoid triggering paradoxical activation."

Age-related speech recognition difficulty and its association with poorer memory, increased fatigue, social
isolation, and cognitive decline are major public health concerns with the current aging population. Older adults
consistently show increased listening difficulties compared to younger adults, including poorer understanding
and memory for speech in noise. The long-term objective of this research is to investigate age-related brain
differences that affect (1) how quickly and (2) how much information is used during the perceptual recognition
of speech in noise. We will use a perceptual decision-making framework to characterize differences in the
speed of evidence accumulation and height of decision criteria, which can affect the accuracy and latency of
speech recognition. Older adults appear to accumulate evidence more slowly and use more cautious decision
criteria than younger adults. Brain imaging studies have linked evidence accumulation and decision criteria-
setting to distinct brain systems, which also decline with older age. However, the contribution of perceptual
decision-making to age-related listening difficulties is not yet known. The interrelated Aims 1-2 for the current
research will test the overarching hypothesis that age-related declines in perceptual decision-making
processes limit understanding and memory for speech in noise, commonly observed for older adults. The Aim
1 neuroimaging experiments manipulate how quickly evidence accumulates, to characterize the degree to
which older adults accumulate evidence more slowly than younger adults based on uncertain and noisy
sensory information. We predict that slower evidence accumulation measures are associated with poorer
understanding and delayed recognition memory for older adults compared to younger adults. Structural
diffusion imaging data will be collected for white matter tracts to determine whether declines in the connections
between brain regions are associated with slower evidence accumulation. The Aim 2 neuroimaging
experiments manipulate decision criteria, to characterize age-related differences in how much evidence is
collected in challenging listening conditions. Older adults often respond more slowly and cautiously in noisy
conditions compared to younger adults, regardless of task difficulty. Older adults also demonstrate poorer
memory for targets and better recognition of distractors than younger adults. We predict that decision criteria
variation will be associated with poorer understanding and memory for speech in noise. Structural gray matter
measures will be collected to examine neural declines accounting for age-related differences in decision
criteria, given that frontal brain regions linked to criteria show lower volume for many older adults. Perceptual
decision-making can explain differences in speech recognition performance outside of the neuroimaging
environment, so this research is a critical first step to developing measures to characterize an individual's
listening difficulties and guiding effective rehabilitation strategies."
10999371,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung diseases are a global public health problem with significant morbidity, inadequate therapies and a very
high burden to society. Of these, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is particularly challenging to treat as existing
therapeutics, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, only slow progression but do not reverse fibrosis. One of the reasons
is in part due to the fact that the vascular endothelium represents a key barrier to effective delivery of anti-fibrotic
drugs into lung tissue. Current systemic lung therapies rely on passive transvascular transport to move circulating
drugs from the bloodstream and into the target tissue. Hoverer, only minute fractions of the injected doses
actually reach the lung tissue, diminishing efficacy and often necessitating dose escalation. The ideal goal is to
deliver the entire dose of therapeutic into the lung with the minimal exposure of other tissues. We attempt to
approach this ideal goal by pumping unique immunotherapeutics precisely into lung tissue to comprehensively
block activation and differentiation of MF, the key driver of profibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and
activation of survival cascades, leading to progressive scarring. The goal of this project is to develop and test
novel lung precision drug delivery system (LPDDS) targeting endothelial cells caveolae that are actively and
specifically pump myofibroblasts (MF)-directed antifibrotics into lungs at microdoses after intravenous (iv)
injection. We have identified the cell surface protein Thy-1 a precision therapeutic and a major modulator of MF
activation and differentiation and characterized its role in resolving fibrosis via synergistic engagement of multiple
profibrotic signaling pathways. Based on this, we engineered the first “dual precision” bispecific therapeutic
mAPP:Thy-1 with antibody mediating precise binding/delivery to and penetration of lung tissue via caveolae
transcytosis and the other – mediating Thy-1’s fibrosis-resolving activity in the lung interstitium where the loss of
Thy-1 promotes a dysregulated MF phenotype driving fibrosis. To further potentiate antifibrotic effect, we
designed mAPP:FAP-Nintedanib immunoconjugates, where concerted action of Thy-1 and Nintedanib in the
lung parenchyma has even greater power to concentrate their fibrosis-resolving activities at the site of action,
potentially reversing fibrosis. Our goal is to explore transendothelial pumping via caveolae to improve therapy of
lung diseases at various stages from very early inflammatory to fibrotic. We will optimize lung targeting of our
LPDDS through engineering and chemistry and will study their specific lung delivery, penetration, accumulation,
and therapeutic impact using multiple imaging techniques (SPECT-CT, IVM, EM, and IHC). Therapeutic effects
will be determined in two rat models that can reproduce many pathological hallmarks of inflammatory and fibrotic
disease stages. Our specific aims are 1) to generate and test in vitro activity of caveolae- and myofibroblast-
targeting therapeutics, 2) to assess the lung targeting, imaging and tissue processing of caveolae- and
myofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in rodent models of fibrosis, and 3) to test the therapeutic efficacy of
caveolae/myofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in lung fibrosis. This work sets a foundation for caveolae-targeted
therapies and could begin a paradigm shift from passive to active delivery for many pulmonary diseases."
11000739,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and recording
available to researchers. As a result, progress towards bioelectronic clinical therapies is hampered by the
significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles faced by researchers to gain access to the few commercial
implantable neuromodulation technologies for early clinical studies. The few clinical closed-loop implantable
neuromodulation systems presently available are not suitable for the many bioelectronic medicine applications
envisioned, as they lack key functional modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, most use closed
architectures (e.g., the use of custom ASICs instead of commercial over-the-shelf components) and proprietary
software, limiting the ability to adapt such systems for different clinical indications.
 To address these shortcomings, the overall objective of this HORNET Center for Autonomic Nerve Recording
and Stimulation Systems (CARSS) is to develop and disseminate a fully open-architecture and open-source
implantable system for autonomic nerve stimulation and end-organ sensing. In this administrative supplement,
we will perform short-term and long-term validation of the CARSS system functionality in small and large animals
for three intended use cases: bladder control, hypoglycemia, and unidirectional nerve block. The CARSS system
includes an external charger and controller, implantable pulse generator, and an assortment of implantable leads
for nerve stimulation and end-organ sensing. The use of sacral anterior root stimulation for treating neurogenic
bladder dysfunction and the use of vagus nerve stimulation for treating hypoglycemia were selected based on
potential clinical indications that are of interest to the NIH SPARC program. Validation of the synchronized low-
frequency alternating current block was selected, as unidirectional activation of the vagus nerve can be applied
for several bioelectronic medicine indications, such as hyperglycemia, chronic inflammatory diseases, and heart
failure."
10990153,"Abstract/Summary of my R35 Program
 This R35 Research Program proposal will use electrophysiological, molecular, and structural approaches to
probe multiple aspects of excitatory synaptic function that are relevant for neurological disease. We will focus on
the elucidation and modulation of the functional properties of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. We will take
advantage of coincident advances in cryoEM, genetics, robotics, and receptor biology to address questions that
were previously inaccessible. Four approaches will address critical gaps in our understanding of synaptic
function and provide therapeutically-relevant insight into neurological disease.
 First, we will explore the functional and clinical implications of regional intolerance for variation in the healthy
population as well as de novo disease-associated glutamate receptor mutations, most commonly found in
GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2D genes that are among the least tolerant in the genome. We will establish
the relationship in healthy individuals between allelic frequency and functional changes, which is necessary in
order to understand the role of SNPs in these genes as disease risk factors. Evaluation of these rare variants
will also provide opportunities for precision medicine, and advance our understanding of receptor function.
 Second, we will develop novel compounds for proof-of-concept studies to identify new therapeutic strategies
for neurological disorders. We will synthesize subunit-selective modulators of agonist potency and channel open
probability to assess the roles of understudied NMDA receptor subunits (e.g. GluN2C, GluN2D) in circuits in
cortex, thalamus, and striatum. We will determine the site and mechanism of action of modulators of NMDA
receptors, and use medicinal chemistry to improve brain penetration, potency, and solubility in collaboration with
Dennis Liotta in Chemistry at Emory. We will use the pharmacological tools that we develop to gain insight into
the treatment of epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.
 Third, we explore biased modulators of NMDA receptors by developing the SAR of two classes of compounds
that alter ion channel selectivity. These compounds represent the first example whereby a pharmacological
agent can alter channel permeation properties, demonstrating that modulators can tune distinct functions of the
NMDA receptor. These compounds hold enormous potential as neuroprotectants that diminish cation flux without
side effects associated with receptor blockade, which we will evaluate in vivo in models of ischemia.
 Fourth, we will combine information obtained through genetic analysis of regional intolerance, mechanism of
allosteric modulation, and new advances in structural biology to advance our understanding of the mechanisms
that convert glutamate binding to channel opening. These experiments will focus on the shared regions of the
protein that control channel opening, which are the key sites of action of our allosteric modulators and common
sites for disease-associated human mutations. We will collaboratively perform cryoEM and crystallographic
studies to determine the binding site for modulators, as well as key features of channel structure and function."
10987151,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Effective drug treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may well be on the horizon. While the amyloid-tau-
neurodegeneration (A/T/N) signature is recommended for the diagnosis of AD, it is not definitive for clinical
expression. Recent advance in digital technology provides a potentially low-cost and scalable approach to
continuous cognitive assessment. Digital biomarkers will also make relevant, in real time, disease prevention
opportunities by monitoring and reporting changes in modifiable disease risk behaviors. The objective of our
proposal is to develop a digital cognitive health resource based on the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (BU ADRC). The project is built upon the success of our initial precision brain health platform
for continuous cognitive assessment. We will leverage the BU ADRC cohort and its extensive and on-going
collection of longitudinal vascular risk factors, AD PET, CSF and plasma biomarkers, adjudicated dementia
subtype diagnoses and other clinical data, cognitive measures obtained from traditional paper-pencil
neuropsychological tests and neuroanatomic regions of interest extracted from brain MRI scans. We will add to
this annual data collection effort concomitant collection of longitudinal digital cognitive phenotypes via digital
recorder, digital pen, and smartphone applications. Our project includes three specific aims: 1) Collect the
digital cognitive metrics (dCog) and characterize those at high AD risk (A/T/N positive; A/T/N+) compared to
those at low AD risk (A/T/N negative, A/T/N-); 2) Assess the relationship of dCog phenotypes with vascular risk
factors and neuroanatomic measures; and 3) Build machine learning models from dCog phenotypes in
isolation and in combination with vascular risk factors and brain imaging/blood-based biomarkers to predict
cognitive health. The outlined strategy will identify and validate novel digital cognitive biomarkers and provide
new avenues for better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AD."
10989049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the U.S. population ages, the number of people with Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative
diseases (NDDs) that cause dementia will grow. Emerging disease-modifying treatments are/will be designed
to address the specific biology of each form of dementia. They are likely to be most effective early in the
course of illness, increasing the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis. Specific identification of the
cause of cognitive impairment is routine in Neurology and Psychiatry, but exclusive reliance on this limited
workforce for assessment of cognitive and behavioral changes will result in treatment delays with meaningful
clinical impact, particularly for medically underserved communities that face obstacles in accessing specialists.
Early evaluation in the primary care (PC) setting can reduce delays, but PC practitioners (PCPs) identify time
and a lack of confidence as barriers preventing them from assessing cognitive and behavioral complaints.
Biomarkers can facilitate the identification of NDD, but expert guidelines stress that they must be paired with
clinical findings to guide diagnosis. In addition, the available biomarkers only address some of the entities that
cause NDD. The goal of this project is to support more thorough assessment of cognitive and behavioral
complaints in PC by supporting PCPs to use a comprehensive diagnostic toolkit developed by the California
Alzheimer’s Disease Centers. The toolkit includes a pre-visit questionnaire that can potentially shorten future
assessments if the sensitivity of the questions can be established. This project will demonstrate first that
assessment with this toolkit, in combination with regular expert-led case conferences, facilitates accurate
distinction by PC providers of mild cognitive impairment and dementia likely due to Alzheimer’s disease from
other, less typical NDD syndromes, and second, that the implementation of this approach is feasible and
acceptable to PCPs, patients, and families. We will implement the model in five CA PC practices that work with
medically underserved communities to facilitate the assessment of approximately 750 patients by at least 30
PC providers. Each participant will be re-evaluated at an expert center, where blood biomarkers of NDD will be
collected. We will support PC practitioners to provide a biomarker-informed diagnostic disclosure to each
patient. We will examine the accuracy of PCP diagnoses, using expert opinions and biomarkers as the gold
standard, and evaluate the feasibility of toolkit use in the practices through surveys, interviews, and focus
groups. To help address the sensitivity of pre-visit questions to atypical symptoms of NDD, we will also recruit
200 patients with atypical presentations at UCSF. Achievement of the project goals will establish an efficient
model for earlier, etiologically-specific diagnosis of cognitive and behavioral changes due to Alzheimer’s
disease and other NDDs."
10997917,"Project Summary
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic gammaherpesvirus with a biphasic lifecycle
associated with several diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). It is
primarily spread through saliva making the oral cavity a critical site for initial infection. KSHV encodes an
immediate early virion-associated tegument protein that is vital for efficient lytic reactivation and virus
production. Following up on a proteomics study of KSHV factors in uninfected cells, our coimmunoprecipitation
and imaging analysis in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells during lytic reactivation of KSHV demonstrated
that an immediate early protein of KSHV interacts with host transcription factors, FOXK1 and FOXK2. FOXK1
and FOXK2 belong to the Forkhead family of transcription factors. FOXK1 and FOXK2 are unique as they are
the only Forkhead proteins which carry a Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. FOXK proteins are ubiquitously
expressed and play a key role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, cancer development, and
autophagy regulation. Their role in KSHV infection is not well understood though. Preliminary data from this
proposal supports a pro-viral role for these host transcription factors during KSHV's lytic cycle. The purpose of
this project is to dissect the importance of the interaction between the immediate early KSHV tegument protein
and FOXK proteins and identify novel targets genome-wide of the immediate early KSHV tegument protein
during reactivation and de novo infection. A combination of genome-wide studies coupled with KSHV mutants
will be used to analyze how the FOXK and immediate early tegument proteins affects KSHV infection. In
summary, I predict that this novel host-pathogen interaction might be engaged by KSHV, in order to promote
its lytic cycle in the oral cavity and beyond, thus by understanding the mechanism, we could uncover future
therapeutic targets. The completion of this project will provide in-depth training in epigenetics, virology and
genomics approaches. These skills will be enhanced in the outstanding research environment provided by the
Oral Biology department at the University of Florida College of Dentistry."
10998266,"Abstract
Niemann-Pick disease type C is a childhood-onset, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease
characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous, but
typically include progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and early death. Niemann-Pick C is commonly (~95%
of cases) caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene, which encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein
required for exporting cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes. Most commonly, Niemann-Pick C
patients have an isoleucine to threonine missense mutation at position 1061 (I1061T NPC1). In fibroblasts from
these patients, we showed that I1061T NPC1 misfolds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is rapidly degraded
by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and by ER-autophagy (ER-phagy). Importantly, escape from these
pathways by genetic or pharmacologic manipulations enables I1061T NPC1 to reach the lysosome, where it is
still functional. As such, NPC1 protein homeostasis (proteostasis) pathways have emerged as prime targets for
therapeutic intervention. While modulators of these pathways have shown success in patient fibroblasts, thus far
they failed to improve neurological phenotypes when tested in vivo. Critically, the extent to which pathways
identified in fibroblasts also function in neurons, a critical disease target cell, is unknown. The overall objective
of this application is to determine the effectors mediating NPC1 folding, trafficking, and degradation in neurons.
Our central hypothesis is that cholesterol acts as a pharmacological chaperone to promote folding of NPC1 in
the ER, and that folding and trafficking of newly synthesized NPC1 to the lysosome are regulated by neuron-
specific pathways. To address this hypothesis, we will use inducible human stem cell-derived neurons (iNeurons)
with WT or I1061T NPC1 to measure NPC1 trafficking, function, and half-life after manipulation of cellular
cholesterol or use of therapeutic cholesterol analogs (Aim 1). We will also use iNeurons expressing fluorescently
tagged WT or I1061T NPC1 to find proteostasis regulators via a targeted CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen
of proteostasis-related genes (Aim 2). The rationale for this work is that characterizing the machinery that
regulates NPC1 folding and trafficking will deepen our mechanistic understanding of the NPC1 protein and
identify new targets for development of Niemann-Pick C disease therapeutics. This research plan will not only
deepen our understanding of neuronal NPC1 proteostasis but will provide learning opportunities that will further
my development during my doctoral training. Using the University of Michigan’s vast resources for scientific
investigation, I will gain new skills in live cell and high-content imaging, CRISPR-based techniques, and in written
and oral scientific communication. This new training will position me well for success as a post-doctoral trainee
and long-term as an independent investigator."

Dr. Janna Raphelson is a Pulmonary Critical Care fellow at UCSD and she is applying for this F32 grant to
further her development as an academic physician scientist. Throughout the time period of this award she
hopes to develop an expertise in heart/lung/sleep physiology that will be the foundation of her path to
independence as a clinician researcher. She will also pursue proficiency in biostatistical methods and trial
design through formal coursework and direct mentoring, and gain exposure to the field of control of breathing.
Her specific project for this period will focus on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with comorbid obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), referred to as overlap syndrome
(OVS). To our knowledge, no randomized trials have been performed in OVS leaving a major void regarding
how best to treat >1% of the adult US population. The proposed work is a mechanistic study to evaluate the
underlying mechanisms behind increased cardiovascular risk in patients with OVS compared to patients with
COPD or OSA alone. The central hypothesis is that poor outcomes in OVS vs. COPD or OSA alone are driven
by right and left heart remodeling which is more pronounced when exposed to both sustained and intermittent
hypoxia in OVS as determined by cardiac MRI imaging metrics. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that RV
remodeling (as measured by RV mass index, primary outcome) will be more elevated in patients with OVS
compared to patients with COPD or OSA alone. Given the high vascular risk among afflicted patients, the very
high population prevalence of disease, and the lack of current data, further mechanistic research is imperative.
Aim 2 will assess the ability of the BODE index, a commonly used clinical tool to predict mortality in COPD, to
predict cardiac changes as seen on cardiac MRI. Exercise capacity limitations (an important component of the
BODE index) have been linked to myocardial fibrosis and LV remodeling, thus in Aim 2 we hypothesize that
high BODE index scores will predict a greater degree of myocardial fibrosis (primary outcome) and increased
LV remodeling index (secondary outcome) by cardiac MRI in patients with COPD. This grant period will help
launch Janna’s academic career as she is highly focused and deeply committed to making a scientific impact
on patients afflicted with pulmonary and sleep related disease. She is working in a highly supportive
environment with a mentoring team with a proven track record, and she is passionate about her vision of
becoming a leading physician scientist running an NIH funded laboratory in the coming years."
10998590,"Age is the greatest risk factor for most causes of morbidity in developed nations. Research into the cellular and
molecular processes that underlie aging and age-related diseases is essential if significant improvements in
healthy aging are to be accomplished, including insights for clinical practice and for novel treatment development.
The Science Research Conference (SRC) “Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Brain Aging” is a partnership
between the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) and the American Aging
Association (AGE) and is designed to provide a forum for investigators to present and discuss the latest in brain
aging research. While both AGE and FASEB promote dissemination of biomedical research results, AGE works
specifically to promote research on the fundamental processes of biological aging with the goals of increasing
the functional life of humans, inform the public of progress in aging research, and expand knowledge of
biogerontology among medical professionals and the lay public. Along with disseminating cutting-edge research
on the mechanisms contributing to brain aging, additional goals of this FASEB/AGE SRC are to provide a venue
for career advancement for early investigators and trainees, and to foster growth of the neurobiology of aging
research community. This meeting is unique in that it focuses on the neurobiology of aging as distinct from being
focused on age-related neurodegenerative disease, includes diverse expertise on a host of emerging topics and
technologies in neurobiology, and includes key features of translational and human research, providing a
blueprint for new investigators to forge translational avenues.
We are requesting funds to support the “Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Brain Aging” SRC that will take
place on September 15-19, 2024, in Niagara Falls, New York. There are three specific aims. Aim 1: Bring
together thought leaders/researchers in the area of cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain aging to advance
the field and accelerate the pace of discovery; Aim 2: Foster career development in the field of neurobiology of
aging, supporting recruitment of new ideas and new innovation in this growing research discipline; and Aim 3:
Raise public awareness of and communicate the value of neurobiology of aging research to a broader audience.
To accomplish these aims, we have designed a program that features (i) new ideas and emerging leaders in
neurobiology, (ii) a breadth of topics spanning multiple disciplines that capture the state-of-the-art in neurobiology
of aging research, (iii) contributions from Early Career Investigators (ECI) (each session includes at least one
ECI and one trainee talk selected from abstracts), (iv) diversity among the invited and selected speakers, and
(v) specific outreach to underrepresented communities to enhance diversity at the conference. This unique
conference will serve as a critical venue for exchanging ideas, fostering new collaborations, and developing the
next generation of researchers. In addition, this meeting works towards the goal of translating knowledge into
therapeutic interventions that promote brain health even into advanced age."
10998786,"Project Summary/Abstract:
DNA in a cell nucleus is organized on multiple levels. The Cohesin complex organizes DNA into large loops
and domains. This level of organization is critical for normal chromosome structure and function. ESCO1 is an
acetyltransferase enzyme that regulates chromosome organization and gene expression by modifying
Cohesin. Acetylation of the SMC3 subunit of Cohesin by ESCO1 stabilizes Cohesin on DNA, promoting long
residence time. ESCO1 and Cohesin colocalize at the base of chromatin loops, but ESCO1 is driven to
chromatin through its highly basic and disordered N-terminal tail, independently of Cohesin. Interestingly,
ESCO1 is suggested to influence genome organization independent of Cohesin acetylation. The mechanism(s)
driving these Cohesin-independent functions is unclear. We have found that tethering multiple copies of
ESCO1 to a specific location in the nucleus results in gross local rearrangement of chromatin. Strikingly, this
Local Chromatin Rearrangement (LCR) occurs independently of ESCO1’s acetyltransferase activity and does
not occur through Cohesin. To determine what about ESCO1 was driving this LCR, we performed a small
screen of DNA binding proteins and showed that linker histone drove rearrangement in a manner similar to
ESCO1. This has led us to propose that ESCO1 has intrinsic linker histone-like activity. we will challenge this
model directly by defining the effect ESCO1 has on chromatin structure and function. We hypothesize that the
N-terminal tail of ESCO1 binds DNA to condense and rearrange chromatin, perhaps explaining ESCO1’s
Cohesin-independent functions. In these experiments, we will define the effect of the ESCO1 tail on chromatin
organization and function in cells (Aim 1) and measure the impact of the ESCO1-chromatin interaction on
chromatin structure in vitro (Aim 2). This work will fundamentally improve our understanding of DNA
organization in vertebrate systems."
10979569,"Cognitive fluctuations –termed “the Lewy Body Roller Coaster” by some families – are a debilitating symptom
of Lewy body disorders (LBD), an Alzheimer’s disease related disorder that includes Parkinson’s Disease
dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. These unpredictable cognitive changes often lead to the loss of
independence in patients that could otherwise function. They are characterized by dramatic changes in two key
domains: attention (ability to focus/think) and arousal (ability to stay alert/awake). Presence of fluctuations are
a key feature used to diagnose LBD. Despite this, a basic understanding of fluctuations is lacking.
Our long-term goal is to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for cognitive fluctuations in LBD
such that targeted, effective treatments can be developed. Animal models allow induction of pathology in
restricted brain circuits, providing the opportunity to address key basic and translational questions regarding
the origin of variability in attention and arousal. In this proposal, we will use injection of the fibrillar form of
alpha-synuclein, the protein associated with LBD, into one hub of the brainstem ascending arousal network
which is highly affected in patients with this disease. We will use mouse models to test the overarching
hypothesis that alpha-synuclein differentially impacts large projecting neurons in the brainstem that orchestrate
brain-wide networks necessary for attention and maintenance of arousal. In Aim 1 we will evaluate which cells
are vulnerable to pathology. We will focus on one brainstem region, the Locus Coeruleus, which shows
pathology in almost all patients with LBD. We will count cells and use live imaging to directly track changes in
axons from this arousal hub. Then, in Aim 2 and 3 we will determine how alpha-synuclein inclusions affect
arousal and attention, respectively. In Aim 2 we will evaluate arousal using continuous EEG in the context of
time-of-day, as well as after exposure to novelty in the home cage. In Aim 3, we will evaluate cognitive
variability using a repeatable timing-task combined with pupillometry and imaging at the single-cell level.
This proposal uses a combination of translatable non-invasive techniques (EEG, pupillometry) with powerful
laboratory methods able to probe individual neuronal activity. The findings will help us better explain findings
seen in human patients. Understanding the processes occurring during cognitive fluctuations is key to
eventually developing treatment targets, including non-invasive neuromodulation of abnormal neuronal activity
and pharmacological modulation of identified neuronal populations."
10979197,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Fear regulation is essential for optimal mental health. Maladaptive fear is a hallmark of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition afflicting 22% of combat veterans. Impaired functioning of infralimbic
(IL) prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to fear dysregulation in PTSD, however factors contributing to IL deficits
are unclear. Not all trauma-exposed individuals develop PTSD, suggesting that predisposition factors may
contribute to IL dysfunction and PTSD risk. Elucidating the nature of such factors will help identify novel
therapeutics. Growing evidence supports a strong association between severe asthma and PTSD. Mechanisms
and cellular substrates whereby severe asthma associated factors regulate PTSD-relevant fear and IL-PFC
deficits remain unknown. Using unique mouse paradigms of aeroallergen house dust mite (HDM)-driven
inflammation we observe: 1) compromised fear extinction only in mice with allergen-induced Th2/Th17
expansion, an effect dependent on IL-17A and IL-17RA signaling and accompanied by reduced neuronal
activation in the IL-PFC; 2) significant upregulation of microglial Il17ra expression in blood-brain-barrier
compromised subfornical organ (SFO) inTh2/Th17 mice (but not in SFO non-microglial cells or PFC microglia);
3) IL-17A-induced activation of SFO neurons, and, 4) direct SFO►IL projections that modulate parvalbumin
interneurons that regulate IL excitability and fear. Collectively these observations inform our hypothesis: IL-17A
engages microglial IL-17RA and SFO-to-IL projections to modulate IL excitability and fear. This hypothesis will
be tested in 2 aims. Aim 1 will determine if SFO►IL PFC projections regulate compromised fear extinction
and IL neuronal excitability in mice with HDM-induced mixed Th2/Th17 inflammation. Using a retroCre-
dependent chemogenetic strategy, we will inhibit or activate SFO►IL projections to assess effects on fear
extinction in mice with Th2 versus Th2/Th17 responses. AAV-ChR2 transduction of SFO neurons and patch-
clamp recordings in IL neurons will be undertaken. Aim 2 will determine if microglial IL-17RA signaling in the
SFO drives HDM-induced fear extinction deficits. Using SFO targeted cell-specific AAV-Cre in Il17rafl/fl mice,
we will assess the necessity of IL17RA signaling in HDM-induced extinction deficits. The transcriptional profile
of SFO-derived microglia and non-microglial cells will be generated for cell-type specific gene expression
signatures to identify DEGs and downstream signaling pathways in Th2/Th17 mice. Finally, the impact of IL-17A
on IL-projecting SFO neurons will be assessed using patch-clamp electrophysiology in slices of brains Th2/Th17
mice, +/- targeted microglial IL-17RA ablation, inhibition of previously identified modulators of SFO microglia-
neuron signaling and other transcriptomic-identified targets. Impact: Our studies will inform on how adaptive
immune mediators modulate brain function and behavior and identify novel risk factors and therapeutic targets
for fear-associated pathologies. Beyond asthma, our findings have implications for other conditions where IL-
17A is elevated in response to pulmonary pathologies (e.g. bacterial pneumonia, ARDS, COVID-19)."
10979364,"Periodontal disease (PD) is the sixth most prevalent health condition in the World. It leads to periodontal
tissue loss, tooth loss, and is linked to other high prevalence diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
and pulmonary infections. For these reasons, PD has been identified as a global public health issue and
represents a significant economic burden for the US, causing an estimated loss of $154.06B. Unfortunately, due
to the complexity of the periodontal anatomy, composed of bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament (PDL),
currently available periodontal therapies have limited regenerative efficacy. Given the ability of stem cells to
differentiate in various phenotypes, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) may be able to regenerate this
complex anatomical structure and may therefore represent the most promising therapeutic tool. However, the
lack of biological and molecular knowledge about the PDLSCs and the lack of strategies to harness them for
periodontal regeneration limit our ability to develop novel and more effective therapies.
 We found that expression of PRX1 (or PRRX1), a transcription factor highly expressed during limb and
craniofacial development, identifies a population of PDLSCs in the mouse periodontium (mouse PRX1-
expressing Periodontal Cells, hereafter mPRX1-PCs). These cells are required for and directly contribute to
periodontal regeneration. Now, using single cell RNA-sequencing we have identified the human homologs of the
mPRX1-PCs (hPRX1-PCs). These cells, located in the human periodontal ligament, present with a molecular
signature of stem cells, and are identified by highly specific surface markers.
 With these findings and with the final goal of developing more effective alternatives to the current
periodontal regeneration therapies, in this research project we aim at 1) identifying a specific set of cell surface
markers that allows for the isolation and full characterization of the hPRX1-PCs; 2) developing a novel harnessing
strategy that leverages on the PDLSCc to induce complete periodontal regeneration; and 3) augmenting the
stem cell potency of the PDLSCc to regenerate oversize periodontal defects.
 These studies may lead to the development of novel therapies that will endogenously stimulate periodontal
regeneration while circumventing the need for transplantation of biomaterials or osteogenic tissue."
10979573,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 The greatest unmet need in family caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLWD) is support for
these caregivers’ mental health. Family caregivers of PLWD express a desire for mental health support
and a need to learn strategies to cope better with the emotions and thoughts that arise from caregiving
situations and to balance care demands with other important aspects of life. Acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT) is an evidence-based transdiagnostic approach that can promote mental
health through acceptance and mindfulness processes and behavior change processes that support
living in alignment with values. Previous studies focused on in-person ACT programs, but internet-
delivered self-help ACT programs have the potential to increase caregivers’ access to mental health
support at low cost. The current study's objectives are to adapt and finalize our artificial intelligence (AI)-
enabled ACT app for family caregivers of PLWD and to test its feasibility, acceptability, and usability. The
proposed study will have two phases. The first phase aims to adapt our AI-enabled ACT web app
(WeACT) through collaboration with a community advisory board (Aim 1). The second phase aims to
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the WeACT app program for family caregivers of
PLWD as a small feasibility (Aim 2). This feasibility study will involve a convergent mixed-methods study
design (i.e., a one-group pretest–posttest design with a phenomenological approach). Twenty family
caregivers of PLWD will be recruited and asked to use the WeACT app in the manner determined in Aim
1. Feasibility and usage of the app will be assessed with the number of days and total minutes of
engagement with the app during the study period. Adherence to the app-based program will be
determined through the completion rates of ACT modules, evaluations, and ACT practice on the app in
the manner determined in Aim 1. Caregivers’ acceptability, perceived usability, and experiences in the
program will be explored using an individual interview and a usability scale. Preliminary data on
caregivers’ mental health outcomes and ACT processes will be collected using self-reported
questionnaires. We will refine and finalize the app based on the feedback from caregivers (Exploratory
Aim). This study will provide important guidance for further development of the WeACT app for future
larger-scale clinical trials to promote mental health in family caregivers of PLWD. Given the evidence that
the greatest unmet need among family caregivers of PLWD is support for mental health, the findings will
contribute to the timely development of an evidence-based, easily accessible mental health app."
10996025,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) and other non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars cause 100 million
infections per year worldwide, and treatment options are limited due to the general contraindication of
broad-spectrum antimicrobials which can exacerbate the inflammation in which Salmonella thrives. Therefore,
there is a need for alternative, targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate Salmonella infection and subsequent
disease. Natural resistance to STm infection is mediated in part by the commensal gut microbiota, the
consortium of trillions of microbes encompassing hundreds of individual species that exist in symbiosis with the
host. The gut microbiota contributes to colonization resistance against enteric pathogens like STm by forcing
the pathogen to compete for resources in order to establish infection; and, to overcome this barrier, STm
exploits aspects of host immunity in order to antagonize gut commensals and establish a niche within the
inflamed gut. While it is known that the outcome of this competition between STm and the gut microbiota is a
critical determinant of whether or not infection is established, the specific mechanisms employed by STm and
the gut microbiota respectively during this competition are only partially understood.
 To address this knowledge gap, herein I employ a combined approach that integrates quantitative
metagenomics (metaG), metatranscriptomics (metaT), and a novel sequencing modality, metatranslatomics,
(metaRS) to gain unprecedented mechanistic insights into microbial and host metabolism in the
STm-perturbed gut. In my preliminary work, application of functional community-level ribosome profiling
(metaRS) to STm infection in a resistant mouse model of salmonellosis (Nramp1+) revealed that STm shares a
metabolic profile with discrete members of the gut microbiota (e.g. Faecalibaculum rodentium) in vivo.
Combined with the observed loss of F. rodentium and other microbes sharing metabolic overlap with STm
post-infection, these data suggest their potential role as STm competitors. Furthermore, depletion of F.
rodentium also occurred concurrently with increased expression of the host antimicrobial lectin Reg3γ.
 Based on these findings, my central hypothesis is that elucidating microbial metabolism in the gut, in
conjunction with analysis of host responses will unveil new competitors and mechanisms of competition
between STm and the microbiota. In the first aim of this proposal, I will analyze bacterial metabolism to identify
potential STm competitors, and apply metaRS to predict competition and identify prebiotic substrates to guide
this competition in favor of the commensal microbiota. The proposal’s second aim will investigate the role of
host Reg3γ in facilitating clearance of STm competitors. Collectively, the expected outcomes of these studies
will provide insights concerning mechanisms governing microbial competition in the context of host responses
and inform the ultimate implementation of microbiota-directed therapies aimed at reducing STm colonization
and maintaining homeostasis."

Type 1 diabetes results from impaired central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. β-cell antigen-reactive T
cells escape negative selection in the thymus and regulation/deletion in the periphery. While the role and
therapeutic potential of professional antigen-presenting cells and regulatory T cells in maintaining peripheral
tolerance in type 1 diabetes is known, non-professional antigen presenting stromal cells residing in lymph nodes
remain understudied. For maintaining and therapeutically promoting peripheral tolerance to self-antigens such
as type 1 diabetes-relevant ones, these stromal cells present unique advantages over other antigen-presenting
cells due to their lower costimulatory to coinhibitory molecules ratio, which remains stable during inflammation
unlike activated professional antigen-presenting cells.
Our focus is on fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) which construct the lymph node stromal scaffold crucial for
lymph node expansion during immune responses. FRC presentation of artificial antigens to specific T cells in
lymph nodes lead to T cell deletion. Our studies showed that in the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type 1
diabetes, and in pancreatic lymph nodes from pancreatic organ donors with type 1 diabetes, the expression of
the autoantigen insulin, the relative frequency of FRCs, and the FRC reticular remodeling properties are
decreased. Thus, we hypothesize that peripheral expression and presentation of tissue-specific antigens by
FRCs to autoreactive T cells may contribute to peripheral tolerance. To test our hypothesis that lymph node
FRCs contribute to peripheral tolerance in type 1 diabetes, we have developed new mouse models to inhibit or
enhance the capability of lymph node FRCs to express and present self and type 1 diabetes-relevant antigens.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the impact of these modifications on autoimmunity.
Additionally, to test FRCs’ ability to target autoreactive T cells and reduce autoimmunity, we propose innovative
in vitro co-culture models with HLA-matched human cells in Aim 2. These studies are based on our preliminary
data using murine FRCs. We demonstrated that (i) we can engineer FRC reticula that recapitulate FRC reticula
organization and phenotype in lymph nodes, and (ii) genetically engineered FRC reticula to express and present
type 1 diabetes-relevant antigens promote specific T cell anergy and regulatory T cells induction and expansion
in vitro. Here, we will test the capability of human lymph node-derived FRCs to provide similar immunomodulatory
effects on HLA-matched human T cells leading to decreased cytotoxicity on primary and stem cell-derived HLA-
matched β-cells for translatability.
While the proposed studies are focused on the specific role and therapeutic application of lymph node FRCs in
autoimmunity, our innovative immunoengineering approaches can be applied to the study of other lymphoid and
mesenchymal stromal cells. The interdisciplinary nature of our MPI team positions us uniquely to conduct these
studies."

Mitochondrial diseases are common inherited metabolic diseases affecting an estimated 1 in 5,000 people. The
Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is the most prev-
alent mitochondrial disease; its cardinal symptom is stroke-like episodes (SLE). Vascular endothelial cell (EC)
dysfunction is believed to cause SLE in MELAS. Currently there are no effective therapies for SLE. Cell-derived
Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) constitute an important mechanism of intercellular communication, and lately have
been implicated in horizontal transfer of mitochondria. Perturbations in numbers and content of circulating En-
dothelial Cell-derived EVs (EC-EVs) have been reported in various cardiovascular disorders. In vitro studies
have demonstrated either detrimental or restorative effects of EC-EVs on recipient cells. We hypothesize that
the EV effects on target cells may be, at least in part, determined by the quality of their mitochondrial cargo.
Preliminary data showed a significant percentage of medium/large EC-EVs to contain mitochondria (mitoEVs);
mitoEVs from cytokine-treated ECs contain mostly depolarized mitochondria; and pretreatment of cytokine-
treated ECs with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant to result in mitoEVs with more polarized mitochondria.
Upon incubation with naïve ECs, EVs from cytokine-stimulated ECs (not from control ECs) upregulated inflam-
matory pathways. Our goal is to assess the contribution of mitoEVs in EC dysfunction, and the potential of
mitoEVs derived from healthy ECs to ameliorate the inflammatory MELAS EC phenotype. In Aim 1, we will
characterize the mitoEVs released from cytokine-stimulated ECs (including the quality/polarization of mitochon-
drial cargo), the mechanisms that lead to mitoEV production, and the EV paracrine effects. The role of mitochon-
drial cargo quality in EV paracrine effects will be assessed by either depolarizing the EV mitochondrial cargo,
depolarizing the mitochondria in source ECs, or pretreating cytokine-stimulated ECs with mitoprotective agents,
and, in either case, studying the EC-EV paracrine effects on target naïve ECs. By employing a MELAS iPSC-
derived iEC model (different levels of heteroplasmy) in Aim 2, we will characterize the mitoEVs released from
MELAS iECs, and the potential of mitochondrial transfer via EVs released from healthy iECs to improve function
and ameliorate the inflammatory phenotype of MELAS iECs with high levels of heteroplasmy. In Aim 3, we will
investigate the mitochondrial cargo quality in EC-EVs isolated from blood samples of MELAS patients and their
contribution to EC dysfunction ex vivo. Our study will bridge benchtop to clinical practice by applying our in vitro
findings on EV-mediated mitochondrial transfer towards understanding EC dysfunction and SLE pathogenesis,
potentially suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for MELAS patients. The proposed work will take place under
the supervision of co-sponsors Drs. Alevriadou, a vascular bioengineer (University at Buffalo-SUNY) and Kozicz,
an expert in stem cell models of mitochondrial diseases (Mayo Clinic). Training is tailored for development as a
physician-scientist in the field of clinical genetics, reflecting on the basic science research goals of the proposal."
10976201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
New disease modifying drugs, like lecanemab, if used equitably across populations disproportionately affected by
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), like African Americans (AAs), could potentially reduce AD outcome disparities. However, these
drugs are expensive, require costly clinician assessment and brain imaging to determine eligibility, and are administered
by intravenous infusion: these features can be challenging for patients of economically disadvantaged states like
Alabama. To understand how to deliver new drugs equitably in this state, there is an urgent need to understand: 1)
access to care challenges that contribute to the full cost of new drugs, i.e., cost that includes copayments for drugs,
specialist visits and imaging, travel and productivity losses of clinic-based treatment, etc; 2) perceived value of new
drugs, and 3) overall costs and benefits of new drugs, for AA and white AD patients. The objective of this project is to
address these knowledge gaps by conducting a mixed methods study and develop an economic analysis for estimating
long-term costs and benefits of AD new drugs for AA and white older adults in AL. In a R61 planning phase (Year 1), we
will conduct qualitative analyses to understand challenges of AD patients in 5 domains of access to care: Availability,
e.g., of specialists, infusion clinics, imaging; Accessibility i.e., how easy it is to reach such medical resources; Affordability
of drugs, specialist visits, imaging; Accommodation, i.e., how easy it is to use medical resources; and Acceptability, i.e.,
perceived benefits and side effects of new drugs, and preferences for treatment attributes including costs. These
analyses will inform framing of the economic analysis, i.e., defining the analysis perspectives and costs and benefits to
include under them. We will then develop a Markov model based on published models and set up data collection for its
inputs. In the R33 phase (Years 2-5), we will collect model inputs using a survey of 240 patients and/or caregivers
exposed to new (N = 80) and traditional AD drugs, and collecting medical records for 120 patients who had visits with
specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, or geriatricians). Other inputs will be collected from the literature and public
sources. We will obtain base case estimates of costs and benefits for AA and white AL populations, and run extensive
sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of results and the health equity impact of new drugs. This work will occur
under the guidance of a Patient&Caregiver and Provider Advisory Board (PPAB) to reflect the voice and relevant contexts
of patients, caregivers, and providers in our findings. The PPAB will also help us define hypothetical interventions to
enhance equity in new drug use, for which we will use the economic model to examine their cost-effectiveness. Lastly,
we will work with the PPAB to summarize results and develop recommendations for equitable delivery of new drugs in
AL to disseminate to academic and non-academic audiences, including provider, patient and caregiver groups, and other
stakeholders. In the supportive environment of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the proposed strong
community engagement, the investigative team of this project will shed some light on the costs and benefits of new AD
drugs for AA and white populations, and inform the equitable distribution of these drugs to positively impact diverse
populations suffering from AD in a disadvantaged US state."

10976522,"Abstract:
Cardiomyopathies, occurring in ~1:250 in the population, are disorders with primary impairment of heart muscle
structure and function. Approximately 40-50% of the major cardiomyopathy subtypes can be explained as
autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Variants causing large subsets of cardiomyopathy are present
in genes wherein truncating variants (TVs) are the most common variant class. In particular, MYBPC3TV are the
most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and DSPTV are the most common cause of
arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (ALVC). In prior work and preliminary data, we have clearly
shown loss of function to be the primary mechanism for both MYBPC3TV and DSPTV – thus, MYBPC3TV and
DSPTV can be considered prototypical causes of haploinsufficiency-associated cardiomyopathy. However,
despite knowledge of the genetic mechanisms for these conditions, precision medicine approaches are hindered
by the fact that marked variability in clinical severity occurs among patients of all genetic subtypes, likely in large
part due to genetic modifiers. Given the strong evidence of haploinsufficiency, noncoding variants that influence
the effective “dose” of the causal genes are highly likely to contribute to expressivity of cardiomyopathy for genes
such as MYBPC3 and DSP. We show that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cis regulatory elements (CREs)
of these genes are common in the population, and are associated with allelic imbalance. In addition to these
potential cis modifiers, recent genome wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered putative modifiers in
protein quality control pathways that could affect gene dose downstream of transcription, but the causative SNVs
and their potential additive effects have not been determined. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that
variation in CREs strongly impacts the severity of haploinsufficiency-associated cardiomyopathy by altering the
effective gene dose. In Aim 1, we will quantify gene-expression effects of all possible SNVs in the major CREs
of MYBPC3 and DSP. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we will perform
massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) with synthetic saturation mutagenesis of these CREs. We will also
determine causal SNVs in linkage disequilibrium with variants found on prior GWAS’s through MPRAs. We will
test for additive effects with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic data for patients with MYBPC3TV.
In Aim 2, we will test whether noncoding variants that disrupt highly conserved transcription factor binding sites
within the major CREs of each of MYBPC3 and DSP further reduce mRNA expression and exacerbate disease
when superimposed on MYBPC3TV and DSPTV iPSC-CM and mouse models. Taken together, this proposal will
generate noncoding regulatory maps covering >30,000 SNVs in the sequence space most likely to influence
gene expression of two major prototypes of haploinsufficiency-associated cardiomyopathy, while also
establishing concepts and analytical pipelines for broadly advancing precision medicine of cardiomyopathy."

Adolescence is the period of highest risk for the initiation and escalation of cannabis use and emergence of co-
morbid psychopathology, including depression and suicidal ideation (SI). Cross-sectional and prospective
studies have found that cannabis co-occurs with depression and SI at alarmingly high rates. However, these
distal associations do not explain how changes in cannabis use impact intensity and variability in depressive
symptoms and SI over shorter, clinically relevant periods of time (e.g., days, weeks, months), including during
intoxication and withdrawal. Understanding these proximal relationships will inform the mechanisms that
reinforce cannabis use in adolescents at high risk for depression and suicide, yield actionable information
about the specific moments during intoxication and withdrawal when a user will be at highest risk for increased
intensity and volatility of negative mood and SI, and guide clinical decision-making on the potential therapeutic
effect of sustained cannabis abstinence on depression and SI. We propose to conduct a 10-week, multi-
method, randomized study, and will recruit 200 school-based adolescents, ages 12-18 years, with daily or near
daily cannabis use, current depression, and past month SI. Participants will complete 2 weeks of real-time,
ambulatory smartphone monitoring (ecological momentary assessment; EMA) during baseline cannabis use to
quantify the temporal relationship between use and mood and SI, and the within-subject (e.g., concurrent other
substance use, social context of use) and between-subject (e.g., average severity of cannabis use, depression
and SI) factors that may moderate these linkages. To determine how depression and SI change across short-
and longer-term cannabis withdrawal, participants will then be randomized to 8 weeks of monitoring (CB-Mon)
or abstinence incentivized via contingency management (CB-Abst), and will complete a 1-week phase of EMA
at weeks 1 and 8 post-randomization. The overarching aims of this proposal are to test if negative mood and SI
are temporarily relieved and stabilized through acute cannabis use (i.e., cycle of negative reinforcement) and
to test if negative mood and SI decrease in overall (mean) levels and variability after cannabis wash-out. These
aims can be uniquely achieved using EMA via smartphones, which enables high-resolution, within-subjects
data collection, thus allowing for elucidation of the specific temporal relationships between cannabis
use/intoxication and withdrawal, and depressive symptoms and SI. This will improve on existing data due to its
high ecological validity, prospective reporting, and ability to collect dynamic, time-specific changes in the
periods immediately before, during, and after acute cannabis intoxication, as well as across the course of
withdrawal. Particularly with widespread cannabis legalization, which will likely bring greater drug availability
and enhanced societal acceptance, there is a great need to improve our understanding of whether, when, and
among whom cannabis use portends heightened risk for psychiatric illness, and depression and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors in particular."
10977780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Structural determinants of health are societal structures and macro-level policies that lead to key exposures,
such as racial discrimination and disparate access to social and health services. While inequities in social
determinants of health (SDOH) undoubtedly shape health outcomes, solutions to these inequities have primarily
focused on individual and interpersonal factors, with limited effect. Effective structural and policy solutions are
needed to reduce and eliminate disparities, and these must address the historical, cultural, political and
institutional influences that restrict access to resources and quality health for minoritized communities. Although
community-led health structural interventions are essential to address complex structural drivers of health
disparities, research that can alter the social context and trajectory of health inequities in this area is often
negatively impacted by limited resources and fraught, superficial relationships with academic partners. To tackle
these problems, we will establish the SHHARE Community Project: The Shared Hub
for Health Action Research and Equity to provide support and resources to community organizations and
coalitions to strengthen their capacity, leadership and success in tackling structural drivers to health inequities.
SHHARE is strongly positioned to serve as a ComPASS Health Equity Research Hub given our extensive
expertise and track record in using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach with
minoritized and underserved populations to address structural determinants, with specific expertise in
social/cultural factors and nutrition/the food environment. SHHARE maximizes strong and long-lasting
partnerships between NYU Langone Health (NYULH) and local and national community-based organizations,
multi-sector partners, and renowned multidisciplinary experts at NYULH and Cicatelli Associates Inc (CAI).
Guided by CBPR principles, SHHARE will support and ensure independence of community-lead health equity
interventions (CHESIs) by: 1) Establishing a centralized, interdisciplinary administrative and coordinating team
(ACT) unit to support research planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation; disseminate findings, and
promote sustainability of CHESIs and their interactions with ComPASS; 2) Providing methodological technical
assistance and expertise through the research methods and data management (RMDM) unit to support CHESI
teams to finalize interventions and research designs; 3) Strengthening CHESI leadership and competencies in
structural determinants of health and health equity research through a community engaged research capacity
building and training (RCBT) unit that provides technical assistance; and 4) Developing a sustainable community
engagement and health equity (CEEQ) unit that supports all CBPR activities within SHHARE and among the
assigned CHESI projects. Our proposed Health Equity Research Hub will empower and support CHESI teams
to successfully implement broader structural change that targets inequities in SDOH to cultivate communities of
practice that shift paradigms about community-led solutions to ensure measurable gains in health equity."

Most measures of adult health and longevity in the United States lag well behind those of other wealthy countries.
Despite widening recognition of this crisis, we have only a limited understanding of its causes and few strategies
to reverse them. This proposal, a renewal of the highly successful Network on Life Course Health Dynamics and
Disparities in 21st Century America (NLCHDD) funded for the past ten years by the National Institute on Aging,
lays out a plan to further develop the scientific groundwork, human capital, and data and analytic infrastructure
to answer critical questions about the U.S. health and longevity crisis. Our overarching objective over the next
five years is to strengthen and focus the NLCHDD to generate new evidence and disseminate data and analytic
resources to better understand the trends and disparities in U.S. adult health and longevity across the life course
and social and geographic contexts. We will do so through four specific aims. First, we will direct attention and
resources toward five targeted scientific questions that will shed light on the multi-layered determinants of the
troubling trends and growing disparities in U.S. adult health and longevity. These questions (described in detail
in the proposal) focus on how social and geographic contexts—separately and collectively—shape trends and
disparities in adult health and longevity across the life course. Second, we will strategically expand the
interdisciplinary Network of emerging, established, and underrepresented scientists who will collaborate to
investigate the key scientific questions. Third, we will provide development and training opportunities for Network
scientists via pilot grants, grant proposal mentoring, working groups, and annual meetings. Fourth, we will
develop and disseminate data and analytic resources to foster innovative research on the key scientific questions
and advance science in this critical area. Our Network is innovative in its focus on the multi-layered contextual
determinants of trends and disparities in adult health and longevity across the life course; in its openness and
evolving nature; in its efforts to incorporate emerging investigators with more established ones; and in its central
concern for support, mentoring, and development of emerging and underrepresented scholars. This emphasis
on human capital development is reflected in all aspects of the Network's organization and operation. Our
Network is also unique in its attention to focusing on research that can inform policies and interventions and
provide the foundation for future research advances. Finally, our Network is unique in that it will facilitate the
expansion, integration, and public dissemination of new and existing data resources for population health
determinants across social and geographic contexts. The renewal Network brings together a PI team and four
sites that span the U.S. with substantial experience in developing large-scale population health research and
complementary scientific strengths connected to the Network’s aims. Using its complementary strengths,
developmental maturity, and geographic diversity, the NLCHDD leadership and overall Network is poised to
make important scientific inroads over the next five years on the U.S. population health and longevity crisis."

Delayed intervention for congenital heart defect residua and sequelae can lead to heart failure and end-organ
damage. Identifying the optimal time for intervention to avoid both adverse outcomes and to minimize the
number of interventions over a lifetime for any given heart defect relies on routine surveillance with expensive
imaging and centralized expertise. Data from the widely available electrocardiogram (ECG) can be transferred
from point-of-care to remote data analysis centers. Machine learning and time-series analysis of ECG waves
related to atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization and ventricular repolarization, conduction intervals
and waveform durations can consistently calculate parameters that can be tracked as biomarkers
longitudinally. ECG patterns may reflect dysrhythmia, ischemia, hypertrophy, chamber dilatation, ventricular
fibrosis and dysfunction, and can change over time in response to subclinical changes in the cardiac
chambers. A significant problem in detecting subtle changes in the ECG is the reliance on normal intervals and
pattern descriptions that lack nuance to detect longitudinal changes on an individual basis that may reflect
impending ventricular failure. We propose to apply artificial intelligence-based methods to analyze longitudinal
ECG changes by age, sex, race and ethnicity in an adult congenital heart disease population. Once we identify
and characterize ECG changes over time, we will use the change in ECG parameters to develop a machine
learning algorithm to predict the need for cardiac intervention or occurrence of adverse events."

 The DNA damage-signaling pathways play critical roles in maintaining genomic stability following DNA
damage. Disruption of these pathways leads to genomic instability and increased cancer incidence, suggesting
that these pathways are essential for the prevention of neoplastic transformation. Our recent work demonstrated
that NUDT16’s catalytic hydrolase activity is required for 53BP1 de-ADP-ribosylation, 53BP1 protein stability,
and its function in cell survival. An important question remains of whether other critical unidentified substrate
proteins exist for NUDT16 hydrolase activity. Our preliminary data revealed that NUDT16 loss decreased the
level of multiple DNA damage checkpoint and repair protein. Moreover, cells lacking NUDT16 showed significant
DNA repair defects and chromosomal aberrations. In addition, Nudt16-/- mice presents increased spleen weight
and elevated number of splenic follicles.
 Driven by these promising preliminary results, in this renewal application, we hypothesize that NUDT16,
through its catalytic activity, regulates multiple DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins, to facilitate DNA
end resection-initiated HR repair, which is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability and prevention of
tumorigenesis. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the role(s) of NUDT16 in regulation
of the DNA repair pathways. Aim 2: Define the physiological function of Nudt16 in vivo. Aim 3: Investigate the
underlying mechanisms by which Nudt16 loss contributes to lymphomagenesis in mice.
 Taken together, these in-depth studies focused on NUDT16 not only contribute significantly to our
understanding of the complex regulation of DNA repair pathways but may also provide critical insights into the
underlying mechanisms by which loss of Nudt16 contributes to tumorigenesis in mice."

Abstract
This project for the R01 proposal focuses on elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying
aging-related cognitive impairments in Down syndrome (DS). The central hypothesis to be tested
for the main R01 grant is that upregulation of the capacity for de novo protein synthesis, via
suppression of eEF2K and eEF2 phosphorylation, will improve multiple aging-related
pathophysiology in DS including synaptic failure and cognitive deficits. A key rationale for the
project is based on our findings that levels of eEF2K phosphorylation are abnormally high in brain
tissue from both DS patients and DS mouse models. For this supplement, we propose to
investigate, within the scope of the currently funded R01 grant (AG073823, PI: Ma), the effects of
neuronal eEF2K overexpression on synaptic and cognitive function by taking advantage of a novel
transgenic mouse model (eEF2K cKI) that we have recently generated."
10998526,"Project Summary: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects nearly 50% of the global population
and establishes disease-causing infections in the gastric epithelium. H. pylori infections are cured using so-
called triple antibiotic therapies, but these fail to eradicate H. pylori in approximately 20-25% of treated
patients. Chronic H. pylori infections cause severe gastrointestinal illnesses, gastric adenocarcinomas, and
gastric mucosal lymphomas. Despite the devastating consequences of uneradicated H. pylori infections, the
mechanisms that allow H. pylori to persist are not well characterized despite the pathogen’s contribution to the
disease. Due to increasing in vivo evidence from clinical trials and gastric mucosal biopsies, the field presently
proposes that low-growth states such as biofilms facilitate chronic infections in the host. H. pylori biofilm growth
is not fully characterized, but our lab showed that genes for ribosomal proteins and ribosome regulators are
differentially expressed between biofilm and non-biofilm growth. A gap in knowledge in this field is how H.
pylori regulates its ribosome population in low-growth states such as biofilms, and what advantage this
regulation confers particularly to maintain chronic infections. My proposed research will address this
mechanistic knowledge gap and provide necessary fundamental understanding into how ribosomes are
regulated under growth-limiting conditions and in the host. The long-term objective of this study is to
determine how H. pylori utilizes ribosomal silencing to regulate ribosome assembly, survive stresses in the
host and maintain chronic infections. Preliminary studies show that rsfS, the only known ribosome silencing
factor in H. pylori, is required for growth limiting conditions, biofilm growth, and long-term in vivo colonization.
The hypothesis for this study is that RsfS is utilized in low growth states to regulate the ribosome population
so that H. pylori can maintain chronic infections and survive eradication. The approach will be to expand upon
preliminary findings by determining the temporal expression and control elements of rsfS under growth limiting
conditions and further investigate the role of rsfS expression in vivo. AIM 1 will identify specific growth limiting
conditions in which ribosome silencing is being utilized by defining the conditions that lead to differential rsfS
expression and affect the ribosome population. AIM 2 will further define the role of rsfS expression in long-term
in vivo infections to help identify the stage of infection that H. pylori utilizes ribosome silencing. The rationale
for the proposed aims is that the findings will elucidate mechanisms that allow bacteria in chronic infections
to persist so that more effective therapeutic strategies can be developed. The contributions from the fulfillment
of these aims will be significant because they will provide fundamental insight regarding H. pylori ribosome
populations in low-growth states, test the field’s current model that proposes low growth states are used in
chronic infection, and define the role of an essential physiological mechanism required by H. pylori to maintain
disease-causing infections."

An estimated 6.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia in 2023, with more than
55 million people living with AD worldwide. However, stark disparities exist in the prevalence of AD with older
adults with multidimensional poverty being more than twice as likely to develop dementia during their lifetime.
Resources, opportunities, and the environment where you live, work, play, and age, also known as the social
determinants of health, have been proposed as significant predictors of numerous risk factors associated with
dementia. This proposal will investigate the influence of a novel social determinant of health, neighborhood
disadvantage, on (1) cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, brain imaging biomarkers, and (2) cognitive
function associated with AD and related dementias (ADRD). This project will utilize data from the Wake Forest
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Clinical Core Cohort to conduct analyses investigating these
relationships. Training will take place at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in the Molecular
Medicine and Translational Science (MMTS) and Medical programs as a part of the M.D./Ph.D. dual-degree
program. The applicant will receive training in the foundational knowledge necessary to conduct health
disparities research, statistical methodology and analytical design, and scientific writing and communication to
accomplish the proposed aims. Mentorship for the proposal includes a multidisciplinary team with individuals in
the ADRC, along with faculty in the Internal Medicine and Neurology departments. This team will provide the
applicant with feedback every step along the way, regarding data analysis, interpretation of findings, and
manuscript preparation. The proposed aims have the potential to provide new insights into the effects of one’s
neighborhood-level disadvantage on various factors of risk associated with ADRD and further elucidate the
influence of social determinants of health on risk for dementia."
10998783,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient, but in excess, it is neurotoxic. Humans who are
over-exposed to Mn environmentally or occupationally develop cognitive and motor deficits.
Under conditions of over-exposure, Mn builds up in the basal ganglia of the brain, which
primarily contains dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons. However, the exact neural targets and
mechanisms of Mn toxicity are poorly understood. A question that remains unanswered is
whether Mn targets dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons of the basal ganglia to induce motor
disease. In the proposed work, we use the critical Mn efflux transporter protein SLC30A10 as a
tool to address this question. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations of SLC30A10 causes
childhood dystonia and adult-onset parkinsonism. We previously showed that loss of SLC30A10
in the brain leads to elevated Mn levels in the basal ganglia in early-life, lifelong motor deficits,
and impaired evoked dopamine release. Previous studies also revealed that selective loss of
SLC30A10 in dopaminergic neurons leads to motor deficits in early-life that persist into
adulthood. These findings show that activity of SLC30A10 in dopaminergic neurons is required
to protect against Mn toxicity and suggest that Mn targets dopaminergic neurons of the basal
ganglia. To definitively identify the neuronal targets and mechanisms of Mn toxicity, we will use
dopaminergic- or GABAergic-specific Slc30a10 knockin mice. These mouse models allow us to
selectively increase Slc30a10 expression in specific neurons and attenuate increased Mn levels
after exposure. In the proposed work, we will use behavioral and neurochemical approaches to
test the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurons are the primary target of Mn. Knockin and control
mice will receive an oral Mn treatment or vehicle treatment starting from birth, and we will
perform behavioral assays at various timepoints from PND28-180. Proposed experiments also
include metal analyses and assaying for changes in evoked dopamine and GABA release by in-
vivo microdialysis. Results from early-life behavioral assays with the dopaminergic-specific
Slc30a10 knockin strain have shown that knockin mice are protected from early-life Mn-induced
motor deficits after Mn exposure, compared to control littermates that develop motor deficits.
These novel findings corroborate the hypothesis that Mn primarily targets dopaminergic neurons
of the basal ganglia to induce motor disease. This proposed study will therefore provide
valuable insight into the prevention of Mn-induced disease and inform future studies towards
developing treatments."

Pediatric skin diseases are highly prevalent and impart a devastating burden on children and their families.
Yet, the specialty of pediatric dermatology is understaffed, the availability of FDA-approved treatments is
inadequate, and the pace of research and guidelines development in the field is too slow. The Pediatric
Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) was founded in 2012 to address these crucial yet unmet needs.
PeDRA’s primary mission is to create, inspire, and sustain research to prevent, treat, and cure childhood skin
disease. The long-term goal of PeDRA is to leverage such research to improve the health outcomes of children
with skin disorders. Annual conferences have been integral to the success of PeDRA, providing a forum for
educating investigators, identifying and prioritizing research needs and opportunities, and developing and
initiating innovative projects. A combination of didactic lectures and panels, expert-led small group discussions,
poster sessions, and unique training opportunities are the foundation of every PeDRA Annual Conference. This
proposal is for the 12th PeDRA Annual Conference, set to take place in October of 2024 with the following
aims: 1) Provide education and engagement opportunities for a broad and diverse audience with a focus on
establishing a core set of competencies and resources to conduct successful pediatric dermatology research;
2) Advance existing research projects and develop new research priorities and initiatives in disease-areas and
high-priority topics spanning the field of pediatric dermatology; and 3) Provide a forum for the dissemination of
final and ongoing research results from a broad group of investigators to a diverse audience that includes
patient stakeholders, industry representatives, and researchers from multiple fields including potential NIH
collaborators. The expected outcomes of this conference are a more developed set of research skills for
current and future physician-scientists, enhanced productivity, strengthened multi-stakeholder networks, and
the conduct of high-quality research. These activities will accelerate the pace of pediatric dermatology
research, allowing clinicians to better understand, prevent and treat skin disease in children, and giving
patients and families options to manage diseases and make informed treatment decisions in the future."

Transcription requires the coordinated recruitment of transcription factors, coactivators, and regulators to speciﬁc
DNA elements with high spatial and temporal regulation. Phase separation has recently been implicated in the
regulated assembly of the transcriptional machinery, but it remains unclear to which extent and how phase
separation contributes to transcriptional activity. This is a bottleneck in our current understanding given the
importance of this fundamental biological process in development and its dysregulation in disease processes.
The small size of transcriptional assemblies is a technical challenge that we will circumvent here by employing
mutagenesis. Another challenge is the limited quantitative comparison of alternative models in the current
literature. Importantly, the existence of multivalent interactions does not necessitate that they give rise to function
via phase separation. E.g., multiple motifs in the yeast transcription factor Gcn4 bind to multiple binding sites in
its cognate mediator subunit Med15, generating multivalent, dynamic interactions that give rise to non-
stoichiometric, soluble complexes below the threshold concentration for phase separation. Thus, we hypothesize
that soluble complexes and condensates are mediated by the same multivalent interactions and serve similar
functions. We further hypothesize that transcriptional condensates have additional emerging properties that can
enhance or suppress transcriptional functions. Here, we propose to leverage a conceptual phase separation
framework recently developed by PI Mittag to generate separation-of-function mutants. Her rigorous approaches
for quantifying driving force for phase separation will be combined with extensive expertise on transcription and
its regulation by PI Ansari. We will perform the proposed studies in yeast because function can be analyzed in
vivo, and activity compared with well-deﬁned in vitro readouts. We will ask three main questions: 1) How do
transcription factors, coactivators and DNA phase separate together, and how do multivalent interactions and
solubility contribute to their phase behavior? 2) Is transcriptional activity of the yeast transcription factor Gcn4
driven by small complexes or by phase-separated condensates? 3) Given that condensates have emergent
properties that small complexes lack, how does the ability to include or exclude regulatory factors from
condensates and the ability to percolate and alter chromatin structure inﬂuence transcriptional function? The
overall impact of this project will stem from the careful quantitative and conceptual characterization of the phase
behavior of transcription factors with downstream factors. The rigorous comparison of alternate models will
reveal the role of phase separation in transcription and which functions of transcriptional condensates go beyond
those of small complexes. The proposed work is of high relevance given the interest in targeting transcriptional
condensates therapeutically in diseases."
11000740,"SPECIFIC AIMS OVERALL
For the last 15 years, The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) Center for Accelerating
Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) has focused on eliminating health disparities in the south Los Angeles
community, particularly those related to cancer, cardiometabolic diseases, and HIV/AIDS. As an unexpected
expansion in response to the needs of our local community, the entire CDU establishment also led community
initiatives to improve local outcomes during the pandemic, including providing education and facilitating COVID-
19 screening, prevention, care, and clinical trials. The AXIS Research Center and our Research Programs at
CDU were critical in these processes.
In the next 5 years, we will improve our strengths and address weaknesses that became apparent during the
previous funding cycle to achieve our goals as a Center and an Institution committed to reducing and eliminating
health disparities. This will use established AXIS Center resources, resources, and partnerships at neighboring
institutions and the nationwide RCMI Consortium to advance our three programmatic goals that align with the
University's mission, vision, and strategic plan. To accomplish this, we propose to continue with the three
programmatic goals that align with the mission, vision, and strategic plan for the university research enterprise:
Goal 1: To enhance the infrastructure capacity in translational research using the Precision Medicine model in
the areas of Cancer, Cardiometabolic, and HIV/AIDS. Provide support for research pillars in Mental Health and
Health Services Research.
Goal 2: To continue integrating basic, clinical, behavioral, and community-partnered research by fostering
collaboration among disciplines, departments, and schools at CDU and sustainable collaboration with
community leaders and investigators across other research institutions.
Goal 3: To facilitate and elevate professional development and best practices in mentored clinical and
translational research training on minority health and health disparities
To achieve these goals, we combine a basic science project, a clinical trial Project, and a behavioral research
Project, all focused on reducing health disparities among Latinx and African American populations in the greater
Los Angeles area. Four Cores will support the three Projects.
1) An Administrative Core to provide oversight and facilitate implementation of critical activities to procure
resources, budget and monitor finances, assess and direct research faculty, and support staff productivity.
2) an Investigator Development Core to continue a pilot project program and provide comprehensive research
resources and support, mentoring, and skills development training for early-stage investigators, post-doctoral
fellows, and junior faculty.
3) A Research Capacity Core to continue to provide transdisciplinary research infrastructure in Drug Discovery,
Biomedical Informatics, Clinical Research Resources and Facilities, and Research Methods and Statistics while
expanding our services with the Next-Generation Sequencing Unit and the Exosomes and microRNA Unit.
4) A Community Outreach Core to facilitate communication and engagement with the community, enhance
education and compassion, and increase research capacity via the local community."
11000741,"ABSTRACT - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core will provide the day-to-day administrative and logistical support, coordination,
documentation, tracking, resource allocation, and integration of facilities, faculty, core resources, and research
projects within the Center for Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS). Our overall goal is to
provide CDU investigators, staff, faculty, and collaborators the support to continue to be productive, submit
competitive grant submissions, and publish their work in high-impact journals. Our team will communicate
between the faculty and the core leaders to provide effective and career-enhancing seminars, trainings,
workshops, conferences, and outreach events. The core will work with institutional offices to facilitate and
allocate resources and activities to build CDU’s research capabilities and enhance its investigators from all
levels. To ensure the center and its services maximize their capabilities, the core will evaluate the cores and
communicate their progress with institutional leadership, the RCMI Coordinating Center, and its advisory
committee (AC), which includes individuals from community and scientific backgrounds. Our advisory committee
will work to identify future directions for AXIS. In the renewal, we will continue to align university infrastructure
resources that work to eliminate health disparities, specifically through three areas of focus that disproportionally
affect the surrounding Los Angeles Service Planning Area 6: Cancer, Cardiometabolic disease, and HIV/AIDS.
We continue to align our goals with the university's commitment to cultivating diverse health professional leaders
dedicated to social justice and health equity for underserved populations through outstanding education,
research, clinical service, and community engagement. The university has continuously supported its
researchers and works to expand, enhance, and integrate the research mission. The administrative core will be
a leader to ensure that administrative leadership executes the alignment and research allocation. We will
continue to enhance resources from other NIH-funded research centers, programs, and partnering institutions."

RESEARCH CAPACITY CORE
The RCMI AXIS Program at CDU is designed to address health disparities by researching diseases that affect
the community it serves and creating technologies and research infrastructure to serve the institutional scientific
community and its academic and community partners. The Research Infrastructure in CDU’s AXIS Center is
designed to develop technology and infrastructure for investigators/researchers/students conducting leading-
edge translational research to improve health and eliminate health disparities. In the last funding cycle (2019-
2023), we established the Research Infrastructure Core (now called Research Capacity Core [RCC]) at CDU
through a combination of institutional funds, previous AXIS/RCMI/NIMHD funding support (2009-2014 and 2014-
2019), other Center grants, and Endowment funds. The Core integrated our resources in Laboratory Technology,
Genomic, Pretomics, Sequencing Technology, Drug Discovery, Informatics, Methodology, Statistics, and Clinical
Research Resources into one transdisciplinary infrastructure Core focusing on Precision Medicine and Precision
Health.
The RCC aims to overcome the lack of inclusion of ethnic minorities and socially disadvantaged populations in
the resource-intense era of genomic research by providing services and training to CDU investigators on next-
generation sequencing technology, genomics, and bioinformatics. The transdisciplinary RCC in our AXIS Center
can provide resources supporting genomic/epigenomic research linking with upstream social determinants of
health factors to understand the impact of social and neighborhood environment on health outcomes in our
community that is critical for developing the future precision health workforce for African American and Latinx
community in South Los Angeles. The RCC at CDU has been used widely by investigators and supported three
funded complete Projects, pilot projects, and AXIS supplement projects in the last cycles. In this renewal
application, the RCC will continue to strengthen research infrastructure, focusing on Precision Medicine, to apply
to various disciplines in CDU to benefit researchers and research Projects in social, behavioral, genomic,
epigenomic, clinical, and community outreach research related to health disparities, health equity, and precision
health."

INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE
The etiology of the broad spectrum of health disparities suffered by minority and socioeconomically
disadvantaged populations in the United States is complex and multifactorial. Charles R. Drew University of
Medicine and Science (CDU) has worked toward increasing its core of health disparity researchers for years.
Developing well-trained basic, clinical, and behavioral research faculty with an in-depth understanding of racial
and ethnic health disparities allows minority institutions such as CDU to take leadership in these critical areas.
The AXIS Center has been focused on supporting this goal in the last 15 years, with measurable success in
establishing a cohort of young faculty who advanced in their academic appointments, secured independent
funding, and increased their productivity and quality regarding the number of citations and impact factor of
publications. The mentoring program established by AXIS Professional Development and Pilot Project Core (1st
funding cycle) has increased faculty productivity in journals, grant submissions, and funding. The trainees
received training grants (KL2, R03, Pilots) and research grants such as R01-level projects funded through
various NIH programs (NCI, NIMHD, NIA, NIGMS). In the next 5 years, the Investigator Development Core (IDC)
will continue building an environment supporting early career stage investigators (ESIs) and Post-Doctoral
Fellows (PDFs) to conduct their research projects focused on reducing health disparities that either generate
preliminary data for subsequent submission of grant applications and/or results in a peer-reviewed research
publication.
In the next 5 years, IDC will continue building on the 15 years of success in training and supporting ESIs and
PDFs career development at CDU. The proposed Aims will be achieved by leveraging the Administrative Core,
Community Engagement Core (CEC), Research Capacity Core (RCC), and collaboration with other RCMI
institutions and the NIMHD program. The three Aims are designed to complement each other for sustaining and
increasing CDU ESI's overall research competitiveness in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences with a
focus on health disparity and enhancing the success of ESIs in seeking extramural funding from the government
(e.g., the K- or R-series awards from NIH)."
11000744,"ABSTRACT
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC)
Research collaborations and partnerships are invaluable to CDU investigators to facilitate the exploration of
scientific arenas that lie beyond their areas of expertise and expand translational research. The university holds
a rich history of successful partnerships within the university, with other research institutions, and with the
community. The synergy of university and community partners makes it possible for CDU to respond to a rapidly
changing environment, by creating unprecedented opportunities for research linkages within and across
research domains in and outside of the university and with community partners. CDU has served as the lead
institution with the RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) consortium and the CDU- UCLA Cancer
Center to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities and is an essential partner for UCLA-CTSI.
In the previous funding cycle, the CEC developed an avenue of research translation aimed at increasing health
disparities research and began anchoring translation opportunities for three key focus areas: cancer, cardio-
metabolic diseases, and HIV/AIDS. With the development of community collaborations, community expertise
was integrated through a series of educational opportunities to provide research translation knowledge for clinical
and community research addressing key focus areas of interest. Expanding knowledge with national inter-
institutional collaborative research through collaborations via RTRN and UCLA-CTSI facilitated components of
science translation.
Building key new constructs for community translation in the focus areas of cancer, cancer, cardio-metabolic
diseases, and HIV/AIDS requires adopting methods and approaches for translational science to be
transformative in communities. Accordingly, the CEC has four overriding objectives for the next funding cycle.
The first is to serve better Hispanic/Latino and African American populations groups affected by health disparities
and diseases, particularly those communities served by CDU and community partners. Second, we will embrace
new community-based participatory (CBPR) research frameworks to solidify partnerships. Third, we aim to
enhance new ideas of community organization and social action models. Fourth, we will integrate various
dimensions of translation with the potential for forging collaborations and partnerships that can embrace systems
change for reducing and eliminating health disparities in afflicted and vulnerable communities."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous subtype comprising 10-15% of breast cancer
incidences. It's notorious for poor outcomes, recurrence, chemoresistance, and disproportionately affecting
younger women, African Americans (AAs), and those carrying hereditary mutations. Treatments are
chemotherapy-based, with a need for improved categorization methods and targeted therapies. Leukemia,
distinguished by excessive production of abnormal leukocytes, leans on chemotherapy as the primary
treatment. However, chemotherapy is ineffective in certain leukemia types, underscoring the need for
personalized approaches. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in particular, exhibits unbalanced health impacts
among minority ethnicities, predominantly Black and Hispanic patients who face lower survival rates. Despite
the availability of numerous drugs on the market and in clinical trials, notable gaps persist, highlighting the
urgent need for targeted, personalized treatments and therapies to address significant health disparities in these
diseases. Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) links to TNBC and leukemia development and prognosis,
and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC and AML. Although inhibiting MCT4 may
suppress TNBC/leukemia cell proliferation and increase chemosensitivity, further research is needed to
understand the role of MCT4 and potential treatment strategies in these diseases. Considering the shared
MCT4 overexpression, common chemoresistance, and health disparities in both TNBC and AML, this project
concurrently studies these two diseases to utilize resources and enhance broader therapeutic insights
efficiently. Given that existing MCT4 inhibitors, like AZD0095, phloretin, and α-CN-4-OH-cinnamate, exhibit
lackluster efficacy and specificity, we need more potent/selective inhibitors. Our newly developed MCT4-
targeting small molecule inhibitor, CB-2, has demonstrated potent anticancer activity in preclinical studies.
Besides, CB-2 enhances the chemo-sensitivity, offering combination therapy prospects. However, the notable
instability of CB-2 presents a substantial challenge to its potential clinical application; there is also a need for
further enhancement of the anticancer efficacy of CB-2. Here, we propose to test whether an improved MCT4
inhibitor, CB-2O2, has more potent anticancer activity and stability. Our preliminary studies show that CB-2O2
has superior stability and anticancer activity and increases chemotherapy sensitivity among TNBC and AML
cells. Thus, we will evaluate if this compound and newly designed backup analogs can inhibit TNBC and
leukemia more completely and increase their sensitivity to chemotherapy by pursuing three Aims."
11000747,"Project Summary/Abstract
Latinos comprise 19% of the population in the United States, yet represent 29% of new HIV infections in the
United States. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is one the most important biomedical preventions
interventions currently available and provides up to 99% protection against HIV infection.[3] Access and use of
PrEP is inconsistent among LSMM. Viral suppression remains elusive among LSMM living with HIV. LSMM
also report high rates of psychologic symptoms of distress. These disparities are exacerbated by poverty,
systemic racism, and homophobia
We know little about the effect that families have on the long-term health outcomes of LSMM. Longitudinal
studies of LSMM can help answer important questions about critical upstream entry points for intervening on
HIV and mental health outcomes. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1: To determine how family ties affect mental health outcomes and HIV-related behaviors (e.g.,
substance use, condomless sex) and HIV treatment (e.g., HIV viral load) of LSMM over time. We will
analyze data on family support, depressive symptoms, HIV-related behaviors, and treatment outcomes in
mSTUDY, a NIDA-funded cohort study of diverse MSM in Los Angeles. It has collected detailed psychosocial,
behavioral, and biological assessments every six months since 2013. Hypothesis 1: LSMM with greater family
emotional support will report fewer depressive symptoms and HIV-related risk behaviors and better treatment
outcomes than LSMM who report less family emotional support.
Aim 2: Determine whether family support and experiences of discrimination affect changes in the
behaviors, mental health, and health of LSMM. We will analyze data on family support, depressive
symptoms, HIV-related behaviors, and treatment outcomes in a randomly selected cohort of 250 Latino men
every six months for 5 years and in mSTUDY. Hypothesis 2A: Increased family support and decreased
experiences of discrimination will lead to a reduction in risk behaviors and to improved mental and physical
health outcomes. Hypothesis 2B: The association between experiences of discrimination with HIV-related
behaviors, mental health, and health outcomes will be weaker in Latino men with high levels of family support.
Hypothesis 2C: The association between family support and experiences of discrimination with LSMM’s
physical health and mental health is mediated by LSMM’s behaviors.
Aim 3: Identify culturally specific strategies to integrate families into HIV prevention and treatment. We
will interview diverse LSMM and conduct focus group with families in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami to
develop strategies for service providers to integrate family members into HIV biomedical interventions.
The results will enable us to assess LSMM health nationally and obtain their input into how to design and
support family-based interventions to increase health behaviors and improve health outcomes for LSMM."
11000745,"Abstract – Recruitment Core
CDU’s RCMI AXIS Recruitment Core will recruit two nationally renowned and respected investigators with
expertise in addressing health disparities research. The Recruitment Core, in partnership with the Deans,
Department Chairs, and Faculty at CDU, will conduct a national search that will ensure that applicants from
underrepresented backgrounds are actively sought out. We will engage national and local academic
partners and collaborators. These individuals will have demonstrated track records in obtaining independent
research support as assessed by NIH-R series, P-series, and/or U-series awards.
Supporting the recruited new faculty members' research with our outstanding Research Resource
Core/Precision Medicine together with robust and well-developed Units in Medical Bioinformatics, Methods
and Statistics, Clinical Research and Facilities, Drug Discovery, and Next-Generation Sequencing. In
addition, these individuals will be encouraged to participate with our internal and external partners (please
see Figure 2 in the Administrative Core section).
The proposed work of the recruitment core will benefit developing multidisciplinary, translational research
based on precision medicine and precision health platforms at CDU. These individuals will serve as strong
role models and mentors for junior investigators and by improving the quality of recruitment and retention
processes for junior scientists. They will play a key role in our Investigator Development Core and provide
strong mentoring and career development for our young investigators."

Racial-ethnic discrimination impacts too many Latino/a/x youth and poses a significant threat to their health and
well-being, increasing vulnerability for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems. Racial-ethnic socialization
(RES) messages that promote racial-ethnic pride (i.e., cultural socialization) and prepare youth to cope with
discrimination (i.e., preparation for bias) may buffer the damaging effects of discrimination. Yet, not all Latino/a/x
youth receive these messages, as some parents avoid discussions of race and ethnicity with their children.
Additionally, RES conversations can be stressful for Latino/a/x parents, and parents may not have the skills and
confidence in their ability to communicate RES content. Using intervention mapping, the current study will further
develop and refine the Video-feedback Intervention to Promote Racial-Ethnic Socialization CompEtency (VIP-
RACE) to support Latino/a/x parents' motivation to engage in RES and strengthen their RES competency
(improved skills and confidence, decreased stress). Leveraging advances in RES theory and intervention
approaches in video feedback and motivational interviewing, VIP-RACE currently comprises three sessions:
Session 1 is an ecologically-focused assessment of parents' RES practices, assessed with parent- and youth-
reported surveys and videotaped observation of parent-adolescent RES conversations. Session 2 involves an
interview with the parent to build rapport, explore parents' RES concerns and challenges, and obtain additional
information to assist with tailoring the feedback session. During Session 3, parents and RES coaches review
clips from videotaped RES interaction tasks. Video feedback highlights parents' RES strengths and encourages
parents to examine missed opportunities for engaging in RES. Data from questionnaires and interviews are also
used to punctuate strengths and highlight concerns. During Phase 1 (Aim 1), we will iteratively refine VIP-RACE
in partnership with advisory boards of youth, parents, and RES coaches, as well as expert researchers and
clinicians, who will review Draft 1 of the intervention manual and materials. Feedback will be used to guide the
development of Draft 2. We will reconvene the advisory boards and experts to provide feedback on the revised
draft and guide further curriculum refinements for Draft 3. The refined intervention will be tested with five parents
of 10-14-year-old Latino/a/x youth to identify gaps in the curriculum and obstacles to implementation that can be
addressed prior to a larger pilot. In Phase 2 (Aim 2), we will conduct a proof-of-concept single-arm trial with 40
Latino/a/x families to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of VIP-RACE. Intervention
effects on parents' RES motivation and competency, youths' racial-ethnic coping and racial-ethnic identity, and
youths' mental health and conduct problems will be assessed. As one of the first studies to develop and test a
RES intervention for Latino/a/x families, this project is poised to make a substantial impact on addressing
discrimination as it relates to the mental health and well-being of Latino/a/x youth. This proposal is responsive
to the NIMHD's priority to develop and assess interventions to improve the health of minority populations."

Sensory environments are cluttered and dynamic, with salient features 1) often masked or degraded by other
stimuli and 2) capable of holding multiple meanings depending on the surrounding context. To account for this
variability, sensory systems must process information in an adaptive manner by using contextual cues and prior
information to bias incoming sensory information. Though this flexibility is critical for accurate sensory
processing, the mechanisms underlying adaptive processing remain poorly understood. Descending projections
from hierarchically higher brain regions to lower regions are a hypothesized anatomical substrate for top-down
modulation of incoming sensory information. In the central auditory system, descending connections from the
auditory cortex target numerous subcortical structures and these cortico-fugal pathways have been implicated
in top-down processes such as predictive coding and attentional modulation of speech in noise. Specifically,
projections from the auditory cortex have been found to carry contextual information about sound statistics to
the auditory midbrain, or inferior colliculus, and to enhance responses to degraded sounds in the auditory
thalamus, or medial geniculate body. Though these cortico-fugal pathways have been implicated in contextual
processing and perceptual adaptation to degraded sounds, the broader circuit and physiological mechanisms
underlying these phenomena remain unknown. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to 1) determine the
mechanisms by which cortico-fugal neurons enable contextual processing, with the hypothesis that they induce
receptive field plasticity in IC neurons, 2) determine if top-down inputs alter context-dependent network
reorganization, and 3) test how top-down circuits mediate adaptation to challenging listening conditions at the
physiological and network level. This proposal uses a combination of behavior, large-scale electrophysiology,
two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics, and network analysis methods to address these aims. The results of
these studies will reveal the circuit and physiological mechanisms underlying auditory contextual processing and
perceptual adaptation. The impact of these experiments extends beyond the auditory system, as it may reveal
generalizable principles about adaptive processing and behavior."

Despite decades of research, schizophrenia remains the most devastating of all psychiatric disorders.
Schizophrenia is characterized by significant deficits in neural and cognitive processing, shortened lifespans,
and tremendous social, personal, and economic burden—for patients, their families, and society. The
development of cognitive markers that can track clinical and neural progression is a promising avenue for
monitoring illness burden and effective treatment response. Yet, despite enthusiasm for cognitive markers of
progression, clinically useful markers have proven difficult to identify. One reason for this may be the lack of
fidelity between potential cognitive markers and neuropathology. Cognitive markers that are causally linked
with brain pathology are needed to overcome this obstacle. We propose that relational memory – a form of
memory dependent on the hippocampus – is ideally suited as a marker of neuropathology in schizophrenia.
Hippocampal atrophy is one of the most significant brain abnormalities in chronic schizophrenia but is less
pronounced in the prodromal and early stage of psychosis. Progressive microstructural changes, resulting from
an excitation/inhibition imbalance advancing from the hippocampal head to encompass the hippocampal body
and tail has been identified as a plausible mechanism for the hippocampal atrophy observed over illness
stages in schizophrenia. We propose to use a novel paradigm developed and validated in hippocampal
amnesia patients to quantify performance across three types of relational memory – associative, temporal, and
spatial – in schizophrenia. As distinct relational memory types have been shown to segregate along the
hippocampal longitudinal axis, we propose that impairment within relational memory types will map to
dysfunction in distinct hippocampal divisions of the head (associative memory), body (temporal memory), and
tail (spatial memory). Further, we will test the relationship between relational memory impairments and
hippocampal pathology over illness stages. To test our hypotheses, we will examine hippocampal volume and
microstructure in patients ranging from early to chronic illness stages. The proposed combination of a multi-
type, hippocampal-dependent relational memory assessment with multi-dimensional hippocampal
neuroimaging will allow us to characterize the relationship between relational memory function and
hippocampal structural abnormalities. The establishment of a cognitive marker sensitive to hippocampal
structure will significantly improve our ability to track, intervene, and prevent the progression from early
psychosis to schizophrenia."
10987433,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that is widely treated with prescription opioid drugs over
extended periods of time. The high prevalence of opioid addiction with abuse and death is now a severe
national crisis in the US. In Jordan, opioid analgesics are highly restricted in their use, and many people
suffer from untreated pain. To address these unmet needs, the goal of this project will be to discover novel
natural products that are potent BBB permeable inhibitors of cathepsin L to produce a lead candidate drug
molecule(s) that reduces spinal dynorphin and attenuates chronic pain without addiction. This goal is
based on compelling evidence showing that spinal dynorphin is a key mediator of chronic pain, and
cathepsin L is largely responsible for the production of dynorphin from its inactive prodynorphin. These
findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of cathepsin L will lead to reduction of dynorphin and
alleviation of chronic pain. An important dimension of this project will be to enrich for BBB permeable
natural products and plant extracts early in the discovery process using an in vitro-parallel artificial
membrane permeability assay (PAMPA-BBB) in a CNS-targeted workflow. For the purpose of screening,
we will choose three distinct sets of natural product extracts and pure compound libraries from various
sources and regional areas, thereby enhancing the diversity in this project. The University of Jordan (JU),
UC San Diego and the NIH-DTP Repository will be subjected for initial screening for their cathepsin L
inhibitory activity at concentrations from 1-10 µg/mL. Active crude extract materials from these
screenings will be subjected to the PAMPA-BBB assay. Permeable eluents and impermeable retentates
from this assay will be evaluated for cathepsin L activity and profiled by LC-MS/MS metabolomics.
Finally, focused/targeted isolation and structure elucidation efforts will be done on fractions that show
several positive selection criteria: promising biochemical activity against cathepsin L, BBB+ in the
PAMPA permeability assay, novel structural features compared to known cathepsin L inhibitors, and a
molecular weight <500. The target fractions will be purified by HPLC, and the pure product structures
will be elucidated using the AI-based tools, Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART)
and DeepSat. The collaborative effort involving the Almaliti laboratory in Jordan and the Gerwick
laboratory in La Jolla offers a remarkable chance to bolster the University of Jordan's staff capabilities
and elevate their expertise in discovering natural products in a region renowned for its historical use of
plants as traditional remedies. These training initiatives in both La Jolla and Jordan will be further
enriched by hosting a natural products symposium in Jordan during the project's second year. Future
collaborations will be established to obtain additional funding and expand this work to other projects in
Jordan and the US."
10987531,"Circulatory shock is one of the most common reasons for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and results
from inadequate blood pressure and blood flow to support organ function. Causes of circulatory shock include
heart failure, sepsis, and hemorrhage. Prompt treatment is required to restore adequate blood pressure to
prevent severe organ injury and death. Consensus guidelines for treatment of shock provide general targets for
mean arterial pressure (MAP) that can be used to adjust medications, but optimal individual pressure goals for
patients with various diseases and comorbidities remain uncertain. Prospective randomized clinical trials
looking at different patient populations have generally failed to show a mortality benefit for higher versus lower
MAP goals, and MAP alone has therefore proven an inadequate single measure of tissue perfusion. This
project seeks to develop a novel hemodynamic metric called tissue perfusion pressure (TPP) for use in
patients with circulatory shock. This metric defines the pressure drop across the systemic circulation as the
difference between MAP and the critical closing pressure (Pcrit), which is the arterial pressure when blood flow
stops and the circulation collapses. It has generally not been possible to measure Pcrit in patients with an
intact circulation, however, and this physiology has been largely ignored in clinical practice. The proposed
approach, developed using analyses from thousands of patients, now allows estimation of Pcrit from standard
blood pressure monitors in the ICU and enables continuous calculation of TPP to augment standard
hemodynamic measures. The fundamental hypothesis of this project is that TPP can provide individualized
blood pressure targets for critically-ill patients and can therefore guide titration of fluid and vasoactive
therapies. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate the physiology of Pcrit and
TPP in preclinical animal models of circulatory shock and resuscitation using extensive physiologic
phenotyping. Measured data will be incorporated into new circuit models of organ perfusion during shock. Aim
2 will next analyze distinct shock cohorts using computational approaches applied to a large clinical database
of ICU patients, with the goal of identifying patterns in TPP response in various forms of shock and to standard
of care therapeutics. Aim 3 will then develop a computational pipeline to perform real-time analysis of TPP for
implementation in clinical decision support tools. Clinical feedback on the novel metrics will be obtained from
expert critical care clinicians. If successful, this project will advance TPP as a potential therapeutic target for
diagnosis and management of circulatory shock and set the foundation for design of future prospective clinical
trials."

dysbiosis is a cause or consequence. The goal of the proposed studies is to gain a better understanding of the
role of gut dysbiosis in the development, progression, and prognosis of PD, which will lay the foundation for the
identification of microbiome-based predictive biomarkers and open opportunities to develop gut microbiome-
based targeted interventions to prevent, mitigate and treat different phenotypes or forms of PD at various stages.
Our multi-disciplinary team proposes a multi-pronged approach that will include cross-sectional and longitudinal
studies of PD patients with different age at the onset, clinical manifestation, and severity of motor and non-motor
symptoms. Clinical metadata will be collected along with fecal microbiota samples that will be subjected to
functional multi’omic analyses that includes two discovery tools: a supervised metabolomics panel and a novel
transfer RNA-based (MSRseq) technology developed by our team that can simultaneously track gut microbial
membership and function on different time scales. These measures are important in defining states of gut
microbiota health and managing patients with gut dysbiosis back to eubiosis. Our studies will also be unique
because of the large Black PD patient population at the University of Chicago (35% here vs < 6% elsewhere)
who come from underserved urban communities on the South and West sides of Chicago. So little information
is available on Black populations with PD because of disparities in socioeconomic status and health care access.
The clinical study design is unique in having both cross-sectional and longitudinal arms and training and
validation cohort components, where fecal microbiota and skin and colonoscopic biopsies for α-synuclein will be
collected at years 1, 3 and 5 along with clinical metadata that includes PD phenotypes or forms, age at disease
onset (early vs usual mid vs late onset), clinical manifestations (tremor dominant vs akinetic rigidity or postural
instability and gait disorder form vs the mixed), severity of motor and non-motor symptoms, and race (Black vs
White), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will be
used to identify best performing PD predictive gut microbiota and metabolic biomarkers. To gain additional
insights into potential gut microbial drivers and mediators that underpin etiopathogenesis of different PD
phenotypes and progression, we will identify PD-promoting microbiota candidates and mediators for which
microbiome-based interventions that potentially prevent, mitigate, or treat PD can be developed. The clinical
meta-data and multi’omic gut microbiota data will be deposited with the Coordinating and Data Management
Center (CDMC) to be available to the broader research community for hypothesis generation and testing."

We will adapt and pilot test a technology-enabled, primary care-based, health literacy strategy to
empower women with increased vulnerability to HIV to make informed decisions about PrEP.
Nearly 20% of new HIV infections in the United States (US) occur among cisgender women, with women of color
disproportionately affected. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe, effective, and empowering option for HIV
prevention women can initiate and use without partner negotiation. Yet most women are unaware PrEP is an
option for them. With primary care representing the frontline of healthcare for most adult women, it is an ideal
setting to promote PrEP awareness and informed decision-making. Importantly, women themselves have asked
for PrEP discussions to be normalized in primary care and multiple studies have shown that women value talking
with clinicians about PrEP. Unfortunately, many primary care providers (PCPs) lack the time, resources, and
experience needed to counsel women on PrEP during busy, routine visits. Our proposed R34 Encouraging
Multiple PrEP Options for Women Engaged in PRimary Care (EMPOWER) therefore offers a pragmatic and
innovative approach to the delivery of PrEP information to women in primary care. The EMPOWER strategy
addresses well-documented barriers and `missed opportunities' for HIV prevention among cisgender women and
supports informed PrEP decision-making by: 1) identifying women who may benefit most from PrEP via an
electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm that utilizes available EHR data on HIV risk factors (i.e. bacterial
sexually transmitted infection, Hepatitis C diagnosis, substance use, intimate partner violence); 2) delivering
understandable, actionable, and non-stigmatizing PrEP education, in multiple formats and languages, directly
and securely to women via the patient portal; 3) enabling women to discreetly self-schedule a visit to discuss
PrEP options with either their own PCP or with a female PCP who has years of experience in PrEP delivery; and
4) supporting PCP counseling via clinical decision support that provides standardized, patient-centered language
to guide PrEP discussions and `smart sets' to facilitate PrEP prescribing, when desired. Our specific aims are
to: 1) Adapt and coordinate the EMPOWER strategy to support informed decision-making among diverse
cisgender women with increased vulnerability to HIV seen in primary care; 2) Pilot test the efficacy of the
EMPOWER strategy, compared to an attention control, on PrEP knowledge, stigma, and future intention to use
PrEP; and 3) Assess the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of EMPOWER components.
EMPOWER will be evaluated in Cook County, an `Ending the HIV Epidemic' priority area. The study will be
meaningfully informed by a community advisory board of diverse women, a scientific advisory board of clinicians
and experts, and a community collaboration board of local organization leaders in the field of HIV."
10998393,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain presence is overrepresented among individuals with substance use disorder (SUD), with
evidence suggesting that in the United States, over two-thirds of individuals with a drug use disorder have
chronic pain. To inform efforts to meliorate the burden of co-occurring chronic pain and substance use, it is
critical to first clarify their underlying mechanisms. Studies often conclude that chronic pain may be causally
linked to substance use. Yet, the lack of research accounting for the heterogeneity across and comorbidity
among chronic pain conditions themselves, as well as plausible alternative explanations of chronic pain and
substance use comorbidity related to shared familial factors (i.e., genetic and environmental confounding) pose
a challenge for such conclusions. The overall objective of the proposed project is to estimate the effect of
chronic pain on substance use accounting for the heterogeneity across and comorbidity among chronic pain
conditions. An additional objective involves receiving training that will help foster an independent research
career assessing substance use and its comorbidities. The rationale for the project is that deepening
understandings of chronic pain’s effect on risk of SUD/OD is likely to further knowledge of chronic pain and
substance use comorbidity, which is critical for informing research and substance use prevention and
treatment initiatives for individuals with chronic pain. The central hypothesis is that a general chronic pain
liability can help explain risk of SUD/OD, which could promote nuanced pain management among individuals
concurrently using substances. The proposal will test this hypothesis in two specific aims: 1) Estimate general
and condition-specific associations between chronic pain conditions and SUD/OD and 2) Estimate general and
condition-specific effects with SUD/OD accounting for familial confounding by design. Aim 1 will implement a
bifactor model capturing chronic pain condition comorbidity and heterogeneity to assess the association
between general chronic pain liability and risk of SUD/OD. Aim 1 will also compare this model to alternative
models to justify considering the role of general chronic pain liability in risk of SUD/OD. Aim 2 will apply a co-
twin control design, comparing twins discordant on chronic pain and SUD/OD to adjust for unmeasured
confounding by factors shared by siblings. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion,
because it capitalizes on a unique, prospective, population-based twin cohort to assess the relationship
between condition-general and condition-specific chronic pain processes and SUD/OD. Further, the proposal
will use a co-twin control approach to account for shared familial factors more effectively than prior research.
This proposal is significant because it is expected to help clarify the extent to which chronic pain affects risk of
SUD/OD, which will help ascertain if reducing chronic pain decreases risk of SUD/OD or if intervening on other
factors is more effective for reducing risk of SUD/OD among individuals with chronic pain."

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) related head and neck cancer (HNC) has increased in incidence by nearly 225%
since the 1980s and is expected to rise over the next forty years. Patients with HPV positive HNC typically
have lower rates of substance use and a more favorable prognosis than HPV negative HNC. Nevertheless,
patients with HPV positive HNC often experience significant side effects from extensive treatment regiments
and psychosocial distress secondary to facial disfigurement, symptom burden, and concerns about prognosis.
It remains unclear how this distress may contribute to health behaviors that have a direct bearing on relapse,
morbidity, and mortality in individuals with HNC. Despite the lower rates of behavioral risk factors associated
with HPV negative HNC (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), patients with HPV positive HNC who engage in these
risk factors (≥ 50% of patients) are at an increased risk for recurrence or secondary malignancy. Among cancer
survivors generally, including HPV negative HNC, psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and fear of
cancer recurrence) has been associated with higher rates of tobacco and alcohol use. However, this
relationship has been understudied in the context of HPV positive HNC. This study involves a secondary
analysis of the Head and Neck 5000 study, a large longitudinal clinical cohort of HNC patients in the United
Kingdom. Through the parent study, patients with HNC were recruited shortly after diagnosis and prior to
cancer treatment, provided blood samples at baseline for HPV status, and completed self-report surveys at
baseline (diagnosis), 4-months, 12-months, and 5-years post-diagnosis. The current study aims to 1) evaluate
the trajectories of psychosocial variables (i.e., psychological distress, fear of cancer recurrence, and physical
symptom burden) in patients with HPV positive HNC from diagnosis to one year following diagnosis, 2)
examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and change in tobacco and alcohol use in patients
with HPV positive HNC during the first year after diagnosis, and 3) assess the role of health behavior change
on 5-year health outcomes (recurrence-free survival). This study will be the first to examine psychosocial
variables in association to health behavior change and long-term health outcomes in a large longitudinal
clinical cohort of patients with HPV positive HNC. Results will inform the need for resources in clinical care and
contribute to psychosocial and behavioral intervention development for patients with HPV positive HNC. This
Fellowship will provide the applicant with the training needed to launch an independent and productive
research program examining the psychosocial and behavioral processes affecting the quality of life of patients
with cancer. The proposed research and training plan will fill gaps in her discipline-specific knowledge in health
psychology, head and neck oncology, and HPV-infection. As well as enhance her skills in longitudinal
quantitative analysis and prepare her for a career as an independent investigator in academia."
10997921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hallucinations are a common, distressing symptom of psychosis-spectrum disorders, which can be
resistant to first-line psychiatric treatments. This symptom is also associated with abnormal audiovisual
integration (AVI) in psychosis, which undermines a holistic perceptual experience of reality. Strong evidence
from a causal lesion network mapping study, supported by the functional neuroimaging literature, indicates that
the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS) plays a causal role in the brain network underlying both auditory and
visual hallucinations. The rSTS is similarly implicated in AVI deficits, suggesting it could be an ideal target for
biomarker-informed treatment approaches. One such approach is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),
a non-invasive brain stimulation method for modulating the electrical activity of a cortical region. High-definition
tDCS (HD-tDCS), a newly developed and refined version of tDCS, makes precise targeting of the rSTS possible.
As lesion network mapping shows that the rSTS is negatively connected to the brain network underlying
hallucinations, a clinical trial led by fellowship sponsor, Dr. Paulo Lizano, aims to reduce rSTS activity by using
cathodal HD-tDCS, which lowers the underlying membrane potential of the stimulated neural region. In the
current research proposal, I will use electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical measures to assess
engagement of rSTS by HD-tDCS and clinical efficacy of this intervention through the following aims. Aim 1 will
determine if neural correlates of AVI are engaged by cathodal HD-tDCS to the rSTS. I will use my expertise
in EEG to extract biomarkers of audiovisual integration from neural responses to repetitive, frequency-modulated
auditory and visual stimuli. I hypothesize that cathodal HD-tDCS, relative to sham, will improve the strength of
these biomarkers, demonstrating improved AVI and successful engagement of the rSTS after a 5-day treatment
and sustained 1 month following treatment. Aim 2 will investigate if cathodal rSTS stimulation, relative to
sham, may provide acute and long-term reduction of hallucinatory experiences. I will employ my clinical
evaluation skills to measure frequency and severity of hallucinations in participants. I hypothesize that cathodal
HD-tDCS, relative to sham, will reduce the frequency and severity of hallucinations in clinician-rated, self-report,
and behavioral measures after a 5-day treatment and sustained at 1-month follow up. During the course of this
fellowship, I will learn how to perform tDCS and learn about other transcranial electrical stimulation techniques
through training provided by Dr. Lizano and Dr. Matcheri Keshavan at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
supported by a consultant, Dr. Robert Reinhart. I will also learn how to plan, perform, analyze, and publish data
from a clinical trial through supervision and clinical coursework. Training in professional development will further
prepare me for the next phase of my career as an independent researcher."

 PLP-dependent enzymes are one of the most versatile biocatalysts and catalyze a diverse range of
chemical transformations. They are widespread in nature and play critical roles in metabolism and numerous
cellular processes. Studying PLP enzymes is hence important for us to understand biology and develop
therapeutics. Because of their exquisite and versatile catalytic activity, PLP-dependent enzymes are also
remarkable biocatalysts to build diverse structurally complex and bioactive natural products; and are
indispensable biocatalytic tools for asymmetric synthesis of noncanonical amino acids and chiral amine
pharmaceuticals. However, despite the vast number of PLP-dependent enzymes characterized to date, our
abilities to predict, manipulate, and harness their activities are still largely limited. This research program desires
to fill the knowledge gap by integrating discovery, mechanistic investigation, and biocatalytic application to
systematically and comprehensively study four types of carbon-carbon (C-C) bond forming and cleaving PLP
enzymes, including our recently discovered PLP-dependent Mannich cyclase. These enzymes represent the
frontier of PLP enzymology because of their unusual activity, complementary synthetic utility to existing
biocatalysts, and unexpected evolutionary relationship with well-characterized PLP enzyme family. All proposed
aims are supported by strong preliminary data gathered in our laboratory. Our overarching goal is to understand
the chemical and substrate specificity and leverage this understanding to uncover previously unknown functions
of PLP-dependent enzymes and explore their non-native catalytic utility. Ultimately, the proposed research will
expand our mechanistic understanding on PLP enzymology, shed new light on metabolism, and provide novel
biocatalytic tools for amino acid biosynthesis."

Coccidioides is a fungal pathogen from the American deserts that infects people who breathe in the spores.
Inside the person’s lungs, the spores develop into spherules which fill with hundreds of endospores that are
released into the lungs. The symptoms of this disease, called Valley Fever, occur in a third of exposed individuals
and resemble the flu or pneumonia leading to misdiagnosis. In 7% of infected individuals the fungus will leave
the lungs and spread or disseminate to the rest of the body, including the brain, joints, skin, and other organs.
Treatments include two classes of drugs and may be needed for years: oral Triazoles like Fluconazole (to which
there is increasing resistance) or IV Amphotericin B which is generally reserved for disseminated disease since
it is toxic to the kidneys. Due to limited therapies, risk of drug resistance, and the rapidly increasing spread of
coccidioidomycosis from desertification, the need for novel anti-Coccidioides drugs is very urgent. Our proposal
will address this urgency by repurposing drugs that have already received FDA-approval as new antifungals, a
practice best described as “teaching old drugs new tricks”. In a screening of 7962 compounds, we discovered
254 potential drugs, 30 were qualified as excellent candidates due to their strong inhibiting action. We tested 13
of these drugs in a combination matrix with three clinical antifungals, Amphotericin B, Fluconazole, and
Caspofungin, to see if there were any synergistic effects where the drugs worked better together than alone.
Excitingly, 6 compounds demonstrated synergy with Amphotericin B, resulting in lower concentrations of both
drugs inhibiting Coccidioides growth more than either drug individually. Therefore, we propose that these six
compounds are strong candidates for a synergistic approach for treating Valley Fever by using combination
therapy of these drugs with Amphotericin B. Aim 1 will investigate the properties of Coccidioides exposed to
drugs in vitro. In Aim 1.1, we measure the potential synergy of the six drugs with the other azole and
echinocandin drugs. Next, in Aim 1.2, we will determine their fungicidal or fungistatic properties to guide our in
vivo dosing. Aim 1.3 investigates pan-morphologic antifungal efficacy. Aim 1.4 assesses pan-isolate drug
efficacy across Coccidioides species, informing collaborative investigations into pan-fungal potential. In Aim 2,
we will test the efficacy of the drugs in two animal models. In Aim 2.1, doses of the drugs individually and in
combination will first be optimized in a Galleria larvae model of coccidioidomycosis to determine the most
effective dose for the mouse model. In the murine model (Aim 2.2) we will compare the efficacy of daily
treatments of the combination therapy versus monotherapy in mice infected with a lethal dose of spores in short,
14d trials and longer, 30d trials where success will be measured both by fungal burden and survival. This
research addresses the unmet need for novel anti-Coccidioides drugs, offering a combination therapy approach
to enhance efficacy, reduce toxicity, and mitigate resistance risks. The results of my combination therapy
experiments with these novel drugs with known medications may change the future of Valley Fever treatments."

The program was accepted as an affiliate site of the UDN in 2022, fully IRB-approved in April 2023, and in Sep. 2023, was added as an X01 site. The UAB UDP seeks to continue the affiliation, working within the UDN to provide services to groups in the Southeast and beyond who historically have not benefited from modern diagnostic investigations. The UAB UDP provides diagnostic evaluations for children and adults with chronic, undiagnosed diseases. Patients are referred by physicians using HIPAA-compliant secure communications systems or are referred from the UDN through the UDN Gateway. A UDP nurse practitioner contacts accepted patients for informed consent and works with the patient and the referring physician to collect and summarize medical records and obtain laboratory and imaging studies. A short summary is then produced, which is entered into the PhenoTips system, and data are shared with the UDN Gateway. After physician review of the summary an in person or telemedicine appointment is made (billed to insurance) with the physician and any relevant specialist consultants. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are ordered as clinically indicated. Progress in evaluations is reviewed by UAB UDP staff at monthly meetings, and a monthly conference is held with UDP staff and consultants to discuss ongoing unsolved cases. Genetic testing, including genome sequencing, is ordered if clinically indicated. Patients who live in Alabama can be offered free-of-charge whole genome sequencing at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology under a state-supported program, the Alabama Genomic Health Initiative (AGHI). HudsonAlpha is also able to do long-read sequencing in instances where a genetic diagnosis has not been achieved with short-read sequencing. Several innovations are proposed which include increased use of telemedicine and a “genome-first” diagnostic approach, the inclusion of basic scientists in a set of diagnostic teams, collaboration with a federally qualified health center to increase diversity of patients seen, and incorporation of a set of bioinformatic and AI-powered tools to improve diagnostic success rates and reduce turnaround time."
10979687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 250,000 angioplasties, stents and open bypasses are performed each year to open occluded vessels for
preservation of life and limb, yet over half of these will fail in under 5 years due to restenosis. The underlying
pathology of restenosis is cellular proliferation that re-narrows the vessel lumen. Restenosis increases the
cost and complications of re-intervention, as well as risking cardiac ischemia, stroke and limb loss. Current
treatment involves a balloon coated with an anti-proliferative drug that is delivered to the vessel wall by direct
contact. Drug coated balloons (DCB) present several limitations including: 1) Technical limits to the type and
amount of drug that can be adhered to a balloon 2) Much of the drug is lost simply by inserted the DCB into
the bloodstream. 3) The occlusive nature of DCB limits the time it can transfer the drug without distal
ischemia. The overarching problem is the inability to deliver high intensity intravascular therapeutics,
while minimizing losses to the circulation that might otherwise be costly or toxic at the systemic level.
A Retrievable Drug Delivery Stentgraft (RDDS) is a novel, dumbbell shaped stent covered in polymer. A
center lumen preserves distal perfusion, while an isolated outer chamber isolates the vascular target. The
RDDS would infuse drug only after the target has been isolated by the stent outer chamber, with aspiration of
unused drug prior to stent removal, thereby reducing systemic losses and toxicity. The design of the RDDS
could accomodate larger quantities of drug and also liquid agents. By preserving distal perfusion, the RDDS
can offer longer incubation of the drug with the vessel wall, contrasting to occlusive DCB that otherwise risk
distal ischemia. The RDDS bears some important distinctions to current permanent drug eluting stents, which
are at risk of circulatory drug loss, should not be used at vascular branches or areas of anatomic flexion, incur
thrombosis over poorly re-endothelialized stent struts and carry traditional risks of a permanent implant. By
contrast, the RDDS is removed after used by sheath advancement to collapse the stent. As a result, the
RDDS is more comparable to DCB since it delivers a therapeutic without leaving an implant.
This study will first compare the RDDS to DCB in a bioreactor, as well as a porcine model of neointimal
hyperplasia, using assays such as quantitative mass spectrometry of both drug delivery and drug losses,
histologic assessment of arterial healing and restenosis. We hypothesize that the RDDS will reduce circulatory
losses of the anti-restenotic agent paclitaxel (PXL), increase the amount of PXL delivered to the vessel wall,
allow doses of PXL that are not possible with DCB, increase the duration of PXL exposure to the vessel wall,
and reduce intimal hyperplasia more effectively than DCB. More broadly, the beneficial effect of many other
intravascular therapeutics is limited by their systemic toxicity. A vehicle to focus drugs to a specified region
(vascular wall or vascular bed) could improve outcomes while reducing complications in a variety of medical
conditions (e.g. chemotherapy, vasoactive agents, gene vectors, and immunomodulatory agents)."

Intergenerational transmission of inequalities in economic and social wellbeing, including health, in the United
States has been well documented and shown to account for a substantial portion of contemporary disparities
by SES and race and ethnicity in these domains. Yet, due to a paucity of population-based longitudinal data on
family contexts, parenting, and child development across multiple generations, knowledge of the extent to
which these factors may be key mechanisms for intergenerational transmission of inequalities is limited. The
Future of (formerly Fragile) Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FF) is the only ongoing population-based birth
cohort study in the U.S. to currently follow three generations of family members. FF follows the parents (first
generation; G1) of initial birth cohort children (G2; born 1998-2000) and the G2 children (now young adults).
Survey and biological data are now being collected on all children born to G2 sample members (G3) as soon
as possible after their birth and will be collected on G2s at age 27. Data span economic, social, environmental,
and biological factors for each generation within a large and diverse national sample. The proposed study will
expand FF to include data at age 5 for all (G3) children born to G2 women. The project aims to: (1) Collect
data on family/caregiving context, parenting and grandparenting behaviors, and child health, socioemotional
development, achievement (cognition), and executive function for all G3 children born to female G2
respondents as they reach age 5; (2) Prepare all data and accompanying documentation to be publicly
available to the research community and fully linkable to all other FF data sources within 1 year of the end of
the award period; (3) Produce a comprehensive guide for implementing virtual assessments of children and
families in the context of a large-scale national study with specific attention to logistical considerations,
response rates, potential challenges (connectivity and quality therein, household distractions, child attention
and comprehension), and lessons learned, both overall and for particular subgroups of families; and (4)
Conduct preliminary analyses of intergenerational correlations of family context/caregiving environment,
economic resources, parenting behaviors, and child development among disadvantaged families. These data
will support novel and important studies of intergenerational transmission of family context, economic
resources, parenting behaviors, and child development; whether associations of family context, economic
resources, and parenting behaviors with child development are consistent or differ across generations; and
whether there is heterogeneity in these patterns by population characteristics. They will also (eventually)
support epigenetic analyses via DNA-based, sociodemographic, and environmental information on three
generations, including prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood data on G2 and G3. As such, FF, with the
inclusion of G3 early childhood assessments, holds unlimited potential to support novel and innovative multi-
generational research to inform public health and social policy."

Neonatal Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) originates from the underdeveloped germinal matrix, a site of cell
rapid cell division adjacent to the lateral ventricles of the brain. IVH leads to brain injury and life-long neurological
disability. Within the same time frame that neonatal IVH occurs, the brain is rapidly producing the cells needed
for myelination. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the brain, are derived from oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs are fragile cells - exquisitely sensitive to many factors present across multiple
neurological diseases such as excitotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. Across a wide
spectrum of neurological diseases, neuroinflammation disturbs OPC development. IVH both causes
inflammation and leads to white matter pathology. Microglia, the endogenous macrophages of the brain, are the
main effectors of neonatal neuroinflammation and are implicated in many forms of neonatal brain injury.
However, microglia also produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is required for normal OPC
development.
IGF-1 is decreased by other forms of neonatal brain injury but has not been studied in IVH. Our preliminary data
indicates that microglia increase production of inflammatory cytokines and reduce IGF-1 production after
exposure to hemoglobin. Both of these effects could impair OPC development. Supplementing IGF-1 after IVH
may be a powerful therapy because IGF-1 not only supports OPC health, but also modulates inflammation and
reduces production of cytokines that are harmful to OPCs. These dual roles of IGF-1: supporting OPC
development and altering the phenotype of immune cells (including microglia), makes it an excellent candidate
for treating IVH in which both inflammation and white matter pathology occur. This project is designed to better
understand how microglia respond to IVH, with a focus on how hemoglobin and IGF-1 affect inflammation and
OPC development. It is also designed to trace OPC fate after IVH and determine if myelination failure is due to
OPC loss versus maturation failure. We will trial IGF-1 as a therapy for IVH, and test its ability to modulate
microglial activation and improve myelination."

Despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is still not completely
understood. As a consequence, IPF causes significant morbidity and mortality and there are no therapies that
reverse existing fibrosis. IPF is characterized by accumulation of collagen and fibrotic extracellular matrix in the
lung that replace normal tissue and interfere with gas exchange, leading to dyspnea, respiratory failure, and
death. A key knowledge gap preventing our development of effective therapeutics is the understanding of how
collagen is degraded and turned over. If we were able to promote enhanced turnover and clearance of collagen
in fibrotic IPF, this could provide a viable strategy to reverse fibrosis in IPF. This grant proposes to address this
knowledge gap by delineating pathways of collagen clearance that we discovered by a recent unbiased CRISPR
screening approach. We have found a previously unappreciated mechanism of regulation of collagen clearance:
that collagen synthesis is sensed by cells internally and directly regulates clearance of collagen (i.e. cellular
uptake and degradation of extracellular collagen). The sensing mechanism is dependent on ER resident protein
SEL1L. This mechanism appears to be a homeostatic negative feedback loop to limit accumulation of collagen
in tissues. Importantly, we have also found that the induction of collagen turnover by collagen synthesis is
impaired in IPF, contributing to the excess and unmitigated buildup of collagen in lung tissue. The research
proposed in this grant will fully define the upstream and downstream mechanisms governing this pathway as
well as the cause of the impairment in this pathway in IPF. We will use mouse models, human lung organoids,
human IPF tissue and cells, and in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. If successful, the proposed research
has the potential to open the door to entirely new therapeutic avenues to try to reverse fibrosis in IPF and
ameliorate symptoms in patients."

Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate in tissues with increased organismal age. SnCs have been associated with
multiple age-associated chronic diseases and implicated as contributing pathological factors in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Brain vasculature aging contributes to AD progression and vascular dysfunction is observed early
on in the disease. Recent studies suggest that endothelial senescence impairs the barrier function of the brain
endothelium. However, SnCs within the brain vasculature have not been studied in the context of AD. I examined
multiple human and mouse single-cell RNA-seq datasets from organisms of different ages to create a resource
that identifies SnCs in different cell types and tissues. My preliminary data indicate that the brain vasculature
has an increased SnC burden in AD and that the blood-brain barrier expresses receptors for SnC signaling.
However, the phenotype and molecular signatures of AD-associated SnCs have not been resolved. I hypothesize
that senescent brain vascular cells have distinct and targetable molecular patterns and that their disruptive effect
on healthy vascular cells can be lessened by interrupting specific SnC signaling pathways. Moreover, I have
shown that transposable elements and human endogenous viral elements are upregulated in endothelial
inflammation, cellular senescence, and AD. Transposable elements differentially regulated in endothelial
inflammation were co-expressed with important inflammatory and senescence regulators, such as NFKB and
CDKN2A. I hypothesize that transposable elements expressed during inflammation and senescence contribute
to sterile inflammation and loss of blood-brain barrier integrity. I will transcriptionally characterize SnCs within
the brain vasculature of human AD patients and mouse models by examining existing single-cell AD datasets. I
will find unique patterns of mRNA expression, regulatory mechanisms, and cell-cell interactions specific to AD-
associated SnCs. I will train a semi-supervised convolutional neural network to identify senescent cells within
the AD brain vasculature. I will test how SnC signaling contributes to AD by ablating receptors required in SnC
signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells with CRISPR-Cas9 then test the effect on barrier integrity in
the presence of SASP molecules. Next, I will find transposable elements uniquely expressed in senescent brain
endothelial cells and bystander cells during AD. I will uncover regulatory mechanisms within the cells that
contribute to the aberrant activation of transposable elements and examine the pathways these elements
activate that contribute to barrier dysregulation. I will test how shRNA knockdown of expressed transposable
element RNA affects the inflammatory and barrier phenotypes in brain endothelial cells. The proposed studies
will teach me multiple computational approaches, such as machine learning, as well as advanced genetic
manipulation in cells and animal models."
10996882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Synapses are the primary sites of cell-cell contact in the nervous system and are
required for the proper function of neural circuits. Signaling molecules expressed on the
neuronal cell surface during early development instruct synapse formation and specify the
identity of synapses as excitatory or inhibitory. Proper balance between excitation and inhibition
is essential for proper nervous system function. Perturbations to this process are implicated in a
variety of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, epilepsy, and
schizophrenia. The proposed research will reveal key biological mechanisms of inhibitory
synapse formation and suggest pathways to target dysregulated excitatory-inhibitory balance in
various neurological disorders.
 Despite a robust understanding of the molecular mechanisms of excitatory synapse
formation, relatively little is known about inhibitory synapse formation. Previous work indicates
that the cleaved transmembrane protein Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), signaling via its receptor
PlexinB1, rapidly (~30 mins) promotes the formation of new inhibitory synapses in the adult
brain. In addition, Sema4D exclusively promotes inhibitory synapse formation while having no
effect on excitatory synapses, a property which thus far appears to be unique to Sema4D.
Further, previous work showed that treatment with Sema4D increases seizure resistance in
adult mice in vivo, suggesting that selectively increasing inhibitory synapse density may have
therapeutic applications.
 This proposal aims to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which new inhibitory
synapses are formed in the central nervous system by utilizing the unique ability of Sema4D to
rapidly promote inhibitory synapse formation. Using a live imaging approach, the proposed
experiments seek to determine how elements of the pre-and postsynaptic specialization
coordinate in real time to rapidly assemble new synapses under the control of Sema4D. This
approach will also provide insights into poorly understood processes which have been observed
during synapse formation, such as the splitting of presynaptic and postsynaptic protein
assemblies. Finally, these experiments will reveal intracellular signaling pathways which

10996884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiometabolic diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States. With rates of these diseases
rising, there is an urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors that contribute to cardiometabolic diseases. A
growing literature has shown that circadian disruption, including disturbances in the regularity of circadian activity
and misalignment of sleep to circadian activity, increases cardiometabolic disease risk. However, there is a
critical gap in our understanding of the sleep-related behaviors which lead to circadian disruption and subsequent
disease risk. Bedtime procrastination refers to the tendency to delay bedtime in the absence of external
obligations. Bedtime procrastinators often have late and irregular sleep timing and engage in behaviors that
increase evening light exposure, potentially serving to misalign and destabilize circadian rhythms. Through
circadian disruption and insufficient sleep, bedtime procrastination poses a risk to cardiometabolic health.
However, no research has investigated the role of bedtime procrastination in circadian disruption or
cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, to date, research on the mechanisms underlying bedtime procrastination
has centered on a single construct: self-regulation. However, emerging research suggests that there are two
distinct pathways leading to bedtime procrastination. The first pathway involves delaying bedtime due to
difficulties with disengaging from rewarding pre-sleep activities, and second involves delaying bedtime to avoid
pre-sleep anxiety. As intervention on the reward- and avoidance-driven pathways would require different
strategies, this lack of research represents a significant barrier to future research and treatment. Together, the
primary objective of this project is to advance a biopsychosocial model of bedtime procrastination. To accomplish
this objective, two studies will be conducted. The first study will evaluate the impact of bedtime procrastination
on circadian disruption (Aim 1) and the risk of bedtime procrastination to cardiometabolic health (Aim 2). Aims
1 and 2 will be evaluated in a sample of overweight individuals using innovative multidimensional assessment of
circadian disruption and cardiometabolic health over the course of a year. The second study seeks to elucidate
the roles of anxiety, reward, and self-regulation in the development of daily bedtime procrastination (Aim 3) using
an intensive longitudinal design in a large sample of young adults. This project will advance an integrated model
of bedtime procrastination. Given that nearly 75% of individuals report procrastinating their bedtime at least once
per week, and the extensive impact of this behavior on sleep health, bedtime procrastination likely has a
substantial impact on public health. Accordingly, this project will evaluate the impact of this behavior on circadian
disruption and cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, by elucidating the mechanisms that underly bedtime
procrastination, this project will lay the foundation for future research identifying treatment targets and developing
novel interventions for bedtime procrastination and circadian-sleep disturbances."

chaperone
Project Abstract
Proteins must fold into specific 3-dimensional structures to attain their function, but this process can be
error prone. Worse yet, accumulation of misfolded proteins can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s. To mitigate this risk, nature has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to assist protein folding
and assess their folding status. One such example is the endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control
(ERQC) cycle, where the enzyme UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) serves as the
master regulator. UGGT can sense the folding status of its clients and selectively adds a glucose residue
to the N-glycans of non-natively folded proteins. Substrates modified by UGGT are retained within the
ERQC cycle for further attempts at productive folding. Prior studies have determined that UGGT prefers
“near-native” substrates that present molten-globule conformations. Nonetheless, a structural description
of the folding-sensing mechanism of UGGT remains unknown. UGGT can act alone, but also forms a
complex with a co-chaperone, the 15-kDa selenoprotein (SEP15). This protein contains a redox-active
selenocysteine residue and is thought to aid UGGT in QC of disulfide-rich substrates, but few structural
and functional studies have been performed. This project will utilize a combination of cellular and
biophysical experiments to investigate the interactions of UGGT with its substrates and co-chaperones.
First, structural studies of UGGT and the UGGT/SEP15 complex are underway. These results will provide
insights into the concerted action of UGGT and SEP15. In parallel, endogenous substrates of
UGGT/Sep15 will be identified in mammalian cell culture using a glycoproteomics assay and their
maturation characterized. Second, UGGT-substrate interactions will be investigated using the disease-
causing null Hong Kong variant of ɑ1-antitrypsin as a model substrate. Specific UGGT residues involved
in client recognition will be identified using photo-crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) experiments.
This work will be performed under the guidance of two leaders in the field of protein homeostasis. Dr. Lila
Gierasch is a leader in the field of protein chaperone biophysics, while Dr. Daniel Hebert is an expert in
the cell biology of glycoprotein quality control. This project will leverage my background in analytical
chemistry and provide critical training in biochemistry and cell biology. Additionally, I will become well-
versed in the broader field of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). After completing the training described
in this proposal, I will be ready to launch my independent academic career studying the structural biology
of ER proteostasis."

The National Forum for Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention (National Forum) seeks funding in support of its
2024 Annual Meeting with the theme of “Advancing Health Equity Throughout America: Novel Data-Driven
Approaches”. The meeting will raise awareness and fluency in the newly developed Vital Conditions for
Health and Wellbeing (Vital Conditions) framework among medical and public health practitioners and
researchers. It will also ensure that discussions on health equity and its implications for cardiovascular disease
are framed within the Vital Conditions principles and recommendations. Furthermore, it will also present the
importance of using data-driven approaches to achieve improvements in health policy and healthcare systems
as well as increase perception of health equity and actions at community and individual levels. The meeting
specific aims/goals are (1)To engage public health professionals, health care decision-makers, researchers,
and the public in a conversation about the health equity implications of the Vital Conditions of Health and
Wellbeing, and how they can become the new norm within public health and healthcare settings. (2) To
identify data-driven approaches that can best inform the Vital Conditions levers for community change and
improvement. (3) To track, compile and disseminate improvements that meeting participants have taken back
to their constituents to form a practical body of knowledge on how the Vital Conditions can improve health
outcomes. The National Forum’s impact in previous meetings has been to bring together stakeholders who
then take diverse perspectives and action items back to their constituents to enact practical changes to
enhance health outcomes and community resilience as relates to cardiovascular health. In line with previous
convenings, we expect 300 participants at our Annual Meeting 2024 from across all health sectors with
significant underrepresented minority and women participation as reflected in our organizing committee and
speaker panel. Follow up activities will include on-demand video, a summary of recommendations and a digital
one pager with links to all conference materials and references. It will also include tracking of ideas, actions, or
policies that were implemented because of the strategies and information presented at the meeting to create a
national map of impact."
10997554,"Abstract: Adolescents need accurate information about contraception to participate in shared decision-making
about sexual and reproductive health, including preventing teen pregnancy. Yet decision-making can be difficult
amidst an increasingly vast and complex health information environment—or “infosphere”—driven by the
expansion of the internet and social media. Digital health information about contraception ranges in quality, with
social media often circulating incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information about side effects, impacts on
fertility, and rates of effectiveness. Adolescents are an especially high-priority group with whom to engage due
to 1) unique ethical-legal challenges surrounding sexual and reproductive among minors; 2) increasingly
restrictive reproductive policies post-Dobbs; 3) racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health inequities in rates of
teen pregnancy and access to comprehensive sexual education; and 4) adolescents’ limited skillset and lack of
supportive relationships to critically engage with sensitive health information online.
 Clinicians who care for adolescents can fill a critical gap in promoting reliable health information and
supporting shared decisions about contraception. Yet studies show that clinicians often avoid extensive
engagement with patients on the topic of misinformation and other internet information due to lack of time and
training. As young people are increasingly exposed to health information on social media, research is needed to
understand how clinicians can support adolescent patients’ emerging autonomy and contraceptive adherence,
particularly as they integrate components of their digital health infosphere into the contraceptive decision-making
process. Discussion of a patient’s infosphere can be incorporated into adolescent-tailored patient-centered
contraceptive counseling (PCCC), an approach that centers autonomy and limits contraceptive coercion.
 To help pediatricians provide PCCC that incorporates adolescents’ digital infospheres, our objectives are: 1)
collect and review content and communication strategies related to the adolescent digital contraception
infosphere, including conducting a relevant qualitative content analysis of Reddit; 2) develop a Counseling about
Contraception Digital Information (CCDI) framework and training module to help clinicians incorporate
adolescents’ online information-seeking into PCCC; and 3) use mixed methods to evaluate pediatrician-reported
acceptability, appropriateness, and self-efficacy related to the CCDI module within the context of a larger training
pilot called Adolescent-Centered Counseling and Empowerment Skills for Success (ACCESS).
 This project fills a crucial gap by conducting, to our knowledge, the first content analysis of adolescent-
focused contraception information online. Furthermore, the study will develop a modern, adolescent-adapted,
and stakeholder-informed PCCC training for clinicians that addresses a high-priority population’s digital
contraception infosphere. This study has potential future adaptations in many other areas of health that are also
impacted by complex digital infospheres."

Voice disorders represent a significant healthcare cost in the US, and a notable patient burden on quality of
life. Vocal fold scar, which occurs because of injury (iatrogenic) or idiopathically, often results in significant
alteration of the voice and is a particularly difficult condition to treat. There is no single treatment modality that
is successful for the majority of patients, nor is there a gold standard practice pattern for vocal fold scar
management. A key limiting factor in treatment development is insufficient understanding of the activity in gene
pathways that lead to the production of molecular components found in fibrotic scar tissue. Broadly, TGF- β
(transforming growth factor beta) signaling pathway has been linked to fibrotic phenotypes in stratified
squamous epithelial cell environments throughout the body. In vocal folds specifically, downstream genetic
effectors of the TGF-β signaling pathway have been implicated in fibrosis in prior studies. The aim of this study
is to comprehensively examine the TGF-β pathway and identify the specific transcript-level changes
associated with vocal fold scar. To achieve this goal, this proposal is comprised of three study aims: (1) Derive
the expression of extracellular matrix components and TGF-β pathway genes in vocal fold scar using an
established in vivo rabbit model, (2) Identify specific contributions of TGF-β pathway genes to vocal fold scar
by a priori overexpression in primary vocal fold cell lines, (3) Compare expression of TGF-β pathway
transcripts from the animal scar model to laryngeal secretion samples from vocal fold scar patients. This
proposal represents a significant step to investigate gene pathways that lead to vocal fold scar and marks the
first attempt to confirm these pathways in in vivo and in vitro models. As a direct result of this proposal, we will
gain a more complex understanding of the genetic influence on vocal fold scar. Thus, the findings have the
potential to inform new targets for therapeutic management of this difficult to treat voice condition.

10998425,"Project Summary
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy with substantial racial-ethnic disparities,
with women of color facing the greatest disadvantage. These GDM disparities have profound implications for
life course disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Recently we conducted a novel
data linkage between New York City birth certificate and HbA1c registry databases to construct a multiethnic
population-based cohort to follow women after delivery from 2009-2017, the A1c in Pregnancy and Postpartum
Linkage for Equity (APPLE) NYC Cohort. When following women with GDM, we found stark racial-ethnic
disparities in progression to T2DM, with Black, Latina, and South Asian women having 2 to 4.5 times the risk of
non-Latina White women. Despite these important findings, very little is known about what causes disparities to
emerge in the years after a GDM pregnancy. Current research focuses on individual risk; however, it does not
identify neighborhood contextual risk factors to inform targets for policy intervention and lacks racial-ethnic
diversity. Structural inequities and neighborhood context may be especially potent in the postpartum period, as
women of color often face social and economic challenges while their bodies recover and continue to evolve
physiologically. Identifying policy levers to intervene ""upstream” during the critical postpartum period has the
potential to dismantle structural inequities that drive individual level T2DM risk factors. Therefore, we propose a
concurrent mixed-methods study, leveraging our retrospective cohort of 21,695 multiethnic women with GDM,
the APPLE NYC Cohort, qualitative interviews with postpartum women, and an innovative systems science
modeling approach. Our overall goal is to identify policy levers to prevent progression to T2DM after GDM in
the postpartum period and reduce racial-ethnic disparities. First, we will use data from the APPLE NYC cohort,
to measure associations between social and built environment and longitudinal T2DM outcomes after GDM.
Next, we will explore the lived experiences of women of color in the years following a GDM pregnancy by
conducting in-depth interviews with Black, Latina, and South Asian women who experienced GDM during
pregnancy, including those who have and have not progressed to T2DM, up to 10 years postpartum. Finally,
we will develop an agent-based model to assess and compare potential policy interventions to improve T2DM
outcomes after GDM and reduce racial-ethnic disparities. To do so we will identify a set of policy scenarios to
alter structural inequities in the social and built environment, use the agent-based model to assess the impact
on the risk of T2DM inequities, and will utilize the APPLE NYC cohort to validate the model. Our proposed
study not only fills gaps in targeted research in the prevention of T2DM, but also shifts the paradigm of post-
GDM T2DM prevention to an ecosocial framework. Our findings will be a key resource for policymakers on how
to disrupt progression from GDM to T2DM and reduce life course racial-ethnic inequities."
10997577,"Project Summary
Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with a 5-year survival
rate of 12%. Despite the success of immune-modulating therapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
in other cancers such as melanoma, single agent ICB is decidedly ineffective in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), leaving surgery and palliative chemotherapy the only options for over 80% of patients.
CD8 T cells are the key effectors of anti-tumor immune responses that recognize and eliminate early malignant
cells and can enforce durable responses that prevent recurrence and metastatic spread through adaptive
immune memory. In PDAC, chronic exposure to cellular constituents in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads
to the terminal dysfunction of CD8 T cells, termed “exhaustion”. Exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX) have reduced
proliferative capacity, an inability to persist and proliferate, and limited protective capacity compared to functional
CD8 T cells which is a major barrier to the success of immunotherapy in PDAC. Stelekati et. al. has recently
shown that antagonizing surface checkpoint molecules (such as PD-1) in chronic infection can synergize with
overexpression of one micro-RNA (miR), miR-29a, in CD8 T cells to abrogate TEX differentiation and restore
antigen-specific cytotoxicity and T cell memory In parallel, the Datta lab at UMMSM has recently uncovered TNF
signaling to drive T cell dysfunction in PDAC through a myeloid TNF-TNFR2 dependent manner. The goal of this
project is to determine the contribution of TNFR2-miR-29a to CD8 T cell dysfunction in PDAC to generate durable
T-cell mediated antitumor activity. I hypothesize that miR-29a regulates TEX differentiation by downregulating
immunosuppressive signaling and provides a promising intervention to overcome resistance to immune
checkpoint blockade in PDAC. Using the canonical KPC model of PDAC engineered to express the neoantigen
Ova, I retrovirally overexpress (OE) miR-29a in antigen-specific OT-1 CD8 T cells and observed improved tumor
clearance, along with altered phenotypic states. Consequently, in this project I aim to: (1) alter the differentiation
of terminally exhausted cells to a progenitor and memory-like phenotype that express Ly108, TCF-1, and CD127,
which has shown to be the subset responsive to a-PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy. I will then validate the
translational importance of these findings by developing an effective combination strategy using miR-29a in mice;
(2) determine the precise contribution of myeloid-derived TNF-TNFR2 signaling upstream of terminal TEX
differentiation in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. By validating this novel mechanistic link between myeloid
immunosuppression and terminal T cell exhaustion, this work may uncover tolerogenic circuitries characteristic
of immunosuppressive TME’s such as PDAC. Taken together, this work will enhance our understanding of T cell
dysfunction in the PDAC TME and elucidate a novel TNFR2-miR-29a axis that provides an attractive target to
be further explored therapeutically in PDAC patients."
10975411,"Project Summary/Abstract: Candida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS), due to Candida colonization and
biofilm formation on the denture surface, is a significant clinical concern and affects up to 67% of denture
wearers. Fungal biofilms serve as a reservoir for various oral bacteria that cause oral health problems and
systemic infections. Currently, strategies for controlling CADS are clinically challenging and have high reinfection
rates, particularly in elderly and/or immunologically- or medically-compromised patients.
This proposal is being submitted in response to NIDCR RFA-DE-24-004 and aims to use natural salivary
anticandidal peptides/proteins in multilayer coatings on dentures to control CADS. We have previously
demonstrated that covalently binding functional polymers, such as poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), onto
conventional dentures enhances the binding of cationic anticandidal biomolecules, including histatin 5 (H-5), a
major salivary polypeptide of the histatin family with high anticandidal activity. The PMAA functionalized denture
material maintained the physical/mechanical properties of the original resin. We have further used a layer-by-
layer (LBL) self-assembly technology (alternating the deposition of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes) by
pairing H-5 with hyaluronic acid (HA), an anionic unsulfated salivary glycosaminoglycan, to form H-5/HA
multilayer coatings, resulting in an increase in the H-5 content on the surface of the denture material. Using H-5
as the outermost layer, the LBL self-assembled H-5/HA multilayer coatings inhibited Candida adhesion and had
long-lasting (weeks to months) anticandidal effects that blocked Candida biofilm formation. The LBL coatings
were stable and remained on the denture surface after extensive mechanical brushing (e.g., >20,000 cycles of
brushing).
The long-term goal of this project is to use normal salivary components as natural and safe antifungal
therapeutics for controlling Candida biofilm formation and managing CADS. The main objectives of this proposal
are to evaluate the efficacy of salivary anticandidal peptides/proteins in multilayer coatings for controlling
Candida biofilm formation on rat dentures and in a novel rat denture stomatitis model. The specific aims of the
proposed research are: (1) to fabricate rat dentures with salivary anticandidal peptide/protein-based LBL
multilayer coatings; (2) to evaluate the anticandidal activity and biocompatibility of the functionalized and coated
dentures in vitro; and (3) to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of the dentures coated with salivary anticandidal
peptide/protein multilayers in vitro and in vivo. If successful, this new denture technology will be the first
therapeutic denture using natural salivary components to provide a long-term biofilm-controlling effects, prevent
unnecessary drug exposure, and minimize the risk of developing Candida resistance. These anticandidal
technologies will not only have a significant impact on clinical dentistry but may also provide new materials for a
variety of medical devices (e.g., catheters, endotracheal tubes) and reduce hospital-acquired infections."

People living with dementia (PLWD) from racial-ethnic minoritized groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged
environments are more likely to face barriers to diagnosis, care, and services. Multiple social determinants of
health (SDoH) contribute to the disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD)
progression and the quality of AD/ADRD care. Thus, AD/ADRD is a public health crisis that must be managed
not only by traditional medical care but also by addressing patients’ unmet social needs. Artificial intelligence (AI)
and large real-world data (RWD), such as electronic health records (EHR), offer an opportunity to develop
innovative approaches that improve health and health equity by addressing SDoH.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based social risk management platform -
ISMART (intelligent Social risk Management in AD/ADRD paTients) - that can be embedded into EHR
systems to improve the quality of care and quality of life of PLWD. We will use RWD from the OneFlorida+
network, a member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), comprising EHR
data from >20M individuals. We will leverage our prior work that established an external exposome database
with contextual SDoH measures documenting social and physical environments and a natural language
processing pipeline that can extract person-level SDoH (including caregiver information) from clinical narratives
in EHRs. Our study will follow an intervention mapping approach that engages a Stakeholder Advisory
Committee to achieve three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will build an RWD cohort of PLWD and to identify key
contextual and person-level SDoH associated with PLWD care and outcomes. In Aim 2, we will develop ML-
based social risk management algorithms for dementia care and outcomes, including (a) a fair individualized
polysocial risk score (iPsRS) to screen for unmet social needs in PLWD; and (b) causal-principled AI methods
to quantify the causal, heterogeneous effect of key actionable SDoH (e.g., food) on PLWD care and outcomes.
In Aim 3, we will co-design with stakeholders the ISMART platform, including (a) prototyping ISMART platform
following a User-Centered Design process; and (b) developing recommendations for future implementation and
evaluation via focus groups and Delphi panels.
The success of our project will lead to the development of ISMART prototype for social risk management in
PLWD, with a set of strategies for future implementation and evaluation. Our innovative, structured approach to
integrating social risk management with health care of PLWD may lead to a necessary paradigm shift in US
health care delivery."

Dental, Oral and Craniofacial health (DOC) plays a significant factor in the overall well-being of
the population. About half of all birth defects are associated with craniofacial malformations.
Many other genetic conditions manifest themselves via phenotypes in the face and skull and are
associated with communication disorders, neurological development and other factors.
Furthermore, oral health plays a significant role in overall human health.
Driven by the importance of DOC research to overall human health, the National Institute of
Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) established the FaceBase Consortium in 2009 to
advance research relevant to the NIDCR mission by creating comprehensive datasets of
craniofacial development and dysmorphologies in order to disseminate these datasets to the
wider craniofacial research community and support reuse of data for new research projects and
collaborations. SInce its creation, FaceBase has become a central data repository resource
funded for diverse dental and craniofacial researchers.
We propose to build on the success of FaceBase to date to 1) expand our inclusive community
outreach, training, and education resources by fostering an active and diverse community of
users across the translational spectrum of Dental, Oral and Craniofacial (DOC) and related

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in 887,000 deaths annually. The central challenge in curing
HBV is eradication of the stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the viral genome, which
depends on elusive host factors for its generation. Using a yeast extract screen, we identified five core
components of lagging strand synthesis –PCNA, the replication factor C (RFC) complex, DNA polymerase δ
(POLδ), FEN-1, and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) – as essential for cccDNA formation. We reconstituted cccDNA
formation with purified human homologs, establishing these as a minimal set of factors necessary and
sufficient for cccDNA formation. We further demonstrated that inhibiting POLδ significantly diminishes
cccDNA formation. In this proposal, we will build on these findings to determine the precise kinetics of
cccDNA formation, delineating the role of each factor at every step of the repair process. In understanding the
dynamics of rcDNA to cccDNA repair, we can identify potential rate-limiting steps that could be novel
therapeutic targets for disrupting cccDNA formation and maintenance. Using a series of innovative techniques
in both cell culture and mouse model systems, we will be able to test our findings in physiologically relevant
platforms that will strengthen the impact of our data. Factors found to be critical for rc- to cccDNA
conversion will be disrupted in these systems by a degron-mediated approach that will allow for fine-tuned
control of expression to alleviate any potential cytotoxicity. We can then monitor the effect of each factor in
turn on cccDNA formation or the maintenance of established cccDNA pools in chronically infected cells. To
increase the resolution of such studies, we will also examine at the single-cell level how the expression levels
of a given factor correlate with that of cccDNA. Altogether, these data will give us a far more comprehensive
view of this process critical to the persistence of HBV in chronically infected individuals."

This R50 proposal is a companion to our recently renewed R35 (CA210036-08), which is focused on the
role of telomeres in cancer. Telomeres are required for the survival and proliferation of human cells and play
a critical role in cancer. Excessively long telomeres at birth predispose to a wide variety of cancers,
presumably because long telomeres delay the Hayflick limit to a stage in tumorigenesis when incipient
cancers have already disabled the cell cycle arrest response to short telomeres. Conversely, in the short
telomere syndromes (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita and Coats plus syndrome) loss of telomeric DNA curbs
the vitality of stem-cell compartments and instigates multi-organ failure. This proposal focuses on CST, the
trimeric ssDNA-binding complex composed of Ctc1, Stn1, and Ten1 and its associated Pola/primase. CST–
Pola/primase has a dual role at telomeres: it mediates maintenance of the telomeric C-strand and it
regulates telomerase, preventing the excessively long telomeres that lead to cancer predisposition.
As described in the preliminary data, we recently discovered a new end-replication problem that is not
solved by telomerase. This problem arises from the inability of the replisome to sustain lagging-strand
synthesis when it reaches the end of a linear DNA, a phenomenon we demonstrated using in vitro DNA
replication in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Yeeles (LMB, Cambridge). I showed that the C-strand of
telomeres shortens by ~60 nt during lagging-strand DNA synthesis in vivo and that the CST–Pola-primase
complex is required to counteract this shortening. My additional preliminary data showed how CST–Pola-
primase is recruited to telomeres. In collaboration with graduate student Sarah Cai, I demonstrated that
CST binds to the shelterin subunit POT1, not TPP1, as had been anticipated. We derived the Cryo-EM
structure of POT1 bound to CST and found that POT1 must be phosphorylated to recruit the complex to
telomeres.
These pathbreaking findings form the basis of my current proposal to determine how recruitment of CST–
Pola/primase is regulated. My aims are to identify the kinase that phosphorylates POT1 to allow CST binding,
study its regulation at telomeres, determine how dephosphorylation of POT1 releases CST–Pola/primase into
the active fill-in complex, and how CST controls telomerase. I am a long-term member of the Unit Director’s
group and a pivotal contributor to our R35 program. I have developed new technologies that are essential for
our research. I am highly skilled, rigorous, creative, collaborative, and completely committed to the Unit
Director’s research on the role of telomeres in cancer. My career goal is to continue to excel and support the
success of the R35 through innovative research that delivers breakthrough discoveries."

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene locus in humans (human leukocyte antigens (HLA)
class I) is the most polymorphic of human genes. Individual variants have profound influences on disease
outcomes in infectious and inflammatory diseases and in cancer. HLA class I variants display distinct peptide
binding preferences which allows a diverse set of peptide antigens to be presented to T cell receptors (TCRs)
of CD8+ T cells. MHC class I molecules also play critical roles in the natural killer (NK) cell response via the
engagement of activating and inhibitory receptors of NK cells. In the textbook defined MHC class I assembly
pathway, peptides are derived from the cytosol of cells, transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the
transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), and bound to MHC class I molecules in the ER in a
process edited by tapasin. This pathway is expected to culminate in the presentation of a stable repertoire of
high affinity peptide-MHC class I complexes on the cell surface. However, there is also a need to maintain
surveillance of endosomal compartments, as antigens derived from these compartments initiate CD8+ T cell
responses. Additionally, many HLA class I variants can assemble independently of components the classical
pathway. Some HLA class I allotypes are also found in complex with peptides that have broad predicted
affinity ranges, and present as imperfect and peptide-receptive forms in cells. There are fundamental
gaps in our knowledge about the non-canonical pathways that govern the formation of such molecules and
their functions in the immune response. It is our central hypothesis that a balance of canonical and non-
canonical HLA class assembly pathways is needed to enable both cytosolic and endosomal
surveillance, immunity in the face of pathogen evasion of the canonical pathway, and immunity under
conditions of inflammatory and nutritional stress. To address this hypothesis, the endosomal HLA class I
assembly pathway will be interrogated, to examine how specific factors affect the expression, localization,
and antigen presentation functions of different HLA class I allotypes. Additionally, assembly under tapasin
and TAP deficient conditions will also be examined, with a focus on their intersections with the
endolysosomal pathway, the resulting immunopeptidomes, and glycosylation changes to HLA class I
molecules. Together, these studies will unravel how HLA class I molecules maintain multicompartmental
immune surveillance and elucidate how the divergent assembly features of HLA class I allotypes ensure the
maintenance of immunity under pathogenic conditions. This knowledge will be important towards the
development of future immunotherapeutic strategies, by identifying features of HLA class I molecules that can
be exploited for enhanced immune protection."

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impairments in social-emotional reciprocity and restricted
behaviors and interests. Language outcomes in autism are heterogenous; impairments in language appear early
in development, are associated with poor functional outcomes, and are resistant to treatment. Individual
differences in language abilities are associated with language efficiency; decreased efficiency in spoken word
recognition contribute to language impairments in autism, though to date the mechanisms are unspecified.
Studies of clinical populations suggest two candidate mechanisms: inefficient competition suppression and
slowed auditory processing. The proposed predoctoral training and research, which addresses a top NIDCD
research priority, will utilize EEG and machine learning to examine individual differences in the temporal and
neural dynamics of spoken word recognition in autism, and their relationship to standardized measures of
language abilities. Autistic adults ages 18-35 with a wide range of language abilities, and language-matched
neurotypical (NT) peers (n = 25 autistic, 25 NT) will complete an EEG/ERP spoken word and nonword recognition
design. Computational modeling will employ a support vector machine classification framework using ERP
response profiles to decode what word an individual heard. This “decoder” captures individual differences in
word recognition precisely and reliably. Analyses will use machine learning to achieve the following Specific
Aims and test associated hypotheses: (1) Model group-level ERP responses to words and nonwords in autistic
versus NT groups; (2) Test individual decoder accuracy as a predictor of language abilities; and (3) Test decoder
accuracy for words embedded in sentences of varying linguistic predictability. The ERP paradigm presents
minimal task demands, and is well suited for studies of individuals with language and cognitive impairments.
Theoretically driven aims and hypotheses will clarify the role of efficiency in spoken word recognition in language
deficits in autism to inform targeted early intervention. Training Plan: The individually tailored training plan
dovetails with research activities and includes methodological training in neuroimaging and computational
modeling; education in language, autism, cognitive neuroscience, and responsible conduct of research; and
professional development in scientific and community settings. Proposed activities include coursework,
interdisciplinary mentorship, methodological workshops, professional seminars, community outreach,
conference presentations, and manuscript preparation. Environment: The mentorship team has a strong NIH
funding record. Univ. of Connecticut is a Research 1 public institution, and the Dept. of Psychological Sciences
ranks in the top 10 for U.S. grant funding. UConn boasts a large community of interdisciplinary language sciences
researchers and a research-dedicated neuroimaging center that prioritizes graduate training. The application is
ideally situated to accomplish the current fellowship proposal."

Reprogramming is crucial for cellular renewal in adult organs that lack dedicated stem cells to replace loss after
injury and inflammation. Because such cell plasticity is likely to be executed by a conserved cellular program,
we have begun to identify the conserved cellular-molecular features of the process of recruiting differentiated
cells as progenitors. The term paligenosis has been recently coined to describe an evolutionary conserved
process that a differentiated cell uses to downscale its organelle contents, activate a progenitor-like gene
network, and reenter the cell cycle. This project investigates upstream triggers of paligenosis. Using a high-dose
tamoxifen injury model to induce paligenosis in zymogenic chief cells of murine stomach corpus, ultrastructural
changes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) were observed during paligenosis initiation (e.g., swelling of
the rER lamellae, liberation of ribosomes from rER, and overall loss of ER). This leads to the hypothesis that
dynamic changes in ER are an upstream event in paligenosis. ER functioning is in part monitored by the
integrated stress response with the paramount ER stress sensor being PERK, a kinase that inhibits translation
of mRNA on the ribosome by phosphorylating the translation initiation protein eIF2α. Phosphorylated eIF2α halts
global translation while upregulating a specific set of genes to restore homeostasis. Data show that high-dose
tamoxifen activates the integrated stress response in paligenotic zymogenic chief cells, triggering global
attenuation of protein synthesis. Preliminary data also indicate that disassembly of rER is an early paligenosis
event, supporting the hypothesis that early events of paligenosis are driven by the PERK-integrated stress
response pathway and the dynamic regulation and autophagy of rER. Aim 1 of this project thus seeks to detail
activation of PERK over a time course early in paligenosis in the high-dose tamoxifen injury model, and then test
the PERK requirement using PERK and integrated stress response inhibitors, and PerkΔ/Δ mice crossed to chief
cell-specific promoter mice. Sufficiency will be tested by inducing ER stress and by drug-induced activation of
PERK. Aim 2 will detail paligenotic ER remodeling in a high-dose tamoxifen model, as well as investigate the
impact of hydroxychloroquine treatment and blocking autophagolysome activity in paligenotic-lysosome-
defective Atf3−/− mice. Using ER-phagy defective mice (Ccpg1−/−), the effect of ER-phagy deficiency on
paligenosis will be examined. The project ultimately seeks to provide new insights on the dynamic functionality
of the ER and its role and necessity in homeostasis and during cellular regeneration."
10997537,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Child maltreatment occurs at alarmingly high rates and represents a serious threat to children’s healthy
development, with negative ramifications lasting into adulthood. Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV),
child abuse, and neglect are particularly detrimental and frequently co-occur. IPV, which typically has an onset
during women’s childbearing years, is one of the single largest risk factors for subsequent child maltreatment.
Therefore, preventing child IPV exposure is critical for child maltreatment prevention and may be effectively
targeted in programming during pregnancy. In order to promote a healthy parent-child relationship, enhancing
maternal sensitivity is another key process that should be targeted in prevention approaches for child
maltreatment. In this project, we propose an innovative approach that combines efforts to address IPV and to
support the mother-child relationship in two developmental periods to prevent child maltreatment. Using a
multi-site, randomized controlled trial design, the proposed project aims to assess the individual and combined
contributions of prenatal and postnatal programming to prevent child maltreatment. We will evaluate the
Pregnant Moms’ Empowerment Program (PMEP), a 5-session group program for women exposed to IPV that
is delivered during pregnancy, and the Reminiscing and Emotion Training (RET) program as an additional
preventative program delivered when children are 3-6 years old. In addition to testing the independent and
synergistic effects of the programs in preventing child maltreatment, we will evaluate mechanisms of treatment
change. Participants will include 300 mother-child dyads drawn from an ongoing randomized controlled trial of
PMEP (n=230; R01HD098092, MPIs Miller-Graff & Howell) and newly recruited pregnant, IPV-exposed women
who will complete the identical PMEP randomized controlled trial protocol at the beginning of the current grant
period (n=70). The PMEP trial arm includes randomization to PMEP or prenatal control conditions, and 4
assessments (baseline [T1], post-test [T2], 3-month [T3] and 12-month [T4] post-partum follow-ups). When the
children of women who participated in the PMEP trial arm are 3-6 years old, dyads will be re-randomized to
receive RET or early childhood control conditions. Families will complete 4 additional assessments during the
RET trial arm (baseline [T5], post-test [T6], 3-month [T7] and 6-month [T8] follow-ups). Thus, the study is a 2x2
randomized factorial design (i.e., PMEP in pregnancy (Y/N) x RET in early childhood (Y/N)). Our central
hypothesis is that the PMEP and RET programs will each prevent child maltreatment. We anticipate that the
effect of PMEP will be mediated by change in IPV and maternal sensitivity, while the effect of RET will be
mediated by change in maternal sensitivity. We further expect that the effects of RET on child maltreatment will
be magnified for women who participated in PMEP, such that RET is more effective in the context of PMEP-
related reductions in IPV and enhancement of maternal sensitivity. This project is innovative in its use of a
multi-site, multi-method design and significant in addressing the needs of a vulnerable population."

 The crowded conditions within cells present a complex physicochemical challenge for maintaining the
solubility and fluidity of thousands of distinct macromolecules. High macromolecular densities promote assembly
into a variety of distinct structures, which in turn can lead to the formation of insoluble solid aggregates. Though
solidified structures could indeed serve protective purposes or as quiescent storage sites, they are more
generally considered to be toxic to the cell. The physical constraints and properties generated by crowded cellular
environments, which contribute significantly to the functional behaviors of the resident molecules, are often
difficult to probe experimentally. In addition to membrane-bound compartments, which define the primary
structural organization of cells, numerous membraneless organelles (MLOs) populate the cytoplasm and the
nucleoplasm providing additional complexity. These biomolecular condensates (BMCs) form via liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS), a process that concentrates the resident macromolecules, but which in turn also can
promote additional phase states, including solid aggregates. Multiple BMC-resident proteins that undergo LLPS
in vitro are the dominant proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions found in patients with a range of devastating
neurological disorders. In one such example, the fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein accumulates in MLOs termed
stress granules (SGs), which form as a natural response to various cellular stress conditions. The high molecular
density of FUS in SGs is potentially an essential early step toward the formation of FUS-containing solid
inclusions linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Directly observing
the formation and growth of such inclusions within a cellular context is challenged by the lack of appropriate
tools. While genetic approaches to attach fluorescent tags are commonly used to determine spatiotemporal
behaviors, their attachment can often perturb function, there are generally only a few reasonable attachment
points, and such probes have inferior photophysical properties. Recent improvements in genetic code expansion
to incorporate non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) for in cellulo labeling promises to significantly extend the types
of questions that may be addressed. This is particularly relevant for the application of multiple single molecule
biophysical strategies. The Specific Aim of the proposed work is to identify and characterize solid aggregates
within live cells. To accomplish this, designer MLOs will be used to specifically modify FUS via ncAA-mediated
fluorescent labeling in cells. Microsecond-scale single molecule rotational diffusion (µs-SiMRoD) microscopy will
then be used to probe for local environmental constraints such as increased viscosity or structural confinement.
The target application will be identifying and monitoring solidified FUS-containing aggregates. This strategy is
expected to be instrumental for identifying unknown pathways leading to the formation of solid aggregates, and
thus, it will likely provide new leads into disease onset. The developed methods are expected to be broadly
useful for probing the physical properties of numerous BMCs within cells."
10986832,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease with unmet medical needs. Currently,
available therapies fail to substantially reduce PAH progression and mortality, which remains near 50% five years
after diagnosis. The cancer-like proliferation of the distal pulmonary arteries is the primary cause of increased
pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to right heart failure. Recent studies highlighted a critical role of metabolic
reprogramming in triggering pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, the particular mechanistic link that
connects the metabolic reprogramming with the uncontrolled proliferation of pulmonary vascular cells has not
been established. Nevertheless, the lack of this knowledge generates a critical barrier that prevents effective
therapeutics that target vascular remodeling. During the previous grant cycle, we showed that increased
oxidative stress in the PAH lungs in patients and animal models results in the nitration mediated Akt activation.
The activation of Akt via nitration of tyrosine Y350 induces overexpression of Pyruvate Carboxylase (PC), leading
to anaplerotic stimulation of remodeling. We reported that inhibition of both Akt nitration or PC-mediated
anaplerosis resulted in marked attenuation of PAH in preclinical models. In cell culture experiments, we observed
that Akt nitration changes the pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) morphology, proliferation rate, and gene
expressions. The microarray profiling showed upregulation of multiple markers of Endothelial to Mesenchymal
Transition (EndMT) in response to Akt nitration (PDGFRa, TGFbR, SMAD3, RUNX2). To identify the possible
mechanisms of EndMT, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis of PC interactome. We found a direct
binding of PC to the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) attenuated by Akt nitration inhibition. Our data indicate
that PC could activate CDK5 in the cytosol. CDK5, in turn, phosphorylates RUNX2 – a well-established mediator
of mesenchymal transition. Indeed, two recent publications showed activation of CDKs and RUNX2 signaling in
PAH patients. However, these reports did not provide mechanistic insights. In the current proposal, we
hypothesize that Akt nitration triggers PC expression and accumulation in the cytosol leading to activation of the
CDK5/RUNX2 axis-mediated EndMT and vascular remodeling in PAH. We will test this hypothesis with the
following aims: 1) To elucidate the role of nitration (Y350) mediated Akt activation in EndMT events; 2) To
determine whether cytosolic PC plays a key role in CDK5/RUNX2 axis activation; 3) To examine the effect of
targeted protein degraders (PROTACs) on EndMT in vivo."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
Multiple lines of evidence have shown that cancer cells frequently become addicted to active nuclear cytoplasmic
transport to sustain their activities including growth and metastasis. A RAN gradient, with high nuclear RAN-GTP
concentration, is required for proper shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The RAN guanine
exchange factor, known as regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1), activates RAN and maintains and
catalyzes RAN-GTP formation in the nucleus. The role of this axis in PDAC is not fully understood. Our
preliminary data show that high RCC1 is correlated with poor patient prognosis. Our studies demonstrate that
Rcc1 depletion in murine PDAC cells alters the steady state distribution of Ran, resulting in widespread
alterations in the subcellular proteome. We found that several cellular pathways are impacted by Rcc1 depletion,
including amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, as well as RNA processing. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that RCC1 is crucial for PDAC maintenance, and its overexpression may play a role in tumor
progression. Therefore, in the F99 phase, I propose to investigate the role and mechanisms by which RCC1
alters PDAC metabolic activity to drive progression using state-of-the-art transcriptomics and metabolomics
approaches. I will also delineate the role of the RAN-RCC1 axis in the regulation of mRNA processing and
alternative splicing using several imaging and molecular studies. Finally, I will use the well-studied KPC mouse
model of PDAC, crossed with a conditional RCC1 overexpression model, to determine the role of RCC1
overexpression in PDAC development and progression. Most patients with PDAC will die due to metastatic
disease. In the K00 phase, I will focus on studying the metastatic PDAC process. I will investigate the complex
mechanisms of crosstalk between tumor cells and metastasis target organ microenvironment. I aim to determine
how the RAN-RCC1 axis is implicated in driving metastatic progression using animal models and patient tissues.
Results from these studies aim to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive PDAC progression.
Our studies will potentially identify potential new vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets with the ultimate goal of
improving treatments and outcomes for patients suffering from this aggressive disease."

Severe malaria kills hundreds of thousands of children across sub-Saharan Africa annually, accounting for most
malaria-related deaths globally. We have not yet identified the exact parasite genes responsible for severe
disease that could be targets for vaccine or drug development. Parasite variant surface antigens – genetically
diverse malaria proteins expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes - appear to play a critical role in severe
malaria pathogenesis. We recently developed a novel strategy to de novo sequence variant surface antigen
transcripts from whole blood using RNA-seq with a custom capture array to enrich for variant surface antigen
detection. Our newly developed capacity to determine full-length transcripts present in severe malaria infections
enables comprehensive identification of gene expression signatures for clinical syndromes and for comparisons
of such signatures across severe malaria subtypes and different geographies. Using this approach in Mali, we
have identified parasite variant surface antigens expressed solely in severe disease and other variant surface
antigens differentially expressed in severe versus mild disease that are known to target multiple human host
receptors. Our central hypothesis is that severe malarial disease is the result of a subset of virulent parasite
variant surface antigens that are common across sub-Saharan Africa. We will sequence the variant surface
antigen transcripts in severe malaria cases and matched uncomplicated malaria controls in Zambian children
and adults (Aim 1). We will then use a custom protein microarray featuring a comprehensive representation of
variant surface antigens to determine the malaria parasite variant surface antigens associated with increased
vulnerability to severe malarial in Zambian children and adults (Aim 2). This microarray will be populated with
severe disease variant surface antigens from Zambia sequenced in Aim 1, from Mali and Malawi (previously
sequenced), and from reference strains, as well as a broad selection of additional reactive malaria antigens from
all parasite lifecycle stages. We will determine whether the pathogenic variant surface antigens associated with
severe malaria in Zambians are similar to those previously identified in Malian children. The data generated from
this R21 study will be used to form the basis of an R01 proposal to identify common subsets of parasite variant
surface antigens associated with severe malaria in children and adults across Africa that could form the basis of
a vaccine or biologic."

Overview. This U01 proposal is dedicated to advancing the Human Virome Project (HVP) by addressing several
key objectives outlined in RFA-RM-23-018 NOFO. The project's focus is on the development and validation of
innovative technologies that enhance rigor and reproducibility of virome discovery and characterization,
particularly in human tissue samples. By addressing challenges such as low-biomass sample analysis, host and
environmental DNA contamination, and the need for more effective viral quantification and enrichment
techniques, this proposal aims to significantly advance the field of virome research.
Goals and Objectives. The project is structured around three specific aims:
Development of Viral-MEM: An innovative viral enrichment technology that operates independently of viral-like
particles (VLP). Viral-MEM is designed to effectively process high-host load tissue samples by removing host
nucleic acids while preserving and separating viruses and other microbes. This technology, building on our
validated microbial enrichment method, is crucial for deep characterization of viral and bacterial fractions,
improving limits of detection in sequencing, and aiding in the identification of novel viruses.
Development of Viral StochQuant: A novel experimental and computational approach designed to increase
the rigor and reproducibility of viral sequencing. This method uniquely combines sequencing measurements with
absolute anchoring measurements to accurately track the absolute numbers of molecules throughout the
sequencing process. It addresses the challenges of low target abundance and high background signal, and uses
anchoring measurements and stochastic simulations for deriving limits of detection, measurement noise,
differential abundance analyses, and contamination detection.
Validation of Developed Technologies: Validation will address both biological and technical variabilities and
be conducted in three distinct and challenging human tissue sample sets—daily sampled vaginal swabs, saliva
samples paired with small-intestine biopsies, and paired biopsies from four locations in the human lower
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This approach will facilitate study of intricate phage-bacterial dynamics, connections
between different human viromes, and the quantitative biogeography of the human virome along the GI tract.
Impact. The successful implementation of this proposal will dramatically enhance the accuracy, cost-
effectiveness, and scalability of virome analyses in human tissues. The technologies developed will enable a
more comprehensive integration of virome data with broader human microbiome research and will offer new
insights into virome dynamics and interactions. Importantly, these innovations will diversify the HVP's research
capabilities, provide access to new sample types, and improve data quality, particularly for low-biomass samples.
Overall, this project is designed to provide tools that significantly deepen our understanding of the human virome
and its implications in health and disease."

Liver transplantation (LT) is the only definitive cure for end stage liver disease; however, there is a growing gap
between organ demand and availability. This has led centers to rely on extended criteria donors (ECD), which
include grafts from older donors, fattier livers, or following donation after cardiac death (DCD). These grafts are
particularly vulnerable to preservation injury and carry increased risk of post-LT complications. Optimizing
organ preservation techniques would improve patient outcomes, increase utilization of ECD grafts, and
improve access to life-saving LT. Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion (HMP-O2) provides continuous
liver flush with oxygenated preservation solution. HMP-O2 shows great promise in early clinical trials in the US
and Europe. Recipients exhibit decreased preservation injury and improved early post-LT outcomes. The exact
molecular pathways modulated by HMP-O2 remain largely undefined. Our team has pioneered machine
perfusion in LT. With a novel portable perfusion pump, the LifePort® Liver Transporter (LLT, Organ Recovery
Systems), we are the lead institution in the first US prospective, randomized controlled multi-center trial
comparing HMP-O2 vs Static Cold Storage (SCS, conventional storage on ice) in LT (NCT 03484455). Under
the continued access phase, with non-randomized enrollment of patients, we have increased utilization of ECD
grafts at our center with excellent outcomes. To characterize the molecular targets of early allograft injury, we
have paired this with an extensive longitudinal bio-specimen collection protocol. The long-term goals of the
present research are to (1) define the protective pathways activated by HMP-O2 compared to SCS and (2) to
identify target biomarkers for organ monitoring and for future therapeutic optimization of allograft function.
Initial data from our center show HMP-O2 improves post-LT morbidity. Preliminary biochemical, molecular, and
tissue injury analyses demonstrate improved tissue structural integrity, decreased inflammatory signaling, and
preserved cellular function. We hypothesize that HMP-O2 improves early allograft function and risk of
post-operative complications by decreasing inflammatory signaling, moderating cellular metabolic
dysregulation, and ultimately, promoting cellular homeostasis. Specific aims are proposed to (1)
immune cell activation, inflammatory signaling, and metabolic dysfunction mitigated by HMP-O2, as well
correlate proteogenomic markers of preservation injury between tissue and liver perfusate in HMP-O2
define
as to (2)
compared to SCS to establish thresholds of irreversible injury for ex vivo monitoring. Capitalizing on our
extensive biorepository, histologic, biochemical, genetic, and protein markers of injury will be defined in tissue
(liver and bile duct), preservation fluid effluent, and bile. We expect to see decreased markers of inflammation,
abrogated cell injury, and increased homeostasis during and following HMP-O2 compared to SCS. These
studies are critical to identify molecular targets to improve pre-LT organ monitoring, facilitate earlier
recognition of graft injury, optimize liver graft utilization, and increase access to life-saving LT."

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting 50 million people worldwide
of all ages. Seizures in up to one third of epilepsy patients are drug refractory, where surgery offers
a necessary means to resect epileptogenic regions (EZs). However, the outcomes of epilepsy
surgery may often be suboptimal as on average approximately 50% of patients are still not seizure
free after surgery, mainly due to the EZs cannot be accurately localized.
Traditionally, the EZ is clinically determined by using ictal intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG) recordings, which are invasive, and can only cover partial brain regions, and with a waiting
period of days to weeks for seizure to occur. In more recent years, it has been recognized by
researchers that seizures arise from a coordinated activity across large scale epileptic networks,
thus characterizing the connections among the involved epilepsy regions is profound to understand
the transmission pathways of epileptic brain network and epileptogenic foci. However, the current
ESI frameworks are insufficient to tackle the changes. Firstly, iEEG electrodes can only record
from partial brain regions, and it is infeasible to record the whole brain intracranial data due to its
invasive nature, and secondly, the existing ESI frameworks suffer from very low accuracy when
it comes to the estimation of whole brain electrophysiological networks.
In this project, we aim to develop a unified paradigm using a simultaneous multimodal
measurement of scalp EEG and iEEG signals to estimate the electrophysiological networks of the
whole brain, thus enabling the characterization of seizure onset zones (SOZ) and its key
transmission pathways from the level of whole brain source space. We aim to bridge the gap
between the less accurate whole brain network reconstruction using source localization with scalp
EEG and the more accurate but regional brain networks constructed from iEEG by using a
principled machine learning framework and letting the partially observable brain signals to “semi-
supervise” the whole brain networks estimation process. We term this new paradigm of source
imaging as “electrophysiological networks imaging” (ENI) in contrast to the traditional
electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). The proposed framework will enable delineation of
brain regions involved in seizure generation and propagation at the whole brain scale and improve
understanding of different epilepsy biomarkers from a network perspective and their values in the
pre-surgery decision making and surgical outcomes."

 Thirteen percent of adults over 75 suffer from aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a progressive disease that leads
to aberrant collagen deposition, leaflet stiffening, and eventual valve calcification at late stages. As it stands,
surgical or transcatheter valve replacement is the only treatment option for severe AVS and is limited in durability
and can require indefinite anticoagulation therapy. AVS is also sexually dimorphic with men having a two-fold
higher risk for developing direct calcification, whereas women with equal disease severity tend to have more
valvular fibrosis prior to calcification. The molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in AVS
progression remain poorly understood, but growing evidence suggests AVS is an inflammation-dependent
disease. Recent studies have focused on the role that infiltrating immune cells such as macrophages play in
AVS, with a growing appreciation that men and women undergo different immune responses and show
differences in compositions of inflammatory cytokines. Combined, these observations suggest not only the need
for alternative treatments for AVS (e.g., pharmaceutical therapies), but also the opportunity to develop
personalized treatments based on sex and inflammatory state. Based on the extant evidence, we propose to
investigate the role of inflammation in sex-specific valve disease progression. We hypothesize that AVS sexual
dimorphism is perpetuated by: 1) sex differences in valve cell secreted factors promoting differential polarization
of macrophages, 2) differences in infiltration behavior of male and female macrophages, and 3) direct
macrophage-valve cell contact eliciting distinct phenotypic differentiation dependent upon sex, leading to the
formation of a pro-fibrotic or pro-calcific niche. We will test these hypotheses with the following specific aims (1)
Delineate how secreted factors from valve cells effect macrophage phenotype and vice versa in a sex-dependent
manner, (2) Elucidate sex-specific differences in AVS disease initiation within an in vitro 3D co-culture model.
The applicant, Dr. Alex Khang, will work with sponsor, Dr. Kristi S. Anseth, collaborating investigators with
expertise in immunology (Dr. Laurel Hind) and sex-specific differences (Dr. Leslie Leinwand), and microscopy
consultant Dr. Joseph Dragavon to carry out the experimental studies. All studies will be performed at the
University of Colorado Boulder. All members of the research team and the required equipment for the proposed
research are housed in the same building (Jennie Smoly Caruthers Biotechnology Building, JSCBB) which will
facilitate constant interactions as well as frequent opportunities for mentorship, while eliminating logistical issues.
The JSCBB also houses numerous faculty that are domain-experts and word-leaders in their respective field
who Dr. Khang will interact with frequently at local seminars and events. During the funding period, Dr. Khang
will gain expertise in engineering in vitro co-culture models, immunology, sex-specific differences, and advanced
light microscopy. The funding period will also enable Dr. Khang to expand his network and attend new
conferences, which will further add to his knowledge and training toward an independent research career."

Sub-Saharan Africa bears the greatest burden of the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
epidemic. Uganda is no exception, with over 1.5 million persons with HIV (PWH), comprising 5.8% of the
population. Improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV from a fatal condition to a
chronic disease with long-term survival approaching that of uninfected individuals. In this setting, increased
morbidity and non-AIDS mortality arising from non-communicable disease co-morbidities is a growing challenge
in the care of patients with HIV.
Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) encompass a broad group of conditions commonly affecting
the muscles, bones or joints. Collectively, these disorders are the leading cause of years of life lived with disability
and the fifth highest driver of disability-adjusted life years globally. In Sub-Saharan Africa the burden of RMDs is
growing due to changing demographic patterns against a backdrop of resource limitation. The interplay of RMDs
and HIV remains a challenge: interactions between the two are diverse and relatively poorly understood, creating
barriers to management, and leading to negative health outcomes.
Written in response to “HIV-associated Non-Communicable Diseases Research at Low- and Middle-Income
Country Institutions (PAR-23-191)”, this proposal aims to establish a novel registry of patients with HIV and
RMDs, which will provide a unique platform for epidemiological and clinical studies of patients with co-morbid
HIV and RMD. Building upon the expertise of the study PIs in HIV, RA and osteoporosis, we further propose a
demonstration project focused on patients with co-existing HIV and RA to illustrate the feasibility of this platform
to support innovative hypothesis-driven research. The two independent but related aims will leverage a new
patient registry at the Rheumatology Clinic at Mulago National Hospital, a well-established HIV Clinic at the same
hospital, a rich history of collaboration between Makerere University College of Health Sciences and Yale
University School of Medicine, an outstanding Advisory Committee, and the infrastructure and network of the
Uganda Initiative for NCDs.
Taken together, the proposed project has significant public health importance. It will provide the prerequisite
data, training, and infrastructure needed to advance research on RMD burden among PWH. Creation of this
unique research and training platform will foster critical local capacity and an integrated network in Uganda for
future prospective studies investigating this important but previously under recognized problem. This will build
the foundation for future longitudinal studies to assess the burden, biology, spectrum, and the progression of
RMDs in HIV."

In the early 2000s, an estimated 1% of United States youth received antipsychotic prescriptions. Of these
prescriptions, approximately 65% were given for non-FDA-approved indications. This led to urgent calls to curb
antipsychotic prescribing, based on both the lack of research on drug benefits in youth and the extensive
evidence demonstrating adverse metabolic and neurologic consequences. More than a decade later, the
characteristics of the current pediatric population receiving antipsychotics, and the degree to which these
medications alleviate psychological symptoms, remain unclear. The objective of this proposal is to understand
the pediatric population receiving antipsychotics and examine their effectiveness in reducing psychiatric
hospitalizations compared to alternate medication options. It will use a new-user patient sample (N = 46,425)
that is large enough to adequately study hospitalization risk and examine differential effects based on
demographic factors and conditions that have scarcely been studied (e.g., depression), yet appear frequently
in antipsychotic users. This project will use a large United States health claims dataset to accomplish this
objective through two specific aims: (1) characterize the youth population using antipsychotics by examining
individual factors that predict antipsychotic initiation and (2) contrast medication effectiveness at reducing rates
of psychiatric hospitalizations using active comparator designs. In Aim 1, antipsychotic users (cases) will be
matched 1:1 with non-users (controls). The odds of using antipsychotics will then be evaluated based on pre-
existing psychiatric diagnoses, race, and socioeconomic status. In Aim 2, survival analysis will be used to
compare rates of psychiatric hospitalizations across different comparisons. First, differences in rates of
psychiatric hospitalizations will be compared for aripiprazole and risperidone users both across the sample and
in demographic subgroups. Second, rates of hospitalizations will be contrasted for antipsychotics versus ADHD
stimulants in users with ADHD and antipsychotics versus antidepressants in users with depression. The active
comparator design and propensity score matching will be applied to ameliorate confounding by indication and
related factors that obscure the ability to identify causal effects of the medications. This work is innovative as it
will provide insight into comparative effectiveness of antipsychotics and alternative treatment options for
pediatric conditions (e.g., ADHD) that have rarely been studied. Furthermore, the results will have a significant
public health impact by providing greater insight on disparities in antipsychotic treatment and how
antipsychotics may differentially affect diverse populations. This program of research will dovetail with the
applicant’s prior experience on causal inference methods and their long-term goal of becoming an impactful
pharmacoepidemiologist by training the applicant to independently analyze large-scale health claims datasets,
broadly disseminate research to audiences that include healthcare professionals, and develop strong content
knowledge in pediatric psychotropic use."
10998449,"Sexually reproducing organisms depend on the precise segregation of chromosomes during meiosis to ensure
the inheritance of the genome through the formation of haploid gametes. Defects in this process can lead to
infertility and the production of gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes, known as aneuploidy. To
successfully segregate chromosomes during meiosis, homologous chromosomes must pair, synapse, and
undergo crossover recombination during prophase I. Synapsis is defined by the formation of a highly
conserved, zipper-like proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) that links two homologs
together and serves as a scaffold for crossover recombination. The SC is a tripartite structure comprised of two
parallel stretches of chromatin-associated axial elements and a central region that connects the two. Despite
its conserved role and appearance across most eukaryotes, little is known about its molecular architecture and
the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of higher-order SC structures. The nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans has been an excellent model organism for studying meiotic mechanisms. In C. elegans, the SC central
region has been known to be composed of six interdependent coiled-coil proteins SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 SYP-
4, and SYP-5/6. Recently, we have identified that two paralogous Skp1-related (SKR) proteins, SKR-1/2, which
are adaptors of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, play moonlighting functions as structural
components of the SC. Their identification has enabled me to reconstitute the SC central region in vitro using a
bacterial protein expression system. SKR-1 and all previously known SYP proteins are purified together
throughout multiple purification steps at stoichiometric ratios, suggesting that the complete set of SC
components has been identified in C. elegans. Here, I propose to use these purified components as a platform
to address long-standing questions regarding the molecular architecture and assembly mechanisms of the SC.
In Aim 1, I will determine the stoichiometry of the SC central region proteins using size-exclusion
chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and Mass Photometry (MP). I will then
construct a map of the SC by identifying areas of protein-protein interactions via cross-linking mass
spectrometry. In Aim 2, I will investigate the necessary requirements that potentiate and regulate SC assembly.
Recent evidence has suggested that the SC exhibits liquid-crystalline properties that allow for rapid diffusion
and condensation of pro-crossover factors along chromosome lengths, which in turn controls the number and
distribution of crossovers. I will induce the formation of phase-separated droplets using purified components
and assess their behavior under conditions that are known to affect SC assembly in vivo. Ultimately, this work
will provide crucial insights into the organization and assembly requirements of the SC and establish a
foundation for understanding the SC structure in other eukaryotic organisms."

Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a Gram-positive bacterium that resides in the nasopharynx. Colonization is
the critical first step in the pathogenesis of this pathobiont, during which Spn forms biofilms that protect against
desiccation and host defense mechanisms. Studies on Spn colonization of naïve animals describe damage to
the epithelia, sloughing of host cells, exposure of the basement membrane, and alarmin release. Spn takes
advantage of this by binding to dying mucosal epithelial cells via Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA),
allowing the bacterium to benefit from released nutrients and, when discharged as respiratory mucous, to avoid
death by desiccation. Importantly, most work done to understand how the host immunological response to
colonization by Spn develops has been done using naïve animals and antigens/cell lysates from planktonic
grown pneumococci. These studies have not taken into consideration the biofilm phenotype, which is the
biological state Spn is present in the nasopharynx, and the impact of repeated colonization events. Our
preliminary data suggests repeated colonization events result in a robust humoral immune response to proteins
produced by biofilm Spn that far exceed their planktonic counterpart. Our hypothesis therefore states that:
repetitive Spn colonization results in the generation of a humoral adaptive immune response against biofilm-
associated proteins of Spn which influence subsequent colonization events and disease pathogenesis. This
proposal will expand our understanding of Spn colonization, host immunity, and has the potential to identify novel
candidates for immunization against colonization, the first step of pneumococcal pathogenesis and disease. To
test this, Aim 1 will elucidate how successive colonization events with different Spn impact mucosal host-
pathogen interactions and immunity. Using a representative murine model of successive colonization involving
three distinct Spn strains, we will assess the pathological and morphological differences between successive
Spn colonization events using scanning electron microscopy to image mucosal epithelial cells in the nasopharynx
of sequentially colonized mice, histological examination of sectioned nares, and immunofluorescent microscopy.
Pathological results will be correlated to bacterial burden in nasal elutes. We will determine the changes in the
immune response to planktonic versus biofilm Spn by quantitating infiltrating immune cells, measuring antibody
titers to biofilm-specific antigens and pneumococcal proteins, and determining which factors generate the
strongest antibody response. Aim 2 will determine how antibody production and immunization impedes Spn
colonization following repeated exposure events. Our preliminary data indicates that sufficient generation of
antibodies to biofilm antigens confers protection against colonization. We will determine how immunization
against PspA and Spn biofilm whole-cell lysates protect the host mucosal epithelia from proinflammatory damage
and drive the humoral immune response to colonization. Human nasal organoids will be used to validate
protection following antibody treatment prior to using our murine repeated Spn colonization model."

Advancements in treatment options are successfully helping CRC survivors (CRCS; post treatment) live longer
with currently 1.4 million CRCS in the United States. Despite living longer CRCS are experiencing negative
psychological (i.e., cognitive impairments) and physiological (i.e., arterial stiffness) of the disease. CRCS
experience impairments in aspects of cognition including cognitive processing speed (CPS), learning and
memory, and executive function with CPS being the most impaired cognitive domain. CRCS further experience
increased levels of arterial stiffness particularly measures of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV).
Physical activity (PA) is recommended following a cancer diagnosis to improve quality of life, alleviate symptoms
of cancer and treatment, and decrease risk for recurrence and development of comorbidities including
hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia; however, levels of PA are reduced in CRCS. In the general
population and diseased populations moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) is associated with improvement in
various domains of cognition including CPS and better outcomes of arterial stiffness, particularly cfPWV
suggesting that MVPA may occupy a similar beneficial role for CRCS and alleviate side effects and improve
quality of life and longevity. The proposed cross-sectional, comparative research study is guided by the central
hypothesis that CRCS will exhibit (a) worse vascular and cognitive function and lower PA levels than matched
controls, and (b) stronger associations among those variables that will support (c) analyses of vascular function
as a mediator of the association between PA and cognition in CRCS. The following aims will be tested (1)
compare CPS, cfPWV, and MVPA between CRCS and matched controls; (2) examine the associations among
CPS, cfPWV, and MVPA; and (3) determine if cfPWV serves a mediator of the association between MVPA and
CPS. The following training goals will guide the completion of this study including: (i) didactic and experiential
training in the CRC progression, development, treatment options and survivorship; (ii) clinical training in the
administration, scoring, and interpretation of neuropsychological tests from the International Cancer Cognition
Task Force battery; (iii) educational and clinical training to further understand the clinical application of
cardiovascular function and risks; and (iv) research training in the initialization, calibration, data processing, and
interpretation of Actigraph accelerometers. The outcomes of this study will highlight the importance of cognition,
vascular function, and PA levels and associations in CRCS as well as lay a foundation for future research on PA
behavioral interventions in this population. The proposed research and training goals with my collaborating team
will help me achieve my short-term goal of completing the proposed study and support my long-term goal of
receiving a faculty and research position in the field of exercise oncology."

Suicide is the second leading cause of death in US youth. Suicidal behavior is complex and is influenced by a
combination of multi-level distal and proximal environmental risk factors and lifestyle factors (i.e., exposome),
and biological susceptibility. Adverse exposome is key to youth suicide risk, and yet there is variability and most
youth who experience adversity do not attempt suicide. To better understand this variability, we need to develop
reproducible tools to quantify adverse exposome, to understand how exposome contributes to disparities in risk
among minority populations, and to better understand mechanisms of resilience in high-risk youth. Additionally,
we need to integrate risk models of environment with biological measures that can improve our understanding
of how environmental stress “gets under the skin” and increases suicide attempt risk. Allostatic load, the
physiologic “wear and tear” of the body over time in response to environmental stress is a proposed framework
to study mechanisms of exposome's effects on mental health and on suicide risk. While exposome and allostatic
load were previously linked to suicide risk, no prior studies have integrated both in a common framework. Our
proposal will provide the foundation to test how exposomic risk contributes to psychobiological stress burden in
youth, improving our understanding of the emergence of suicidal behavior in adolescence. We will quantify
aggregate environmental risk burden in a reproducible manner in five different youth cohorts that include >65,000
youth, of whom 25,000 youth have longitudinal data. We will use an exposome-wide-association-study (ExWAS)
approach, which applies a data driven method to systematically study associations with an outcome (such as
suicide attempt in this case) using large scale data of exposures and applying statistical methods to derive effect
sizes of risk associations, accounting for multiple testing and collinearity among exposures. Thereafter, we will
compute exposomic risk scores that represent the aggregated burden of risk exposures and apply these scores
to address our aims. In Aim 1, we will test generalizability of exposomic risk scores in five different cohorts from
different settings, including a clinical sample; test disparities in exposomic risk to suicide attempt and identify
resilience factors that are clinically relevant for future interventions. In Aim 2, we will map exposomic risk to
allostatic load measures and test their combined contribution to mental health and suicide attempt risk among
youth. Last, in Aim 3, we will explore causal mechanisms of environmental exposures, resilience factors and
allostatic load to youth suicide attempt risk by applying causal inference methods on longitudinal data. The
expected findings will advance suicide research through developing methods that are critical for reproducibility
in using environmental exposures' data; will inform suicide prevention efforts through identification of factors that
contribute to disparities in risk and to resilience in high-risk youth; and will advance understanding of the
biological processes that are associated with risk and resilience to youth suicide attempts in diverse samples."

There is increasing evidence that alterations in myelin contribute to cognitive and behavioral defects and that
this is partly mediated through myelin plasticity, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this occurs
remain poorly understood. One example of the crucial role of myelin plasticity in mental health is the long-term
impact of juvenile social isolation (JSI). Children subjected to JSI suffer from dramatic long-term behavioral and
cognitive defects that persist after fostering and intervention. Imaging studies indicate that affected children have
defects in the myelination of neuronal circuits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region implicated in memory,
executive function, social interactions, and psychiatric disorders. In prior studies, we found that like in children,
mice isolated during their juvenile period also present with long-term defects in social interactions and cognitive
function together with altered myelination of PFC neurons. In addition, we have demonstrated that JSI in mice
reduces the trophic factor Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) type III in the PFC and that mice with central hypomyelination
due to decreased signaling by NRG1 and its ErbB receptors (ErbBRs) have behavioral phenotypes like those
produced by JSI. Together, these data suggest that JSI influences PFC myelin plasticity through alterations in
NRG1/ErbB signaling, and that the resulting hypomyelination in turn impacts PFC function. However, critical
mechanistic aspects of how JSI alters PFC structure and function remain undefined. To fill these gaps in
knowledge and to determine if the effects of JSI can be prevented, ameliorated, or reversed by increasing type
III NRG1 levels, we propose the following aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which JSI alters
PFC type III NRG1 expression, focusing on epigenetic regulation. Aim 2 will determine the cellular mechanisms
by which JSI and hypomyelination alter the function of PFC circuits using patch-clamp recordings combined with
laser scanning photo-stimulation (LSPS). In Aim 3, we will determine if the downregulation of NRG1 PFC
expression is sufficient to induce the JSI endophenotypes, and if restoration of type III NRG1 expression is
sufficient to attenuate, prevent, or rescue the impact of JSI on PFC myelination and function. For the latter aim,
we will use new genetically modified mice that allow for cell-specific inducible NRG1 KO or over-expression. The
proposed studies, which represent the continuation of a collaboration between labs with complementary
expertise, will provide new insights into the mechanisms of myelin plasticity and the interactions between
oligodendrocytes and neurons, the mechanisms by which JSI alters neuronal gene expression, the mechanisms
regulating the expression of NRG1, a gene involved in psychiatric disorders, and the mechanisms by which
myelin disruption alters neuronal function. Elucidation of these mechanisms has the potential to enable
interventions to prevent or mitigate the effects of JSI or to help in the treatment of some psychiatric disorders."

The occurrence of concussion, or mild TBI, has been steadily increasing in incidence over the past decade.
One possible consequence of concussion - post-concussion syndrome - can persist for weeks to months and
result in life dissatisfaction for the patient and economic burden for society. With the development of new
rodent models for mild TBI, we can now study the molecular mechanisms that mediate injury and/or protection
from a single TBI. Our previous work identified significant changes in the guanine deaminase cytosolic PSD-95
interactor (cypin) after mild and moderate TBI, and in turn, discovered small molecule cypin activators that are
neuroprotective in vitro and restore neurocognition in vivo in both mild and moderate TBI models. Cellular
concentrations of methionine, a key metabolic effector that regulates neurocognition, increases shortly after
mild TBI, and our preliminary data point to cypin as a pivotal molecule for restoring methionine levels to
baseline after TBI. We are proposing that activation of purine metabolism by cypin attenuates methionine
levels via two mechanisms: 1) by altering cellular metabolism needed for methionine production and 2) by
binding to adenosylhomocysteinase like 1 (AHCYL1), sequestering it from inhibiting adenosylhomocysteinase,
allowing the methionine cycle to continue and reducing methionine accumulation post-mTBI. These
mechanisms can be harnessed for therapeutic application. Our proposed work determines whether the
activation of cypin can be targeted after mild TBI to promote functional recovery in mice. Broadly, our proposed
experiments will identify new molecular targets for treating TBI patients and reducing the long-term morbidity of
TBI on society."

The World Trade Center (WTC) General Responders (GRs) carry a significant mental health
(MH) burden from the exposure to intense psychological trauma after the WTC collapse. PTSD
and depression are two of the top ten certifiable mental health conditions that the 9/11 GRs are
burdened with. Members of the WTC Health Program (WTCHP), including GRs, FDNY and
Survivors, have increasingly moved to Florida representing close to six percent of the cohort.
They are away from the NY Metropolitan Area WTCHP, creating a need for localized, accessible
care. Additionally, preliminary findings from our ongoing pilot study on the WTCHP GRs residing
in Florida, indicate a large majority of the participants identify as Latinx, creating a need to
provide accessible services in the language of their choice, addressing health equity. The
findings also indicate that the majority prefer individual care and prefer, or are open to, remotely-
delivered services. While many studies have identified the MH burden that the responders carry,
there have been no controlled studies of psychosocial interventions to reduce PTSD,
depression, anxiety, and sleep symptoms among multiethnic GRs. There is a critical need for
developing or testing interventions appropriate for the GRs.
Preliminary evidence suggests that remotely-delivered and clinician-supported interventions can
reduce adverse MH symptoms as part of low-cost approaches with scalability potential in adults
with significant MH conditions. The goal of this proposed U01 2-year study from Principal
Investigators at a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
efficacy of Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach, originally developed for English speaking military
veterans but never tested with responders, for reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression,
anxiety, and sleep disturbance among English and Spanish speaking WTC GRs. PTSD Coach
is a mobile app available at no cost for Apple and Android mobile devices. PTSD Coach is a
self-managed (SM) application but given the need for more personalized, synchronous, and
attentive services, the clinician-supported (CS) PTSD Coach intervention was developed.
Studies of CS PTSD Coach with English-speaking veterans, reported reductions in PTSD
symptoms. Collectively, these preliminary data suggest CS PTSD Coach is a promising
intervention for the GRs in Florida. Findings from this study with a known cohort in Florida will
inform the deployment of an expanded trial nationally on CS PTSD Coach with WTC GRs."
10994831,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A fundamental feature of perception is the ability to recognize objects or object features despite changes in
presentation, such as size, position, or context. Elucidating the mechanisms by which cortical populations and
circuits build representations that are invariant to these manipulations will significantly advance our
understanding of the biological underpinnings of perception. Based on limited biological work examining invariant
tuning properties of neurons in visual cortex, studies in the field of object recognition hypothesize that invariance,
or tolerance to identity-preserving transformations, increases gradually as signals ascend the visual processing
hierarchy. In contrast, studies investigating how invariance is computed for perception of motion across different
object types have hypothesized that different types of invariances are computed in discrete, subsequent steps.
For example, humans and nonhuman animals alike perceive the pattern direction of motion of drifting plaids
despite the fact that plaids are composed of two overlaid gratings that drift in divergent directions. This perception
requires direction invariance (tolerance to the component grating directions of motion) and spatial invariance
(tolerance to differences in spatial features across different types of plaids). Previously published work proposes
that direction and spatial invariance are computed in series. First, spatial invariance is achieved by complex,
direction selective cells in V1 and next, direction invariance is computed upon integration of the signals encoding
component directions of motion in higher order areas of cortex. However, data from other studies and my own
preliminary data do not agree with this two-stage model. We find direction invariance in V1 prior to the
representations achieving spatial invariance. These data suggest that the computation for spatial invariance for
pattern motion encoding may occur gradually, as is proposed in object recognition pathways. Therefore, my
central hypothesis is that motion encoding circuits compute spatial invariance gradually over multiple
transformations to build an invariant percept of pattern motion. Using multiphoton imaging and optogenetic
manipulations in mouse visual cortex, I will test this hypothesis with two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will test if spatial
invariance increases gradually throughout the processing hierarchy and, if so, whether the increase is inherited
by receiving biased inputs that come from the most invariant neurons in the preceding population, or if spatial
invariance is computed de novo upon integration of heterogenous inputs. In Aim 2, I will investigate how single
cell and population level pattern motion representations inform pattern motion perception by training mice in a
direction discrimination task. Overall, the significance of this work will be to advance our understanding of how
invariance is built for pattern motion perception, resolving current controversies in the field and revealing
fundamental principles of cortical computations that increase invariance for perception."

ABSTRACT
The over-arching theme for this MDSRC grant application is to accelerate the translation of novel genetic
therapies from the bench into the clinic for individuals with muscular dystrophy. A significant bottleneck in
studying pathogenic variants or their correction is the limited proliferative capacity of muscle cells from
muscular dystrophy patients, and the process of obtaining cells (muscle biopsy) is invasive. A technique using
lentiviral vectors for both hTERT and MyoD delivery to dermal fibroblasts derived from skin biopsy to create
myogenic fibroblasts (hereafter called FibroMyoD) will overcome this bottleneck. Through a previous P50
grant we have been very successful creating and banking several hundred fibroblast and FibroMyoD cell
lines. The overall objective of the Muscular Dystrophy Cell Line and Serum Banking Core (MD-CLSB Core)
will be to continue banking human primary and immortalized cell lines and improve on the method to create
myoblasts that will support each of the MDSRC Projects, as well as for serum and plasma banking for
exploratory and collaborative projects. The overall objective will be addressed in two specific aims. Aim 1 will
expand our unique cell line resource from muscular dystrophy subjects by banking dermal fibroblasts and
creating FibroMyoD cell lines and continue banking of serum samples from muscular dystrophy subjects. In Aim
2 we will develop an improved transdifferentiation protocol to generate mature myofibers from the FibroMyoD
lines that more closely mimic mature myofibers. We will use novel 3D microenvironments in combination with
new transgene delivery to convert dermal fibroblasts to FibroMyoD, different media formulations and extracellular
matrix composition to create a more mature myoblast. This MD-CLSB Core will leverage the existing expertise
of the Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) Research Institute Cell Line Core, codirected by Drs. Flanigan, MD
and Wein, Ph.D. This institutionally supported shared resource has been creating and banking cell lines for over
15 years. The current proposal involves a greatly increased demand on the existing NCH Cell Line Core, and
establishment of the MD-CLSB Core will provide the additional resources needed to serve as a resource to both
the NCH/OSU and the broader muscle research community. The cell lines generated, and serum samples
stored is and will continue to be a valuable resource for the projects of the proposed MDSRC, and the broader
muscular dystrophy research community, in direct alignment with the MDSRC mission."

Project Summary/Abstract
Title: Extracellular Vesicles in Monitoring and Treatment of Dystrophinopathy.
X-linked recessive Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy affecting 1 in
3,500 boys. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, preventing the production of a fully functional
dystrophin protein, which normally performs a critical structural role in stabilizing myofiber membranes during
muscle contraction. Functional and clinical outcome measures for DMD were used in the clinical trial that led to
the recent FDA-approval of the microdystrophin gene replacement therapy. The U7snRNA-based exon skipping
is another promising one time single-dose gene therapy, aiming to restore full-length dystrophin expression, that
entered clinical trial. The latter relies on similar outcome measures to validate therapeutic efficacy in treated
patients. These outcome measures can be labor intensive, time consuming, inconvenient for some patients and
expensive, which might delay approval of DMD therapies. Moreover, it is still unknown how efficacious these
gene therapies would be in the larger DMD population and for how long their therapeutic benefits will last.
Therefore, non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of treated patients is needed to understand disease progression
and assess persistence of therapeutic interventions and safer next-generation gene therapies with higher
potency and possibility of re-administration are needed. In this project, we will rely on extracellular vesicles (EVs)
to meet these needs. To identify novel circulating DMD and BMD biomarkers, we will investigate the RNA and
protein content of circulating EVs collected from the plasma of DMD and BMD patients and healthy controls. EVs
are lipid-bilayer delimited vesicles released by tissues or organs into biofluids and carry tissue/organ-specific
molecules indicative of the pathophysiological state of their tissue or organ of origin. These molecules can be
actively enriched in EVs. Therefore, their identification might allow the validation of EV-associated biomarkers
that help track DMD and BMD onset and progression, stratify patients for trials, and serve as therapy responsive
outcomes (Aim 1 and 2). AAV-mediated gene therapy for muscle diseases typically requires systemic delivery,
which is challenging for first-generation AAV vectors due to high dose requirements for widespread muscle
transduction. High dose, vascular AAV delivery has been linked to adverse events such as liver toxicity and
AAV immunogenicity, which can reduce therapeutic efficacy and prevent administration to patients with pre-
existing immunity to AAV. To overcome the challenges associated with systemic delivery of high AAV doses, we
will package AAV with EVs. By enveloping AAVs with a lipid-bilayer, EVs may reduce total AAV capsid exposure,
which would reduce the development of humoral immunity and shield AAV capsids from pre-existing anti-AAV
antibodies. Previous work on EV-AAVs have demonstrated that enveloped AAVs were protected from anti-AAV
neutralization. We will test the transduction efficiency and therapeutic potency of EV-AAVs in wild-type and DMD
mice using as proof-of-concept AAV gene therapies investigated in Project 2 (Aim 3)."

Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are involved with the criminal legal system (i.e., incarcerated,
arrested) face an increased risk for morbidity and mortality, and few receive evidence-based treatment while
incarcerated. The two most commonly used medications for OUD (MOUD), buprenorphine and methadone, are
the most effective treatment interventions that can be provided during incarceration and post-release. It is
unknown if the onset of ubiquitous fentanyl use has altered the use of MOUD type among individuals with OUD
during incarceration, whether these potential changes in MOUD use additionally impact post-release health
outcomes, and how these trajectories may differ by individual factors. This F31 will use a convergent mixed-
methods design to address two research aims: (1) Analyze a comprehensive longitudinal database on health
service use and health outcomes among individuals who received buprenorphine or methadone during
incarceration at a unified jail and prison system in the Northeast (n=4558) from 2016 to 2023. Specifically, a
retrospective cohort design will be used to examine predictors and uses of buprenorphine and methadone during
incarceration and post-release, and the association between buprenorphine and methadone use during
incarceration and post-release health outcomes (treatment retention, mortality) will be investigated over this time
period. (2) Conduct and analyze one-on-one, in-depth interviews with individuals released from incarceration
(n=30; 12 received methadone, 12 received buprenorphine, 6 received both) to identify individual, interpersonal,
community, and structural factors that may shape the selection of MOUD type during and upon release from
incarceration. This data will be used to examine preferences for MOUD delivery and type, experiences with
MOUD delivery while incarcerated, and intentions to use MOUD post-release. Data from both aims will be
integrated to fully contextualize the uses of health services and outcomes among this population. The proposed
research addresses an urgent need to reduce morbidity and mortality surrounding OUD and fentanyl use among
criminal legal involved populations by understanding the rapidly evolving opioid public health crisis and outcomes
associated with evidence-based treatments. This two-year training fellowship will support the applicant’s
development of content expertise, and knowledge and application of advanced longitudinal statistical methods,
mixed-methods data collection and analysis, and scientific dissemination. Completion of this study will provide
preliminary data for a postdoctoral NIH grant application exploring adaptations to the carceral-based provision
of evidence-based OUD treatment. The extensive training this mentorship team provides will prepare the
applicant for a successful career as an independent addiction science researcher."
10997218,"Alcohol use can accelerate the detrimental processes of aging in terms of cognitive, physical, and emotional
outcomes and has been identified as the strongest modifiable risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Common biological mechanisms such as inflammation, amyloid-β
deposition, and cell death have been observed in patients with ADRD and those who consume high amounts of
alcohol in a chronic fashion. Despite evidence of this causal link, minimal focus has been placed on
understanding synergistic interactions of alcohol, aging, and tau-driven neurodegeneration; which is a hallmark
of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical models of pathological tau expression, such as the PS19
tau mouse model, have been well characterized in the study of ADRD but have rarely been utilized to study
consequences of chronic alcohol consumption.
The prevalence of alcohol consumption in older adults is increasing and our society is aging, leaving our
population even more vulnerable to the neurodegenerative effects of alcohol. Thus, the study of the intersection
of aging and alcohol is more urgent than ever.
The current literature on this topic is limited, so it will be critical to determine foundational knowledge about the
chronic effects of alcohol in a model of neurodegeneration. The current proposal therefore aims to investigate
the progression of behavioral impairment, the time course of aging-related biomarkers, and development of
neurodegeneration as a result of alcohol intake and development of tau pathology. Behavioral and cognitive
impairment is a critical standard that we will measure as an outcome, as it is a common feature present in
pathological aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Peripheral biomarkers represent a method of quantifying
the level of biological impairment and assessing the overall state of aging and degeneration in multiple systems
across the body. All of the biomarkers we have selected to measure in this proposal have a parallel clinical
assessment that can be measured noninvasively, which will be beneficial for translational purposes.
SPECIFIC AIMS: (1a) Determine how voluntary chronic alcohol intake in the presence of pathological tau
expression impacts behavioral and aging-related outcomes across the lifespan, (1b) Delineate the
synergistic effects of specific low or high alcohol intake and pathological tau expression, (1c) Utilize
machine learning techniques to predict behavioral and neurological outcomes from acute biomarker
measures, and (2) Investigate the acute effects of alcohol in a mouse model of tauopathy.
The successful completion of this proposal will provide a holistic characterization of how aging is affected by
alcohol over the lifespan, highlight new biomarkers to predict chronic adverse outcomes, and ultimately provide
potential clinical targets to combat physical, emotional, and cognitive impairments in the aging population."

This proposal will provide the foundational tooling for understanding the function of the pan-genome reference
through the accurate annotation of regulatory elements within the pan-genome. As the genetic component of the
pan-genome reference comes into focus, the next challenge is understanding the functional relevance of genetic
variants within this reference. However, resolving this challenge requires tooling that enables users to: (1) get
accurate epigenetic data into a pan-genome reference; and (2) use epigenetic data once it is in a pan-genome
reference. This proposal leverages our team’s unique expertise in long-read epigenetics, short-read epigenetics,
pan-genome assembly, and genomic software development to develop transformative tooling for threading
accurate epigenetic information into a pan-genome graph, as well as extracting epigenetic information from a
pan-genome in a manner that is compatible with existing epigenetic and genetic analysis tools. Our tooling is
grounded in first assembling accurate epigenetic annotations at the level of haploid linear contigs, which are then
threaded into a pan-genome reference. This approach significantly improves the accuracy by which both long-
and short-read epigenetic features are mapped into a pan-genome, enables our tooling to readily adapt to new
pan-genomes, and enables user-generated epigenetic data to be incorporated into a pan-genome reference
without having to remake the pan-genome reference itself. Importantly, we are designing this tooling to work for
diverse types of epigenetic data acquired across sequencing platforms. In addition, this tooling will be available
through AnVIL, Conda, and other platforms, enabling users to readily adopt it into their own research pipelines.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will develop tooling that uses a semi-supervised machine learning approach to
accurately classify long-read epigenetic data collected using diverse experimental methods and sequencing
platforms. In Aim 2, we will develop tooling that accurately aggregates long-read epigenetic data onto haploid
linear contigs, and then threads either long-read or short-read epigenetic data into a pan-genome reference. In
Aim 3, we will create fundamental operation tools for processing epigenetic data within a pan-genome to identify
epigenetic and genetic features at specific points of interest within a pan-genome in a sample-, path-, and read-
aware manner. Finally, we will apply our tooling to existing long-read and short-read epigenetic datasets to
identify genetic variants within the pan-genome reference associated with haplotype-, paralog-, and sample-
specific epigenetic features."
10978140,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease that infects over 150 million people in low- and
middle-income countries. WHO has targeted schistosomiasis for elimination as a public health problem by
2030 but is not on track due to geographically focal areas of persistent endemicity, especially hot spots of high
Schistosoma prevalence. After decades of the longstanding public health strategy of mass drug administration
(MDA), endemic areas and hot spots are often geographically focal and missed by the standard district-level
prevalence surveys that inform MDA decisions. More granular prevalence mapping to inform targeted MDA is
limited by: (1) inefficient diagnostics (i.e., stool microscopy) that are slow, insensitive, and prohibitively
resource intensive; and (2) lack of understanding of the optimal geographic scale (i.e., district, sub-district,
community) for mapping and MDA implementation. Our broad, long-range goal is to evaluate whether more
geographically precise mapping with newer diagnostics for targeted MDA, including more intensive efforts in
hot spots, can improve schistosomiasis control while being cost-effective. Our proposal will evaluate a novel
‘rapid mapping strategy’ that will compare two rapid, sensitive lateral flow urine antigen tests: (1) WHO
endorsed semi-quantitative POC-CCA; and (2) fully quantitative UCP-LF-CAA, in an innovative pooled
sampling strategy, which is supported by our preliminary data. Our application will leverage a decade-long,
productive collaboration in Côte d'Ivoire and includes a multi-disciplinary team that merges expertise across
epidemiology, diagnostics, mathematical modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis, clinical medicine, and policy. In
Aim 1, we will evaluate rapid urine antigen tests with pooled sampling for identification of endemic and hot spot
locations of Schistosoma mansoni prevalence for improved surveillance. We will test pooled urine samples
with two rapid antigen tests (qualitative POC-CCA, pool size 4-8; highly sensitive and quantitative UCP-LF-
CAA, pool size 5-10), using a one-stage (pooling only) and two-stage system, in comparison to WHO-
recommended thresholds for being an endemic or hot spot location. In Aim 2, we will apply a geospatial model
of S. mansoni prevalence and project the impact and cost-effectiveness of implementing surveillance, including
the rapid mapping strategies, and MDA against S. mansoni at more granular geographic scales (sub-district,
community-level), compared to current standard district-level decisions. We will develop an open-source
modeling tool to guide optimal mapping for schistosomiasis, which may be used by national MDA programs
across endemic countries. This proposal’s aim to evaluate new rapid mapping strategies to guide precise
intervention against schistosomiasis will support the 2030 WHO goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public
health problem."

The Administrative Core (AC) of the UNM CHANGES (Climate and Health Allied Network for Geospatial and
Environmental Science) Center is tasked with the ambitious objective of not only coordinating and leading the
center, but also creating integrative structural organization for two separate campuses: UNM Main and UNM
Health Sciences Center. The long-term goal of the UNM CHANGES is to become a national leader in Climate
Change and Human Health research, with a regional focus on solving issues impacting our vulnerable
communities. The goal of the present application is to establish a centralized and effective AC that provides
managerial, fiscal, and organizational support for the scientific objectives, mentoring activities for our junior
investigators, and coordinating activities and output for our cores and projects. The rationale for the AC is to
ensure the long-term success of the UNM CHANGES Center and begin the establishment of a cross-campus
model for the integration of research units needed to address the complexities of human health impacts of
climate change. This success extends beyond independent research projects and it requires effective and
integrated training, communication, organization and team science approaches that the AC will provide. The
Administrative Core, therefore, has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will be to provide scientific direction and
organizational support for the UNM CHANGES Center. The leadership of the AC will drive scientific objectives
and provide strategic planning as well as managerial and fiscal oversight. The AC will establish an External
Advisory Committee (EAC) of internationally recognized experts in biomedicine, cancer biology and toxicology
to ensure high productivity, innovation, and success of the Center. Additionally, through its advisory
committees and leadership team, the AC will provide vision for the strategic development of our Cores to
ensure that capabilities remain both state-of-the-art and tailored to the needs of our center members and
external partners. In Specific Aim 2, we will manage core facility utilization and data generation, storage,
analysis, and dissemination. The AC will provide coordination, management and evaluation to ensure that our
Center generates quality data that is publicly available. Establishing and executing a high-level data
infrastructure and management plan will ensure high quality research products, broad utilization of the Center’s
research output, and optimal information for dissemination and implementation. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we
will promote innovation and expansion of research on climate change and human health. To expand the
quality and impact of research related to climate change and to ensure sustainability of the Center, the AC will
advance 1) campus-wide, team science-focused pilot projects; 2) recruitment and mentoring of new PIs that
leverage the geospatial and data science resources to address broader impacts on human health; 3) high
profile seminars and remote engagement with local and regional healthcare providers as well as research
institutes, centers and departments; and 4) effective center evaluation strategies."

How climate-related disasters impact health and regional risk is not fully known. Our long-
term goal is to improve health sector preparedness, resiliency, and health outcomes following
climate-related disasters. Our objectives are threefold: 1) To assess long-term changes in
health outcomes that have been linked with climate-related disasters; 2) to quantify the
relationship between population vulnerabilities in the 7 Vital Cond variables and post-event
disease prevalence changes; and 3) to develop and test a geospatial C-DRAPS to visualize the
regional risk profiles, identify climate-sensitive health indicators, project impacts on health, and
communicate regional community risks with healthcare workers, educators, and community
leaders who care for disaster-affected populations. Our central hypothesis is that incidences of
long-term chronic conditions and vector-borne disease following a climate change-related
disaster are associated with region-specific well-being and environmental health (EH)
conditions. Our aims are: 1) Determine the existing community risks and consequent extra risks
to health arising from climate-related disasters. 2) Determine the independent and joint impacts
of climate-related disasters on the prevalence of HTN, DM, asthma, depression, and vector-
borne diseases up to five years following disasters. 3) Analyze county samples in Aim1.a as
training data to establish a model that quantifies the relationship between variables in the 7 Vital
Conditions of Health and Well-being and post-event disease prevalence changes. This model is
subsequently employed to predict changes in the prevalence of HTN, DM, asthma, depression,
and vector-borne disease following future climate-related disasters within any given U.S. county
based on county-specific variables. Aim 2. Design and validate a GIS-based dashboard for
integrated visualization, analysis, projection, and communication of regional community risks
focusing on population vulnerability indicators, climate indicators, and health indicators
(prevalence of HTN, DM, asthma, depression, vector-borne diseases) after climate-related
disasters. The research is significant as it will predict long-term health impacts of disasters and
exacerbate regional risk profiles that can influence disaster planning and policy, resulting in
innovative approaches to health systems and community preparedness that enhance resiliency.
 The impact of this model will expand the understanding of chronic conditions and vector-
borne disease following FDDs and link the evidence from datasets consistent with the 7 Vital
Conditions of Well-being. The innovative holistic model will combine complex data in one easily
assessable tool, designed to be user-friendly and openly available."

Climate change is fueling dramatic increases in the frequency, duration, and intensity of wildfires in the Western
USA and globally. The contribution of wildfire smoke to air quality is no longer transient or negligible as recent
studies demonstrated that wildfire smoke has either stagnated or reversed previous multi-decadal progress in
reducing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in three-quarters of states in the contiguous USA
(CONUS). Moreover, since 2016, wildfire smoke has added an average of 1 µg/m3 to annual ambient PM2.5
concentrations in the eight most affected states in the West and Midwest. Wildfires release large amounts of
particles, toxicants, and carcinogens into the atmosphere, which can impact the health of populations both near
and far from the burning sites. Studies, including our own, have documented that wildfire smoke worsens mental
health and exacerbates cardio-pulmonary diseases within days of exposure, and may cause lung injury and
obstructive airway changes within weeks to months of exposure. However, the impact of repetitive wildfire smoke
exposure on chronic health consequences remains unknown. Specifically, despite cancer relevance of wildfire
smoke and the growing population of cancer survivors, the risk for developing and surviving cancer under
repetitive insults from wildfire smoke is a significant knowledge gap. Understanding this risk is an interdisciplinary
research priority for both cancer and climate researchers. Whereas the lack of a reliable assessment of wildfire
smoke exposure has traditionally impeded scientific progress, the newest advancements in air quality modeling
have the potential to advance the field. This includes the daily wildfire-driven PM2.5 concentration estimates at
10 × 10 km resolution that is available for the entire CONUS from 2006 to 2022. Therefore, we proposed to link
the wildfire smoke data to cancer incidence and somatic mutation data to examine whether wildfire smoke affects
the risk for developing cancers (Aim 1). Aim 2 will link wildfire smoke data to cancer mortality and survival data
to assess whether wildfire smoke affects the risk for surviving cancers. With the projected increase in wildfires,
delineating these relationships has the potential to inform new public health and climate policies to better protect
vulnerable populations from contracting cancer and to improve health outcomes in cancer survivors following
wildfire smoke exposures. Finally, we will work with the Community Engagement Core to foster increased
individual- and community- level decision-making and climate health literacy by translating our team’s research
results to identified audiences using culturally-centered, science-communication approaches."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype with increased propensity for metastasis
and few treatment options. Mounting evidence suggests that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in TNBC contribute
to the early recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. Thus, identification of novel therapeutic approaches
effectively targeting CSCs is crucial for improving outcome in TNBC. We propose to target CSCs in TNBC by
exploiting their overexpression of two redox regulating enzymes, NQO1 and SOD1 as a therapeutic vulnerability.
Utilizing a potent NQO1-bioactivatable redox cycling compound, IB-DNQ, which generates large amounts of
reactive oxygen species in CSCs via futile redox cycling, we propose to examine the feasibility of utilizing IB-
DNQ alone, or in combination with SOD1 inhibition, to effectively target CSCs across the EMT-MET CSC state
continuum. We will address three specific aims: 1) To demonstrate the efficacy of IB-DNQ alone or in
combination with SOD1 inhibition in targeting CSCs in vitro and in mouse models of human TNBC; 2) To
determine the mechanisms of cell death induced by IB-DNQ based pro-oxidant strategies; and 3) To determine
how IB-DNQ based pro-oxidant strategies modulate antitumor immunity in immunocompetent mouse models.
This proposal will evaluate a novel pro-oxidant-based approach in selectively targeting CSCs in TNBC and
elucidate the mechanism of action for futile oxidant generators in activating mitochondrial apoptotic and
pyroptotic cell death with resultant stimulation of antitumor immunity. As NQO1 and SOD1 are overexpressed
in many solid tumors, this therapeutic strategy may have wide applicability."

Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are experiencing an ongoing HIV epidemic in Vietnam, with an
HIV prevalence of 12%. However, HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among YMSM remain
low. To improve HIV testing and PrEP use, mobile health (mHealth) interventions hold great promise to reach
YMSM in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). HealthMindr, an evidence-based mHealth intervention
developed in the United States for men who have sex with men, is an ideal option for adaptation for YMSM in
Vietnam. I propose to adapt this app and explore barriers and facilitators of implementing the app among
YMSM in Vietnam. The specific aims are to (1) Adapt the HealthMindr app to improve HIV testing and PrEP
uptake among YMSM in Vietnam; (2) Examine acceptability, feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the
adapted app among YMSM in Vietnam and (3) Explore barriers and facilitators of implementing the adapted
app among YMSM in Vietnam. In Aim 1, theater testing will be conducted through focus group discussions with
YMSM and key other stakeholders, including health officials, clinic staff and community-based organizations.
Theater testing data will be used to refine the app for beta testing. During beta testing, a small group of YMSM
will use the app for 30 days, then complete an online survey and an exit interview to rate the app’s usability,
provide their perspectives of the app and report any other areas for improvement. App analytics will also be
collected to understand whether and how the app is used. In Aim 2, the adapted app with be tested among
YMSM through a randomized controlled design. YMSM will be randomized into the intervention or control arm
(1:1 ratio). The intervention arm will have full access to the app for 3 months, while the control group will
receive standard-of-care HIV services. Key app features include HIV test planning, risk and PrEP eligibility
assessment, ordering of free condoms and HIV test kits, information about PrEP, and PrEP provider and HIV
testing locations. HIV testing and PrEP use will be assessed at baseline and 3 months and compared between
groups. A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate app acceptability and feasibility. Quantitative data
on acceptability and feasibility will be collected through the 3-month online survey, while qualitative data will be
collected through in-depth interviews with a subset of YMSM in the intervention arm and other key
stakeholders. In Aim 3, through the same qualitative study as Aim 2, factors that influence the implementation
of the app will be explored. Determinants from seven domains will be identified: condition, technology, value
proposition, adopter system, health organization, wider system and embedding/adaption over time. Only when
mHealth interventions are both effective and adopted can they maximize their potential to reduce HIV
incidence among target populations. This proposal will generate data for designing a full-scale hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation trial to test the adapted app and identify implementation strategies to address the
barriers of app implementation in LMICs."

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is characterized by incomplete closure of the diaphragm and lung
hypoplasia in newborns. The diaphragm defect can be surgically repaired; however, lung hypoplasia remains
the main cause of mortality and morbidity in CDH. The etiology of lung hypoplasia in CDH is multifactorial and
involves compression by herniated viscera, genetic and environmental factors. To date, over 100 CDH-
associated genes were identified in patient cohorts. However, the function of most CDH-associated genes,
including Zinc Finger Homeobox 4 (ZFHX4), in the fetal lung is unknown. In Preliminary Studies, we show
that ZFHX4 is selectively expressed in mesenchymal cells in fetal lungs of humans and mice. Functional
disruption of Zfhx4 in mice causes thickened mesenchyme, defective alveolar fibroblast differentiation, and
impaired alveologenesis, which resemble the clinical hallmarks of lung hypoplasia in CDH. Interestingly,
Zfhx4-/- mice have no diaphragmatic henia, which suggests that additional factors may cause diaphragm
defects in CDH patients with ZFHX4 variants. A lack of confounding diaphragm defects also makes Zfhx4-/-
mice an excellent model to investigate the direct role of Zfhx4 in lung mesenchyme development. We show
that Zfhx4 expression peaks at the pseudoglandular stage of lung development; however, Zfhx4-/- mice have
no lung mesenchymal phenotypes until E16.5 when Zfhx4 is no longer detectable. Supporting the impact of
early Zfhx4 expression on late mesenchyme development, transcriptome profiling of wildtype and Zfhx4-/- lung
mesenchymal cells at E16.5 identified differentiatlly expressed genes enriched in matrix and mesenchyme
developmental pathways. The observed temporal disparity between Zfhx4 expression and the phenotype in
Zfhx4-/- mice are reminiscent of two defining features of a pioneer factor -- by binding to silent gene loci early
on and by recruiting transcriptional factors and epigenetic regulators, drives later lineage specification. Based
on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the pioneer factor ZFHX4 accesses silent gene sites
and recruits transcriptional regulators in embryonic mesenchymal progenitors thereby orchestrating
alveolar fibroblast differentiation. Utilizing the R03 funding mechanism and leveraging available Zfhx4-/-
and Zfhx4v5 mouse lines, we propose two pilot assays to interrogate Zfhx4 regulation of lung mesenchyme
development during embryogenesis. The first assay is to investigate dynamics of Zfhx4 binding, chromatin
opening, and gene regulation in lung mesenchymal progenitors (Aim 1) and the second assay is to identify
Zfhx4-binding transcriptional regulators in lung mesenchymal progenitors (Aim 2). The results of these two
proposed assays will identify canidate mediators of Zfhx4 for future functional investigation to inform lung
mesenchyme development and pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia in CDH."
10987275,"Aphasia is a multi-modality disturbance of language that is more common than disorders such as Parkinson’s
disease and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than Alzheimer’s disease and many cancers. Persons
with Aphasia (PWAs) are thought to be at a higher risk for depression than other stroke survivors. Depression is
also thought to worsen language and cognitive performance in PWAs and decrease their quality of life. However,
identifying depression in PWAs is challenging as their language disturbances make it difficult to assess
depressive symptoms using traditional methods such as questionnaires and interviews as these methods require
PWAs to report on their inner experiences (e.g., their sadness, experience of pleasure, etc.). An alternative
approach to diagnostic interviews or questionnaires is to utilize laboratory-assessed biomarkers that require
minimal language abilities and have shown to robustly identify depression in neurologically healthy individuals.
A goal of this study is thus to assess the ability of three laboratory tests to detect depression in PWAs (N=46):
(a) heart-rate variability at rest, (b) pupil dilation, and (c) gaze duration (a measure of biased attention) to
negatively and positively valenced images. A challenge of this study is that without a gold-standard way to assess
depression in PWAs, it is difficult to truly know whether the three biomarkers are validly assessing depression in
people who have difficulty verbally reporting on their inner experiences. Aim 1 of the study will therefore apply a
novel convergent validity approach and use as its validator a composite reference standard based on multiple
indicators or proxies of depression - specifically, informant (e.g., family member, caregiver) report of PWAs (a)
depression symptoms, (b) pre-morbid history of PWAs depression (a robust predictor of future depression in
non-neurological and neurological patients), and (c) a self-report depression scale adapted for PWAs. Composite
reference standards are routinely employed to evaluate new tests when gold-standard and imperfect diagnostic
tests exist, but this approach has not been used to assess depression in PWA. Aim 2 will test whether laboratory-
assessed biomarkers predict PWAs day-to-day experiences of affect and social interaction (a critical factor for
successful rehabilitation), using experience sampling methodology (ESM). ESM is an approach that requires
brief, frequent (multiple per day), at-home assessments (in this case, from caregivers). ESM minimizes recall
bias and increases ecological validity of assessments. Lastly, aim 3 will establish the retest reliability of
laboratory-assessed biomarkers of depression by re-administering all measures to PWAs 7 days later. The
proposed project has the potential for high impact for PWAs since accurate diagnosis of depression in PWAs
can lead to better management of depression, which can positively impact linguistic and cognitive functioning
and improve PWA’s quality of life. The project will lay the foundation for a future research platform for the early-
stage PI that examines whether the laboratory-assessed biomarkers predict different depression treatment
responses and language and functional improvements related to the treatments longitudnally."

Millions of Americans suffer from deficits in reward processing, in the context of psychiatric disorders including
major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Disrupted reward processing leads to worse outcomes, yet
current treatments poorly treat this symptom and new treatments are urgently needed. Recent evidence that
mu opioid antagonists function as antidepressants suggest the opioid system as a promising line for
developing novel treatments. We hypothesize that increasing endogenous enkephalins by using molecules
(DENKIs) that inhibit the degradation of this endogenous class of opioid peptides will reverse reward seeking
deficits without raising the liability for substance use disorders. To test this hypothesis and extend our
preliminary data, we will administer a DENKI to chronically stressed mice and record in vivo neural activity in
the reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)) as the freely moving mice
engage in a reward task that assesses different aspects of reward processing. Using KO mice and receptor-
specific antagonists, in Aim 1, we will determine if these effects are mediated by MOR and in Aim 2, test
whether they are mediated by delta opioid receptor (DOR). We will also confirm that DENKI administration is
not inherently rewarding. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel insights into how the opioid
system influence reward circuity activity during behavior and establish the basis for more detailed study of
endogenous enkephalin modulators as treatments for the anhedonia commonly seen in psychiatric disorders."
10989081,"Project Abstract
Because not all patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) respond to standard treatments, alternative
therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), ketamine, and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have
been introduced. These alternative therapies require more provider-intensive monitoring and thus are typically
only recommended for those with “treatment resistant” depression (TRD). However, establishing treatment
resistance clinically requires evidence of multiple treatment failures, and this is a costly and lengthy
process that burdens patients. If we could identify patients prone to multiple treatment failures of first-line
therapies, we could refer to alternative treatments sooner. The most relevant component of the task of
stratifying patients to alternative treatments is to separate partial response (PR) from true treatment
failure (TF) in the patients who do not meet response criteria. The current proposal will use trajectory
classification methods to empirically identify a group of patients with consistent nonresponse to a range of
first-line treatments (SSRIs, SNRIs, CBT), more accurately representing true treatment failure (TF). We will
use the method in both combined clinical trial data (PReDICT, iSPOT-D, STAR*D) as well as treatment as
usual (TAU) data (MARS). Then to demonstrate that these patients are more likely to be treatment resistant,
we will demonstrate that those with TF are less likely to respond to switch/augmentation of first-line treatments
than partial responders (PR) for the trial data and examine an association with a measure of TRD collected
for the observational data. If there is a link between initial TF and TRD, this group could then be targeted for
earlier referral to alternative treatments. The study will then demonstrate an analytic framework for future
modeling of TF by estimating effect size for a previously derived genetic biomarker using proper weighting
methods. The current study will thus allow us to bridge the gap from well-controlled clinical trial data to
future studies of more heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data and pave the way for possible real-
world changes in recommendations for treatment resistant patients."
10998512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a widespread human enteric pathogen that has a broad range of
animal hosts and environmental reservoirs. Meanwhile, the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is the most
common pestiferous cockroach species in human environments. B. germanica frequently harbors Salmonella
spp. in nature, serving as both an environmental reservoir and a vector. Transmission of S. Typhimurium by
cockroaches has been previously described as a passive, non-replicative process by which the bacteria are
mechanically transferred from one surface to another. However, our laboratory recently demonstrated that S.
Typhimurium actively colonizes the digestive tract of German cockroaches after being ingested. Colonization of
the cockroach is characterized in part by an initial population bottleneck during which most ingested bacteria are
eliminated. Subsequently, the surviving population of S. Typhimurium undergoes replication and persists in the
cockroach gut, interacting with a highly diverse microbiota. The bacteria that persist are disseminated in the
feces into the environment where they can be ingested by other cockroaches via coprophagy and/or acquired
by a vertebrate host. The central hypothesis of this project is that cockroaches provide a unique environment for
S. Typhimurium to undergo significant evolution as a result of both selection pressure from the host and
interaction with its gut microbiota. Specifically, we hypothesize that evolution in the gut of the cockroach vector
may favor the emergence of novel variants of S. Typhimurium with 1) enhanced ability for vector-borne
transmission, 2) altered potential to colonize other animal hosts, and 3) antimicrobial resistance horizontally
acquired from diverse constituents of the cockroach gut microbiota. We will pursue two specific aims to test our
hypotheses. In specific aim 1, we will use whole genome sequencing to identify the adaptive genotypic changes
that occur in S. Typhimurium after experimental evolution in a laboratory cockroach strain and we will examine
the effects of these changes on fitness in the vector. In specific aim 2, we will determine if S. Typhimurium can
horizontally acquire antimicrobial resistance from commensal bacteria harbored in the gut of field collected
cockroach strains, and we will explore the mechanisms by which this may occur. Together, these studies will
provide novel, naturally relevant insight into how underappreciated insect reservoirs may contribute to evolution
of S. Typhimurium and may implicate insect control as a simple intervention to mitigate pathogen evolution."
10998392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is emerging as an important immune related adverse event (IRAE) of immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). ICIs are a revolutionary new class of cancer treatment used in over 17 types of
cancer and are treatment options in approximately 38% of cancer patients. Their role in therapy is expected to
expand to additional cancers as well as in maintenance regimens. As their use expands, the frequency of AKI
as an IRAE is also expected to increase. AKI is especially hazardous in cancer patients. In addition to
increased rates of CKD and related sequalae, it is associated with lower rates of remission, higher costs of
care, ineligibility to future chemotherapy, and higher cancer mortality. ICI induced AKI must be detected early to
prevent irreversible damage, however, risk factors and effective monitoring parameters have not been
identified. Though exact mechanisms remain unclear, evidence suggest that ICIs cause AKI primarily through
acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Drug-drug interactions may be a primary driver of AIN during ICI therapy.
Studies of have repeatedly found that concomitant treatment of ICIs and other drugs suspected of causing AIN
are risk factors for ICI associated AKI. Beta-lactam antibiotics are critical supportive care agents in cancer
treatment and are also the leading cause of drug induced AIN. Beta-lactams cause AIN through formation of
drug-protein complexes that accumulate in renal interstitium, get presented as antigens to T-cells, which then
trigger inflammatory responses leading to AIN and AKI. ICIs may exaggerate this inflammatory response as
they set T-cells in a hyperactivate state leading to larger immune responses. Given the frequency of beta-
lactam use during ICIs treatment, this drug-drug interaction may be a primary driver of AKI in ICI users.
However, this potential drug-drug interaction remains unstudied in the literature. Understanding the
comparative risk of AIN with beta-lactam antibiotics versus key alternatives is essential for informing antibiotic
selection during ICI therapy. In Aim 1 of this study, we will use target trial emulation to evaluate whether, in
patients treated with ICIs, beta-lactams increase the rate of AKI versus fluroquinolones, an alternative to beta-
lactams that may carry a lower risk of AIN. In Sub-Aim 1a of this study, the treatment effect heterogeneity of
this drug-interaction will be evaluated using subgroup analysis, the prognostic score approach, and methods to
identify the optimal treatment rule. The accompanying training plan consists of both coursework as part of a
PhD program in epidemiology, application of advanced methods, and mentorship by expert clinician
researchers in renal pharmacoepidemiology, drug-drug interactions, nephrology, and oncology. This fellowship
will provide essential support to the trainee as she prepares for her career as an independent academic
pharmacoepidemiologist focused on studying nephrotoxicity in the cancer population."
10998399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White patients in pregnancy-related outcomes, including
perinatal depression symptomology, are stark and pervasive. Depression symptoms, which can result from social
stress, including racism-related stress, contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related outcomes.
Interventions that buffer against social stress, including racism-related stress, in perinatal care have potential to
reduce racial and ethnic disparities in postpartum depression symptomology. Patient-centered care and social
support are key components for addressing racism-related stress in the healthcare setting. However, to our
knowledge, there are no interventions for prevention and treatment of postpartum depression symptoms for
Black birthing people that are delivered in perinatal care and explicitly promote patient-centered care and provide
social supports. The proposed project engages Beloved Birth Black Centering (BBBC) program in generating
evidence to improve perinatal care interventions that address racism-related stress using a community-engaged
model of perinatal health services created by and for Black birthing people. BBBC incorporates five evidence-
based practices (EBPs): racially concordant care, midwifery-led group perinatal visits, doula support, wrap-
around care, and culturally aligned black birthing education. Through these bundled EBPs, BBBC promotes
patient autonomy, respectful interactions, social connection, and connection to community resources – all of
which have the potential to reduce postpartum depression symptoms. We will employ a pragmatic trial using a
mixed-methods analytic approach to analyze secondary, longitudinal data from electronic health records (EHRs)
and patient surveys. The overall objective of the proposed research is to test a bundled perinatal care intervention
on postpartum depression symptomology and explore mechanisms by which postpartum depression symptoms
can be prevented and treated among Black birthing people. This research proposal’s overall objective aligns with
the NIMHDs’ 2021-2025 strategic goal 3: “Develop and test interventions to reduce health disparities”. Aim 1 will
estimate the association of between BBBC and postpartum depression symptoms among Black birthing people
and will use propensity score analyses to compare postpartum depression symptoms among patients who
received perinatal care through BBBC (treatment group) to those receiving routine perinatal care (comparison
group). Aim 2 will assess the extent to which patient autonomy in decision-making and respectful clinician-patient
interactions in perinatal care is associated with postpartum depression symptoms among BBBC participants
using data from EHRs and patient surveys. Aim 3 will explore how BBBC patient experiences of perinatal care
may impact postpartum depression symptoms using data from patient surveys. This work is responsive to the
growing evidence showing that racism-related stress impacts health, and will ultimately advance the science of
health disparities research."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with a dismal prognosis that lacks
effective therapeutic strategies. While the advent of immunotherapy has significantly improved patient outcomes
in a variety of extracranial cancers, these novel approaches have achieved limited success in GBM. The goal of
this study is to investigate mechanisms underlying brain microenvironment-specific suppression of effective anti-
tumor immunity mediated by aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, and furthermore
whether targeting this oncogene creates novel vulnerabilities to enhance immune response in this deadly
disease. Extensive preliminary data, which leverages a highly innovative EGFR activated immunocompetent
murine glioma model (MADR-mEGFRvIII), indicate tumor-intrinsic EGFR signaling impairs intratumoral T cell
infiltration and promotes the development of a tumor microenvironment (TME) enriched in microglia, a myeloid
cell type unique to the brain. Moreover, preliminary data demonstrate an association between EGFR activation
and an immunosuppressive wound healing signature linked with poor prognosis in the myeloid compartment of
immune cells isolated from newly diagnosed GBM patient tumors. Specific Aim 1 utilizes a transgenic T cell
system engineered to be antigen-specific in conjunction with multiple modalities of in vivo EGFR ablation to
determine the precise impact of aberrant EGFR signaling and tumor-programmed myeloid cells on T cell
cytotoxic function, clonal proliferation, and exhaustion. Through the incorporation of functional and phenotypic
assays designed to isolate the contributions of each factor in the complex brain immune TME, this approach is
expected to provide novel insight into the role of EGFR activation in dysregulating effector T cell responses.
Specific Aim 2 endeavors to elucidate the axis by which aberrant EGFR signaling promotes a distinct
immunosuppressive microglia phenotype characterized by VEGF and IL-1β in the brain TME with an emphasis
on EGFR-mediated tumor-microglia crosstalk. Using in vitro co-culture approaches and in vivo knockdown
strategies, the precise impact of EGFR activation in coordination with microglia IL-1β signaling on tumor-
associated microglia phenotype and overall anti-tumor immune response will be assessed. Specific Aim 3
focuses on assessing rational combinatorial strategies targeting EGFR using ERAS-801, a novel clinical stage
small molecule inhibitor, to drive enhanced T cell infiltration followed by immune checkpoint blockade to support
prolonged T cell function within the TME. Overall, this project will provide the first comprehensive assessment of
the mechanistic underpinnings and functional consequences of aberrant EGFR activation on the myeloid-
dominant tumor immune microenvironment and the resultant impact on anti-tumor immune response in GBM.
By identifying the dynamics of interplay between oncogenic EGFR signaling and immune evasion, this work will
not only expand fundamental knowledge on the intersection of these two hallmarks of cancer, but also enable
development of near-term therapeutic strategies for patients with this grave malignancy."
10998519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with no known cure. Current therapies
focus on symptom relief with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants but have significant side effects. The gut
microbiome plays an important role in immune regulation, and modulation of the gut microflora could provide a
novel avenue for SLE therapy. The Luo Lab has demonstrated that bacterial DNA (bDNA) can stimulate IL-10
production and regulatory B cell (Breg) proliferation, which are both associated with improved lupus symptoms.
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an endosomal sensor that recognizes bDNA and is associated with less severe
lupus symptoms. CpG-B oligonucleotides (ODNs) are short nucleotide sequences that mimic bDNA and agonize
TLR9. We have shown that CpG-B ODNs can robustly induce IL-10 production and Breg proliferation in vitro
through two distinct, TLR9-dependent mechanisms: a B cell intrinsic mechanism, where TLR9 is agonized in
B cells themselves, and a B cell extrinsic mechanism, where TLR9 is agonized in a secondary cell type, creating
IL-6 that subsequently expands Bregs. IL-6 can expand Bregs but is also capable of expanding inflammatory
cell subsets. We have in vivo data to show that increased IL-6 is associated with increased Bregs but is also
associated with increased renal damage in lupus prone (MRL/lpr) mice. Therefore, we aim to enhance the IL-6
independent, B cell intrinsic mechanism, while limiting the IL-6 dependent, B cell extrinsic mechanism. This
proposal aims to determine the therapeutic potential of CpG-B ODNs in the management of SLE. We propose
to study these TLR9 agonists with MRL/lpr and humanized models, both in vitro and in vivo, to demonstrate the
translatability of my work. We hypothesize that CpG-B ODNs can increase the number of Bregs and protect
the host against SLE by acting through B cell intrinsic, TLR9 agonization. This application is broken down
into two aims: Aim 1 is to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CpG-B ODNs stimulate
Breg differentiation in vitro. The first objective is to elucidate the mechanism of the B cell extrinsic pathway by
using cell-specific Tlr9-/- co-culture experiments. By elucidating its mechanism, we can more effectively limit the
B cell extrinsic pathway in the future. We will then analyze the pro- vs. anti-inflammatory profiles of the intrinsic
and extrinsic mechanisms. Lastly, we propose to validate these findings in human PBMCs. Aim 2 is to determine
the efficacy of using CpG-B ODNs in vivo. We aim to enhance the B cell intrinsic mechanism, while limiting the
B cell extrinsic mechanism using Tlr9 conditional knockout mice. After determining that we can confer protection
in MRL/lpr mice, we will demonstrate that we can protect mice with a human immune system. These experiments
will demonstrate the potential efficacy of CpG-B ODNs in future human trials. We believe that CpG-B ODNs have
the potential to be passive, yet effective treatments for lupus. This work will be the focus of the applicant’s Ph.D.
candidacy and training plan. The applicant also plans to attend conferences, shadow physicians, and continue
to practice the skills necessary to being a successful and productive physician-scientist."

 Acute and chronic effects of viral diseases often involve immune-mediated responses, including
inflammation, immune activation, and autoimmunity. Long-COVID immunopathogenesis is complex but its
understanding is advancing rapidly. The consequences of immune-mediated damage in long COVID share
similarities (and differences) with other post-viral diseases like Ebola and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In the case of HIV, ongoing activation of the inflammatory response is a major
concern, and immune reconstitution remains limited in some patients even long after treatment initiation. In
addition to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, other viral infections such as CMV are known to result in inflammation-
related pathology. Viruses can also trigger autoimmunity. Epstein-Barr Virus is tightly linked with the onset of
Multiple Sclerosis through several autoimmune mechanisms. Viral encephalitis also often has an autoimmune
background. Common underlying mechanisms imply the possibility of employing similar therapeutic
interventions, such as neutralizing antibodies, antiviral drugs, and therapeutic vaccines to eliminate the
persistent virus or anti-inflammatory drugs to ameliorate chronic inflammation. Therapeutic interventions must
often target both ends of the virus-immune system spectrum. The prevalence of post-acute infectious
syndromes is concerning. The severity of the syndrome disables daily activities, posing a significant burden on
health, economy, and society. Despite intensive research on cellular and molecular mechanisms, scientific
platforms to share data and discuss new concepts are limited to sessions at major international conferences or
scientific meetings focusing on a specific condition.
 This annual workshop links leading international scientific investigators in a discussion of cutting-edge
research developments on underlying inflammatory mechanisms related to viral infection, and its clinical
implications. Specific aims of the meeting include: 1) providing a global cross-disciplinary platform to exchange
knowledge on underlying mechanisms of virus-mediated inflammation; 2) gathering basic, translational, and
clinical researchers, and clinicians to stimulate discussion on remaining unknowns; 3) fostering future
collaborations among participants; 4) translating the data into clinical guidance; and 5) increasing the visibility
of early career investigators and investigators from underrepresented minority (URM) groups and their
research, thereby facilitating a generation of future leaders in the field."

Reading difficulties continue to be a pervasive public health issue. Many children, particularly those from
marginalized populations, experience reading difficulties due to underdeveloped phonological awareness –
and, specifically, phonemic awareness. Although decades of basic research have established phonemic
awareness as causally related to reading acquisition as well as a developmental progression from phonological
sensitivity to phonemic awareness, we know much less about how or when to support phonological
awareness development in children. Our long-term goal is to optimize phonological awareness intervention as
a means of preventing reading difficulties and disparities. Our short-term goal is to complete two randomized
controlled trials that inform such optimization through addressing current scientific controversies around the
content, timing, and goals of phonological awareness intervention. In the randomized controlled trials, we
evaluate three interventions (phonological sensitivity + phonemic awareness, phonemic awareness only,
delayed phonemic awareness), which vary in the linguistic units targeted but are carefully equated on content
and/or instructional time, for their impact on children’s phonemic awareness, reading, and spelling skills
relative to each other and to a control condition; we also consider whether impacts differ based on when and to
whom intervention is provided. Participating preschool and kindergarten children contribute screening, pretest,
midtest, posttest, and longitudinal data to address four aims: (Specific Aim 1) Determine the relative impact on
phonemic awareness, and subsequent reading and spelling development, of intervention that (a) initially
targets phonological sensitivity or (b) directly targets only phonemic awareness, (Specific Aim 2) Determine the
relative efficacy of these two approaches when intervening during preschool or kindergarten, (Secondary Aim
3) Examine whether the impact of the two approaches is differential based on children’s initial phonological
skills and alphabet knowledge as well as language variation, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, and
(Secondary Aim 4) Explore whether a transition point can be identified as to when phonemic awareness
intervention is most likely to be efficacious. The results will contribute to both basic science concerning the
development of phonological awareness and its contribution to reading and spelling acquisition as well as
translational efforts. With respect to the latter, results will inform learning standards, instructional
recommendations, and intervention design to better align these with the scientific evidence base and thereby
improve prevention and intervention for reading difficulties."

There are millions of people worldwide with debilitating upper limb amputations. While electrical signals from
residual muscle can provide some function, every amputee is missing muscles, and therefore missing a variety
of important functions. Our group has demonstrated a novel method for obtaining signals from independent nerve
fascicles in humans, which we call the Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI). The small muscle grafts
degenerate, regenerate, revascularize, and reinnervate utilizing natural biologic processes. They also introduce
a degree of conformity among prosthetic users, for example always having thumb muscles available for
electromyography (EMG). Our long-term goal is to achieve able bodied performance for prosthetic hand
movement. The objective of our current application, which represents the next step, is to develop reusable deep
learning architectures for controlling wrist and finger movements. We will achieve this with the following specific
aims. In Aim 1 we will utilize a range of deep learning techniques we developed for brain machine interfaces to
use with implantable EMG signals for truly continuous control of finger movement. This will be done in monkeys
and humans with similar implanted electrodes. In Aim 2 we will achieve simultaneous control of the wrist and
fingers by learning to segregate stabilization related EMG from wrist movement related EMG, again in both
humans and monkeys. Finally, in Aim 3, in humans, we will quantify the biomechanical efficiencies gained from
using our novel prosthetic decoders testing the likely clinical impact of this approach. We believe that the
demonstration of higher performance across the board will motivate widespread use of RPNI and implantable
EMG for prosthetic control after upper limb amputation."
10979867,"ABSTRACT: How Distinct Age-Associated B Cell Subsets Can Protect the Aged from Influenza. With age,
the generation of T follicular helpers from naive CD4 T cells, and of germinal center B cells from follicular B cells,
both of which are essential for the generation of high affinity antibody (Ab), become highly compromised. Most
current vaccines for influenza in the elderly are ineffective at inducing these critical responses. Thus, the elderly,
though protected by Ab already in place for pathogens encountered earlier in life, are highly susceptible to new
strains of virus (e.g. new yearly variants of influenza) and newly emerged pathogens (e.g. pandemic influenzas,
COVID-19). In aged mice, we noted the generation of an unusual population of Ab-secreting B cells in response
to live influenza infection. We found they are derived from stimulation of recently described ""age-associated B
cells"" (ABC) rather than conventional naïve follicular B cells. In aged mice influenza-induced ABC (iABC)
responses are generated independently of CD4 T cell help, but are strictly depend on stimulation by pathogen-
associated ""danger"" signals. Notably, the ABC are the predominant naïve B cells that respond to influenza
infection in aged mice. We find only the IgD ABC subset of naïve ABC, respond, and that IgD ABC include two
subsets, T-bet+/CD11c+ and T-bet-/CD11c-. Here we will determine the potential of each of these to respond to
infection and generate Ab-secreting cells (AbSC), B cell memory and long-lived Ab-secreting cells in the lung
and nasal tissues as well as the spleen, lymph node and bone marrow and define what signals from the influenza
infection are needed. We will determine the contribution of the T-bet and non-T-bet responses to protection from
reinfection. We will compare the ability of live influenza virus, whole inactivated virus and mRNA-LNP vaccine to
generate ABC-derived responses and induce protective immunity, and test if adding infection-associated signals
improves this. These results will give us new insights into this novel age-associated immune pathway and should
provide new indications of how vaccines can be improved to provide more robust protection to the elderly who
currently are highly vulnerable."

Every year 400,000 people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are hospitalized, transfer
to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), and transition to home, assisted living, or long term care. After discharge,
one in five patients are re-hospitalized within 30 days, and their caregivers experience high levels of strain and
psychological harm. Black SNF patients and caregivers, compared to their White counterparts, experience
lower access to ADRD care and worse outcomes after SNF discharge. To promote effective transitions from
SNF to home and other destinations, we designed the Connect-Home ADRD transitional care intervention (C-
H ADRD), an adaptation of Connect-Home transitional care. Our recent trial of Connect-Home generated
evidence for intervention efficacy and reach in a population of Black and White patient and caregiver dyads. In
a supplemental award, we identified unique needs of SNF patients with ADRD and their caregivers. We
designed the C-H ADRD intervention to address those needs: (1) before discharge, SNF staff develop an
ADRD transition plan with patient and caregiver dyads and (2) after discharge, a Dementia Caregiving
Specialist provides phone-based support for the ADRD transition plan. In a pilot study, we demonstrated C-H
ADRD’s feasibility, acceptability, and potential to reduce caregiver strain and patient neuropsychiatric
symptoms (NPS). The next logical step is an efficacy test of C-H ADRD. Our Objective is to conduct a cluster
randomized trial (CRT) of C-H ADRD, enrolling 360 ADRD patient and caregiver dyads in 12 SNFs.
The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Conduct an CRT of C-H ADRD (intervention) vs. usual discharge planning (control) and compare
caregiver outcomes 30 days after discharge: (1) caregiver strain (primary) and (2) depression and
preparedness for care transitions (secondary).
Aim 2: Compare patient outcomes between intervention and control arms 30 days after discharge: (1) patient
NPS (primary) and (2) quality of life and acute care use (secondary). Exploratory: Examine whether caregiver
strain modifies intervention effect on patient outcomes.
Aim 3: Examine potential disparities by race in Connect-Home ADRD outcomes and implementation. (3a)
Determine intervention impact by patient race and other factors for caregiver and patient outcomes. (3b)
Identify factors at the dyad-level (e.g., social determinants) and SNF-level (e.g., staffing) contributing to fidelity
to the C-H ADRD protocol.
IMPACT: C-H ADRD has potential to improve health outcomes and health equity for people with ADRD and
their caregivers."
10980254,"The inferior olivary nucleus plays a vital role in cerebellar function and motor control, and olivary degeneration
is central to the pathophysiology of tremor and ataxia. A striking feature of olivary neurons is that they are
susceptible to degeneration both from intrinsic molecular pathology (e.g., in spinocerebellar ataxias) as well as
from extrinsic denervation of inhibitory cerebellar input which causes hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD).
These triggers for olivary degeneration are assumed to reflect distinct cell death mechanisms, but our recent
data strongly suggests that these different etiologies utilize shared molecular events key to olivary neuron
viability. This proposal will test this novel hypothesis, which has profound implications for inferior olivary neuron
survival and function. In a genetically precise mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1; SCA1-
knockin or SCA1-KI mice), we find olivary neuron hypertrophy accompanied by the characteristic increase in
dendrite length. Remarkably, these features occur in the absence of loss of inhibitory input. Moreover, we find
no olivary pathology in a separate line of SCA1 transgenic mice that exhibit more severe but restricted
cerebellar Purkinje neuron degeneration. A significant loss of calbindin positive neurons, characteristic of
olivary degeneration, accompanies HOD in SCA1-KI mice. Considered together, these findings challenge
current dogma by dissociating HOD and denervation. Preliminary studies using in vivo electrophysiological
recordings demonstrate that synaptic (extrinsic) excitation on the olive, the cause of HOD due to inhibitory
neuron denervation, is not increased. Additional studies demonstrate that hypertrophic olivary neurons exhibit
increased intrinsic excitability of neurons due to potassium (K+) channel loss-of-function. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that this increased intrinsic excitability is the trigger for olivary degeneration in SCA1,
and that increased excitability from whatever source (intrinsic or extrinsic) is a shared mechanism for inferior
olive degeneration. We further hypothesize that olivary degeneration can therefore be prevented by
normalizing membrane excitability. We will test these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1.
Define the relationship between membrane excitability and olivary degeneration in SCA1. Aim 2: Define
intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to olivary dysfunction in models of SCA1. Aim 3: Determine the basis for
increased intrinsic excitability in hypertrophic olivary degeneration in SCA1. Results from these studies are
expected to establish that increased membrane excitability is a convergent mechanism for olivary
degeneration. These studies would be expected to provide insight into whether neuronal degeneration due to
synaptic excitotoxicity may be addressed by reducing intrinsic excitability as a therapeutic strategy."

Alcohol is the most commonly consumed drug in the world. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. In the original R01, we conducted a randomized trial of intravenous alcohol versus placebo to demonstrate an acute change in atrial electrophysiology expected to render the atria more prone to fibrillate and demonstrated a near-term risk of AF associated with alcohol consumption in an observational, case-crossover, study of ambulatory patients. Those findings coupled with a recent randomized trial showing that abstinence reduces AF burden along with an NIH priority to study utilization of digital health to promote alcohol abstinence in these patients motivate our revised Aim 1. In Aim 1, we will employ human-centered design in collaboration with AF patients and experts in behavioral change, alcohol use, technology, and implementation research to construct a smartphone-based mobile application purpose-built to promote alcohol abstinence specifically in AF patients. We will leverage our Eureka Digital Research Platform, our previous research findings, and recent integrations with commercially available smart watch-detected AF episodes to craft a starting framework for this Digital Intervention, including 1. Messaging; 2. An individualized visualization of alcohol-AF relationships; and 3. Real-time abstinence encouragement triggered by geofencing of establishments that sell alcohol. The Digital Intervention will be compared to a control condition in a randomized trial, with outcomes of AF burden and durable abstinence measured by self-report and objective assessments. In Aim 2 of this revised submission, we also seek to fill an important gap remaining in the study of alcohol and AF: definitive, randomized controlled trial evidence that alcohol consumption immediately heightens the risk of a discrete AF episode. New preliminary data ramifies the continued import of such information to AF patients, evidence of such a causal relationship would bolster the utility of the proposed Digital Intervention in Aim 1, and simultaneous assessments of physiology will provide mechanistic information also of priority per a recent NIH statement. In Aim 2, ambulatory paroxysmal AF patients will be fit with a continuously recording ECG, a transdermal alcohol sensor, and a Fitbit and will then receive randomization instructions daily to abstain or not abstain from alcohol. We are powered to detect clinically meaningful associations among AF patients drinking within guideline-acceptable limits, making this especially pertinent to the great majority of individuals who consume alcohol. Aim 2 participants will receive an individualized visualization of AF episodes versus their randomization assignments, and, with subsequent encouragement to avoid alcohol, will then be evaluated for durable abstinence using the same methods as those employed in Aim 1. This research offers a rigorously developed and evaluated digital tool to promote abstinence that is imminently scalable while elucidating a critical gap pertinent to immediate causal relationships between alcohol consumed within guideline-acceptable limits and discrete episodes of AF."

Maintaining physical activity (PA) is critical for older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who complete
cardiac rehabilitation (CR) because it prevents adverse secondary cardiac events, declining functional status,
and poor quality of life. CR is an evidence-based, exercise-based program prescribed after cardiac events
(e.g., myocardial infarction, revascularization) to improve overall physical, mental, and social functioning.
However, the majority (50-85%) of individuals report no exercise 6 months after completing CR, leaving them
vulnerable to rapid clinical, functional, and cognitive decline. The objective of this 6-month randomized
controlled trial (n=143 per arm) is to test the efficacy of a virtual coaching and social support intervention to
improve PA, psychosocial, social cognitive, and clinical outcomes as well as understand the mechanisms that
affect change in outcomes for older adults (age ≥ 60) exiting CR and living in urban and rural areas. Virtual
coaching includes: 1) education, 2) personalized feedback, and 3) motivation; social support includes social
networking in groups of 4-6. The rationale for our approach is that CR is typically only 12 weeks or less but
older adults desire and require extended support to reap the numerous benefits of sustained PA. The specific
aims are: 1) Determine the effect of a virtual coaching and social support intervention on adherence to PA
(measured by objective step counts) in the intervention vs. control groups; secondary measures will be
sedentary time, functional fitness, and self-reported exercise. 2) Determine the effect of the virtual coaching
and social support on psychosocial and social cognitive factors (self-efficacy, self-regulation, perceived
social support) in the intervention vs. control groups; and 2a) Evaluate the extent to which psychosocial and
social cognitive factors mediate the effect of the intervention on PA adherence. 3) Examine differences
in clinical outcomes including CVD risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity) between
groups. We will also record and explore group differences in cardiac events/rehospitalization. This study is
innovative because we will: 1) provide a virtual social network to mimic the social support received in CR; 2)
include an optional leader board/buddy system/badges to increase engagement; 3) intentionally recruit diverse,
under-represented groups (rural, women, racial/ethnic minorities) and deliver the intervention in Spanish; and
4) be the first clinical trial to address loneliness in patients with CVD. Significance: We address key NIH
priorities to improve adherence to healthy behaviors and reduce burden of chronic conditions as well as
promote a program in older adults to maintain maximum PA/functional fitness. Impact: While leveraging digital
health innovations, we will test a novel and pragmatic solution to maintain PA after CR completion that may
lead to an efficacious evidence-based intervention that improves critical outcomes for older adults with CVD
living in urban and rural communities at risk for functional decline, secondary events, depression, and cognitive
decline. Our long-term goal is to disseminate a low-cost program that is easily scalable to other CR centers."

Asthma and asthmatic symptoms continue to persist and are a growing health burden demonstrating the need
to understand how the main asthmatic effector molecule, immunoglobulin (Ig) E (IgE), is produced. Asthmatic
pathology occurs by IgE being produced in response to what are typically innocuous substances. While IgE
production can lead to protective immunity in response to venoms and multicellular pathogens, its overproduction
in response to benign substances underlies its role in asthmatic and allergic inflammation. IgE is secreted from
B lineage cells in the presence of cognate antigen and activates mast cells and basophils to release potent
inflammatory molecules which act directly on the airway wall and attract inflammatory cells to the lungs. Emerging
evidence demonstrates that allergic inflammation sensitizes another cell type- neurons. Once sensitized,
neurons release a host of neurotransmitters which enhance allergic inflammation, and recent data indicate the
neuronal ability to enhance B-cell mediated IgE overproduction. However, what sensitizes these neurons and
what effect sensitized neurons have on asthmatic pathology, in particular the overproduction of IgE, requires
further investigation.
The overall objective of this application is to investigate the role of the sensory and autonomic neurons in IgE
overproduction in allergic asthma. Our preliminary data has led us to hypothesize that sensory neurons
stimulate sympathetic neurons to stimulate B-cell overproduction to increase IgE release. We show that
sensory neurons can sense antigen alongside antigen-sensing immune cells. This stimulation of sensory
neurons by antigen then increases B-cell production by eliciting sympathetic reflex activation. Once the surplus
B-cell reservoir reaches the allergic lung, stimulated sensory neurons then release their neurotransmitters during
antigen recognition which stimulates the overproduction of IgE. We will investigate this novel neuronal circuit of
IgE overproduction in two aims. Studies in AIM 1 will use robust electrophysiological recording and calcium
imaging techniques to assess a novel signaling pathway of sensory neuron antigen recognition, excitation, and
hypersensitization. Subsequent molecular assays will delineate the exact downstream molecule effector with the
hopes to identify potential drug targets for future study. Studies in AIM 2 will use neural tracer technology to
learn which brain regions are involved in this novel neuronal circuit. Further studies in this aim will test the
necessity and sufficiency of sensory neurons and autonomic neurons in regulating B-cell production using state-
of-the-art chemogenetic tools. Isolated cell experiments will delineate which neuronal molecules affect B-cell IgE
production. These data will drive further experiments to identify how the entire pathway works in a mouse model
of fungal allergic asthma. This contribution is significant because it is expected to elucidate a complete
picture of how IgE is produced and dysregulated in asthma. Such knowledge has the potential to inform
the development of new strategies that will help to reduce the growing problem of allergic asthma."

 Insulin controls hyperglycemia after feeding by stimulating glucose uptake and suppressing
endogenous glucose production. The liver contributes 90% of endogenous glucose production during fasting,
generated through glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis, thus insulin’s control of hepatic glucose
metabolism is crucial for restoring whole body glucose homeostasis. Insulin acutely suppresses hepatic
glucose production and promotes glucose uptake and storage within fifteen minutes of a glucose bolus. This is
accomplished through direct and indirect effects on the liver. The direct mechanism by which insulin acutely
controls hepatic glucose utilization is unclear, and previous studies suggest it becomes dysregulated with
insulin resistance. Our lab and others demonstrated that insulin directly controls liver glucose balance through
AKT, a serine/threonine kinase and an obligate insulin signaling intermediate in hepatocytes. The goal of this
study is to determine 1) the metabolic pathways AKT controls to acutely regulate glucose utilization and 2) the
mechanisms involved and how they becomes aberrant in metabolic disease. Preliminary stable isotope tracing
experiments suggest that AKT rapidly increases glucose contribution to glycolytic intermediates and lipogenic
precursors within 5 minutes, independent of changes to glycogen metabolism. I have also found that insulin
stimulates phosphorylation of an allosteric regulator of glycolysis, PFK2/FBPase2, in hepatocytes at Ser469
and Ser486 in an AKT-dependent manner. Phosphorylation at these residues correlates with increased PFK2
kinase activity. Thus, I hypothesize that insulin acutely shifts glucose balance in the liver from gluconeogenesis
to glycolysis postprandially through AKT-mediated PFK2 phosphorylation. I will test whether AKT suppression
of gluconeogenesis allows for the increased contribution of glucose to glycolytic intermediates and lipid
precursors, and the role of PFK2 phosphorylation downstream of insulin signaling in mediating AKT’s acute
effects on glucose flux. Finally, I will interrogate how the AKT-PFK2 pathway contributes to in vivo hepatic
glucose utilization in both healthy and insulin resistant states using diet interventions, hyperinsulinemic clamps
and adeno-associated virus delivery of phosphomutant PFK2. Overall, this study will determine the acute
mechanisms by which insulin directly controls hepatic glucose balance, which may reveal novel therapeutic
targets for treating insulin resistance and maintaining glucose homeostasis."

The developing brain becomes active before it is ready to receive sensory input. Such stimulus-independent
developmental activity was originally described and characterized in the visual system over three thirty years
ago. Since then, the phenomenon has been observed and studied in many additional areas of the brain, including
other sensory systems as well as in the thalamus and cortex. Where tested, altering developmental activity leads
to disorganization of neuronal connections. While its role in instructing wiring fidelity has received significant
attention, two important questions about developmental activity remain largely unaddressed: First, is the activity
is coordinated across disparate brain regions? And, secondly, what is the significance of developmental activity
to shaping behavior, and more specifically, how does it contribute to the maturation of a healthy nervous system?
Understanding brain development is a significant scientific challenge with direct relevance to human health.
Studies into the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders rightly cast a wide net, covering progressive stages of
neural development from proliferation to morphogenesis to synaptogenesis. Notably, developmental activity—
as an evolutionarily conserved process—remains a blind spot, mostly due to the challenges of working with the
mammalian model: both in utero development and the daunting size and complexity, make the requisite
exploratory studies prohibitively costly.
 The fruit fly brain also has developmental activity comparable to that seen in mammals. Patterned, Stimulus-
Independent Neural Activity (PSINA, ‘see-nah’) engages the whole brain in highly structured and stereotyped
activity, providing neurons their first opportunity to communicate across previously inaccessible spatiotemporal
scales. The fly, with its approachably complex brain and an ever-expanding molecular-genetic toolkit, is at the
forefront of cellular, systems, and behavioral neuroscience research. The discovery of PSINA introduced this
powerful fly model to complement mammalian studies into developmental activity.
 Recently, our lab reported that a population of ~2,000 neurons, genetically defined by their expression of the
cation channel Trpγ, is critical to coordinating PSINA across the brain. We know that a much smaller subset of
this population is directly involved in PSINA. In my first Aim, I will use a recently developed molecular-genetic
approach to functionally fractionate Trpγ+ population down to individual cells. In the process, I will learn how the
circuitry of PSINA is organized to produce its distinct spatiotemporal structure. Further insights into the biology
of PSINA will come from my second Aim, where I will ask how a neuropeptide signaling pathway acts through
specific neurons to shape the activity. With the successful completion of this project, we will gain the experimental
control to explore how critical brain functions, from sensory processing to sleep and learning-and-memory, are
shaped by developmental activity. I expect that the discovery science I carry out in fly will motivate studies in the
mammalian system to address the relevance of developmental activity to the assembly of a healthy brain."

 Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasingly common, resistant to treatment, and responsible for a
broad range of medical comorbidities and excess mortality. Pediatric obesity is especially concerning as it
frequently persists throughout life. The causes of obesity involve interactions of genetics and environmental
factors. The Behavioral Susceptibility Theory suggests genetic factors predispose individuals to unfavorable
appetite regulation such that when they are exposed to highly palatable foods, excess consumption, positive
energy imbalance, and weight gain result. Considering obesity polygenic risk scores (PRS) from recent
genome-wide association studies, my previous research found obesity PRSs relate to appetitive traits and BMI
in children. As a target of recent effective anti-obesity medications, GLP-1 and associated pathways play an
important therapeutic role through appetite regulation. However, there is a knowledge gap as to how the
endogenous GLP-1 pathway may drive or prevent obesity, specifically how genetic variants associated with
this pathway may relate to phenotypes of appetitive traits (observable behaviors) and food cue reactivity (a
conditioned reward response to food cues). Specific Aim 1 will incorporate genotype and appetitive trait data
collected on a sample of 312 children aged 9-12 years, allowing the association of GLP-1 related genetic
variants and appetitive traits to be assessed, both as main effects and in higher order epistatic interactions.
This will allow my novel training in methods for high dimensional genetic data analysis. Specific Aim 2 will
leverage fMRI data conducted in a subset of 176 of these children to associate these variants independently
and interactively with food cue reactivity in reward regions of the brain. This will allow my novel training in the
processing and analysis of fMRI data. Finally, linking these characteristics to deleterious weight gain in pre-
adolescence, Specific Aim 3 will associate GLP-1 related genetic variants independently and interactively with
prospective weight gain in these children. It will further explore how appetitive traits and food cue reactivity may
mediate an association between GLP-1 pathway heterogeneity and prospective weight gain. This will allow my
novel training in methods for statistical mediation analysis. I will gain further training in the clinical application of
obesity research, and professional skills in preparation for an independent career as a physician scientist.
 This F30 proposal will allow me to contribute to the understanding of causes of obesity through appetitive
mechanisms and this increased etiologic understanding may enhance obesity prevention and treatment efforts.
The highly collaborative environment at Dartmouth College, Dartmouth Health, and the Quantitative Biomedical
Sciences graduate program will help me to achieve my proposed research and training goals."

The long-term goal of this research is to understand visual processing in the inner plexiform
layer of the retina. More immediately, the research serves to provide genetic access to distinct
glycinergic amacrine cell types for functional characterization and to understand how they shape
the response properties of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Amacrine cells (ACs) are the most
diverse neurons in the retina, with at least 60 types of ACs identified through single-cell RNA
sequencing in the mouse retina, along with the 40-50 AC types described in morphological
studies. It is believed that each AC type has a distinct functional role in visual processing, yet
the correspondence is only known for fewer than 20 types. Within the 60 identified AC types,
approximately 13 are characterized as glycinergic ACs with small dendrites spanning multiple
vertical layers. Our understanding of the functions of glycinergic ACs is limited to only about 5 of
these types. For most of the remaining glycinergic ACs, we are constrained from assigning
precise functions to these genetically and morphologically defined cell types. We propose to use
mouse intersectional genetics, combined with functional imaging and electrophysiology
recording, to dissect AC circuits in three separate Aims. In Aim 1, we will create Cre/tTA and
Cre/Flp intersectional strategies to discover new glycinergic AC types and to minimize the
labeling to the fewest possible types. In Aim 2, we will investigate how visual responses are
generated and organized across the laminar depth of the dendrites of the newly discovered
glycinergic AC types. In Aim 3, we will identify the postsynaptic RGCs of the glycinergic AC
types with intersectional ChR2 activation. We will further examine their functional roles with
chemogenetic inactivation. We will begin with COMS-AC, a newly identified glycinergic
amacrine cell and map its synaptic connectivity with multiple co-stratifying RGCs, followed by
testing the hypotheses that it plays a multitasking role in different RGC circuits with selective
inactivation. We will use both hypotheses driven and discovery-based approaches to gain
insights into the circuit functions of glycinergic ACs. This research will enhance our
comprehension of visual processing in the inner retina, and the technologies developed will
represent significant advancements compared to existing methods for studying amacrine cells,
with potential applicability to other brain circuits. Moreover, this project will offer valuable
insights into the pathophysiological neuronal mechanisms underlying retinal diseases,
contributing to the development of improved therapeutic strategies."

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is one of the world’s most common life-threatening
genetic diseases. Mutations in the genes PKD1 and PKD2 account for 85% and 15% of all ADPKD cases,
respectively. ADPKD patients are heterozygous for either PKD1 or PKD2 deleterious mutations; homozygous
mutations are considered incompatible with life. Interestingly, loss-of-heterozygosity studies and genome
sequencing of patients’ cysts, have documented the clonal nature of the epithelial cysts in ADPKD. Altogether,
these data support the two-hit model in which one mutation in either PKD1 or PKD2 is inherited, but a second
(somatic) mutation is required for the clonal expansion of the epithelial cells and progression of cystic disease.
While these data strongly support the two-hit model, there is scarce data reporting if, when, and how, a second
mutation in an individual renal cell affects the behavior of that cell and its environment in vivo.
We have generated a series of mouse lines that recapitulates the two-hit model. In an otherwise Pkd2
heterozygous animal, we can induce a second mutation during embryonic development but also at later
timepoints. Our data confirms that single mutant cells are responsible for the generation of cysts and that all
cells in the cyst arise from the originally mutated cell. Most importantly, our data reveals that not all mutant
cells become cysts.
We hypothesize that cyst inception is modulated by additional intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting mutant
cells. Specifically, we hypothesize that cyst inception and/or growth is driven by tubular identity, external
sources of proliferation and the microenvironment created by the chimeric nature of the disease. We will test
these hypotheses in three aims employing mouse models as well as kidney explants and iPSC-derived kidney
organoids."

hope for individuals affected by AD and related dementias (ADRD) and their families, best practices are
unclear due to potential harms, substantial costs, and modest efficacy. Those affected by ADRD, along
with their families, clinicians, and payers, dynamically make decisions about therapies in response to the
evolving cognitive, physical, behavioral, financial, and emotional challenges as dementia progresses.
Standard cost effectiveness analyses fall short in incorporating the perspectives of the diverse users of
new treatments, who differ in clinical responsiveness, side effects tolerance, risk acceptance, spending
preferences, and use of therapies driven by healthcare access inequities and cultural differences. In the
planning phase (R61), we will conduct focus groups with diverse individuals affected by ADRD to
understand their medication decision-making processes. With this information, we will design discrete
choice experiments to learn how different attributes of a therapy are valued by affected individuals and
what tradeoffs they would make between treatments with different attributes. In the implementation
phase (R33), we will administer the survey, in a web-based format, to a large, nationally representative
sample of older adults conversant in English or Spanish. Experiment results will inform a risk-adjusted
cost-effectiveness (GRACE) model, incorporating relative preferences and health risk attitudes, overall,
and by specific subpopulations of interest, including racial and ethnic subgroups that have experienced
inequities in management of ADRD. Using these estimates, data from the National Health and Aging
Trends Study cohort (2011-2024) with their Medicare claims, and other input data from the literature,
we will develop, validate, and calibrate a health economic evaluation microsimulation model of ADRD
progression and outcomes. We will apply the model to estimate the cost-effectiveness as well as
financial risk and health equity impacts of new existing and hypothetical ADRD drugs, overall and for
specific patient populations disproportionately impacted by ADRD. We will prepare the final models so
that they are accessible for use as additional novel therapies become available."
10976097,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) commonly exhibit pathologic gait patterns. Crouch gait, which is
characterized by excessive stance phase knee flexion and may be accompanied by other deficits at the hip
and/or ankle, is a common and debilitating gait disorder in children with CP. Left untreated or inadequately
addressed, children with crouch gait will experience progressive gait deterioration, leading to a loss of
ambulation in a large portion of adolescents with CP. While crouch gait is one of the most frequently observed
gait deviations in children with CP, current intervention approaches including surgical and non-surgical have
not been optimized to effectively address these key gait deficits in many children with CP. Specifically, surgical
interventions, which typically target the hamstrings, remain the dominant interventions but outcomes are
variable across different studies. Similarly, muscle strengthening programs have been developed to improve
crouch gait, but studies showed inconsistent outcomes. Hamstrings botulinum toxin injections have been
shown to modestly improve knee kinematics 2 weeks post injection, but the effects mostly disappeared by ~12
weeks, leading to a repeated injections of botulinum toxin during growth. Robotic assistance has been used to
improve crouch gait in children with CP, although the effect was not retained after the removal of the
assistance force. Thus, there is a clear need for the development of new interventions for improving crouch
gait in children with CP, which requires a thorough examination of the motor learning mechanisms of the
interventions. The overall objective of this study is to determine whether the application of a targeted
resistance torque to the knee joint during overground walking will induce improvements in crouch gait in
children with CP. Our central hypothesis is that increasing errors by applying a targeted perturbation torque to
the knee joint during overground walking will facilitate motor learning and induce improvement in crouch gait in
children with CP. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the effect of error size on motor learning to improve
crouch gait in children with CP. We expect to see a greater improvement in crouch gait in children with CP
after applying a targeted resistance torque to the knee joint during the swing phase of gait in comparison to
assistance torque during walking. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of error variability on motor learning to
improve crouch gait in children with CP. We expect to see a longer retention of improved crouch gait in
children with CP after applying a varied resistance torque to the knee joint in comparison to a constant
resistance torque during overground walking. Results from this study are expected to demonstrate the effect
of error size and error variability on the motor learning of improved crouch gait in children with CP. The results
of this study are expected to have an important positive impact by providing a strong justification for the
development of an effective intervention for improving crouch gait in children with CP that is more effective
than the best physical interventions currently available."

The ventricular conduction system (VCS) is essential for normal myocardial excitation and contraction.
Diseases impacting VCS structure and function are responsible for a substantial burden of cardiovascular
disease, including conduction slowing and block, and triggered and reentrant arrhythmias. In previous NIH-
funded work, our laboratory established and characterized novel genetic tools to visualize the formation and
function of the murine VCS and its constituent Purkinje cells, resulting in the identification of a novel
transcriptional pathway critical for VCS development. We also used these tools to create and characterize
innovative genetically engineered murine models that firmly established the role of Purkinje cells or juxta-
Purkine cells as arrhythmogenic triggers in heritable syndromes including CPVT and LQT3. While our earlier
studies significantly advanced the field's understanding of the role of Purkinje cells in mono- and oligogenic
forms of arrhythmogenic heart disease, much less is known about the underlying mechanistic basis for
pathologic remodeling of the VCS in common acquired cardiomyopathies, such as those that seen in patients
with hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other common conditions. These disease states are by far
responsible for the greatest burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We have obtained preliminary
data suggesting that paracrine signaling from activated fibroblasts may drive Purkinje cell transcriptional
remodeling, as evidenced by repression of the rapid conduction signature and induction of a pro-fibrotic
program. Based upon these data, we propose two specific aims designed to provide a deep mechanistic
understanding of pathologic remodeling of Purkinje cells. We also will perform exploratory studies to determine
if agents that target fibroblast activation can diminish pathologic Purkinje cell remodeling."

Newborn Screening (NBS) is celebrating its 60th anniversary as one of the most important and
life-saving public health programs in the United States. NBS has enabled countless babies with
rare disorders to lead productive lives because of early detection and early treatment. Importantly,
current NBS panels reflect only a fraction of the potentially screenable disorders, i.e. disorders
that are serious, treatable, and detectable in dried blood spots (DBS). There are many other
disorders where affected children would benefit from early detection. Thus, there is an ever
pressing need to expand our current NBS practices. Pilot NBS programs are necessary to gather
objective data about the feasibility, accuracy, and outcome of screening for new disorders.
ScreenPlus is a multi-disorder, multi-tiered, flexible pilot NBS program that screens consented
infants from diverse backgrounds for a panel of 14 rare disorders in addition to those on New
York’s routine panel. ScreenPlus includes long term follow up of identified infants to enable
analysis of critical outcome data, with the goal of describing pre-symptomatic disease
progression, identifying optimal times to initiate therapy, and determining whether there is a
benefit to early detection. Parental engagement is at the core of ScreenPlus and includes parental
education and informed consent, as well as a series of surveys, qualitative interviews and focus
groups to elicit parental perspectives on the complexities of NBS expansion. The creation of a
complex cost share infrastructure with funding from NIH, industry sponsors, and patient advocacy
groups has enabled the program to effectively and efficiently function with transparency and
mutual benefit. Our current funding cycle showed exceptional progress in all aspects of the study.
We validated screening assays, contracted with sponsors, and initiated live screening. We
identified affected infants who are now being monitored and treated as needed. We created and
executed parental surveys, which are providing fascinating and important insights into the future
of NBS expansion. In this Competitive Renewal application, we hope to build upon the remarkable
progress that we have made thus far to provide critical, detailed data to help guide objective,
ethically sensitive decision-making about NBS expansion."

Mental illness is common among women who use methamphetamine (WWUM). The high comorbidity of
mental health issues and meth use worsens both their mental health and meth use outcomes. We propose to
evaluate the potential of Friendship Bench to be used as a low-threshold, task-shifting mental health
intervention among WWUM in Vietnam—a lower-middle-income country. The specific aims of this research
proposal are to: (1) assess the mental health needs of WWUM in Haiphong, (2) adapt Friendship Bench to the
specific needs of Vietnamese WWUM and (3) assess the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the adapted
Friendship Bench for common mental disorders among WWUM and preliminary indicators of its impact in
improving their mental health and methamphetamine use in a two-arm randomized trial, comparing Friendship
Bench with usual psychiatric care.
The proposed research will support the candidate for this career development award, Dr. Nguyen Thu Trang,
to achieve her long-term career goal to ensure more humane and effective treatment of drug-related issues in
Vietnam and globally. Dr. Trang is a researcher at Hanoi Medical University (HMU), Vietnam. To accomplish
that goal, she will work under mentored guidance to achieve four specific training objectives: (1) to acquire
necessary knowledge in mental health interventions and research, including the identification and management
of common mental disorders and the applicability of the Friendship Bench model; (2) to develop key skills in
conducting research with people who use drugs including theoretically driven, evidence-based systematic
recruitment approaches to hidden populations, community engagement, and the associated concerns related
to research in vulnerable populations; (3) to acquire the skills needed to design and implement randomized
controlled trials for both effectiveness and implementation science research and (4) to develop key skills
needed for a successful research career.
Nguyen Thu Trang is supported by a dedicated mentorship team. Drs. Bradley Gaynes, Professor of
Psychiatry and Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC) and Le Minh Giang,
Professor of Epidemiology and leading researcher in substance use in Vietnam at HMU, will serve as her U.S.-
based and LMIC-based primary mentors. Drs. Vivian Go, Professor of Health Behavior at UNC and William
Miller, Professor of Epidemiology at UNC will provide her with mentorship in implementation science and
randomized controlled trial design and conduct. The research plan has the support of Dr. Ruth Verhey – a co-
developer of the Friendship Bench model and Dr. Byron Powel – a leading expert in implementation strategies.
It also secures support from a community-based organization for women who use drugs in Haiphong who will
be a key partner in the research implementation. The chairman of HMU is committed to provide the candidate
with the resources and protected time necessary for completion of this award."
10976503,"Calprotectin is the most abundant protein in neutrophils. Our surprising discovery that calprotectin can
bind and hydrolyze multiple β-lactam antibiotics forms the basis of this proposal. In particular, calprotectin
hydrolyzes and inactivates the penicillin sub-class that includes ampicillin, amoxicillin and oxacillin, which are
among our most important and most widely used antibiotics. The identification of calprotectin as the first known
host protein with β-lactamase activity has major implications for the treatment of infection. Indeed, our
preliminary data demonstrate that human neutrophils hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics in tissue culture and that
oxacillin treatment is more effective in calprotectin-deficient mice than in wild-type mice.
 In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of calprotectin’s β-lactamase activity on antibiotic efficacy in vivo
through three sub-Aims. We will first assess the ability of calprotectin to hydrolyze β-lactams during E. coli and
S. aureus infection in mice. We will determine how the β-lactamase activity of calprotectin alters antibiotic-
mediated growth inhibition and killing of pathogens during bacteremia and wound infection. We have shown
that the serine β-lactamase inhibitor, sulbactam, blocks the β-lactamase activity of calprotectin. Therefore, we
will next examine the capacity of various approved β-lactamase inhibitors to inhibit the β-lactamase activity of
calprotectin and determine the capacity of inhibitors to improve β-lactam efficacy in mice, against penicillin
sensitive bacteria, lacking any native β-lactamase production. Finally, we will assess whether β-lactam binding
or inhibition of β-lactamase activity of calprotectin affects the innate immune functions of calprotectin, including
metal sequestration and TLR4 activation.
 In Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) of calprotectin’s β-lactamase activity through
two sub-Aims. Our preliminary evidence suggest calprotectin has multiple β-lactam binding sites and binds β-
lactams with a high affinity. We will first fully characterize the β-lactamase activity of calprotectin, including
dependence on parameters such as metal ions, salts, pH, temperature, and multimeric state. We will test
hypotheses concerning reaction mechanism through enzymatic characterization of site-directed mutants. We
will complement kinetic methods by determining the co-crystal structure of calprotectin bound to various
inhibitors of β-lactamase activity.
 The completion of our Specific Aims will comprehensively characterize the newly discovered β-
lactamase activity of calprotectin, determine its contribution to antibiotic efficacy in vivo and identify new
avenues for drug development. Our proposal is significant due to potential impact on multiple aspects of
treatments for bacterial infections. Our proposal is conceptually innovative in establishing a new paradigm for
how calprotectin affects the outcome of bacterial infection."

Some of the most novel insights in aging have come from studies in model organisms like S.
cerevisiae. While a lot has been done about gene (mRNA) expression changes that accompany
aging, not much has been done about short RNA changes that may accompany aging. To
address this, we sequenced the short RNAome in young and old yeast and discovered that
there was a significant induction of a family of short RNAs derived from tRNAs, called tRF-5s or
tiR-5s or tRNA halves, that are created by cleavage of tRNAs in the anticodon loop. In addition,
we discovered a strong induction of extended transcripts spanning the tRNA loci in the aged
yeast compared to the young yeast. In this exploratory project we propose to investigate the
tRNA halves and the extended tRNA transcripts to determine if they contribute to lifespan or to
the proteostasis that is associated with aging. In Aim 1 we will focus on the tiR-5s,
overexpressing or depleting them to study effects on lifespan and proteostasis. We will also
determine how the tRNA halves accumulate with age and whether mutations in yeast that
advance aging advance the accumulation of the tRNA halves. In Aim 2 we will turn to the
extended tRNA transcripts, defining their start and end points, how they accumulate and
whether their overexpression contributes to lifespan changes or aging-associated dysregulation
of proteostasis. These exploratory studies will define whether these short RNAs and/or the
abnormally extended tRNA transcripts contribute to determination of lifespan or to specific
disturbances in proteostasis that accompany aging. A positive result will lead to more in depth
studies exploring the mechanism by which these tRNA based short and long RNAs are
produced and how they contribute to the aging phenotype. This project brings together an
expert on yeast aging (Dr. Jeffrey Smith) and an expert on tRNA fragments (Dr. Anindya Dutta)
to explore what could be a novel mechanism of aging."

There is overwhelming evidence that the immune system plays a significant role in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. However, information about the role of specific immune populations and the
underlying mechanisms is currently lacking. Neutrophils are innate immune cells that function as first-
responders to damage, including damage to neuronal tissue. These cells ultimately determine whether
damaged neurons undergo repair or whether damage is exacerbated. Additional damage can occur directly via
cytotoxicity or indirectly through the recruitment of other immune cell types, the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and the suppression of repair mechanisms. Thus, neutrophils may play a central role in the
response to motor neuron damage in ALS. To support this, our previously published studies show that
neutrophils are increased in the blood of ALS patients, that these cells accumulate in the central nervous
system (CNS) of individuals with ALS, and that increased levels in the peripheral blood are associated with
shortened survival. In addition, preliminary data show that peripheral neutrophils are dysregulated in ALS with
increased expression of trafficking and activation markers. Finally, our predictive models of disease show that
neutrophil levels are the single best predictor of future ALS progression in patients. Therefore, I hypothesize
that neutrophils contribute to ALS pathology by accelerating motor neuron death and by suppressing pro-repair
immune responses in the CNS. To test this, I propose two Specific Aims which will assess the role of
neutrophils in ALS. In the first Aim, I will identify subpopulations of neutrophils or neutrophil-based mechanisms
that are associated with ALS progression and survival. To do this, I will use flow cytometry, single cell RNA-
Seq (scRNA-Seq), and analysis of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants to immunophenotype
neutrophils in the peripheral blood of control and ALS participants. Dysregulated pathways will first be
identified and then associated with ALS progression and survival using our existing biostatistical pipeline. In
the second Aim, I will identify the mechanisms by which neutrophils become activated and more pro-
inflammatory in ALS. To do so, I will culture primary and iPSC-derived neutrophils with and without ALS-
associated proteins such as TDP-43 aggregates. Activation and pro-inflammatory activity will be determined
via flow cytometry and assays for degranulation, reactive oxygen species release, and NET formation. Overall,
completion of these studies will elucidate mechanisms driving neutrophil-mediated damage in ALS and identify
potential therapeutic targets for future studies."

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital cardiovascular (CV) disease characterized by a severe stenosis
of the main artery delivering blood from the heart to the body. CoA affects 5,000 to 8,000 births annually in the
U.S. Unfortunately many CoA patients have morbidity even after successful surgery. Hypertension (HTN) is the
most common form of morbidity, which is worsened by irreversible aortic remodeling and stiffening from
coarctation induced mechanical stimuli. Treatment for CoA is currently based on a peak-to-peak blood
pressure gradient (BPGpp) ≥20 mmHg quantified from invasive catheterization. Unfortunately, there is a lack of
data for the current BPGpp treatment value. Preliminary data applied for the current research shows that a
BPGpp <20 mmHg (i.e. below the current treatment threshold) alone does not avoid HTN, and can produce
coarctation-induced mechanical stimuli resulting in pathologic aortic remodeling with stiffening. We are poised
to propose new lower BPGpp threshold guidance that avoids irreversible aortic remodeling based on recent
data. However, the ultimate link between new thresholds and HTN in CoA patients remains to be further
investigated, which is the objective of the current research. Our central hypothesis is that a personalized
medicine approach developed and implemented in the current project will improve objectivity and diagnostic
tools for treatment of CoA to limit the severity and duration of mechanical consequences thereby reducing
instances of HTN. Aim 1 will provide a rapid path to translation of new BPGpp thresholds by expanding
machine-learning based decision tree methods using predictors governing follow-up HTN status as part of the
largest study of outcomes from CoA patients to date. Aim 2 will use a computational growth and remodeling
(G&R) algorithm to predict irreversible aortic remodeling and HTN in CoA patients. In contrast to the decision
tree analysis from Aim 1 that is robust but does not natively consider mechanisms of aortic remodeling,
prediction of HTN from the G&R algorithm is based on mechanical stimuli as well as patient factors. Aim 3 will
scrutinize the diagnostic performance of a new index called the continuous flow pressure gradient relative to
other indices of coarctation severity assessment in order to arrive at the most accurate means of determining
BPGpp, which is a critical factor in the machine-learning based decision tree and G&R tools to be developed
for clinical use. These aims will provide translational tools that ultimately prevent remodeling linked to HTN
from coarctation-induced mechanical stimuli as part of the largest such study to date. The collective results will
lead to new guidance that avoids unnecessary invasive testing and allows clinicians to intervene before
precursors of HTN. Translating results from the current proposal in these ways is aligned with NHLBI's mission
of prevention and treatment of CV disease, enhancing the health of all individuals so that they can live longer
and more fulfilling lives, and educating the next generation of scientists in the methods applied for this purpose."
11000249,"As with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the pathological hallmark of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) is the 
formation of plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils. It is widely hypothesized that structural variants of 
fibrils, termed polymorphs, contribute to the pathophysiology of CAA and AD. However, there is no clear 
understanding of how their molecular structure induces cytotoxic activity. The objective of this application 
is to employ novel chemical imaging and electrochemical sensing methods to directly monitor the structural 
dynamics, aberrant interactions, and toxic activities of different Aβ fibril polymorphs. The central 
hypothesis is that toxic polymorphs promote cytotoxicity by exhibiting faster growth kinetics, disrupting 
cellular membranes, and inducing higher levels of oxidative stress via reactive oxidative species (ROS) 
generation. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Characterize the molecular 
structures and growth mechanisms of Aβ fibrils using Raman spectroscopy; 2) Employ novel stimulated 
Raman chemical imaging methods to directly visualize the interactions between Aβ fibril polymorphs and 
living cells; and 3) Use electrochemical sensing to directly assess levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
induced by Aβ fibril polymorphs. Under Aims 1 and 2, a novel methodology pioneered by the Punihaole 
group called Raman Chemical Imaging, will be used to directly monitor how different fibril polymorphs grow, 
structurally evolve, and alter the fluidity, integrity, and chemical composition of cellular membranes. In Aim 
3, oxidative stress induced by different fibril polymorphs will be monitored. This will be accomplished using 
fast electrochemical measurements to measure acute and chronic changes in the concentration of ROS 
generated by the cells. Synergistic coupling of these novel methods is innovative since they together 
provide structural and chemical information on time scales required to link molecular-level interactions 
between fibril polymorphs and cellular components with cellular responses, including the production of 
ROS and rapid release of cytotoxic markers. The proposed work is significant because it builds the 
foundation of a broader research program that will produce a holistic understanding of how the molecular 
structure of amyloid fibrils underlies the pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of patients with CAA and 
AD. Ultimately, the insights obtained will guide treatment strategies and the rational design of drugs to 
limit the formation of toxic strains of Aβ fibrils, inhibit their aberrant interactions with cells, mitigate oxidative 
damage, and potentially reverse the loss of cortical tissue and atrophy associated with dementia."

This proposal is responsive to RFA-DA-24-028, “Advancing Psychedelics Research for Treating Addiction (R01
Clinical Trial Not Allowed).” Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a public health crisis in the United States with
few therapeutic options. SUDs are influenced by environmental factors including chronic exposure to
psychological stress, which shares common mechanisms of neural circuit dysfunction with SUDs. For example,
chronic stress disrupts mechanisms within limbic circuits controlling reward behavior, such as the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) of the ventral striatum. Therefore, studying NAc circuitry in chronic stress may uncover new
targets for SUDs. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, have emerged as powerful therapeutics to combat mood
disorders and SUDs by boosting signaling via the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor. Recent work in mice has elucidated
key mechanisms by which psilocybin and other psychedelics act on neurons. However, psychedelics exert
effects on many cell types outside of the nervous system that express the 5-HT2A receptor, including peripheral
immune cells. Yet, a key challenge in deploying psychedelics to control immune responses induced by stress is
many of the immune cell types, networks, and behavioral consequences of their activity remain unknown. In
preliminary studies I identified populations of peripheral immune cells that are recruited to the meninges in
response to chronic psychological stress and respond to the psychedelic psilocybin through 5-HT2AR signaling.
Immune cell-derived cytokines elevated in response to chronic stress decreased the expression of Inhba in NAc
astrocytes, which boosted Activin A signaling in NAc neurons. In vivo genetic perturbation of Inhba in NAc
astrocytes showed Inhba limits stress-induced helplessness behavior by decreasing Activin A production while
Acvr2a perturbation in NAc neurons ameliorated stress-induced helplessness behavior. Psilocybin treatment
ameliorated stress-induced behavioral deficits as well as immune cell recruitment by decreasing immune cell
chemokine receptor and inflammatory cytokine expression, which was independent of corticosterone levels.
Hence, these data suggest that psilocybin decreases pathogenic neuroimmune signals induced by chronic stress
implicated in SUDs. I hypothesize that stress-induced immune cell recruitment triggers loss of Inhba expression
in astrocytes, which boosts NAc neuron Activin A signaling to increase helplessness behavior. I will test this idea
by: Defining the effects of psilocybin on 5-HT2A+ meningeal immune cells during chronic stress using nucleic
acid cytometry (Aim 1); Determining how psilocybin-sensitive immune cells regulate astrocytes through genome-
wide CRISPR screens (Aim 2); and Evaluating psilocybin-dependent 5-HT2A+ immune cell effects on reward
behavior using immune cell genetic perturbations via bone marrow chimeras (Aim 3).
IN SUM, this R01 tests the therapeutic potential of a psilocybin-sensitive neuroimmune circuit in chronic stress
relevant for SUDs."
10978632,"Summary
The vascular system constantly remodels in response to tissue growth or changes in metabolism to efficiently
deliver nutrients and oxygen to tissues. Remodeling encompasses sprouting angiogenesis, arteriogenesis and
expanding vessel diameters. Failure of these mechanisms contributes greatly to coronary artery disease,
peripheral artery disease and cerebral vascular dysfunction. While many genes and signaling proteins in these
processes have been identified, our incomplete understanding of regulatory networks impedes identification of
therapeutic targets and development of new treatments for these conditions. Vascular remodeling is regulated
principally by VEGF secreted by ischemic cells of the target tissues, and fluid shear stress (FSS) from blood
flow that act on vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Our recent work has revealed novel aspects of FSS-
dependent remodeling and interactions between FSS and VEGF that determine these processes. But we
know little about how these pathways interact to determine tissue-level outcomes. The Kholodenko lab has
developed a powerful new method called cell State Transition Assessment and Regulation (cSTAR) for
exploiting `omics' data to develop pathway models that can accurately encompass cell regulation, predict
outcomes, and identify therapeutic targets. Our three labs will work closely together to acquire quantitative
data on interactions within vascular remodeling regulatory networks and develop a quantitative model of
vascular remodeling that will be tested in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 will address the roles of VEGF and FSS in EC
fate decisions during angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Here, we will perturb candidate mediators of FSS and
VEGF signaling and measure effects on signaling and gene expression pathways. cSTAR will then identify
and precisely quantify causal connections in the regulatory network that guides EC phenotypic transitions to
allow purposeful manipulation of EC states and fate decisions, which will then be tested experimentally in vitro.
Aim 2 will utilize a similar strategy to address the effects of low, physiological, high and oscillatory FSS that
determine artery diameter and disease susceptibility. We will first characterize the effects of FSS profiles on
pathway activation, then carry out a perturbation study to determine effects of inhibiting pathways on EC
signaling and gene expression. cSTAR will again develop a causal computational model and generate
predictions that for testing in vitro. Aim 3 will then test predictions in vivo in mice, deleting candidate genes and
observing the impact on vascular remodeling. Together, these studies will develop a novel experimental-
computational approach to elucidate in unprecedented depth the regulatory networks that govern vascular
remodeling and develop insights into these biological processes that identify novel therapeutic targets for
improving vascular insufficiency in coronary, peripheral and cerebral artery disease."
10978633,"The human cornea is a precisely curved transparent structure composed primarily of extracellular
matrix (ECM) that is able to refract light and focus it on the retina. Genetic defects in corneal development
contribute to visual disorders such as myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, as well as more serious diseases
like keratoconus and corneal dystrophy. The power of genetic model organisms has been under-used to
understand corneal disorders because of a dearth of information about potentially appropriate models such
as the Drosophila corneal lens. The corneal lens is entirely made up of apical ECM that is secreted by a small
set of non-neuronal retinal cells. These cone and pigment cells develop from the same pool of progenitor
cells as photoreceptors, and express the same transcription factor, Glass. The process by which cells in the
retina diversify and execute different developmental programs is not well understood. In the first aim of this
proposal, Glass-dependent enhancers specific for cone and pigment cells will be combined with a
photoreceptor-specific enhancer to determine whether cell type-specific gene expression relies on
coactivators or on repressors. These other transcription factors will be identified by extracting their binding
motifs from a genome-wide set of cone and pigment cell Glass-bound enhancers obtained from Targeted
DamID experiments. Altering the normal timing of cone and pigment cell differentiation, which is controlled by
the steroid hormone ecdysone, disrupts corneal lens morphology. Preliminary data suggests that two
ecdysone-regulated transcription factors, Blimp-1 and Eip93F, have opposite effects on the progression of
differentiation. In the second aim, this hypothesis will be tested by looking for temporal changes in gene
expression in the retina in loss of function conditions for either or both genes. In addition, cell type-specific
Omni-ATAC will be used to examine how these transcription factors affect chromatin accessibility on cone
and pigment cell genes. These experiments will reveal how cell differentiation is precisely timed so that
corneal lens components can be deposited in the correct sequence. Finally, a major roadblock to using the
corneal lens as a model is the current lack of knowledge about the nature and organization of these
components. The third aim will begin to address this by building on recent advances in the transcriptomics of
retinal cells and in the biology of other cuticular structures. Components predicted to localize to different
layers of the corneal lens will be labeled with endogenous fluorescent tags and used to characterize the
organization of the corneal lens in wild-type and mutant conditions. In addition, mutations in genes that
encode major corneal lens components will be generated and analyzed to determine their effects on its
structure. These studies will reveal which molecular and structural homologies link the Drosophila corneal
lens and the human cornea, and will therefore provide an informed basis for using the corneal lens to
understand genetic diseases of the cornea and to devise potential treatments for them."

resulting significant health care and financial burdens. Current therapeutic approaches in EoE include dietary
elimination and limiting inflammatory signaling using corticosteroids or biologics; however, there is increasing
recognition of an EoE patient population failing to exhibit clinical and histological remission in response to these
interventions. Disruption of esophageal epithelial tissue architecture and barrier function are hallmarks of EoE
and achieving healing of the esophageal epithelial barrier represents a significant clinical challenge. Our own
published work demonstrates that maintained epithelial remodeling is associated with symptoms in patients with
histologically inactive EoE. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that epithelium of inactive EoE patients fails
to normalize at the cellular and molecular level. Despite the importance of esophageal epithelium in EoE
pathobiology, we lack the comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating esophageal epithelial
homeostasis that is necessary to shape approaches for promoting epithelial healing in EoE. In a recent
publication, we identified a CD73+ progenitor population within the basal zone of esophageal epithelium that is
critical for tissue renewal. We further found that CD73+ basal cells are depleted in human subjects and mice
with EoE inflammation, with the EoE-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 causing a shift from CD73+ to CD73-
basal cells in human 3D organoids. CD73 is a membrane-bound ectoenzyme that catalyzes conversion of
extracellular adenosine monophosphate into the purine nucleoside adenosine. In the current proposal, we
provide robust preliminary data adenosine (1) restores organoid formation, differentiation, and barrier integrity in
esophageal keratinocytes with genetic depletion of CD73; and (2) improves epithelial differentiation in IL-13-
treated organoids and a mouse model of EoE. Based upon our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize
that esophageal homeostasis is mediated by CD73+ epithelial cells and dysregulated purinergic signaling
contributes to EoE pathobiology, including epithelial remodeling. We will test this hypothesis by: defining the
direct requirement of squamous epithelial CD73 in esophageal homeostasis and response to EoE (Aim 1);
identifying the molecular mechanisms through which adenosine signaling supports esophageal epithelial
homeostasis (Aim 2); and delineating how levels of CD73 and CD73-associated purines relate to clinical features
of EoE patients (Aim 3). This proposal will illuminate the functional and mechanistic roles of CD73 and purinergic
signaling in esophageal homeostasis. The proposed studies will also assess the therapeutic utility of restoring
purinergic signaling in EoE models and the clinical significance of alterations in CD73 and purines in EoE
patients, which may have implications for EoE therapy and clinical management."

ligands activating ~100 GPCRs are still unknown, hence they are named orphan GPCRs. Considering their
understudied biology and established physiological roles, orphan GPCRs represent unexploited
pharmacological targets. The quest for endogenous and synthetic compounds modulating their activity is
significant for both understanding their biology and developing novel therapeutics. Using an innovative cell-
based assay, we recently established Gi/o/z coupling for several orphan GPCRs. Building on this discovery, we
optimized a platform to screen candidate ligands based on the heterologous co-expression of orphan GPCRs
and a multicomponent activity biosensor. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify pharmacological
modulators, endogenous ligands, and binding partners for GPR156, a clinically relevant target for the treatment
of hearing and balance disorders with unexplored roles in the central nervous system. Our preliminary data
support the feasibility of the approach and also establish the presence of endogenous ligands in the brain.
Thus, the identification of these endogenous ligands will constitute an additional goal of our proposal that we
will pursue applying innovative proximity-mediated labeling technologies. Activity of identified ligands and
function of interacting proteins identified by proteomics analysis will be validated in a physiologically relevant
system. In fact, GPR156 controls hair cell orientation in auditory and balance organs, with GPR156 gene
mutations leading to deafness and balance disorders in patients. Finally, combining proteomics analysis and
mouse genetics, we will define components of GPR156 signaling complex and determine their role in
establishing planar cell polarity in the mouse inner ear."

diagnosis and treatment. Targeted therapies can increase therapeutic effectiveness while limiting side effects.
Since the publication of the NETTER1 trial results (1,2), the use of 177Lu-DOTATATE to treat neuroendocrine
tumor (NET) patients has increased significantly. The protocol for the trail was four 200 mCi administered
treatments at 8-week intervals. This protocol received FDA approval in the United States and has become the
standard of care (SOC) for most sites throughout the world. On the other hand, there is a large group of
physicians and scientists that believe 177Lu-DOTATATE treatments should be personalized for each patient.
177Lu emits electrons for therapy, but it also emits gammas that can be used for imaging. Therefore, it is possible
to quantitate dose to a person’s organs at risk (OAR) and tumors using imaging techniques, such as SPECT/CT.
Assessing OAR dosimetry after each treatment allows for personalization of 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy.
Retrospective studies have demonstrated significant lengthening of progression free survival (33 vs. 15 mos)
and overall survival (54 vs. 25 mos) when patients were able to continue treatments up to 23 Gy delivered dose
to their kidneys (4). In addition to OAR dosimetry, there is growing interest in personalizing therapies based upon
tumor biology. Thus, the goal of this work is to develop and validate a cost effective, patient friendly technology
that will enable personalization of 177Lu-DOTATATE using daily measurements of the radioactivity in the patient’s
OAR and tumors without requiring serial visits to an imaging center. The Personalized Remote Radiation
Tracking Portable Organ Dosimetry Device, PRRT PODD or PODD for short, is a patient-friendly radiation
measuring device that the patient can use in their homes. The primary OAR is the patient’s kidney; however, the
PODD will also provide data for accurate dose estimation of other OAR and physician selected tumors, thus
enabling treatment personalization based upon maximum tolerated dose to OAR, cumulative tumor dose,
therapeutic ratio (i.e., ratio of tumor dose to dose to OAR), or other dosimetry-based metrics. Our project consists
of four specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and characterize compact imaging detectors and associated software
tools for use with the PODD; 2) Use realistic, digital NET patient phantoms and simulation tools to optimize
PODD design for both OAR and tumor dosimetry; 3) In clinic patient studies to validate quantitative organ and
tumor measurement capabilities of PODD; and 4) Conduct a patient study including at home measurements
comparing OAR and tumor dosimetry estimates using PODD to serial SPECT/CT imaging. At the conclusion of
this project, we will have validated our PRRT PODD technology on a 36-patient cohort and the technology will
be ready to support clinical trials to study the benefits to patients of personalized 177Lu-DOTATATE therapies,
where personalization can be based on dose to patients’ OAR or tumors and on tumor biology."

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic condition characterized by cognitive impairment, atypical beliefs, and reduced
reward/goal pursuit, which contribute to ongoing functional impairment even when other active phase
symptoms subside. Symptom severity has been associated with poor decision-making with respect to integrating
information about potential rewards and associated uncertainty, often manifesting as maladaptive unwillingness
to tolerate the risk of failure. This risk-aversion limits opportunities to gain new or additional rewards or
resources (i.e., nothing ventured, nothing gained). How an individual attends to and accrues information
critically impacts subsequent decisions. While research has identified neural circuits implicated in impaired
decision-making during choice in SZ, less is known about the processes by which information is attended to and
accrued from the environment and integrated before a choice is made. This project will identify how decision-
making in SZ is impacted by attentional, behavioral, and cognitive processes preceding decision choice, and
whether associated neural signals predict daily, real-world decisions. Isolating these antecedents of impaired
decision-making allows for the implementation of ameliorative interventions, empowering those with SZ to make
choices that could reduce the burden of illness.
 First, leveraging concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye-tracking, the project will
characterize attentional processes underlying evidence integration prior to decision choice. It will determine if
SZ is associated with visual attentional biases toward aversive, and away from potentially rewarding, stimuli, and
whether these biases underlie differences in associated brain activation in regions such as the nucleus accumbens
(NAcc), insula, and anterior cingulate. Second, during fMRI it will test whether implementing cognitive strategies
prior to decision-making upregulate reward-related brain activation and ameliorate disadvantageous choice in
SZ. During upregulation via cognitive strategies, those with SZ are hypothesized to improve decision-making
while increasing connectivity between NAcc and prefrontal regions, and during decision-making they are
predicted to exhibit increased NAcc activation underserving adaptive reward pursuit. Such a result would suggest
the feasibility of teaching these strategies as a clinical intervention for excessive risk aversion. Third, real-world
daily behavior will be assessed using experience sampling methods to ascertain how daily decisions are impacted
by perceived risks and symptom expression. Those with negative symptoms are predicted to endorse greater
perceived risk of failure before potential activity engagement and those with positive symptoms are predicted to
have less perceived risk of failure, despite impaired engagement. Finally, combined data will establish whether
brain activation and task behavior predict real-world decisions to pursue rewards despite potential risk of failure.
The project will establish the foundation for a novel interventional program of research into improving decision-
making in SZ by elucidating distinct targets of behavioral and neuromodulatory intervention."

Chronic hyperglycemia has been linked to systemic inflammation, which may underlie several comorbidities, and
infection is a significant concern for persons with diabetes. Based on our published and preliminary data, the scientific
premise of this proposal is rooted in the finding that hyperglycemia-enhanced low-grade inflammation prompts phagocytes
to hyper-respond to pathogens, amplifying the severity of unchecked inflammatory responses, the risk of multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality from sepsis in persons with diabetes. Also, the lack of understanding of the
pathogenesis of systemic infection during diabetes poses a major barrier to developing effective treatments. We and others
have shown that the lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a critical component of the inflammatory response. However,
we have also shown that excessive amounts of this bioactive lipid enhance systemic inflammation and promote
susceptibility to infection in diabetic animals. However, 1) we did not determine the mechanisms involved in aberrant
LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1; the high-affinity receptor for LTB4) activation in diabetic animals; 2) we did not assess whether
preventing BLT1 actions after sepsis had protective effects during sepsis and diabetes. Here, we aim to determine how
epigenetic alterations caused by high glucose exposure accelerate the transcription of genes involved in LTB4/BLT1
actions that render diabetic mice more vulnerable to systemic infections. This proposal is based on the surprising
preliminary data showing that peritoneal macrophages from diabetic mice exhibit high basal histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) activity and increased acetylation of H3 histone, favoring gene transcription. HAT inhibition decreases exaggerated
Ltb4r1 mRNA expression in diabetic animals. We also discovered that treating diabetic mice with a BLT1 antagonist 6 h
after i.v. infection increased survival and decreased bacterial load in diabetic mice. Notably, the relevance of our findings
is underscored by our preliminary observation that LTB4 levels and BLT1 expression are higher in people with diabetes
and sepsis than in individuals with sepsis and nondiabetes. These data led to our hypothesis that hyperglycemia primes
HAT activation to promote sustained and amplified BLT1 activation, leading to an intense but ineffectual inflammatory
response to systemic infection, resulting in severe MODS and enhanced death rates. We propose two Specific Aims,
which will use innovative approaches to test our hypothesis, including cutting-edge murine systems, testing newly
generated concepts (metabolic memory) in the pathogenesis of sepsis, and new potential treatment protocols that might
help translate our findings to the bedside. Aim 1 will determine whether hyperglycemia promotes metabolic memory to
sustain aberrant BLT1 activation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the threshold of BLT1 activation dictates the severity
of the infection and MODS in humans and mice with diabetes. Understanding how altered metabolism intersects with
epigenetic modifications in inflammation and sepsis could lead to the development of therapeutics to reduce chronic low-
grade inflammation in diabetes that will improve the outcome of systemic infections associated with this disease."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing brain disorder that accounts for 5% of deaths globally. There
is an urgent need to test interventions that reduce withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and delirium and improve
brain health. Recent observations on brain energetics suggest that a shift from brain glucose to acetate
metabolism occurs in individuals with AUD that persists beyond the acute intoxication state. That is, individuals
with AUD show poor brain glucose utilization and enhanced levels of brain acetate, a metabolite of alcohol.
During alcohol detoxification, brain acetate levels decrease in the absence of alcohol, leading to an energy-
deficit state that may contribute to neurotoxicity and withdrawal severity in AUD. Ketone bodies (β-
hydroxybutyrate [BHB]), acetoacetate, and acetone) are structurally similar to acetate and provide an alternative
to glucose as an energy source in the brain. We recently found that a Ketogenic Diet intervention reduced the
need for benzodiazepine medications to treat alcohol withdrawal and elevated brain utilization of ketone bodies
in AUD inpatients. Because a Ketogenic Diet is rigid and difficult to maintain, we started evaluating a BHB ketone
supplement drink (KS) in humans, which reduced alcohol withdrawal in rodent models of alcohol dependence.
Thus, KS supplementation appears to be sufficient to reduce withdrawal symptoms without requiring a special
dietary regimen. Here we propose to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ketone supplementation during the alcohol
withdrawal state and its effect on improving brain ketone, and GABA metabolism in patients with AUD during
inpatient detoxification. The proposed study aims to determine: (1) the extent to which KS reduces the need for
benzodiazepine treatment and alleviates withdrawal symptoms in AUD inpatients during alcohol detoxification,
and (2) the effects of KS on brain ketone and GABA metabolism in individuals with AUD measured with high-
field strength proton magnetic spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging. To this end, we propose to randomize AUD
inpatients to receive a KS supplement or a taste-matched Placebo by mouth three times daily during a 4-day
alcohol detoxification treatment. Withdrawal signs and symptoms will be monitored every four hours using the
Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar), and benzodiazepines will be prescribed by
a clinician for a CIWA-Ar score ≥8. After the 4-day intervention, participants in the KS and Placebo groups will
complete a 1H-MRS scan at 7 Tesla to measure brain ketone and GABA metabolism. We hypothesize that KS
will reduce the need for benzodiazepine medication and alcohol withdrawal symptoms during alcohol
detoxification and improve ketone, GABA and glutamate metabolism compared to Placebo, as evidenced by
higher brain ketone, GABA, and glutamate levels. Documenting the beneficial clinical effects of KS in humans
with AUD (e.g., reducing withdrawal and improving brain metabolism) would be promising for the development
of new ketone-based interventions during alcohol treatment to enhance success in recovery from AUD and to
elucidate brain metabolism in the context of AUD."

Chronic alcohol use has long-lasting detrimental effects on human cognition and behavior that result from
changes in brain function. Here we examine changes in corticostriatal circuit function after a 4-week
chronic alcohol exposure via alcohol vapor using high-density neural recording (Neuropixels) and
optogenetics within rodent models of decision making. In Aim 1 we characterize neural activity changes
within the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsomedial striatum as rats exposed to
chronic alcohol perform a two-choice probabilistic reversal learning task in which we have previously seen
alcohol-induced performance deficits. In Aim 2 we use optogenetic manipulations to probe the role of
cingulate cortex-to-dorsomedial striatal and orbitofrontal cortex-to-dorsomedial striatal projections in this
behavior in rats exposed to chronic alcohol. In Aim 3, we extend our corticostriatal recording approach to
alcohol self-administration to determine if neural activity related to this behavior is altered by prior chronic
alcohol exposure via alcohol vapor. Together these studies will provide new information on the impact of
chronic alcohol on the activity of large populations of neurons within corticostriatal circuitry that is critical
for executive function and cognitive control."

In November 2023, New York City (NYC), NY became the first jurisdiction in the US to adopt an added sugar
warning policy, which requires restaurants to display a warning label on menus next to items high in added
sugar. The adoption of this policy has the potential to reduce the burden of nutrition-related chronic diseases,
including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. However, almost no real-world studies have examined
whether added sugar warning labels affect purchases of restaurant foods. Moreover, no real-world studies
have examined for whom these warning effects are largest. Also unknown are the psychological mechanisms
that could explain how added sugar warning labels change behavior. The Warning Impact Model has
established that cigarette and beverage warnings change behavior by changing thoughts, feelings, and beliefs,
but has never been applied to added sugar warnings. We will determine whether, for whom, and how added
sugar warnings affect restaurant purchases. All Aims will use a rigorous quasi-experimental design (difference-
in-differences) that assesses changes in purchases in NYC from before to after the warnings are implemented,
net of changes in comparison sites without warnings over the same period. We will combine two
complementary data sources. First, we will partner with MFour, an innovative mobile phone app with whom we
have completed a rigorous pilot test. Using MFour’s ability to send location-based surveys to a panel of
participants, we will prospectively collect receipts from customers exiting chain restaurants in NYC and
matched comparison sites. We will collect 4 repeated cross-sections of data (2 before and 2 after warnings are
implemented, total n=10,000 customers). We will also collect information on customers’ demographic
characteristics and their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about added sugar. Second, we will obtain a dataset of
every purchase made at Taco Bell restaurants nationwide (including >3 million transactions per year in NYC
alone) from 2023-2028. We will use these data to examine whether added sugar warnings reduce total sugar
purchased from chain restaurants (Aims 1.1 and 1.2) and to determine whether this effect differs for customers
with lower education, lower income, or Black or Hispanic identities (Aim 2). We will also use these data to
determine whether added sugar warnings lead to more negative thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about added
sugar (Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that added sugar warning labels will reduce total sugar purchased
from restaurants in NYC relative to comparison sites, with larger reductions among customers with lower
education, lower income, and Black or Hispanic identities. Completion of these Aims could lay the groundwork
for the adoption of added sugar warning labels across the US to reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other
nutrition-related diseases."
